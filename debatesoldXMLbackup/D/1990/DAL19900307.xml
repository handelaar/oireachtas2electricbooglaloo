    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (c), line 11, before &ldquo;a crossbow&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a longbow or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very simple and straightforward proposal asking the Minister to consider extending the definition of firearms beyond that of a crossbow and to include the concept of the longbow as an addition.  This matter was raised on Second Stage and, if my memory serves me correctly, it was also referred to &mdash; though not by specific amendment &mdash; in the Seanad.  We should be as comprehensive and careful as possible in drafting the legislation.  In this amendment we are trying to address the problem of a person who would be disposed to using a crossbow in irregular or illegal circumstances being thwarted by this Bill and simply turning to another form of weapon.  Obviously someone with the expertise to use a crossbow for irregular or illegal purposes would be well capable of using the longbow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister agrees with the point raised on Second Stage and covered under amendment No. 2, that we should have no poundage draw weight restriction on the definition of a crossbow, a point that might have troubled the Minister on Second Stage and in the Seanad, and that it was the intention to allow a crossbow below a certain poundage because of the view among those who knew a lot about these weapons that a projectile fired from a crossbow below that poundage would not represent a serious threat and would facilitate the sporting usage of these weapons. If I understand the Minister's amendment correctly we are taking that out today so the argument does not stand. What is left as a matter of difference between a crossbow and a longbow?  I recall the Minister's representative in the Seanad making the point that a crossbow <Col N="1737" /> can be cocked and ready to discharge at any time but I do not think that makes a substantial difference between the basic nature of either weapon.  For those reasons, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a commonsense amendment.  All parties welcome this legislation to deal particularly with the crossbow but I do not see how we can outlaw a crossbow except under licence and yet have the longbow readily available. There is no need to enter into any great discussions about this amendment but people in society who are in the habit of using the crossbow for whatever purposes other than sporting will, to comply with this legislation, opt for the use of the longbow.</P>
      <P>There is no reason for not including the longbow in the legislation because it is an equally vicious and dangerous implement as the crossbow.  Perhaps we are allowing people who would resort to these bows a loophole under the legislation if we do not include the longbow. Apart from the sport of archery I cannot see why a crossbow can be issued under licence.  The Minister may be in agreement with that statement and I should like him to refer specifically to the lawful uses that he sees for the longbow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond as positively as I can to the debate as it progresses and I have tabled a number of amendments.  I also want to take a commonsense approach, the phrase used by Deputy Flanagan.  From the point of view of public order and safety, the longbow does not present the same problems or concerns as the crossbow.  What makes the crossbow a potential danger is that, in the wrong hands, it can be used to devastating effect without the need for a great deal of practice.  It can be carried, for example, in a cocked position, ready to fire by a simple squeeze of the trigger like a gun.  It is smaller and less cumbersome than the longbow and can even be fitted with a type of telescopic sight normally found on rifles.  On the other hand, considerable skills are required to <Col N="1738" /> use the longbow.  It is cumbersome and would be very ineffective for use in committing crime.  In the absence of any evidence that the longbow has been misused or is likely to be misused for criminal purposes, it would be wrong to bring it within the ambit of the firearms Bill, as the Deputies suggest in their amendments.</P>
      <P>I will, of course, keep the situation under review.  If at some future time evidence should emerge of criminal misuse of the longbow &mdash; there is no such evidence at this stage &mdash; I would certainly consider what the Deputies have suggested. We want to keep as much common sense as possible in the approach to this matter.  With the cumbersome nature of the longbow and the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever of its use, I do not intend to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have listened very carefully to the Minister's argument.  He has been open enough to say he will take on board the points raised by my colleagues and will consider them for the future.  I suggest that that is a typical waiting until the horse has bolted approach.  That should not be the manner in which the Minister approaches this problem.  Serious concerns have been expressed by my colleagues in relation to the longbow.  We are all agreed that the crossbow should come within the terms of the Bill.  If we are to address the problem in a common sense fashion I do not think it would be sufficient to say one would need skill to use the longbow effectively.  I am sure when crossbows are outlawed it would not take too long for those who may be interested in this type of weaponry to acquire the necessary skills to use the longbow in its place.  The fact that the longbow may be somewhat more cumbersome is no justification for refusing to bring it within the ambit of the Bill.  Anybody who has followed its history will know the lethal effectiveness of the longbow.  The skill of the British archers and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As far as I know, even in our children's story books the weaponery used by Robin Hood and his Merry Men fell into the same category. From all we have read in history and mythology, the effectiveness of the longbow is beyond dispute.  It seems the Minister may be closing one door while opening another by leaving this loophole. I do not want to prolong this matter unduly, and neither do I want to engage in any bow and arrow warfare with the Minister, but it seems to be ill-advised to leave this loophole in the Bill, a loophole that will become more glaringly obvious with the bringing of the crossbow within the ambit of the Bill.  Those people who are interested in this kind of weaponry will almost automatically turn to the longbow. I urge the Minister to close the loophole at this stage by accepting this simple amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unfair of Deputy O'Keeffe to question the Minister's open approach to this legislation. I have had a brief glance through the list of amendments.  The Minister is attempting, in the amendments he is introducing, to respond to a number of good points that were made on Second Stage, and I thank him for that.  It reflects his honesty and his genuine desire to meet reasonable points that have been raised.  I can see some validity in Deputy O'Keeffe's and Deputy Flanagan's arguments concerning the longbow but we must bear in mind what we are dealing with here.  We are dealing with a situation where certain categories of weapons, in addition to firearms as they are commonly understood, will require a licence before a person can purchase them.  We cannot extend the question of licensing indefinitely. I am sure the people who are in control of licensing, namely, the Garda, will not thank us for bringing every conceivable type of weapon within the ambit of the licensing requirements.  There <Col N="1740" /> must be some limit to this if only from the point of view of administrative efficiency and what people are capable of doing administratively.</P>
      <P>My experience has been that the crossbow has certainly been used as a weapon with which to perpetrate crime.  The Minister recognised that when he specifically included crossbows within the licensing requirements.  There is no great evidence as yet &mdash; certainly not from my experience &mdash; that longbows have been used in criminal activities.  I do not know if there are any specific examples to which Deputies can point, but I am certainly not aware of any usage of longbows for the perpetration of crime.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is fair or reasonable to suggest that the Minister is in some way leaving a deliberate loophole in the law. The Minister wants to deal with problems that have arisen since the firearms legislation was first introduced and that is why the Bill is before the House today.  There is no deliberate intention to leave a loophole in the law on the Minister's part and I do not think any reasonable Minister would suggest that.  It would not be worth his while bringing in legislation to outlaw certain types of weapons and at the same time deliberately leave a loophole where other weapons could be substituted in the commission of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a problem arises I would be prepared to accept the Minister's bona fides that legislation would be immediately introduced to deal with it.  It is not a complicated matter.  If there is evidence that the longbow is replacing the crossbow as an instrument of crime, I am sure the Minister will being in a single section Bill &mdash; it would entail only a simple amendment &mdash; to include longbows under section 4 of the firearms Bill of 1989.  It is not a big deal and it would not be difficult to do.  It could be done in a matter of minutes any day if a problem arises.  In the meantime we cannot include an endless list of weapons because that would make the implementation of the legislation administratively impossible.  As I said, if there is no evidence of any problem in relation to longbows at present. However, there is a possibility that this <Col N="1741" /> might become a commonly used weapon in the commission of crime and if that happens I would accept the Minister's bona fides.  As I have said, it would not be very difficult to bring in a single section Bill to deal with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy O'Dea said.  Nobody is saying the Minister is trying to deliberately leave a loophole in legislation but surely the Minister sees himself as having a role in the prevention as well as in the curbing of crime.  Clearly there is an argument in favour of saying that people who up to now resorted to the crossbow for their unlawful uses will now move into the area of the longbow.  I fail to see why, simply because there is no great evidence of longbows being used at present, these fairly vicious weapons cannot be included under the legislation. Is there a problem about the definition of longbows?  The Minister has not referred to that but if there is such a problem, we might think seriously about the difficulties that would arise so far as enforcing the legislation is concerned.  I do not see a definition difficulty.  I think everybody, including the Garda Síochána, knows what a longbow is and there is no identification difficulty.  I ask the Minister the question I asked him ten minutes ago.  What use does he see for the longbow other than for sporting purposes? In the section we are talking about the issuing of a firearms certificate to cover crossbows in certain circumstances. If we do not wish to outlaw the longbow, if we see a use for it be it sporting or otherwise, then surely a firearms certificate can be granted, as in the case of the crossbow.  However, nobody has come forward with any reason a person should be using a longbow other than for sporting purposes and until I get that answer I will not be satisfied.  I do not see any reason the longbow cannot be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  I accept that he is endeavouring to find a balance.  I do not wish to go overboard entirely on the <Col N="1742" /> issue but the amendment deserves some further consideration.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the most recent directive from the EC on the control or acquisition and possession of weapons. The document, dated 8 November 1989, is No. 446 Final &mdash; SYN98.  It contains a proposal to update the regulations of the Commission.  It endeavours to deal with the problem of those who want to move from country to country with weapons.  Under Annex 1 the Commission bring in for the first time any bow or crossbow.  Has the Minister given consideration to that directive in the light of the Bill that is before us?  Does he consider it prudent that we should keep our domestic legislation in line with what is happening in the EC?  The EC up to this, if I am interpreting the explanatory note covering the directive correctly, have specifically not included bow or crossbows.  It would appear that there is a view in Europe that those weapons should be subject to control.</P>
      <P>The directive lays down different regimes to cover people who are buying for the purpose of the possession of firearms and those who have firearms for sporting use.  The Commission are unashamed about this and say that weapons for the purpose of the directive should include the longbow.  Has the Minister had regard to those trends emerging in Europe?  Does he consider it necessary to keep our legislation in line with what is happening in Europe?  If the Minister says he would wish to consider the matter between now and Report Stage I have no difficulty agreeing to the amendment being withdrawn until then.  However, I am concerned that we are a little out of step with what is happening elsewhere.</P>

I should like to assure Deputy O'Dea that I will keep this matter under review and if at some future time evidence emerges of criminal misuse of the longbow I will consider introducing a simple Bill to extend the scope of the section to cover them.  I am anxious to take a common <Col N="1743" /> sense approach to the Bill.  I should like to assure Deputy Flanagan that crime prevention is top of my agenda and that is why the Bill is before the House.  It is a preventive measure and will assist the gardaí in their fight against crime. However, there are hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of responsible people who are members of archery clubs here and who use longbows.  I do not want to put them to considerable cost and trouble when there is no evidence of trouble with longbows.  I should like to tell Deputy McCartan that the EC directive leaves the question of legislation to the discretion of the national governments.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment for practical reasons.  If I was convinced that there was a difficulty I would be pleased to accept it but there is no evidence of the longbow being used in crime.  In the absence of that evidence I do not wish to include in the Bill a provision that may become cumbersome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was being drafted it was decided that toy crossbows, that is those with a drawn weight of less than 1.4 Kg., should be excluded from the controls <Col N="1744" /> which were being introduced for crossbows generally and this is why the exemption was included in the Bill, However, I have been advised that the reference to a specific draw weight in the section would require the gardaí to prove in every case that a crossbow had a draw weight of at least in excess of 1.4 Kg. in order to secure a conviction against a person for having a crossbow without a firearm certificate. I believe this would impose an unnecessary additional burden on the gardaí and for that reason I am satisfied that the exemption for toy crossbows should be removed.  I might also mention that there appears to be no need to make special provisions for toy crossbows since they are not readily available in this country.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 12 and 13, to delete paragraph (d) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d)  any type of stun gun or other weapon for causing any shock or other disablement to a person by means of electricity or any other kind of energy emission;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the definition of &ldquo;stun gun&rdquo; in the Bill to weapons other than those which inflict an electric shock.  This is being done to deal with a point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe on Second Stage when he said that the existing definition of stun gun might not be adequate in view of the possibility that new weapons could be developed which could stun a person by some other means.  I share the Deputy's concern in this matter and I am grateful to him for raising it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> My amendment is designed to ensure that any stun gun or similar type weapon will be brought within the definition of firearm in the Bill and will thus be subject to all the controls which operate in respect of firearms under the firearms Acts.  Deputies will note that the new wording I am proposing would cover not only stun guns but also any device which could be used to cause shock or disablement to a person by means of electricity or any other kind of energy emission.  I am advised that the words &ldquo;energy emission&rdquo; are wide enough to encompass any possible way in which a person could be stunned and I am satisfied that the amendment is fully adequate to deal with any future technological developments which could produce a stun device capable of being used against a person.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is an amendment in the names of Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan which has been put down to achieve exactly the same result as my amendment.  I appreciate the fact that the Deputies have taken the trouble to produce their own amendment on this point but, on reflection, I believe that the wording I have proposed is to be preferred since it is more comprehensive than that used in the other amendment. Accordingly, I would ask the Deputies concerned to withdraw their amendment and to accept what I propose.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the reaction of the Minister to the point I raised on Second Stage.  My attention was directed to this problem by a case in the UK where a pair of binoculars, which were fitted with a type of laser beam, were used, according to the evidence in court, to nobble a horse.  It seemed to me that such type of weapon did not come within the original definition in the Bill. The Minister has accepted the point in principle and I appreciate that.  In examining his amendment as opposed to mine it appears that the Parliamentary Draftsman has an advantage.  The amendment proposed by the Minister probably covers the situation much better than the <Col N="1746" /> amendment in the names of Deputy Flanagan and myself.  In that case I am prepared to agree to the withdrawal of our amendment and the substitution in the Bill of the Minister's amendment covering the same point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  any article which would be a firearm under any of the foregoing paragraphs but for the fact that, owing to the lack of a necessary component part or parts, or to any other defect or condition, it is incapable of discharging a shot, bullet or other missile or of causing a shock or other disablement (as the case may be);&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of these amendments is to ensure that a defective firearm will be caught by the definition of `firearm' and thus be subject to the controls which are imposed by the Firearms Acts. It is not clear whether a firearm which is not capable of discharging a bullet or shot comes within the scope of existing firearms legislation and these amendments are being introduced to put the matter beyond doubt.  This is a matter which was raised by Deputy O'Dea at Second Stage and I am sure that all Deputies would agree that the amendments are worthwhile as it would be completely ridiculous if a person could get around the very strict firearm controls merely by removing a firing pin or making some minor adjustment to a firearm.  I thank Deputy O'Dea for his comments on Second Stage and for bringing it to our notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 provides for the <Col N="1747" /> insertion into the definition of firearm in section 4 of a new paragraph which provides that notwithstanding that a firearm cannot discharge a bullet etc. it will be treated as a fully operational weapon for the purposes of our firearms legislation.  The provision itself is quite clear and does not, I believe, require any further elaboration.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 will allow a Garda superintendent to grant an authorisation to a person to keep a firearm as a souvenir or curio without the need for a cartificate where the firearm has been rendered incapable of discharging.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides that a superintendent may issue an authorisation to a person to hold a defective firearm where the superintendent is satisfied that the person has a good reason for having it and could do so without endangering the public safety.  The type of case to which this provision would apply would be one where a person had inherited a gun which had been used by a relative.  It could also be availed of by museums.  Subsection (2) allows a superintendent to attach conditions to the granting of an authorisation. It also allows him to revoke an authorisation when he considers it necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the proposal to include defective weaponry, I fully agree that this is a positive proposal and I compliment Deputy O'Dea who originally raised the point.  It certainly improves the legislation.  When I first read the amendment I wondered whether it would cover another aspect which gave me cause for concern and which I raised on Second Stage: that is the question of imitation and replica firearms.  As the Minister is very well aware, imitation and replica guns are regularly used in robberies. We have only to recall the recent <i>cause célébre</i> in Belfast at a bookmaker's office of the killing of three people who were apparently using replica guns.  I wonder if there is any way in which the Minister could devise an amendment which would proscribe replica weapons so as to ensure that replica or imitation <Col N="1748" /> firearms are not available to criminals. This problem is very serious.  I accept there is considerable difficulty in framing an amendment to cover the point.  I have given some thought to it and the question that arises is where one draws the line between imitation and replica weapons and toy guns, some of which can look very realistic in their presentation.  I raised this point on Second Stage.  I would again ask the Minister to seek the advice and assistance of his officials and of the parliamentary draftsman on this issue.  It would be a great advance if we could make some progress to outlaw replica and imitation firearms.  If the Minister is not able to come up with an amendment on that point I want to give notice that I will attempt to produce an amendment on Report Stage to deal with it.  I ask the Minister to direct his energies and efforts to seeking and finding a solution to that issue.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposals to provide for authorisation to hold defective firearms without a firearms certificate, has the Minister thought through this amendment? I appreciate the situation in relation to museums &mdash; old antique weapons, curios and so on &mdash; but my understanding is that that is covered already.  I am not sure that it is wise to leave defective firearms around the place.  I was in that situation at one stage where in my own legal office I found a firearm which dated back to the so-called troubled times.  Having discussed the matter with the local sergeant he indicated that the option was open to me to have the weapon rendered ineffective and that I could then retain it.  This happened some years ago but apparently that is still the situation.  Having considered the matter at the time I realised that that weapon could have fallen into wrong hands and could have been used for criminal or even possibly subversive purposes. I handed in the weapon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recalling that experience and applying the lessons of that incident to the general position, is it wise that we should have pistols and revolvers and so on, even if they have some historic or sentimental value, lying around the place, bearing in <Col N="1749" /> mind the frequent use of weaponry in robberies where the actual weaponry may not be fully effective?  My concern about the increase in armed crime and the use of weapons in robberies in this country stems from the fact that in the last crime report there were 672 cases of robbery and aggravated burglary in which firearms were used.  We are talking about two such crimes per day.  Is it wise that we should have a situation where defective firearms can be retained and may fall into wrong hands?  Would it be wiser to have these weapons handed into the Garda Síochána except where we are guaranteed that they are in secure hands, in a museum or some such place?  I raise that point for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This very point is one which also concerns me.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on it.  When this Bill was being debated in the Seanad the Minister took the view that imitation firearms would be covered under the current definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; in the Firearms Acts and if a person used an imitation firearm for the purpose of an offence the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; would cover the imitation firearm in those circumstances. However, I do not think that addresses fully the problem we are dealing with here.  We are trying to introduce a positive code for dealing with weapons right across the board in a comprehensive single Act.  We have addressed the problem of imitation weapons to some degree but the question now is whether we should require them to be licensed or held under certain authorities.  This question has be be addressed seriously.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment, as drafted, seems to address the question of defective firearms.  I accept that the amendment states &ldquo;... or to any other defect or condition ...&rdquo; but the overall interpretation of the section is that it deals exclusively with defects.  That is the general principle of interpretation which is described as an <i>ejusdem generis</i> principle when what will be looked at is what the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; represents.  I believe it will be linked to the word &ldquo;defect&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 refers to defective <Col N="1750" /> firearms.  It does not refer to defective, replica or imitation firearms.  It deals entirely with defective weapons.  Deputy O'Dea raised a very valid point and quoted case authority for the matter but we have to address the question of replica weapons and whether it is desirable to have them licensed or controlled in any way.</P>
    <P>The lifelike reproduction of weapons is startling.  It is incredible to see pictures of young children in strife-torn cities such as Belfast running around with what only can be described as lifelike imitations of the weapons used by paramilitaries and other armed personnel.  It is remarkable to think that this can happen.  It is even more remarkable when, as has been pointed out, this can lead to a loss of life, as happened to the three robbers when they were coming out of the bookmaker's shop.  I do not condone what they did but it helps to illustrate the point that the possession of these weapons can be used to a remarkable extent and can lead to the inevitable loss of life.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address the problem of the proliferation of replica weapons in particular.  I do not think we can ever ultimately deal with the problem of imitation weapons in the context of this legislation.  In a recent case in Britain a man who was arrested after committing numerous offences was found to have been carrying a cucumber and not a firearm in his pocket.  The press report showed a very vivid picture taken by the surveillance video of him standing at the counter and for all practical purposes he seemed to have a firearm in his pocket but when he was arrested it turned out to be a cucumber.</P>
    <P>We need to deal with the almost exact reproduction of weapons which can be sold.  I believe many people collect these weapons as a hobby.  They can have very serious consequences in the hands of the wrong people and we should be working towards controlling their use, not just in the area of offences but in the wider context also.  I do not like to see guns in any shape or form being used by people on our streets.  People may say we have to draw the line between a toy and a <Col N="1751" /> replica weapon but if we are to err in this area we should err against rather than allow the present situation to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy McCartan for their kind remarks.  However, I did not understand Deputy McCartan's initial point.  He said the Minister had said on Second Stage that imitation firearms were included within the definition.  I may have misunderstood what Deputy McCartan said but I understood the Minister to say that if somebody attempts to commit a crime using an imitation firearm there are sufficient laws to deal with this.  I agree with Deputy McCartan's interpretation of the word &ldquo;defect&rdquo; in the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe adverted to the difficulty of finding an adequate definition for imitation firearms.  This matter is dealt with in section 57 of the UK Firearms Act, 1968, which defines imitation firearms as anything which has the appearance of a firearm whether or not capable of discharging any shot, bullet, etc.  The real problem here is that there is a distinction between imitation firearms which, as Deputy McCartan has said, are very closely related in appearance to actual firearms and other imitation firearms.  While the English definition demonstrates that it is a relatively easy matter to define an imitation firearm, if we are to bring imitation firearms within the ambit of the legislation we will have to bring all sorts of toy guns within its ambit.  I do not think it is possible to bring in a definition which would distinguish between imitation firearms which have a genuine appearance of firearms and other imitation firearms.  Therein lies the difficulty in which the Minister finds himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem I have. I am not scoring any points but this problem was acknowledged by Deputy O'Keeffe during the course of Second Stage debate.  He pointed out the virtual impossibility of distinguishing between an imitation firearm and a toy gun for the purposes of legal definition.  I want to <Col N="1752" /> reassure Members that under existing statutory provisions there is a maximum penalty of 14 years for carrying a firearm or imitation firearm with criminal intent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the authorisation to be given by a superintendent, it will be absolutely essential for the superintendent to be sure that before allowing anybody to retain an old weapon it has to be for a very good reason.  As Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out, most of these firearms would be connected in some way with the 1916 period.  That is the type of case we are talking about here.  I share Deputy McCartan's concern about the number of guns in Northern Ireland in the hands of paramilitary groups.  Too many guns are in use there on a daily basis or hidden away in some dump for future use.  That is a matter of concern to the Government and to every Member in this House.</P>

      <P>Children play this rather innocent game using inefficient longbows and plastic guns &mdash; they were made of metal in my day &mdash; and the superintendent of the Garda may round up all these guns and take them away.  I hope we do not get to the stage where we will look a little ridiculous in what we are trying to achieve.  The Minister has taken a very balanced approach in this Bill and he has covered in his amendments all the questions raised on Second Stage.  The Minister says that many households keep guns with the firing pins sawn off and the barrels drilled out as mementoes and keepsakes.  Do the owners of these guns now have to go back to the Garda to get a note or letter allowing them to keep these guns in their possession?  In addition guns of an ancient vintage are displayed in hotels and guest houses, museums or places where there is a large tourism element.  Such weapons may date back for centuries.  Are they now covered <Col N="1753" /> by this Bill and, if so, is it only necessary for the owners to go to the local superintendent to get permission to keep them as curios which give an ambiance to particular rooms?  Can the Minister assure us that people will not be in difficulties because they keep something that gives a certain ambiance to particular establishments?</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's comments in relation to what I am trying to achieve here, which is a balance between the real and the unreal.  People who have guns that have been in their family for generations will, when this legislation comes in, merely have to notify the superintendent who will, if appropriate, give them clearance. Antique guns in the case the Deputy mentioned, are already covered under existing Firearms Acts and nothing has to be done in relation to them.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1) The superintendent of the Garda Síochána of a district may grant an authorisation in writing to a person resident in the district, not being a person disentitled under the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990, to hold a firearm certificate, to have in his possession, without a firearm certificate, a firearm where he is satisfied that the firearm would not be a firearm but for section 4 (1) (f) and that the person has a good reason for wishing to keep it and may be permitted to do so without danger to the public safety or the peace.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), lines 24 to 26, to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the section on the possession of silencers.  I am proposing to delete paragraph (2) (b).  Subsection (2) deals with the powers of a superintendent to grant an authorisation under the section.  It says:</P>
      <P>A superintendent shall not grant an authorisation unless he is satisfied that the person who is to have possession of the silencer or to whom it is to be sold or transferred is the holder of a firearm certificate for a firearm to which the silencer can be fitted...</P>
      <P>I agree with that; it is an eminently sensible proposition.  Paragraph (a) states:</P>
      <P>having regard to all the circumstances, the possession, sale or transfer concerned will not endanger the public safety or the peace,</P>
      <P>I cannot disagree with that either.  I think that is enough supervision.  I do not understand the need for paragraph (b) which I propose should be deleted.  It reads:</P>
      <P>The person has a special need that is, in the opinion of the superintendent, sufficient to justify the granting of the authorisation for the silencer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point here is that if the superintendent is of the view that the possession of the silencer will not represent a danger to public safety or the peace, as is required under paragraph (a), that should end the matter and there should be no other consideration.  If there is no <Col N="1755" /> threat to peace then let people possess these silencers but I do not see why a person has to make a special case.  In the area of balance this seems to have dominated the debate so far.  These are a peculiar piece of the weaponry used by some people and not by others, depending on the circumstances in which they work or hunt.  Provided the superintendent is satisfied that there is no danger to safety or peace, then people should be allowed have these silencers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. The purpose of section 6 is to limit the availability of silencers to those persons who have a bona fide need for such an item and who can be safely entrusted with them.  I need hardly reiterate the reason for introducing this restriction. We can all envisage the nefarious use to which such items can be put if they fall into the wrong hands.  However, we cannot ban them completely.  I understand that from time to time people like veterinarians, people in charge of stud farms, etc., can have a legitimate need for a silencer for a gun for the destruction of animals or vermin in circumstances where a loud shot would cause disturbance among other animals.  It is such a need that section 2 (b) is designed to deal with and I believe it is important that it be left within the Bill because silencers can be very dangerous and can make guns even more lethal.  We should have as many safeguards as possible, and that is why this provision is in the Bill.</P>

I have to think long and hard to come up with a situation where a person could go beyond the stage of saying that there is no harm having a silencer to lay a special case.  The Minister has given some interesting examples.  I <Col N="1756" /> have no hard view on that.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment but I was anxious to tease out the reason this paragraph was there.  What we are doing here is legislating for the maintenance of public safety and if the superintendent is happy that the possession of a silencer in particular circumstances would not threaten that, I do not see the need to require the citizen to make a special case. If the Minister is standing firm I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 5, after &ldquo;not&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or who, without lawful authority, discharges a firearm in the period after nightfall and before daybreak&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am very anxious to hear the Minister's response to this amendment.  It has been represented to me that in some parts of the country there is a considerable amount of poaching during the night involving the shooting of deer and pheasant in barbarous ways.  I gather that searchlights are used in the same way as the old rabbit dazzler; that the animals are mesmerised by the lights and very often deer are wounded but escape to die in the hills.  It seems that the discharging of weaponry during the night can have few legal causes.  I understand that Garda officers and the military should not be covered by this.  Even as regards sportsmen with licences I do not believe it is sport to be out after dark killing animals and birds in this fashion.  I understand legislation exists in the UK on this.  I am anxious to ensure that we do not have weapons discharged after nightfall and before dawn for any purpose other than where there is lawful authority for carrying such weapons, and I do not regard a licence issued to sportsmen as being lawful authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> I am open to any views of the Minister's officials, as may be expressed by the Minister, as to the validity of the point or of the manner in which I have attempted to cope with the problem.  I ask the Minister to take the matter on board seriously.  I have received a number of reports from around the country which would suggest that this is a problem that needs to be tackled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to make it an offence, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, for a person to discharge a firearm at night unless he has specific authority to do so.  I have considered the amendment and my view is that it is not necessary to make such a change in our law.  We already have very strict legislation on the control and use of firearms and this has been supplemented by the creation of the new offence of reckless discharge which is provided for in this Bill.  The Garda Síochána will be well placed to deal with any situation where they need to act to prevent the abuse of a firearm.</P>
      <P>If the amendment were accepted it would give rise to serious practical difficulties. These would rise directly with the use of the expression &ldquo;without lawful authority.&rdquo;  This is normally taken to refer to where a person is specifically authorised by law, for example, a garda, to carry out a certain function, and the result could very well be that nobody, except perhaps a member of the Defence Forces or a garda, would be permitted to discharge a firearm during the hours of darkness.  If that were the case a farmer, for example, would not be allowed to fire at a fox which was raiding his farm.  I do not believe that is what Deputy O'Keeffe wants and it would not be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern in relation to firearms being discharged at deer etc. at night.  That is poaching but it is not really poaching or hunting that we are about in this Bill, it is public safety.  If there is a need for a provision of the type the Deputy suggested I think it would be better teased out in the context of a wildlife Bill rather than this Bill.  That whole area of hunting, poaching and <Col N="1758" /> farmers using their guns at night for defending their farm against pests could be teased out under other legislation.</P>

      <P>This discussion has helped to clarify the issues to some degree.  It is clear to me now that we do not have legislation to cover the point I have raised.  Secondly, it may be that the manner in which I have framed this amendment is not the best way of tackling the problem.  On the other hand the only alternative the Minister has come up with is to leave it to a wildlife Bill.  We are talking about the proper use of firearms. While I accept it is not a crime in the strict sense, to mesmerise, shoot and wound deer out in the hills at night, it is an improper use of firearms.  Reflecting on the Minister's comments I would ask him to have the matter discussed again with his officials to see whether some more acceptable clause could be included on Report Stage.  If he takes on board the point that legislation is necessary it seems to me this is appropriate legislation in which to include it.  We are talking about the proper use of firearms.  I do not intend to press the issue at this stage.  I invite the Minister to consider the point raised in this discussion and I think we can look at it again on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>That is fine.  I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 8, but in Part III, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;(1) A person shall be guilty of an offence if he possesses or has under his control in any public place, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse (the onus of proving which shall lie on him) any weapon made, or adapted, for causing injury to, incapacitate, or intimidate any person.</P>
      <P>(2) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both, or</P>
      <P>(ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking the amendments in this way I intend to address the kernel of this legislation, that is how we proceed to deal with the control of weapons of offence. We are in the process of repealing and updating legislation that has existed from as far back as 1824, and which was dealt with under subsequent legislation &mdash; the Dublin Police Act, 1842, the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871 and the 1916 Larceny Act in terms of the possession of weapons of offence and of housebreaking implements.  We are beginning now to address in a central, single way under one Bill the regulation of the possession of knives and other articles of offence.  On Second Stage I made the point that I felt the Minister was going completely the wrong way about it, that he was engaging <Col N="1760" /> in so many different scenarios and situations that it would make this which should have been very central and clear legislation, much too cumbersome, much too complicated and packed with all kinds of arguments, that would make the situation for the policemen on the ground almost impossible and for the officer in the court subsequently prosecuting liable to all kinds of legalistic traps.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is in Part III of the Bill under the heading &ldquo;Offensive Weapons&rdquo; while &ldquo;Possession of knives and other articles&rdquo; is the side heading in the margin.  The Minister provides under section 8 (1) to deal &ldquo;with any knife or any other article which has a blade.&rdquo;  That is the first matter.  We are dealing with a knife or an article with a blade that is sharply pointed and is not a folding pocket knife.  It shall be an offence to have one of those things in any one of a number of different locations, &ldquo;any dance hall, dance marquee, discotheque, cinema, theatre, concert hall, recreation hall, amusement hall or similar place,... any club premises, or any premises in which food or drink (whether intoxicating or not) is served to the public&rdquo;.  We have 12 different locations.  Even before we get beyond subsection (1) we have three separate articles and 12 different possible locations.  All of those are then qualified by the definition &ldquo;at a time when people are likely to be resorting thereto&rdquo;.  Then there is reference to any place where there is a sports fixture, a carnival, a bazaar, outdoor concert or any similar function being held and where people are likely to congregate.  All of those in their own right will be the subject of a debate on their definition but more importantly the subject of practical consideration by the police officer.  Where was he?  Was he in a dance hall, club premises, was intoxicating liquor being sold, had the knife a blade that is sharply pointed, can it fold or not?  The section is full of problems for the police officer investigating the case and equally when it comes to court for proof, all kinds of issues will be raised in defence.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) (a) of the Bill &mdash; by no means the second scenario, I think we <Col N="1761" /> have counted 20 already &mdash; deals with another implement, the flick-knife, and section 8 (2) (b) deals with &ldquo;any other article whatsoever made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person,&rdquo;.  In fact paragraph (b) covers everything that can be contemplated under paragraph (a) because &ldquo;any other article whatsoever made or adapted for use for causing injury&rdquo; will obviously include a knife or an article with a blade that is sharply pointed, a flick-knife or any other article, and it will be a crime to have them in any public place without lawful excuse.  I believe that paragraph (b) makes paragraph (a) virtually redundant.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (3) deals with another concept where a person has with him any article intended by him to unlawfully cause injury to, incapacitate or intimidate any person.  What article is contemplated that is not already covered by paragraph (b)?  I am at a loss to know what subsection (3) deals with that is not clearly covered by subsection (2) (b).</P>
    <P>Section 8 (4) is a tortuous qualification of the person whom it was intended to intimidate or whom it might have been intended to intimidate under subsection (3).  It states: &ldquo;It shall not be necessary for the prosecution&rdquo; to prove that the person had the weapon for the purposes of intimidating and that they do not have to prove that you were in pursuit of a particular person.  There can be a general intent to intimidate.  I believe this is an unnecessary modification and qualification of subsection (3) which in any event is subsumed under subsection (2) (b) and it should not be in the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (5) deals with penalties. There are varying penalties because there are various scenarios.  I think we should have a single scenario and a single sentence. Section 8 (6) tries to define a &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  In fact &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is so well defined in judicial law arising from the road traffic legislation that it does not need definition and we will now have a major problem with arguments on the definition in court where lawyers will be borrowing from judicial interpretations of the public place provision under the <Col N="1762" /> Road Traffic Act and, if I am correct, when the Road Traffic Acts were originally introduced it was seen by the Legislature that there was no need to define a &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  It was left to the courts to subsequently give a commonsense definition of public place: a public place is a place to which the public have access. Whether entry was under licence or for a fee was irrelevant.  If you have access to a place it is a public place for the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally in section 8 (7) we have a definition of a &ldquo;flick-knife&rdquo;.  The Minister will have to agree that he had a tough job getting a definition that was comprehensive enough to cover all the eventualities of how a flick-knife can be created.  It can be either a knife which has a blade that can be shot out by a spring or a blade that can be thrown out by the force of a hand movement and that can be withdrawn into the knife by a flick movement.  There were all kinds of imponderables.</P>
    <P>The section is much too cumbersome and envisages far too many variables and will in fact make the workings of this central pivot of the Bill difficult to implement.  I have suggested a proposed amendment to section 8 which covers all of the scenarios envisaged by the Minister. Section 8 (1) of my proposed amendment states:</P>
    <P>A person shall be guilty of an offence if he possesses or has under his control in any public place, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse (the onus of proving which shall lie on him) any weapon made, or adapted, for causing injury to, incapacitate, or intimidate any person.</P>
    <P>As a consequence there is no necessity for the tortuous qualification of what intimidation is all about and one penalty will be provided.  Therefore there is no need to define a flick-knife.  As I have said a public place is well and truly defined in existing legislation and it is not for us to have to produce another definition here. A section that runs to over 60 lines involving seven subsections can be comfortably reduced to two subsections with a central <Col N="1763" /> proposition as in subsection (1) of my amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked at length in the Seanad and on Second Stage in the Dáil about achieving the balance of trying to protect the boy scout with the folding pocket knife or the man who needs a knife to cut his plug tobacco and he felt that it was important to recognise that there were many uses of knives that had domestic and innocent explanations and many tools of a trade that clearly had innocent explanations and that we should envisage allowing for universal entitlement to have these knives or weapons in innocent and easily explained situations. My reply to that is, rather than create this cumbersome code of traps that appear in section 8, the Minister should go for a simple, all-embracing proposition as I proposed in my amendment and that you allow the defence of lawful excuse should a prosecution be brought.  In the unlikely event &mdash; I use an extreme example because it is easy to illustrate &mdash; that the boy scout ended up in the dock on account of possession of the hunting knife or camping knife with all its accoutrements, it is open to him to simply say: &ldquo;Your Honour, I was out about my business as a member of the boy scouts and I intended to cut sticks and prepare ropes and I had no unlawful intent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How could a judge convict a person in those circumstances?  How are the rights and interests of that person not defended in that case? In any event their position would be completely covered because if the police officer comes across a person carrying a weapon in a public place, I believe that under my amendment he has the discretion to say that he is not prepared to believe a lawful excuse exists, and to confiscate the weapon and prosecute if necessary.  We are approaching this in a far more sensible way.  We are giving the widest possible discretion to the garda to address each situation in the circumstances in which they find it and to make a decision consequent on that.  A garda officer presented on the <Col N="1764" /> street with the various different propositions contained in this section will be faced with all kinds of questions before he or she can act.  I am extremely worried that we have created a monster here which will render this legislation virtually unworkable and I would urge the Minister to have regard to an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to Deputy McCartan and I have to admit a certain amount of sympathy with what he has said.  If we try to make the legislation too complicated we run the risk of rendering it ineffective.  The reverse is also the case.  If we try to over-simplify it we may also make it ineffective.  In the section the Minister is deliberately trying to address a number of situations.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the way Deputy McCartan's amendment is drafted.  The amendment would only penalise people who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, are in possession of weapons made or adapted for causing injury.  I can understand the concept of a weapon adapted for causing injury.  A bottle is not made for causing injury but if it is broken it may be presumed to be adapted for causing injury.  The vast majority of weaponry with which the crimes we are talking about are committed is not specifically made for causing injury to other people.  For example, a chisel, a kitchen knife and a screwdriver are not made for causing injury to a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 8 (1) if a person goes into a crowded place, a dance hall or a football stadium with a sharply pointed weapon he can be prosecuted for an offence.  Under section 8 (3) if he goes to the same place with an iron bar or any weapon which is not sharply pointed and does not have a blade he also commits an offence.  The burden of proof is very different in relation to the two offences. In the first case all the prosecution have to prove is the simple fact of possession. In the second case the prosecution have to establish intent to commit injury, incapacitate, intimidate, etc.  A person can wreak as much havoc with an iron bar or a knuckle duster as with a weapon which just happens to be sharply pointed or has <Col N="1765" /> a blade.  I am unhappy that these are distinguished in this way.  In one case there is an additional heavy burden of proof of intent, while this ingredient is lacking in the other offence.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the amendment could be drafted in a different manner.  As I read it, the vast majority of weapons would be excluded.  I can think of one or two weapons made deliberately for the purpose of causing injury to other people.  I would argue that even a flick-knife is not made exclusively for causing injury to other people and that it has some uses apart from that.  It is a difficult and complex matter.  The Minister is setting out to address a number of possible situations. In our attempts not to over-complicated the Bill, we must not fall into the trap of over-simplifying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of this amendment would involve the deletion of section 8 of the Bill and I cannot accept it. Perhaps I should repeat what I said in my Second Stage speech about the reasoning behind section 8 and why it takes the form it does.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in devising statutory controls to deal with the availability of offensive weapons, other than firearms, is that many ordinary everyday articles can be employed as offensive weapons and even those articles which most readily come to mind as weapons, e.g. knives, have many legitimate uses. In recognition of this fact it is attempted in section 8 to provide for controls which will deal with the problem of abuse in a realistic and balanced way.</P>
      <P>A scaled approach is taken.  Firstly, knives and similar instruments are prohibited in those places where people congregate for entertainment or recreation and where there is no legitimate reason for a person to have such items.  Secondly, those weapons which have no legitimate use such as flick-knives are prohibited in public places generally.  And thirdly, having any weapon in a public place with intent to injure or intimidate is made an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1766" /> Deputy McCartan, in his amendment, seeks to simplify the matter by attempting to provide an all embracing provision to cover everything from the ordinary kitchen knife to a flick-knife to a razor studded belt.  This would be an attractive approach if it could work but it cannot.</P>
    <P>The Deputy proposes that we simply make it an offence to have in a public place &ldquo;any weapon made, or adapted, for causing injury to, incapacitate, or intimidate any person&rdquo;.  The effectiveness of this provision depends on what is to be regarded as a &ldquo;weapon made or adapted&rdquo;.  It is well settled that an ordinary knife, or a screwdriver or any other implement which has a legitimate use cannot be regarded as a &ldquo;weapon made or adapted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in their Report on Vagrancy and Related Matters &mdash; LRC 11 of 1985 &mdash; dealt with the significance of this point.  At page 76 of their report they quote from Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, fifth edition in relation to English law in this area.  I should mention at this point that although the passage quoted by the Law Reform Commission relates to English law, it is relevant also to section 8 of the present Bill.  The passage reads as follows:</P>
    <P>There are three categories of offensive weapon: (i) Articles made for causing injury would include a service rifle or bayonet, a revolver, a cosh, knuckle-duster, dagger or flick-knife.  (ii) Articles adapted for causing injury would include razor blades inserted in a potato or cap-peak, a bottle broken for the purpose, a chair-leg studded with nails or so on.  &ldquo;Adapted&rdquo; probably means altered so as to become suitable. It is not certain whether the intention of the adaptor is relevant.  Is an accidentally broken milk bottle &ldquo;adapted for use for causing injury to the person&rdquo;?  It is submitted that it is not and that if the article was not adapted with intent, it can only be an offensive weapon in category (iii) below.  It has been held that a bottle broken for the purpose of committing suicide is adapted for causing injury to the <Col N="1767" /> person; but since the question is whether it is an offensive weapon and &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; implies an attack on another, the &ldquo;injury&rdquo; to which (it is submitted) the adaptor must contemplate, must be injury to another. (iii) It is very important to distinguish the third category of articles which are neither made nor adapted for causing injury, but are carried for that purpose. Whether D carried the article with the necessary purpose is essentially a question of fact.  Articles which have been held to be carried with such interest include a sheath-knife, a shot-gun, a razor, a sandbag, a pick-axe handle, a stone, and a drum of pepper.  Any article is capable of being an offensive weapon; but if it is of such a nature that it is unlikely to cause injury when brought into contact with the person, then the onus of proving the necessary intent will be very heavy.</P>
    <P>The importance of the distinction is that, in the case of articles &ldquo;made or adapted&rdquo;, the prosecution have to prove no more than possession in a public place.  D will then be convicted unless he can prove, on a balance of probability, that he had lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  But if the article falls into the third category the onus is on the prosecution to show that it was carried with intent to injure.</P>
    <P>My advice is that that third category referred to in the extract I have quoted would cover the vast majority of knives, sharp tools, etc.  Therefore, in the provision proposed by Deputy McCartan possession of an ordinary knife or a sharp tool would not be prohibited.  A person carrying an ordinary sheath-knife or a screwdriver or say a &ldquo;Stanley knife&rdquo; would not be in possession of something that could be automatically classed as a weapon in the context of the Deputy's amendment.  Proof of intent to use the item as a weapon would be needed which could, of course, be difficult to provide.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment, if accepted, would be a retrograde step and would greatly weaken the Bill.  That does not <Col N="1768" /> mean I am not prepared to accept the point about the pocket knife, its length and the difference between the man who is using it for cutting tobacco and so on. We will try to regularise that on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to a blunt instrument.  An iron bar or a hammer can be used as weapons but the line must be drawn somewhere in the Bill.  Almost any heavy item can be used as a blunt instrument and we cannot bring everything within the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister and Deputy O'Dea for their remarks.  There seems to be a degree of unanimity about simplifying the law and I should like to pursue the matter to see if there is a possibility of a simpler code. On Second Stage Deputy O'Dea made a very interesting contribution to the Official Report, volume 394, column 1607, where he referred to the man travelling on the train from Limerick with intimidatory purposes in mind.  He said that under the section the man travelling up on the train with a weapon was committing an offence whereas, going home with the same weapon, he was not.  That oddity arises because we are trying to do too much in the section.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to draft something that might appeal to the Minister I relied too much on the Minister's wording in the Bill by adopting the words &ldquo;made or adapted&rdquo;.  I fully accept that they are inappropriate words to deal with all the situations the Bill needs to cover.  I wonder if the words &ldquo;capable of causing injury to, incapacitate or intimidate&rdquo; would cover the deficiency in the wording I used.  The section could then refer to &ldquo;any weapon capable of causing injury to, incapacitate or intimidate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot follow the line of thinking that if we are too wide and all-embracing the legislation might equally become ineffective. I would have thought that the all-embracing legislation which gives on the one hand discretion to the police officer to act in certain circumstances and on the other the open defence of lawful excuse to the defendant if prosecuted to explain <Col N="1769" /> why he or she felt the weapon could be carried, is the best approach to take.  I do not fully agree with the Minister's statement that the section could not work.  I borrowed the words &ldquo;made or adapted&rdquo; from the original section and I agree they are unduly restrictive.  If we introduced the words &ldquo;capable of&rdquo; would we be getting closer to something that would commend itself to the Minister?</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for his acknowledgment of the difficulties surrounding this section.  I would like to have had it as broad as possible but I have outlined the difficulties.  I have not had an opportunity to consider his remarks but my immediate reaction is that a person carrying a sheath knife, a screwdriver or a Stanley knife would not be in possession of something that could automatically be classed as a weapon in the context of the Deputy's amendment. We are back to the whole question of intent and proof of intent in relation to the Deputy's point.</P>

      <P>I obviously do not intend to press my amendment because I am grateful for the good advice of Deputies on the other side although I am not entirely happy with the wording. However, I will come back to it on Report Stage because it is an issue of central principle to the working of legislation that we keep matters as simple and concise as possible.  Perhaps I will leave this matter because we will shortly be discussing an amendment in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe in regard to the public place definition.  Why did the Minister feel it necessary to give a definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in the context of this legislation when ample and adequate definitions already exist?</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister not make it an offence to possess or own a flick knife apart from using it in a public <Col N="1770" /> place?  I do not see any reason for anybody having such an implement because it is an offensive weapon and cannot be used for any other purpose, unlike the other knives which have been mentioned. Why do we not ban this weapon instead of allowing it to be bought and in the possession of people in certain areas which are not public places?  Perhaps I am wrong but I thought the flick knife had been banned many years ago and that it was an offence to possess one. Does the definition of &ldquo;club premises&rdquo; extend to the sports ground attached to such premises?  There are many GAA, soccer, rugby and golf clubs which have premises and extensive grounds.  I certainly agree with banning any knife on the fourteenth hole in Portmarnock during the Carrolls' Irish Open although it is an unlikely happening.  Nevertheless, I wonder if one would be in contravention of this law if one was found in possession of an offensive weapon in the sports ground area rather than on the club premises.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 follow on from amendment No. 9 and try to improve the section as it stands.  I am merely proposing that &ldquo;other than a folding pocket knife&rdquo; be taken out of subsection (1).

      <P>The folding pocket-knife was included to allow for pipe smokers or others who might habitually carry a pen-knife or pocket-knife for peeling <Col N="1772" /> tobacco or for doing many other jobs for which a pen-knife is useful.  I do not want to stop such people from carry their penknives or to put them in a position where they must check their pockets before going to a football match, a dance or for a drink to be sure they are not carrying a pen-knife.  In my view the exception is a reasonable one.  However, I am prepared to consider a compromise on Report Stage to limit the length of any blade or folding knife to, say, three inches or eight centimetres.  This was done in the British legislation and I think it might meet the concerns the Deputy has expressed.</P>

The ordinary small one which pipe smokers or fishermen use is probably legitimate, but I imagine there are types of folding knives which could be very lethal.  The approach now being taken by the Minister limiting the length of the knives might be the best one.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kavanagh wants me to tell the House about the strict regulation in the House of Commons where you cannot bring your sword into the Chamber.  Maybe Deputy O'Keeffe can be asked to leave his pen-knife outside also.  The section states &ldquo;without lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo; therefore the pipe smoker has nothing to worry about if the words are deleted.  The folding pocket-knife is being excluded.  If the pipe smoker can produce his tobacco tin or his pipe, that would be a lawful excuse.  I do not see a difficulty <Col N="1773" /> in that but I do see a difficulty if we get into the area of the British legislation trying to regulate measurements.  If a police officer is dealing with a busy discotheque, bazaar, dance hall, recreation hall or amusement hall, is he to have a ruler with him and ask the person to wait until he measures the knife to see what length it is?  That would be unworkable. As the words &ldquo;lawful authority or reasonable excuse&rdquo; are included, the innocent person has nothing to worry about.  I am trying to address this matter with effective legislation that is workable from the point of view of the police officer as well as covering the rights of those who have nothing to worry about in the first place. I acknowledge that we are coming back to this matter on Report Stage and I hope the Minister will keep those points in mind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (6), line 22, after &ldquo;train,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;aircraft,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is very simple and straightforward.  I was examining the definition of a public place where these offences might be committed and the subsection refers to the obvious public places, such as a highway and any other premises or place to which the public have or are permitted to have access.  It makes it clear that any club premises, a train, a vessel or vehicle used for the carriage of persons for reward are also included.  It does not appear to me that we are talking about modern forms of travel because an aircraft has not been included.  I am seeking to broaden the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  In many ways the possession of knives or offensive weapons on an aircraft would be more serious than if they were in the possession of a person on a train or other vehicle.  It was for that reason I tabled my amendment and I should like to encourage the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that the Bill would now provide that it would be an offence for a person to have with him in an aircraft any article intended by him unlawfully to <Col N="1776" /> cause injury to incapacities or intimidate another person.</P>
      <P>I believe that this amendment is unnecessary given that section 19 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, already makes the conduct at which the amendment is directed an offence.  That section provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that it is an offence for a person on an aircraft to be in possession without lawful authority of any article which is made or adapted for causing injury to or incapacitating a person, or for damaging or destroying any property, or which is intended by the person in whose possession it is for such use.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, I do not think this amendment is necessary but I think I should also mention that I do not think it would be appropriate to deal with a criminal offence which might be committed on board an aircraft in the current Bill.  This is because there is specific legislation &mdash; i.e. the Air Navigation and Transport Acts &mdash; which is concerned with what happens on aircraft and I believe that offences which take place there should be dealt with in that particular legislation.  For the reasons given I would oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 40 to 45, to delete subsection (7) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Where it is proposed to make an order under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the order shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been approved by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the powers of the Minister to prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale, hire or loan of offensive weapons.  That is a welcome provision but nonetheless the Minister is entitled to make orders under the section.  The section provides that the order shall be laid before the House and become law if there is no motion to annul or object to it moved within 21 sitting days.  I am opposed to such a provision in principle. All orders or resolutions emanating from legislation should be in the positive form requiring an Act of the Oireachtas in advance of them being passed into law. The fact is that there is virtually no opportunity under current orders of the House for an Opposition Deputy to move a motion within the time constraints. Effectively, it is a meaningless provision. <Col N="1778" /> I am asking the Minister to adopt my amendment which seeks to require the House to actively pass such a resolution.</P>
    <P>When such matters go before the Whips, on representation from the Government Whip, the motion is explained in brief terms and nine times out of ten it is passed by the House without debate.  This is a better process in that the House will be given an opportunity to decide if there is an issue to be debated. In that event a limited period could be allowed for debate and I do not think it would take any more than 30 minutes of the time of the House.  The formula I am suggesting is better than the standard formula which operates and means that the House will not address such resolutions at any stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle I prefer the approach of using the affirmative resolution, particularly where matters of substance are involved.  I get the feeling, and I am not pointing the finger at the Minister, that the Executive are normally advised by the public service that the easier course of action is not to go by way of affirmative resolution but to follow the procedure laid down in the section. Where matters of substance are involved I lean towards the affirmative resolution as being the preferred course to follow from a democratic point of view.  I am thinking in particular of the Bill dealing with genetic fingerprinting under which regulations will be a major part of the approach.  Members should have an opportunity of debating regulations made under that legislation.</P>
      <P>The type of order to be made by the Minister under the section does not appear to be of major substance and on that basis, while agreeing with the general principle put forward by Deputy McCartan, I do not think it is the type of order on which we should go to bat.  I would give a higher priority to seeking an affirmative resolution in regard to many other orders.  This section might be appropriate for the negative resolution approach.</P>

      <P>The types of weapons which will be prescribed in the regulations will be weapons which are considered particularly dangerous or undesirable and for which there is no legitimate use or need.  The Garda authorities are being consulted in this regard and a tentative list of such weapons has been compiled.

What a charming list.</P>
      <P>There will undoubtedly be need to amend these regulations from time to time as new weapons come on the market.  I will rely very heavily on the advice of the Garda authorities as to what weapons should be prescribed.  I think it must be accepted that they are the experts in this area.</P>
      <P>I do not see any need for the elaborate procedure proposed in Deputy McCartan's amendment whereby both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to pass a motion of approval every time regulations may be needed to prescribe some new exotic weapon with a Chinese name which comes alone.  This would simply cause delay and would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negative resolution procedure, which the Bill proposes, is suitable for cases where the Oireachtas have approved of the policy in general and have decided to authorise the Minister to select the cases where it is appropriate for the policy to be applied but to reserve the power to ensure that the Minister exercises the power correctly.  The affirmative resolution procedure is appropriate where large questions of policy are involved and the approval of the Oireachtas should be sought in advance.  In the case of section 11 the <Col N="1780" /> Oireachtas will have approved the policy that restrictions such as mentioned should be imposed in respect of articles of certain kinds and, as I have mentioned, it is appropriate for these to be specified from time to time as necessary subject to the overriding control of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Garda would be considered the experts in this area but not exclusively so.  We are representatives of the people.  We are the people in touch with what is going on in our constituencies and in our communities and we have a certain expertise that should be listened to.  The Minister suggests that it is a cumbersome procedure. It is no more cumbersome than the negative approach that is being provided for.  In both you must drawn up an order and in both cases it must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The only difference required is that it be the affirmative, that the Whip presents it at a Whip's meeting and says: &ldquo;This is the Order, this is why we are bringing it in. What do you have to say about it?&rdquo; In nine times out of ten, the matter appears on the Order Paper and is taken without debate but there may well be an occasion when Deputies feel it would be important to debate it.  For someone who says it is not really an important provision, it is dealing with the manufacture, importation, sale, hire or loan of certain weapons of offence and their availability in the community.  The Minister, by his own litany of intended contemplated weapons illustrates the importance of these martial art type weapons that are becoming more and more popular in the community. These should be controlled or prohibited by the legislation.  They are unwelcome as has been made clear in the contributions to the debate this morning as well as on previous days when this provision was debated.  Deputies have shown a wide range of knowledge and information on the subject.  It was through our arguments on this side of the House that the definition of stun gun will be extended.  That is an important item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> The Minister has agreed that the question of the bow will be looked at afresh. That is another illustration of that debate and information which comes from the Floor of the Chamber can often be important and useful.  If we receive notice of a resolution that does not seem to cover enough or that is not covering something adequately, it gives us the opportunity to say so.  In practical terms, the current operation of the rules of the House mean that under subsection (7), we will not have that input.  That is why I think the amendment is important.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 15, to delete &ldquo;or a Peace Commissioner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which is succinctly to the point.  It proposes that we delete from the section the power being conferred on a peace commissioner to issue warrants of search and seize under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined in more detail on Second Stage the reason I have reservations about the giving of powers to peace commissioners. Those reservations are based on my experience of that institution and office during the years I worked as a practising solicitor.  My firm belief is that these office holders were incapable and, indeed, on some occasions unwilling to exercise their functions and authorities in a proper quasi judicial way.  I illustrated the occasion where it was brought most vividly home to me on visiting Lucan Garda station one Sunday morning to visit people in detention; while waiting for them to arrive into the room, I began to fidget with the rubber stamps lying on the desk in front of me only to establish to my horror that the rubber stamp lying in the Garda station &mdash; obviously available for use whenever needed &mdash; was that of a peace commissioner.  That exemplifies the unfortunate development to which the office of the peace commissioner has now drifted.  For his own convenience the man has said: &ldquo;Look, do not annoy me, if you want a search warrant, an arrest warrant or a fingerprint warrant and so on, there is my stamp, stick it on it.&rdquo;  It was brought home further to me on another occasion on entering an hotel, where I knew that the proprietor was a peace commissioner and when I observed a number of gardaí from the local Garda station standing at the reception desk while the receptionist was busily signing their summonses and <Col N="1783" /> warrants on behalf of the hotel proprietor; he was too busy to do so.  This happened in daylight where everyone who was passing by could see this young girl busily appending to the document the signature &mdash; so-called &mdash; of the peace commissioner.</P>
    <P>It is time to review entirely the office of peace commissioner; whether or what function they serve must be questioned. We must leave that aside as that is not the debate here today.  The debate today is on whether we afford to the peace commissioner the powers, based on sworn information from a member of the Garda Síochána, to issue warrant of search and entry and seizure of goods. The power is needed because the home is considered the castle.  The Constitution recognises the importance of the home and property of the individual and we are legislating for potential incursions into the Constitutional rights of citizens.  We should only do that on the basis of a judicial directive, that of a District Court. There are enough of them around.  They are available as often as necessary.  It presents no difficulty in any part of this country to find a district justice, at any hour of the evening, for the purposes of obtaining the document necessary. Anyone who suggests otherwise is not being entirely frank on the matter. Consequently, that is how I think the matter should be dealt with.  I acknowledge that courts have judicially pronounced that the signing of a search warrant is not an unconstitutionally infirm procedure from the point of view of the peace commissioner but his role has been sufficiently eroded.  Previously he was entitled to initiate proceedings by the signing of summonses to prosecute but the courts have now said that that is not something a peace commissioner should do.</P>
    <P>The functions of peace commissioners have been eroded, and correctly so in view of the sad practices by some of them. I am not saying that every peace commissioner is guilty of the slipshoddiness I referred to earlier and on Second Stage <Col N="1784" /> but we should not, as a matter of principle, continue to extend the quasi-judicial powers of peace commissioners. There are many other functions they can carry out such as signing and authenticating documents for passports, registers of births, marriages, deaths etc.  If they want to continue to do this then so be it but I would call a halt when it comes to giving them the authority to authorise members of the Garda to invade homes and seize the property of individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The view presented by Deputy McCartan in regard to the availability of district justices is a typically Dublin one.  I do not know whether Deputy McCartan is aware of the position in my part of the country where our district justice lives in Cork city, which is about 100 miles away from Castletownbere.  Under this section the Garda Síochána may seek a search warrant if they suspect that an offence has been or is being committed.  If they want to search a premises over the weekend they will have to travel 100 miles to Cork city to locate the district justice and get him to sign the search warrant.  This is all very well in Dublin where one third of our population are living within 30 miles of one another but it is a different story in the country.  From a practical point of view it would be very unwise to restrict the issue of search warrants to district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the question of how peace commissioners discharge their functions can be addressed by removing their responsibilities.  Deputy McCartan is doing an injustice to the very many peace commissioners who are conscientiously and responsibly discharging their functions, by suggesting that possibly one or two are not so doing.  Perhaps the warrants should be removed from those people who are not discharging their functions properly and the matter brought to the attention of the Minister who signs their warrants for them.  This does not detract in any way from the honourable traditions and very responsible behaviour of many peace commissioners throughout the country.  A <Col N="1785" /> general debate on the role of other peace commissioners is a matter for another day in the context of a review of our court practices and procedures but it should not be done by removing from the peace commissioners the power to issue search warrants under this Bill.  As I have said, from a practical point of view this would be a very unwise move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy O'Keeffe has said.  Like Deputy McCartan I live in an urban area and while I agree with him that there are a fair number of district justices it is nothing like the number of peace commissioners. This section is dealing with a situation where time will invariably be of the essence.  Deputy McCartan's point could be met by redrafting this section to read &ldquo;... a district justice or, if he is immediately unavailable, a peace commissioners&rdquo;. I could not support any suggestion that this power should be confined to district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy O'Dea have said. The effect of this amendment is that it would not be open to a peace commissioner to issue a search warrant under section 14.  I believe a peace commissioner should be in a position to issue these warrants and in that regard it must be borne in mind that circumstances might well arise where a garda would require a warrant but a district justice would not be available for exactly the reasons given in regard to distance, etc., by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that this case was decided in the High Court in July 1987 where it was held that the issuing of search warrants by peace commissioners was not contrary to the Constitution.  In addition, the power to issue warrants conferred on peace commissioners under the Bill is practically identical to those powers which have been conferred on commissioners by recent legislation which has been passed by both Houses.  As well as that the search power under section 11 will be applied mainly to commercial premises and not to private residences. <Col N="1786" /> The power relates only to offences under section 11, which are trading offences.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of peace commissioners, I must say that Deputy McCartan took a broad brush and seemed to paint everybody with the same colour as the commissioners in the two examples he gave.  On the face of it there was misuse of the warrants by the peace commissioners and I would be grateful if Deputy McCartan would give me the details of the two examples he mentioned so that I can have them examined. If the circumstances are as we were given by the Deputy &mdash; I have no reason to doubt the Deputy's assertions &mdash; I will withdraw the warrants of the two commissioners involved.  Clear specific guidelines are laid down for peace commissioners for the operation of their duties and if they go outside those their warrants can be withdrawn.  I invite the Deputy to submit details of the two cases to me so that they can be examined immediately.</P>

      <P>We are taking this issue a little bit too lightly.  The balance of convenience, because of the distance involved at rural level, is being presented as one reason why what I now believe to be the decrepit office of peace commissioner should be defended.  I instanced two cases of the misuse of warrants but I believe there are a myriad of such cases.  I have to deal with these people in police stations when they have acted virtually as puppets for police officers by looking for people to be put into custody, not wanting bail to be fixed, etc.</P>

      <P>I know but that has been my experience over the years in dealing with these people.  They were unable to take any sort of independent view whatsoever and were as much a part of the police woodwork as the desks, benches or chairs in the rooms in which we sat.  The notion that they are capable of fulfilling a quasi-independent judicial <Col N="1787" /> role is long gone.  This function is now reserved for people who serve political parties in Government well and is a way of acknowledging their service to the party.  That is not the basis upon which we should be deciding who should be appointed for the purposes of issuing warrants to invade homes, seize property or deal with other transgressions which would otherwise be ones of constitutional right.  I want to make that point very clearly.</P>
      <P>I have made my point on the basis of my experience of working at close hand with this institution over the years.  I make this point with regret but nonetheless with conviction.  A far better way of dealing with the geographic diversity and non-availability of district justices &mdash; this issue has begun to be addressed slowly by the Law Reform Commission, and I accept that there are difficulties in rural areas currently &mdash; is to expand the law to use modern conveniences like fax machines for the transmission of warrants or sworn information to and from the offices of the district justices.  It is a far more preferable arrangement, with all the problems that it could present than dealing with the institution of the peace commissioner.</P>
      <P>This is an issue that I feel very strongly about.  Having spent 15 years working in close proximity to the institute of the peace commissioner, I am not prepared to see myself legislate or be part of an agreement to legislate for the further extension of their powers, and I am sorry that the issue has not been taken up in that light.  I appreciate that there are difficulties on all sides here, having appointed wholesale personnel to the institution of the peace commissioner over the years.  Let there be absolutely no doubt about it that the first opportunity I ever get to deal with the peace commissioners I will be abolishing the office entirely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment would be extending the powers of the Garda Síochána.  I tabled this amendment following some practical advice I received from a senior member of the Garda Síochána.  He pointed out that the power of search without a warrant lacks pragmatism under certain circumstances. He referred to the problems that would arise at a major rock concert where there is a very large number of people present when the number of gardaí that might be available to deal with the problem might be very small in proportion to the big attendance.  In that situation it might not be prudent or practical, in certain circumstances, to use the power of search on the spot.  From the point of view of the numbers involved, if one had only two or three gardaí to deal with the situation I could certainly understand why it might be difficult to carry out a search on the spot.  Therefore there should be powers to enable the gardaí in exercising the power of search under this section to require the suspected person to accompany the garda to a Garda station. That power is included in the Misuse of Drugs Act.  I refer in particular to section 12 of that 1984 Act which specifically provides that a member of the Garda Síochána who decides to search a person under that section may require the person to accompany him to a Garda station.  So there is a precedent for the approach which I am suggesting.  I am also including in my proposal the power not just to bring the suspected person to a Garda station but also the power to bring that person to a temporary Garda centre or Garda booth for the same purpose.  I suggest this because I am told that rock concerts and other such gatherings may take place in areas which are a good distance away from a Garda station.  I am further told <Col N="1790" /> that where big numbers are expected it is quite usual for the Garda to erect a temporary Garda centre or Garda booth. In that situation that would be the obvious place for any search to take place rather than having to travel five or 10 miles away to a Garda station.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of privacy. I am further advised that an offensive weapon could be a strong string with a number of loose balls on it or jagged edged blades.  That type of offensive weapon could be easily concealed next to the body and would not be evident on visual inspection.  I can see that Garda would not wish to invade one's privacy with so many people around, so I would urge the Minister to accept my amendment. It would improve the Bill if we include a provision of the kind I now propose and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this amendment, as outlined by Deputy O'Keeffe, is that when a garda exercises the powers of search under section 15 he will have adequate opportunity to carry out the search.  I do not believe it is necessary to provide that when a garda is searching a person under 15 that he should take that person to a Garda station or otherwise detain him.  All that a garda would be required to do would be to frisk the person which could be done in seconds, since the type of dangerous article which the garda would be looking for would be easy to detect.  Furthermore, there is already a power of arrest without warrant for offences under sections 8, 9 and 10 which could be used in an appropriate case where a person refused to allow himself to be frisked. Drugs are different because they can be hidden in ways and in places where a knife, for instance, could not.  However, the Deputy has made the point in relation to taking persons to a side booth, say for the purpose of a more thorough search to find if there are some of these more exotic weapons which can be quite small and dangerous.  If the Deputy will agree to withdraw his amendment I will see <Col N="1791" /> what I can do on Report Stage in relation to this halfway house suggestion.</P>

There are at least six different Acts so providing at present.  Let me inquire from the Minister as to how this will improve or change provisions in previous legislation.  I suggest to him that a specific power of search is conferred by the following Acts: section 29 of the Dublin Police Act, 1842, section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, section 8 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, section 22 of the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1971 and section 72 of the Wildlife Act.

Such a power is necessary if the Garda are to be in a position to enforce the new legislation on offensive weapons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824 (as extended to Ireland by section 15 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871) is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am simply proposing that now the opportunity presents itself to us we do not withdraw just a section or part of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824.  I am proposing, as has been the call for many years, that we get rid of that invidious legislation, that entire section of the 1824 Vagrancy Act.  This is the section that has notoriously been used and recognised as the means of dealing with our homeless, poor and destitute people.  For years the Simon Community have campaigned and argued that it should be done away with in its entirety. I would like the Minister to indicate the position here.  My suspicions are that by reason of what we did in the recent Larceny Bill the 1824 Act is effectively redundant.  I am simply seeking to have the formal declaration made in the course of this important legislation that the invidious section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, is hereby done down once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment. A considerable number of offences were provided for in section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, and detailed discussions on these can be found in the Law Reform Commission's report on vagrancy and related offences.  In that report the commission considered the offences in section 4 of the 1824 Act and <Col N="1794" /> related Acts and made detailed recommendations in relation to them.  They recommended that some of the provisions of the section should be repealed without replacement but others should be replaced by modern, up-to-date provisions. It is not, therefore, simply a case of replacing section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, simpliciter.  Thought, very careful thought at that, has been given to replacing some of its provisions in the way recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I agree with the Deputy that section 4 should be repealed in its entirety but I hope he will appreciate that this will have to wait until other more urgent legislative priorities have been disposed of and I have had the opportunity to consider what replacement provisions may be required.  However, this Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for such an exercise.  It is far too complex.  I agree that the section should go but not in the simplistic way the Deputy proposes.</P>
      <P>In relation to the larceny legislation there are other items in section 4, begging, fortune telling and all that sort of thing, that obviously the legislation does not cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted, as the Minister made this point either in this House or in the Seanad, on Second Stage, that the more invidious portions of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act had been expunged over the years in some shape or form. What is left in the Vagrancy Act that we want to avail of?  The Minister mentioned begging and fortune telling.  If there are provisions in there for dealing with begging and fortune telling and that is all we are still holding on to, then let us be honest and straightforward enough to recognise the age in which we live and get rid of that section in its entirety.  It is a gross anachronism, offensive to all good thinking people and has been the butt end of a great deal of criticism from successive Governments in this administration that we cannot get beyond a section of the law introduced to deal with wayward soldiers returning from the Napoleonic wars and displaced citizens from the country moving into the cities, a phenomenon <Col N="1795" /> causing problems in that era that had to be dealt with by this legislation.  Despite our revolution in 1921 and all the years we have had this legislation, we cannot get beyond the section.  We are never going to get beyond the section.  The Minister has indicated that there are all kinds of other demands on his time and other priorities of government and legislation. I am asking him to do no more than leave the beggars on the street, leave the fortune tellers wherever they carry on their trade but let us get rid of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act and be done with it.</P>

We have not managed to deal with it in the lifetime of the State, and I have grave doubts that it will be dealt with, but recognising that my colleagues on my left have disembarked, I <Col N="1797" /> do not see any point in pressing the matter.

      <P>With your indulgence, Minister, and the indulgence of the House, I am required to advise as follows.  Consultations have already taken place in respect of the amendments. It is proposed the following amendments be taken together for the purpose of discussion: amendments Nos. 2, 5, 20 to 28, inclusive, 30, 53 to 55, inclusive, 59 to 61, inclusive, 63, 83 and also the proposal to delete section 8.

      <P>It is further proposed that amendments Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, to amendment No. 26, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to amendment No. 28,. and amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 30, be discussed when amendments Nos. 26, 28 and 30 &mdash; which will already have been discussed &mdash; are formally moved.  These amendments to amendments should not be discussed in the main discussion on amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed groupings of these amendments to amendments are as follows: amendments Nos. 2 and 3 to <Col N="1798" /> amendment No. 26, amendments Nos. 4 and 7 to amendment No. 26, amendment No. 5 to amendment No. 26 and amendment No. 58, amendment No. 15 to amendment No. 26, amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 28 and amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 30.

      <P>For the information of the House, on Second Stage a number of Members recommended and a number of people involved in nursing homes said they would prefer if nursing homes were subject to registration rather than licence. We have acceded to the wishes of the majority in this House and have brought forward an amendment.  The major amendment to section 4 deals with licensing and we are asking the House to agree that it should be registration in the future rather than licensing.  The reason all these amendments are coming together is that most of them are consequential on the major amendment to section 4.</P>

      <P>The Minister has rightly outlined the substantial changes here. However, in relation to the proposed groupings of the amendments, as the Minister said the most substantial change is amendment No. 26 in the name of the Minister, which is the longest change and sets out a new section 4.  I cannot understand how we are taking the first grouping together without including amendment No. 26, as that is the bones and the meat of what we are talking about.  I fail to see how we can deal with amendment No. 2 &mdash; which deletes the definition of a &ldquo;licence&rdquo;&mdash; and amendment No. 5 which defines &ldquo;register&rdquo; and &ldquo;registered pro-prietor&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the December 1989 Council meeting of the Ministers of Transport, the EC Commission tabled proposals relating to future policy development for the railways.  These proposals, which cover a range of railway activities, envisage the separation of responsibility for providing rail infrastructure, including the permanent way, from other rail activities.  A more enhanced role is envisaged in these proposals for member state Governments in relation to responsibility for provision of the appropriate infrastructure.  These proposals would have important budgetary implications for the Exchequer and are being studied carefully by my Department.</P>
      <P>I will be considering the Commission's proposals over the coming months in conjunction with my European colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best I can do is give the Deputy the Exchequer support <Col N="1805" /> for the railway company.  The Exchequer support for CIE overall was £111.255 million in 1988, of which £90.143 million went to the railways.  The Deputy may assume that a good portion of that is also involved in the maintenance side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the manner in which the permanent way is included in the costs of CIE as an overhead distorts their accounts and puts them at a disadvantage in relation to other transport companies who use the public roadways?  Will he agree that the removal of the permanent way costs from the accounts of CIE would give a fairer view of the trading position of that company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Deputy is getting at but, with respect, it is something of an accountancy exercise in the sense that whether we show the costs of maintaining the permanent way on the CIE accounts or include them in the costs of the Department of Tourism and Transport is academic to an extent unless of course &mdash; as happens in some countries &mdash; the permanent way is directly maintained by the State and the railways are leased out or used by different operators.  In that kind of scenario it makes sense for the State to directly deal with the permanent way but when there is only one operator it is academic and an accountancy exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would appear to be referring to criteria specified in the private sector scheme under the tourism operational programme in relation to just one of the measures in the programme, namely, the provision of aid for the development of all weather leisure facilities at hotels.  The programme was formally approved by the EC Commission in December last and the decision to limit Structural Fund assistance for all weather leisure facilities to hotels of 45 bedrooms or more is based on the economics of providing quality facilities of this nature to internationally accepted standards, and on the limited availability of EC funding under the programme for such developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that Ireland is at a disadvantage in terms of other EC countries in so far as we do not have the population all year round to support hotels of 45 bedrooms or more in every part of the country? Will he agree that in non-urban areas &mdash; particularly in remote areas &mdash; it is desirable to develop smaller hotels for use all year round?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of priorities.  There are 120 hotels with more than 45 bedrooms registered with Bord Fáilte.  Taking that into account and the fact that the total allocation for the provision of these facilities is £10 million over four years, it is obvious that it will not go very far if we reduce the figure of 45 bedrooms further.  I am concerned that if we spread it too thinly we will get a lot of marginal type developments spread throughout the country and, therefore, it makes more sense to have good sized hotels with good facilities which will attract international visitors.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it would be better to have a fairer criterion instead of being concerned about the spread being too thin between hotels?  Will he also agree that <Col N="1807" /> it might be fairer to omit some hotels of 45 bedrooms or more and include other hotels with fewer bedrooms, particularly in the west and remote regions?  Will the Minister tell the House the number of hotels that have fewer than 45 bedrooms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10, 18 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport investment plans for the greater Dublin area have been submitted to my Department by CIE.  On the rail side, these plans provide for new commuter rail services between Clondalkin and the city centre and for the improvement of commuter rail services on the Dublin-Maynooth line.  Both projects <Col N="1809" /> have been formulated by CIE on the basis of the development of existing rail lines. The Clondalkin project, which it is estimated would cost about £27.3 million, would involve the construction of eight new stations and the provision of railcars. Feeder bus services would be provided linking Clondalkin railway station to Tallaght. A rail link to Tallaght is not included in these plans.</P>
    <P>The Maynooth line project, which involves the construction of four new stations, would cost about £0.7 million.  CIE have recently informed me that they are proceeding with the construction of the new stations on the Maynooth line and that they hope to have them open for traffic this summer.</P>
    <P>Both these rail projects have been submitted to Brussels for assistance from the EC Structural Funds in the context of the operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure.  The operational programme is under discussion at present with the EC authorities.  Further developments in relation to the Clondalkin project must await the outcome of the request for EC aid.  The application is being pursued urgently by my Department with Brussels.</P>
    <P>On the bus side, the investment plans prepared by CIE propose new services on a number of peripheral routes, local mini-bus services in certain suburbs and some city areas and limited stop services to the city on certain longer journeys. The local mini-bus, limited stop and peripheral route services are already in operation on a number of routes and these services will be expanded this year.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Dublin transportation task force in improving traffic management and introducing further measures in that regard will also continue to facilitate the provision of a more efficient and effective public transport system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that we do not need motorways through Dublin, particularly in places like the Liberties, and that, therefore, an upgraded public transport system is badly needed?  In view of what the Minister said <Col N="1810" /> about the construction of stations and railcars and that the Inchicore Works are on the verge of closure because of lack of work &mdash; the Minister is aware that CIE and a former IDA employee are jointly looking at the works &mdash; will he agree that the introduction of urban renewal type grants which would be available to the private sector and CIE or one of their subsidiaries would assist in getting a proper rapid public transport system on the ground in Dublin?</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that attacks on tourists in Dublin is causing great concern to those in the industry and to the national marketing and promotion body, Bord Fáilte.  I would say to the Minister that the only real basis on which this can be eliminated is by a greater presence of gardaí on the streets in Dublin.  I welcome the initiation of the opening of the complaints office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is likely to be a substantially greater loss in tourism revenue <Col N="1813" /> to the country as a result of a continuation of these attacks than there would be from providing an effective street policing system?  This is the vital question that the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Tourism and Transport have to give attention to.  These attacks have got widespread publicity on the Continent and that publicity will continue as long as the incidents continue.  I appeal to the Minister, in consultation with his colleague in the Department of Justice, to consider the presence of a substantially higher number of gardaí on the streets. That would be the one basis on which to defeat these thugs.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that such attacks can be very damaging to the industry.  The last thing we need is that kind of coverage around the world, that tourists are not safe.  This is the island of the welcomes and if tourists get any other impression it could have a very serious impact on our tourist industry. We have to be practical about this. The Garda know the areas of high tourist interest and they have already agreed to use plain clothes gardaí in so far as is possible in those areas.  The most effective way to proceed is to try to target the limited resources in these high tourist interest areas, using the gardaí in plain clothes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>A scheme for alert and co-ordination of emergency services, and other organisations in the event of an incident&mdash;accident involving dangerous substances, including ammonia, in transit by rail has been drawn up by a committee operating under the aegis of my Department. That committee are representative of relevant Government Departments and agencies and of certain manufacturers using dangerous substances.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is to provide a framework for the co-ordination of the actions of the various emergency services such as fire authorities, Garda, pollution control agencies and ambulance services responding to an incident or accident involving rail vehicles conveying dangerous substances or discharged vehicles or containers which had contained such substances.</P>
      <P>The scheme outlines how the various services are expected to fit into a combined operation to deal with an emergency. It provides for the identification of substances, raising the alarm and rendering the site of an incident safe.</P>
      <P>Exercises are held from time to time to test the operation of the scheme and the response to it.  The scheme is reviewed in the light of the experience gained from those exercises.  I am satisfied that the scheme is adequate to ensure that all necessary actions will be taken in the event of an incident or accident involving a train carrying dangerous substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anhydrous ammonia from Marino, Cork, to Arklow is carried by rail in specially designed tank containers constructed to stringent international specifications. It is considered that the <Col N="1815" /> possibility of tank containers being damaged or any of the chemical leaking in an incident or accident is very remote. Trains carrying anhydrous ammonia are subject to extra stringent operating procedures.  The Iarnród Éireann personnel involved have been given special training to deal with any incident or accident. The times of the trains are advised to the various emergency services along the relevant routes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the carriage of dangerous substances by rail generally, I can assure the House that every effort is made to eliminate to the greatest extent possible all potential risks of accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Do his Department carry out any inspections of trains carrying dangerous substances, specifically inspections of the particular train to which I referred in my question, and if so, how often are those inspections carried out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy an inspection schedule but I can tell him that these are specially designed tank containers and are constructed to very stringent international specifications. Iarnród Éireann continually inspect and review these containers to ensure that they are maintained to the stringent international specifications.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does take account of those rail crossings and I have dealt with that in previous Dáil questions.  The vast majority of those crossings have been visited by CIE personnel and the people have been advised on the risks and brought up to date on the usage of the crossings.  That is the most practical thing to do in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>While there may be a major accident plan in existence designed to co-ordinate the services and agencies in the event of a disaster I should like to know if the Minister is aware of concerns expressed by the fire fighters' union that there is no specific plan under which they receive training to deal with accidents on the railways involving trains conveying toxic chemicals.  Those fire fighters claim that they have not been given specific training to deal with toxic chemicals. They accept that they are part of an overall grander plan dealing with evacuation and the bringing in of emergency services. Will the Minister comment on that statement?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked me about the training of the fire service which is a separate matter.  Their special training deals with a whole range of activities.  In the course of my reply I <Col N="1817" /> stated that Iarnród Éireann personnel have been given special training.  I am satisfied that the fire services are well capable of handling any such accident but I will have to inquire as to whether they have specialised training to deal with the transport of chemicals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One could debate whether an independent body or the Department of Tourism and Transport should carry out such a study.  Such a study is being undertaken at departmental level.  As I indicated in my reply, special training is given, exercises are held from time to time, the services are co-ordinated and the equipment, which is specially designed, is kept up to stringent international specifications.  That is the most practical way to deal with this matter.  I am not convinced that a specialised agency would do any better but I will examine the suggestion put forward by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the availability of assistance under the operational programme for tourism for the development of certain sports related facilities for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in a written reply of 30 January 1990 some £40 million in Structural Fund assistance is being made available to both the private and the public sector for development under this heading. There is a wide range of tourist activities in the specialist markets such as golf, angling, sailing, walking, cycling, <Col N="1819" /> equestrian, field sports and cruising eligible for assistance which will cover both infrastructural works by public authorities, for example, inland waterways, and trails, and other works by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Full details on aid rates, eligibility and other criteria are set out at great length in the programme itself, copies of which I have already arranged to have made available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not outlined the terms and conditions under which individuals can apply for those grants.  I understand that the Minister of State responsible for sport, Deputy Fahey, had been given responsibility in the Minister's Department to deal with specific projects relating to tourism.  I am anxious to ascertain the criteria for the giving of such grants to districts such as Dún Laoghaire and Bray.  In large towns in order to attract tourists it is necessary to provide sporting facilities such as indoor ten pin bowling and so on.  It is important that families and tourists are able to use such facilities.  They should have a sporting content and be an attraction to tourists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Including indoor sports.  The bottom line is that the project will be looked at by Bord Fáilte and if it meets the major criteria of attracting tourists to Ireland it will be supported with Structural Funds via Bord Fáilte and the Department of Tourism and Transport. If, on the other hand, the facility is <Col N="1820" /> mainly for local use it will not qualify.  I should like to say that there are five or six projects for every one that we have sufficient funds to support.  Therefore, it is important that Bord Fáilte select the projects that meet definite criteria.</P>

The company are having talks with Aeroflot with a view to increasing the business arrangements currently existing between the two airlines, including the <Col N="1821" /> possibility of establishing a joint venture airline.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The issues involved have to do with routes.  For example, Aeroflot, have a very strong dominance in going eastward from the Soviet Union to South East Asia, Japan and that side of the world.  Aer Lingus have increasingly strong links, and are trying to develop them day by day, with the western side, the United States and that side of the world.  There is great potential to try to develop both of those route networks.  One could do that by using the Moscow type route.  The over Moscow route to the Far East is a very attractive one.  There are certain synergies there that would make it attractive for both airlines to talk about having some kind of joint venture.  The issues the Deputy talks about have to do with routes, how they might be financed, what type of competition is envisaged, what kind of trends are in the aviation world, whether they are going for larger airlines or more niche type airlines and so on.  All those issues have to be thrashed out.  I should also say that Aer Lingus, at my request, are continually talking to other international airline companies.  They must keep up with the game in regard to international linkages.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I welcome the outgoing approach by Aer Lingus in relation to establishing linkages with other airlines whether it be Aeroflot or any other European airline.  At what point does the Minister expect a decision will be made given the complexity of the issues and the short time scale involved between now and the end of 1992 and the importance for Aer Lingus, despite their size, in relation to <Col N="1822" /> the Irish market and their tiny size in relation to the European market?  How can Aer Lingus be assisted in developing these linkages, whether it is with Aeroflot or any other airline to ensure their viability?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>At Government level I try to be of assistance by having discussions with other transport and aviation Ministers and the officials of my Department have discussions with other Departments. Generally we support the efforts of Aer Lingus in seeking to make fresh linkages.  I do not think the 1992 deadline should be sacrosanct because that would only set a deadline for Aer Lingus that may not make commercial sense for them.  It is better for them to proceed as they are handling it now, that is to talk to a number of airlines, look at projects as they are proposed, look at joint ventures on the basis of common sense and then to proceed with them when they are happy that they make sense for Aer Lingus.  That is a better approach rather than setting a deadline which could only push them into something they might not wish to go ahead with.</P>

      <P>I am in the course of completing my consideration of all the issues associated with the update and replacement of the Road Transport Act, 1932, including liberalisation of bus passenger transport services.  I hope to have the Bill published and circulated as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to road haulage, the Road Transport Act, 1986, finalised the liberalisation process governing access to the market.  Road freight carrier's licences, unrestricted as to area of operation, types of goods carried and number of vehicles operated are freely available to all applicants who satisfy the requirements of good repute, appropriate financial standing and professional competence, laid down by the EC for access to the profession of road haulage operator.</P>

Is he aware that 125,000 units are carried northwards each year by <Col N="1824" /> northern carriers at a loss estimated, on the basis of the most recent estimates, to the Exchequer of £56 million per year? Is he aware, therefore, that under the proposed changes in the cabotage rules we could be left without a freight industry in the Republic if he does not act soon on this matter?  Therefore, I impress on him the need to publish the legislation before Easter.</P>

There is substantial freedom of movement with freight.  I aim to publish the Bill by summer but as I have already said at a number of public functions I held back the publication of the Bill because I want to inject a greater degree of liberalisation and a greater degree of competition into the bus business in the State.</P>

When they put <Col N="1825" /> their mind to competing they are exceptionally good at it.  The costs are gradually being reduced.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties being caused to Ireland's exports by road to the United Kingdom arising from the failure of the United Kingdom to provide a good road link between port of entry for most of Ireland's exports by road to the United Kingdom motorway network, as strongly recommended by the EC road infrastructure requirements; if he will use his position in the course of his Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers to ensure that this position is remedied; the steps he has taken in this regard; the steps he proposes to take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Freight traffic between Irish and UK ports is fairly evenly divided between Liverpool, Holyhead and the Southern ports of Fishguard and Pembroke on the UK side.  However, the main difficulties experienced by exporters relate to the A5-A55 road linking Holyhead and the UK motorway network at Chester.  While the Deputy will appreciate that the matter is not my direct responsibility, I understand that about 55 miles of the 75 mile route is now up to dual carriageway standard.  Work is already under way or planned on an additional ten miles.  Last December, the former UK Secretary of State for Wales announced that plans were being developed to convert the whole of the remaining ten miles of the route from Holyhead across the island of Anglesey to dual carriageway standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader front, the National Development Plan, 1989 to 1993, confirmed the Government's intention to improve Ireland's access links to Britain and the Continent in the interests of our overall competitiveness.  I advised the House in response to a Parliamentary Question on 1 February last of details of a major consultancy project which has <Col N="1826" /> recently been commissioned by my Department to examine, <i>inter alia</i>, the feasibility of investment in improved sea and air freight services between Ireland and other EC countries.  This study, which is expected to be completed in about two months, will also consider the adequacy of existing infrastructure in and around major ports of destination for Irish exports.  Recommendations arising from the feasibility study will be given careful consideration with a view to appropriate action being taken to improve Ireland's trading access to Britain and the Continent.  I know that the European Commission is favourably disposed towards Ireland's position, and I will approach the Commission in any case where it is necessary to impress upon the UK Government the need to facilitate trade to and from Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the lack of adequate road transport links for our exporters to the UK, particularly in Wales, is not in accordance with the overall scheme of road transport infrastructure and that this was commented on in a report of the European Court of Auditors?  Does the Minister not agree that this puts Irish exporters of goods to Britain at a serious disadvantage?  Has the Minister made representations to the British authorities about this matter either in his capacity as Minister or in his special position in the EC Presidency? What representations has the Minister made, when did he make them and what representations does he propose to make now so that we can compete with our exports to Britain on a fair and proper basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to discuss the matter again with the UK representatives. The Deputy is correct in what he is saying to the extent that the main artery from Holyhead to London and on to the Tunnel is critical for Irish exports.  This route is as important to this country, if not more important, than many of our roads because of its linkage to the Tunnel.  The British Government and the British authorities know full well of our <Col N="1827" /> very deep interest in developing this route.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply, 55 miles of the 75 mile route, which is the critical stage, is now a dual carriageway and I understand that the rest of the route is to be upgraded.  Work has already started on an additional ten miles of the route.  Our only role in this matter is to make sure that the British Government know our position, encourage them and be as helpful as we possibly can &mdash; we are as helpful as we possibly can be whenever we are asked &mdash; without unnecessarily interfering. We are also as helpful as we possibly can be at Brussels level in supporting any British requests which may be made in regard to the road.  Therefore, it is a daily battle.</P>

      <P>The tenor of the Minister's response is unsatisfactory and he is being more submissive perhaps to the British position than he might be.  Would the Minister not agree that it is not just a matter of assuming that our position on this issue is known to the British but is instead a matter of pointing out forcibly and, if necessary, aggressively to the British that as Europeans and members of the EC Community, which is supposed to have free access of goods back and forth and in and out of countries, they are obliged by EC transport requirements to complete this link and that we demand and require them to do so?  Will the Minister take up this matter with the British Government in a forceful manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should move in advance of the Joint Aviation Authority's decision in the matter. This is a very technical matter in which substantial costs and, of course, very important safety ramifications are involved.  The important thing now is to get the decision of the Joint Aviation Authority, which is made up of 14 states acting together.  We need to hear from them before we make any move.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said but what we are talking about here is an increase of only an extra six inches which will increase the existing standard aperture opening from 24 inches to at least 30 inches.  It has been proven that vital extra seconds can be gained in an emergency evacuation of a plane if this is done.  I reject the Minister's observation that there would be tremendous structural problems involved in this exercise.</P>

      <P>I am not technically minded but I gather that changing any aircraft by even an inch could be quite a technical challenge particularly if it has to be done to existing aeroplanes.  When safety considerations are involved there is an established procedure whereby 14 states come together in the Joint Aviation Authority to set new standards for aircraft manufacture and decide on technical matters.  It will certainly be safer for us if we do not rush ahead until we hear from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the tourism development measures proposed in the National Development Plan submitted to Brussels in March 1989.  These measures which were subsequently agreed, in principle, with the EC in the Community Support Framework have now been set out in detail in the Tourism Operational Programme.  I have already provided, in a written reply dated 30 January 1990, a detailed outline of the workings of this Operational Programme, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The programme provides for assistance for tourism under three sub-programmes. One of these &mdash; SubProgramme 1 &mdash; includes provision for assisting local authorities to carry out certain strategically important tourism works in their area.</P>
      <P>Maximum assistance will be at a rate of 75 per cent of total eligible expenditure and the available budgets and eligibility criteria are spelt out in great detail in Chapter 5 of the Operational Programme, pages 40-43, and in the Scheme at Appendix IV.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that local authorities are in an ideal position to identify projects, particularly in the tourism field which would not be attractive to private enterprise?  In the Dublin city area, tourism prospects exist in respect of Viking Dublin, for example, the city walls and the finds from the Wood <Col N="1831" /> Quay site.  The city council will be aware of this, but because local authorities nationally are so strapped for funds, they are incapable of even seeing themselves playing a serious rôle.  Would the Minister not agree then that the Government could make a special fund available to permit local councils nationwide to present plans for the development of tourism in their area?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that local authorities are in a good position to develop tourists projects and they are doing that.  Subprogramme 1 has £51 million available to assist tourism developments by public bodies or local authority type bodies.  That £51 million is broken down into £28 million allocated to the Office of Public Works, so that they can carry out a major revamp of a number of important cultural and heritage attractions and inland waterways, and £23 million which is being administered by Bord Fáilte and SFADCo for tourism works carried out by local authorities, regional tourism organisations, fishery boards and other State and semi-State bodies.  We are at one in this.  There is substantial scope within those allocations for local authorities to put forward projects.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the European Court of Auditors have stated in their recent annual report that their inquiry showed no demonstrable link between the receipt of EC funds and higher spending on transport infrastructure in Ireland; whether he accepts these findings; and if he is adopting any measures to deal with the situation in light of these allegations.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that control over the particular EC transport infrastructure funds dealt with in the EC Court of Auditors report to which the Deputy has referred has been exercised <Col N="1832" /> by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, who have both answered similar questions from the Deputy in recent weeks.  As regards transport infrastructure grants, successive Transport Councils of Ministers have considered proposals for a definitive transport infrastructure fund together with a multi-annual programme of measures for assistance, but to date the Council has not reached agreement on these proposals.  Instead, since 1982 special infrastructure grants totalling approximately £300 million have been allocated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from the Community budget towards road and rail projects on the European networks. Ireland has received about £13.7 million for six projects on the Euroroute 01 which runs from Rosslare to Belfast.</P>
      <P>Regarding the manner in which these grants are controlled, the situation is that the public capital programme is determined each year taking account of the amounts likely to be received from the European Regional Development Fund and also the separate transport infrastructure grants.  In the absence of these amounts, the total of the public capital programme would have to be reduced correspondingly.  The EC aid received, therefore, is retained on a recoupment basis, by the Exchequer, for that which has been made available through the public capital programme.  The Minister for Finance explained this procedure on his recent response to a question from the Deputy and pointed out that the observations of the European Court of Auditors did not take this procedure into account.  He did not agree that the link between the Community aid and the particular projects aided was not evident and he said he did not propose to change the procedures.</P>

In other words, there is a planned shortfall of £116 million based on 1989 contributions. Is it not a fact that as EC contributions go up our own contribution is going down, and that the observation of the EC Court of Auditors is correct in relation to Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  The Deputy is confusing two things.  The Court of Auditors are talking about a reasonably technical mechanism.  The £13.7 million we received from the Community came, in the first instance, from the Department of Finance and a similar amount was then expended by the Department of the Environment on the Rosslare to Belfast Euroroute.  In other countries it does not work like that.  In other countries there is, perhaps, more transparency about the matter, but we are not trying to hide anything here.  The funds we take from the Community come from Finance and similar figures subsequently surface in the Department carrying out the expenditure, in this case, the Environment.  It is our view that the auditors failed to understand that particular procedure.</P>

It is not sufficient that he should hide behind an absent Minister to hide his inability to answer simple factual questions.  It is a disgrace that he is unable to answer this question.  Would the Minister not agree that it is a very grave matter in view of the extent to which this country depends on EC funds, if we are found by the supreme body concerned with the proper expenditure of EC money, namely the EC Court of Auditors, to be in breach of EC rules?

      <P>I think the Deputy is greatly exaggerating the situation.  He knows full well, as a former Finance Minister, that these matters are dealt with very efficiently by senior officials in the Department of Finance and their counterparts in the Commission.  There are regular discussions about all these matters between those Departments.  I am not hiding behind the Minister for Finance.  I am simply leaving to the Minsiter for Finance his statutory responsibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not been found to be in breach.  The European Court of Auditors have commented that they could not find a demonstrable link between the funds and the spending on transport infrastructure. That is not the same thing as breaching Community rules.  I want to reject completely the Deputy's suggestion, hidden in his comments, that there is anything to hide here.  There is nothing <Col N="1835" /> to hide.  The funds in the Irish circumstances come to the Department of Finance and are subsequently expended by the sponsoring Department.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the EC treaties, to which Ireland is party, established the European Court of Auditors as the proper auditing body of EC funds and that they have commented adversely against Ireland regarding the lack of linkage shown between moneys given for specific projects and their use for those projects? Would the Minister not agree that the EC Court of Auditors and the EC are entitled to require, and do require, that funds allocated by them for a specific project should be used specifically for that project and that what the State has been doing is putting all these funds into a hotch-potch operation and has not shown that the money was specifically spent on the project for which it was sought and given?</P>

      <P>The Deputy and Deputy Bruton have been extraordinarily selective in their quotations from the report.  Let me draw their attention to a comment in the report which says &ldquo;this does not mean that projects approved by the Council for financial support have not been implemented&rdquo;.  Let me also draw their attention to the part of the report which says &ldquo;the Court found that in the case of Germany, Ireland and the UK, there was no demonstrable link&rdquo;.  Having said there was no demonstrable link, they then went on to point out that that did not mean the projects were not properly implemented.  It was simply a comment by the Court of Auditors that these three countries, Ireland particularly, have a <Col N="1836" /> separate procedure, and I have no doubt that the Department of Finance will in their ongoing discussions with the Court of Auditors seek to satisfy the Court of Auditors about these procedures.</P>

      <P>The attraction of major sporting events to Ireland is an important element of our tourism strategy and where suitable facilities are available Ireland has been successful in attracting a range of world class sporting events.  We are not in a position to bid for the European Cup, World Cup or Olympics as we do not, as yet, have adequate facilities.</P>
      <P>We are, however, aggressively marketing Ireland as a location for sporting events.  In 1990 for example a number of world championships yachting and sailing events will take place in Ireland together with the Boxing World Cup while in 1991 the Walker Cup will be held in Portmarnock Golf Club.  Strenuous efforts are currently being made to attract the Ryder Cup to Ireland for 1993 and the Hockey World Cup in 1994.</P>
      <P>In addition events in motorsport, showjumping, golf and horse racing are being actively pursued.  Such events will generate significant tourist traffic and give worldwide TV and media exposure to Ireland.  Other promotions such as corporate sports events and incentive events are also being developed.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that visitors coming here <Col N="1840" /> on shooting holidays every year contribute over £3 million annually to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>They represent one of the more lucrative segments of the international tourism market and have been identified as a category with further potential for growth.  I do, of course, recognise the need for protection and conservation of bird species. I am assured by the Wildlife Service that the situation is closely and regularly monitored by them and that if the Wildlife Service decide that a species is endangered by sporting activity they will use their powers under the 1976 Act to restrict shooting either to certain areas or to remove a species from the open season list altogether.</P>

I resent entirely the manner in which I have been dealt with by the Chair in relation to this issue.</P>

    <Title>Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, 1989: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) old age,&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I had begun to give the <Col N="1865" /> very good and valid reasons that the Minister should not object to accepting my amendment.  We accept that the Bill is good and is absolutely necessary at this time.  In section 1 the term &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; means a person who requires assistance with the activities of daily living, such as dressing, eating, walking, washing and bathing by reason of physical informity or physical injury, defect or disease or mental infirmity.  I am asking that &ldquo;old age&rdquo; be included.</P>
      <P>As I had begun to say before the debate was adjourned, many people who go into old persons or retirement homes may not necessarily have any physical or mental infirmity but may decide that it is in their best interests to go into such a home.  A person who is living alone may feel that the safety and security offered by a residential home is preferable to remaining alone in a flat or in an isolated farmhouse, especially if they have no family living with them.  They may simply want to do so for comfort and convenience, but nevertheless they are vulnerable to exploitation and merit the same protection and high standards that the Bill seeks to set for persons who have a physical or mental infirmity.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister gave us some statistics which I think should now help to convince him to accept my amendment.  He said that the population projections reinforce the need to define the responsibilities of health boards and nursing homes.  The census reveals that 382,000 people are over 65 years, of which 143,000 are over 75 years of age.  The latest projections suggest that the number of elderly will increase slowly up to the year 2000 and rapidly after that, and by the year 2011 we will have a population of 414,000 elderly people. The need for accommodation for old people is going to arise in that time and that is a good reason that the Minister should have no problem accepting my amendment to include &ldquo;old age&rdquo; in section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of August 1988 <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> carried a report of how an 81 year old woman lay dead or dying for three days in a self-contained flat in a <Col N="1866" /> residential home for elderly people run by an order of nuns in Dublin.  At present that home would not be subject to the terms of the Bill.  That is another example I give to convince the Minister of the importance of the amendment I proposed.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. We need not spend an undue amount of time on it, but it would add to the definition of dependent person if the conditions of frailty or delicateness were included and those who may not necessarily have a disease or who are not necessarily disabled, should receive the benefits and protection conferred by this Bill.  I support the amendment because it would not, by definition, include all old people but just those who are elderly and require assistance with all the activities named in section 1.  Unless there is some difficulty with the interpretation that old age does not mean people over 65 years, I can certainly envisage circumstances where there are some frail, delicate people who would be excluded under the present definition, although in every practical sense they would be dependent persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I listened carefully to the points made, I do not think it necessary to amend section 1.  The definition of a dependent person is not related to old age.  A dependent person is somebody who needs care in the activities of daily living whatever their age.  The definition of a dependent person already includes elderly people but it also covers younger people so that anyone who is dependent either temporarily or for a longer period will have access to a high standard of care in a nursing home.  Looking at section 1 and the definition of dependent person I believe the cases mentioned by Deputy Sherlock would be included in the definition of dependent person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment. The Minister seems to accept the reasoning behind it but feels it is <Col N="1867" /> unnecessary because it appears the category is already covered within the present framework. The case has been made by my two colleagues that there might be a category of elderly people who are not in any way infirm and might be outside the scope of the Bill.  It would copperfasten the issue if the amendment were accepted.  We could reach agreement on this issue.  It would be a good start to the debate if the Minister accepted the amendment to put the issue beyond doubt so that all the people who find themselves in need of shelter in a home would have the protections envisaged under this Bill.  The Minister has already accepted the principle of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to look at the amendment before Report Stage but I am not prepared to accept it today. There is in classification a move away from terminology like &ldquo;old age&rdquo;.  I should like to look at it in that context.  We will see if there are areas not covered which should be covered and come back on Report Stage if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that commitment.  This is more than an academic exercise.  Section 7 deals with subventions which are linked strictly to the definition of dependent person. There could be a person who, because of social circumstances, could not be minded but did not require hospital care because the person was not physically or mentally infirm.  Such a person would require a place in a nursing home.  Under Section 7 (1) some health board could decide to preclude such people from the subvention towards the cost of a nursing home.  The point is validly made.  We would welcome a definition dealing with that type of elderly person who does not suffer from a disablement or disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to make precisely the same point as Deputy Yates.  The fact that the definition of dependent person can relate to somebody <Col N="1868" /> under 65 years of age does not cover the kind of case envisaged by Deputy Sherlock's amendment.  I am not sure what the Minister means in saying he will have a look at it before Report Stage.  The category of senior citizen which Deputy Yates envisaged is growing because of recent trends and developments in the health services.  I rise only because I have been subjected to specific representations from precisely the kind of person who does not have the social support which is omitted in this Bill.</P>
      <P>A number of senior citizens have been decanted from psychiatric hospitals in recent years.  They were not psycho-geriatric patients in the first place.  The tradition whereby geriatric patients or senior citizens ended up in psychiatric institutions is a major issue which need not detain us here.  All of our psychiatric institutions housed quite a number of such people who have been institutionalised over the years and who, because of new trends in psychiatric medicine and new arrangements planned, have gradually lost their places in psychiatric hospitals.  Many of those people fall into the category envisaged by Deputy Sherlock's amendment.  My disposition would be to press this matter because if the Minister's commitment is not more than to glance over the matter before Report Stage it does not meet the situation envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary for the Deputy to anticipate my commitment. My commitment is to look at it in the context of the very reasonable points made by Deputies Sherlock and Yates to see if it is necessary to have this provision inserted in the Bill.  Regarding Deputy Rabbitte's point about patients who were in psychiatric hospitals, I do not think there would be any difficulty in the circumstances he outlined in having them included under dependency, in view of their previous history of mental infirmity.  That is the case he appeared to be making.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to consider this in a reasonable light.  I am not sure we should be encouraging people who are just elderly to go into nursing homes. There are other ways in which the health boards could support them.  The Bill provides that a dependent person is a person who requires assistance with activities of daily living and goes on to give examples.  It refers to physical infirmity, injury, defect or disease or mental infirmity.  The health board can support people through boarding out in the case of people such as those mentioned by Deputy Sherlock who may be elderly and afraid to live on their own. Local authorities provide old persons' dwellings and sheltered housing.  The health boards might also be able to provide greater support at home.</P>
      <P>I intend to look very seriously at the matter to see if there is a need for this provision in the Bill.  If there is need I will come back with an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was more encouraged by the Minister's original comments than by his second set of comments.  He seemed at first to accept the principle that it is important to ensure that anybody who finds himself in a nursing home should be covered by the protections of this legislation, particularly the financial implications of section 7.  Now the Minister is saying that it might be an encouragement to people to go in and he is saying that it might be proper to exclude some people from the provisions of the Act.  There is a worrying new thrust in the second set of comments by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that there are other options open to the health boards and local authorities such as the provision of special housing for old people, sheltered accommodation and boarding out.  It is envisaged that if a person chooses to avail of a nursing home and it is suitable for that person's circumstances, he or she should be afforded the protections of the Act and should be able to avail of the financial assistance given to dependent persons.  The Minister indicated in his latter comments that he might wish to <Col N="1870" /> exclude some people from these provisions because they might be encouraged to get into a nursing home.  People should have that option, with the financial help and protections envisaged in this legislation. I am quite worried by the Minister's departure in his most recent comments.  I hope he will clarify that he does not intend or wish to exclude anybody from the financial assistance envisaged in the Bill if a nursing home is a suitable place for a person and that person chooses to be there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to want to completely disregard old age.  We know of the growth of institutions and homes over the last few years, they are nursing homes in everything but name, and the people in them may not be suffering from illness or disability but they are there because of inability to look after themselves.  We seek to have this sort of person included in the Bill.  Deputy Yates is right in his interpretation because section 7 says that if, following the assessment of a dependent person and of his means and circumstances, the health board are of the opinion that the person is in need of maintenance in a nursing home and is unable to pay any or part of its costs, they may, if the person enters or is in a nursing home, pay to the home such amount as they consider appropriate.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is also specific.  It defines &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo; as one with a physical infirmity or a physical injury, defect or disease or mental infirmity.  Old age need not fit into any of these categories and would be denied a subvention.  The Minister agreed to look at this on Report Stage but I do not see why he cannot accept the amendment because it merely gives the category of old age recognition under a very important Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on the amendment.  My concern is that we are trying to get away from the terminology of old age, and that is accepted internationally.  The definition in the Bill does not exclude older persons and certainly any person in a nursing home is <Col N="1871" /> entitled to its protection.  I intend to look at the section to see if it is necessary to include &ldquo;old age&rdquo; in the Bill.  However, it may not be necessary to include the phrase because the category of people to whom Deputy Sherlock refers may already be covered by the terminology in section 1 of the Bill.  I am prepared to look at it and to come back to the House on Report Stage if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister has had an opportunity to consider this matter.  This Bill offers the opportunity to do something for senior citizens who find themselves in a category which does not necessarily come under the definition of &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo;, in other words, senior citizens who are not, within the meaning of the old legislation, incapacitated in that sense but who are, nonetheless, dependent on the nursing home as their only home and who do not have the social support necessary to retain them at home.</P>
      <P>When the Minister says we should not be encouraging people to go into nursing homes I feel that he really is saying that as there is already such a demand in this area with which we cannot cope, the last thing we want to do is to broaden the area of eligibility for subvention.  There is a crisis at present and as long ago as 1985 an article appeared in association with an advertisement taken out by the Irish Private Nursing Home Owners' Association which referred to the fact that at that time there were 1,200 geriatric patients or &mdash; less clinically stated &mdash; old people in private nursing homes in the Eastern Health Board area alone. Having regard to the demographic trends and assuming that after its enactment this legislation will stay in place for some time, that demand will grow.  That is more than the entire patient intake of St. James's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital put together; put it into context, that is the kind of demand that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good number of those people would not qualify under the definition in the Bill.  The demand is growing and there is <Col N="1872" /> chronic pressure on the system.  Representations on behalf of senior citizens who could not be described as incapacitated or dependent in the meaning of the Bill are in need of care because the social support is not there.  They are not looked after in this Bill.  We are talking about a situation in any event where most of the provision for senior citizens in this definition are catered for in the private sector.  It is effectively the privatisation of an entire area of medical care and the least we can do is to make them eligible for the subvention envisaged under section 7.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a very important issue.  I have no difficulty with the Minister coming up with a term other than the bald one proposed in Deputy Sherlock's amendment of &ldquo;old age&rdquo;.  If he can come up with a synonymous description which takes on board the thrust of what all the Deputies who spoke intend, that is fine. If there is an objection to the use of the term &ldquo;old age&rdquo; that is not a problem. However, I fear that the Minister will come back on Report Stage to say that he has examined the matter and he is quite satisfied with the definition of &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; because it takes into account all the categories.</P>
    <P>I did not say the people who had been decanted from psychiatric institutions were all, by definition, suffering from mental infirmity.  I do not particularly want to go into the social scandal of why some people ended up in psychiatric institutions in the past who were not psycho-geriatric patients.  However some people left psychiatric institutions in recent years and it is generally and privately accepted by expert medical opinion that they were not mentally infirm.  The Minister is talking as if we had a large network of community services in place, that all the services necessary to provide the backup to which he referred were already in place and that, therefore, we need not worry.  He said there was a choice but that is not the case.  I hope the Minister is embarking on a course to make a choice available as there has been little enough progress in the implementation of planning for the future and so on.  I should <Col N="1873" /> like to hear the Minister elaborate on this because, as Deputy Howlin said, I am less happy about his second intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's contribution was very interesting because he seems to be suggesting that many people will find their way into nursing homes just as a place to live, that there is nothing wrong with them and that they do not need any help with their daily living as they are able to look after themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people to whom Deputy Rabbitte referred are not in that category they are dependent on some support for their daily living.  They cannot be excluded from that category.  It is a very interesting point because we should be defining the kind of people who should be cared for in our nursing homes.  Do we want a situation where people just go into a nursing home to live because of age and that they need no support whatever? I do not envisage that people do that because nursing homes are not the type of location in which you would expect to find somebody who is fully competent to look after themselves.  If they are fully competent to look after themselves and need no support whatsoever you will not find many of them in nursing homes.  This raises the issue of defining the kind of people who are cared for by nursing homes.  As I have said, while I am satisfied at present that the term, dependent person, caters for the people Deputy Rabbitte has talked about, in the light of some of the comments that were made earlier, particularly by Deputy Sherlock, I would be very glad to look at the section and see if it is necessary to include &ldquo;old age&rdquo; or some similar wording to ensure that the section does what everyone in this House wants it to do, that is, that everybody who finds their way into a nursing home is covered by this Bill.</P>

    <Col N="1874" />
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are lectured occasionally by the media and have been lectured by former Ministers on how important legislating is.  I am trying to make a serious point and I am very sorry the Minister, for the third time, has chosen to distort what I am saying.  To try to suggest that I am making an argument for the inclusion of anybody who walks in off the street, as the Minister put it, to go to live in a nursing home, is arrant nonsense.  With respect, I never said that.  I am referring to the actual definition which reads as follows: &ldquo;`dependent person' means a person who requires assistance with the activities of daily living such as dressing, eating, walking, washing and bathing&rdquo;.  If the matter stood at that it would cover the kind of category of people to which I am referring but of course it does not cover this category.  It says: &ldquo;by reason of&rdquo; two things: first, physical infirmity or physical injury and, secondly, mental infirmity.</P>
      <P>I know many of my constituents &mdash; and I am quite sure the same is the case in Cavan-Monaghan &mdash; who have difficulty with the activities of daily living, who require assistance in one or other or all of the activities referred to such as dressing, eating, walking, washing or bathing, but not because they have any physical or mental infirmity.  These are merely people who are old or frail, whose families have rejected them or whose families do not want to know.  When they are discharged early from St. James's Hospital or wherever the families simply do not want to take them in and they have to find some alternative shelter.  If that means living in a nursing home so be it but nobody in their right mind, either on the street or in here, would suggest that people will be seeking to leave, say, good bungalows, and look for accommodation in expensive nursing homes in south Dublin, from which people are making enormous money because of the State's failure to provide this kind of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to address this point seriously.  Since he first indicated to Deputy Sherlock that he was prepared to take the thrust of it on board he has back-wheeled.  For a great number of old <Col N="1875" /> people, it is a great fear at the end of their lives that they are going to be left without care.  These people may not have a physical or mental infirmity but find it difficult to get up every day and get on with the business of living.  Either they have no family to look after them or their families do not want to know.  That situation is not catered for in this Bill and all I am doing is making a serious plea to the Minister to take on board the thrust of what we are saying.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the House that we have applied ourselves to this amendment to the point where anything worthwhile has been said.  I hope, on this occasion, to be helpful. There is an amendment down in the name of Deputy Sherlock and the Minister has indicated that if what Deputy Sherlock seeks to satisfy is not already provided for he will have a look at it and deal with it on Report Stage.  Deputy Sherlock appreciates that if he puts his amendment now and if it is defeated he will not have the opportunity of putting it again on Report Stage.  I make those comments and ask the House what it wishes me to do.</P>

      <P>Listening to the last comment from Deputy Rabbitte I believe it is even more necessary to look at this matter before accepting the amendment. It is not alone the wording &ldquo;old age&rdquo; that we are concerned with but also the question of physical infirmity.  It appears, if people are frail and have difficulty raising themselves up, going up the stairs or whatever, that that of itself is physical infirmity.  Physical infirmity does not have to be a certifiable disease.  People in the category which Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, people who might need help dressing, eating, walking or washing, are covered.  The very fact that they need <Col N="1876" /> help may well be because of physical or mental infirmity.  This needs to be looked at and certainly if the terminology &ldquo;old age&rdquo; or some similar terminology is necessary, as I have said, I have an open mind on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <P>I would give as an example a person who applies for free telephone rental.  The condition in that case is that a person must be living alone or with a person who is disabled or infirm. In the assessment that is made generally the cases are lost because the person is not deemed so infirm as to be able to do something.  That is what will happen if there is not built into this legislation a provision to cater specifically for it and that is the reason I am pressing the amendment.</P>

In view of the fact that this definition is included in the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964 &mdash; the interpretation section refers to old age, physical infirmity or physical injury and mental infirmity or mental handicap &mdash; why has the Minister not seen fit to bring it forward into this up-dated legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on what the Minister has said, there is a willingness to introduce some flexibility.  The point has been made by Deputies Sherlock and Rabbitte that in a bureaucratic interpretation by a health board in giving effect to this legislation, people who would be deserving of care and attention could be outside that category because of the tail-on to the wording at present. Perhaps the Minister would be prepared to consider that interpretation.  At present there are many old folk we would like to see taken into care but because of lack of space there is a problem.  I know the Minister is conscious of this and is endeavouring to address it.  Perhaps he <Col N="1877" /> would find somewhere between home care and institutional care.  If the Minister is prepared to introduce some flexibility on Report Stage, I would ask Deputy Sherlock not to press the amendment at this stage.  We could then get an agreeable formula on Report Stage which would satisfy the concerns we all have on this matter.</P>

      <P>I have given an intimation of the litany that follows but I should like to repeat it so that there will be no misunderstanding as we move along.  We now move to amendment No. 2 in the name of the Minister. Amendments Nos. 2, 5, 20, 26, 28, 30, 55, 59, 60, 61, 63 and 83 and the proposal to delete section 8 form a composite proposal. Amendments Nos. 21 to 25, inclusive and No. 27 are alternatives to amendment No. 20 and amendment No. 26 respectively.  Amendments Nos. 53 and No. 54 are alternatives to the proposal to delete section 8.  Amendments Nos. 2, 5, 20 to 28, inclusive, 30, 53, 54, 55, 59, 60, 61, 63, 83 and the proposal to delete section 8 will be taken together for the purpose of discussion.  I should like to remind the House that they will all be discussed in an omnibus fashion but that in respect of any one amendment the proposer may ask that a question be put. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1), lines 22 to <Col N="1878" /> 24, to delete the definition of &ldquo;licence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This group of amendments is a response to the wishes of Members as expressed during Second Stage.  I wish to set out the composite proposal on the main amendment I am proposing to the Bill which is the registration rather than the licensing of nursing homes.  The main changes are to section 4 of the Bill, amendment 26, and there are several consequential changes as a result.  In all I will be dealing with 12 amendments together.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 4 replaces the system of licensing nursing homes with a system of registration.  Several Deputies indicated during Second Stage that registration would be more appropriate for nursing homes than licensing. This point was also made by the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association.</P>
    <P>The procedure for registration will be similar to that for licensing.  Each health board will maintain a register of nursing homes.  Subsection (1) replaces section 8 in the original Bill which provided for the keeping of a register.  A person proposing to carry on a nursing home must apply to the health board to be registered.  Registration will be valid for two years.  Before granting registration, the health board must satisfy themselves that the registered proprietor and person in charge are fit persons to carry on a nursing home and that the home meets the standards laid down in regulations under this Bill. A health board will be able to revoke the registration or to attach conditions, subsection 8.  The board will issue a certificate of registration and any conditions must be stated on the certificate.  One addition is subsection (6) (b) (iv) which provides that where a condition of the registration has been contravened in the previous year a health board could cite this as a reason for refusing registration. The purpose of this new subsection is to provide an incentive for nursing home owners to comply with and fulfil conditions of a registration within a reasonable period.  Applications for the renewal of registration must be made two months before its expiry and if at the end of that <Col N="1879" /> time a board have not notified the person of their refusal to register the home, registration will be granted automatically for a further two years.</P>
    <P>An issue raised by a number of Deputies, and a matter which greatly concerned the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association, was the transfer of homes and the problems which could be caused if prospective owners could not be sure before purchase that health boards would accept them as registered proprietors.  Section 4 (4) specifically deals with these concerns. This subsection provides for a person who proposes to take over as the registered proprietor of a nursing home which is already registered to apply in advance for a declaration from the health board.  The declaration will state that the health board consider that the person is a suitable person to carry on a nursing home.</P>
    <P>On the actual transfer the registration will lapse and the new registered proprietor will have to apply for registration but there should be no difficulty with this application as the board will have agreed in advance that they have no objection to that person becoming a registered proprietor. A declaration may only be refused if a person has been convicted of an offence under the Bill, the 1964 Act or any other offence so as to render the person unfit to carry on a nursing home or if the applicant has refused to supply information or supplied misleading information. The grounds for refusal are restrictive.  The new person cannot be registered in advance as there can only be one registered proprietor of a nursing home at a time.</P>
    <P>A fee will be payable in respect of the declaration.  The purpose of the fee is to discourage anyone who is not really intending to become the registered proprietor from applying for advance clearance. The amount of the declaration fee will be prescribed under section 9 and I intend that any subsequent registration fee be reduced by the amount of the declaration fee.</P>
    <P>Subsection 14 obliges a health board in notifying a person of a decision not to grant a declaration to inform him or her <Col N="1880" /> of the right to make representations to the board within 21 days or to appeal to the District Court within the same period.  The same applies to decisions concerning registration.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that on transfer the registration lapses and the person who proposes to become the registered proprietor must apply for registration within two weeks.  These provisions are intended to cover the situation where a registered proprietor dies and someone else assumes responsibility for the home.</P>
    <P>An issue which concerned Deputies, and the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association, was the health boards' power to refuse registration on the basis of previous offences committed by the person applying to be the registered proprietor.</P>
    <P>In the original Bill, section 4 (3) (a) (ii), allowed a health board to refuse or revoke a licence if the person had committed an offence &ldquo;under this Act, the 1964 Act or an offence that, in the opinion of the board, would render a person unfit or unsuitable to carry on a nursing home&rdquo;.  The section gave a health board a wide discretion in relation to offences.  Taking on board the concerns expressed, the section, now subsection 6 (b) (ii), has been redrafted and the words, &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo;, and, &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo;, deleted to clarify the need for a health board to act on an objective basis in determining whether a person is or is not unfit to run a nursing home.</P>
    <P>The consequential changes arising from the system of registration are amendment 2, deleting the definition of a licence and amendment 5, defining what is meant by the register and the registered proprietor.  The definition of register states the meaning of this word throughout the Bill and likewise in respect of registered proprietor.  A register of all registered nursing homes will be established in each health board area. The name of the registered proprietor will be entered on the register.  The registered proprietor would normally be the owner of the nursing home.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 revises section 3 of the Bill in line with the proposed <Col N="1881" /> system of registration under section 4. The section is not changed materially except to refer to the registered proprietor instead of the licence holder and subsection (3) has been altered.  This subsection which prohibits the advertisement of unregistered nursing homes has been simplified to make its meaning and intention clear.  This subsection prevents the owner of an unregistered home from trying to advertise it as a &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo;.  The title &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; is reserved for homes registered under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 to section 5 appeals which replaces the existing subsection (1) provides for appeal to the District Court under the system of registration in the same manner as was provided for with licences.  The amendment also provides for appeals in respect of declarations.  There is no material change to the purpose of the subsection.  The registered proprietor may take an appeal against a decision of the health board to refuse a declaration, to revoke a declaration, to refuse to register the home, to remove the home from the register, to attach a condition to registration, to amend a condition of registration, or to revoke a condition of registration.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 30 is necessary as a consequence of the registration rather than the licensing of nursing homes.  It is not materially different from the original draft of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 55 provides for the payment of a fee to a health board for registration and for a declaration.  Where a declaration fee is paid I intend that this fee will be taken into account in relation to the subsequent registration fee.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 59, 60, 61 and 63 provide for a registered proprietor in place of a licence holder.</P>
    <P>Amendment 83 amends the Long Title of the Bill to take account of registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two comments at the outset.  I think it is rather unhelpful, to put it midly, to Opposition Deputies who are trying to scrutinise this legislation if within 24 to 36 hours of Committee Stage being taken we receive <Col N="1882" /> amendments in the name of the Minister which completely rewrite the Bill and substantially change sections 1, 3, 4 and 8 which are gone and substantial changes to sections 5, 6 and others.  Not only that but we have to take all the amendments together.  Do I take it that when we reach section 59, for example, we are precluded from discussing it, and at that point do we just vote on it?  This makes matters very difficult indeed.  I only received the wording of the amendments this morning. It is not fair.  These amendments should have been circulated some time ago.  The bulk of this Bill is being taken in one step.</P>
      <P>To deal with the substance of what is at issue the Minister outlined a number of very detailed points in his presentation, only some of which I got the complete drift of because of their complexity.</P>
      <P>The first question I should like to deal with is registration versus the licensing arrangements.  I was one of those who argued that a licence was not entirely suitable for this type of nursing home.  A nursing home was not like a gun or a dog that needed a licence, nor was it like a public health service: registration was more suitable but there was always registration in this Bill.  Section 8 will now be very convoluted.  It will be the first part of section 4 (1) and (2) (a) and (b).</P>
      <P>The first question we have to deal with is registration versus licensing.  There are two issues here &mdash; whether the building and the rooms are of an adequate size, whether the sanitary services are adequate, if there is a hoist in the bath, if there are proper facilities for fire emergencies, etc.  All these points are on one side, and on the other side there is the proprietor, the fitness of that person to provide adequate nursing care, adequate medical care and adequate nursing of different types of residents in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear from the Minister's new section 4 exactly what will be the difference because we do not seem to have a register of proprietors as well as a register of homes because we have only one certificate.  What happens in the event of there being question marks about the <Col N="1883" /> proprietor but not as regards the suitability of the premises?  It is not clear if this is dealt with.  The Minister tried to deal with this issue in the context of a transfer when the person comes to sell the premises when a person dies or whatever. He has introduced a new term, the declaration form, a declaration fee, which I have not seen provided for in the wording of the Bill.  On my first reading of the amendments circulated I did not see any mention of the word declaration or declaration procedures but I could be wrong. We have now introduced this declaration procedure whereby if somebody has in mind to transfer the ownership of the nursing home then they will go through the declaration process and hold on to the registration until a decision was made.  But if a transfer is not at issue and the health board are not satisfied as to the fitness of the person in charge of a large nursing home as opposed to the suitability of the premises, does that mean there can be no registration in that instance?  In other words, is there anything the proprietor can do to put it right?</P>
    <P>The second issue that arises in the original Bill and in the second set of amendments is the distinction drawn between the proprietor and the person in charge. Section 6 refers to people in charge who are at fault.  I would like to know exactly what is at issue here.  Is it somebody in charge on the night shift, or somebody appointed manager to be put in charge at all times?  We must try to keep these concepts as simple as possible.  Surely the registered proprietor will be the person who will be responsible at all times, and we should delete reference to the person in charge and instead pursue just the proprietor.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 26 the Minister referred to section 4 (6) (b) and said that reference to &ldquo;it is of opinion that&rdquo; had been deleted.  Section 4 (3) (ii) of the Bill as drafted states:</P>
    <P>The person or a person who will be or is the manager or in charge of the nursing home has been convicted of an offence under this Act....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> The Minister proposed changes there.  I had proposed that it would be a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;an offence&rdquo;.  I do not see the change he has referred to.  My amendments Nos. 5 and 6 to amendment No. 26 deal with those points.  I would like the Minister to clarify those points.</P>
    <P>We need to reflect very carefully on the different aspects of this because it seems that the Minister, albeit in a genuine attempt to meet the wishes of the Private Nursing Homes' Association and Deputies, by deleting the reference to the licence, has made it more muddled, more confused and more difficult.  We need clarification on the register of nursing homes and the registered proprietor. Amendment No. 5 states that a register means &ldquo;a register of nursing homes established under section 4 and, in relation to a particular health board, means the register so established by that board and cognate words shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;. Perhaps the Minister will tell me what the term &ldquo;cognate words shall be construed accordingly&rdquo; means.</P>
    <P>This is my first intervention and I want to emphasise a number of points.  I cannot proceed until I have some clarification of these points.  I have some reservations about proceeding on this basis.  I understand that this Bill is not likely to be taken next week so this will give us time to digest this aspect of it.  We are being asked to swallow the total debate on the major sections of this Bill, that is, sections 1, 3, 4 and 8, which propose either deletions or mass substitutions all in one go.  We are being asked to do this in the most unclear of circumstances.  I would like there to be a requirement for a register but no licence and separate certifictes for the proprietor and the nursing home.</P>
    <P>I am all for the declaration procedure, but in circumstances where there are irregularities or problems within nursing homes which have 20 or 30 elderly patients, these patients should not be turfed out overnight if a director of community care or some other person is concerned about them.  Instead the opportunity should be made available to the proprietor to either put proper management in place or try to rectify what is <Col N="1885" /> wrong.  If the proprietor is perfectly in order, but the premises are unsuitable the opportunity should be given them to close the home.  It should not be said that a proprietor is not a fit person to run another home somewhere else in the same community.  These are the questions of detail we get down to when we look at individual cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said &mdash; this sounded quite extraordinary and perhaps he will clarify it for me &mdash; that if the declaration or registration is refused by the health board they are allowed to make representations within 21 days.  What is meant by the making of representations? There is either an appeals procedure or there is not and it is either carried out by the health board or somebody else.  I have put down amendments to this section because of my experience of eight different health boards who acted in eight different ways in the operation of many existing laws.  I would much prefer the Department of Health to oversee the supervision aspects to ensure uniformity across the country.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House any further other than to say I am not satisfied at this stage.  I want to hear the Minister's response to these individual points before I accept any of the changes proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty raised by Deputy Yates.  By responding to requests in the House on Second Stage to change the system from a licensing to a registration system this has many consequential effects on the Bill and I appreciate the difficulties these pose in debating the Bill.  I will be happy to take this on board and try to clarify all the points raised.</P>
      <P>Section 8 will no longer be necessary when there is a system of registration but effectively this section only required that a register of nursing homes would be kept by health boards.  It did not deal with how one would get on to the register.  Section 4 deals with this issue.  The amendment I have proposed effectively replaces section 4 as it was but substitutes registration for licensing and incorporates section 8 for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> Section 4 (4) (b) of my amendment refers to an application to the health board for registration made by a person to whom a declaration under paragraph (a) had been given by the board.  Section 4 (2) (a) of my amendment deals with the register of the nursing home and requires that the name of the registered proprietor be entered on the register.  In addition, the register will include the address of the premises and the date on which the registration was granted.  My amendment specifies these items of information, whereas the Bill, as drafted, left them to be prescribed.  These provisions, which formerly would have been by way of regulation are now written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>The person in charge of the nursing home will also have responsibility for the standards of the home.  I believe it is appropriate that the person in charge of a nursing home should have responsibility for the standards in the home.  As I have said the new section 4 does not differ substantially from the original draft in the Bill.</P>

      <P>No, not necessarily but obviously both of them would have a responsibility for maintaining the standards.</P>
      <P>With regard to the term &ldquo;cognate words shall be construed accordingly&rdquo; this appears in legislation and is a drafting change to promote clarification of the meaning of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with these issues one by one.  I will deal first with the person in charge and the proprietor. The Minister did not deal with my central point about the difference between the register of the premises and the register of the proprietor.  If there is a problem about one of them will they lose registration or will there be separate registers for the proprietor and for the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same register but in order to qualify for the register naturally it will be necessary for the board to be satisfied with the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 8 a register of nursing homes has to be maintained and I understood that the licence referred to the applicant.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister said that the health board will consider the person applying for the licence and the proposed premises to ensure they are all in order.  He also said that they would require certain information in regard to the suitability of the applicant and the person in charge of the home.  There seems to be a quite clear understanding that the person was one aspect of this and the building was the other.  It seems now that we have submerged the whole thing into one registration process.  Let us say there was a problem with the fire escape.  Is that the basis on which the whole thing would be closed down or is that rectifiable?  If a person had one home that was found to be unsatisfactory, is that person no longer suitable, as a proprietor, to run any other home?  It would be preferable to have a distinction drawn between the two, albeit on two registers, as opposed to a licensing procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is in relation to the person who is to be in charge.  How many people can be specified as being in charge?  If that person gets sick would there be a panel of people in charge?  Say they <Col N="1888" /> went on holidays, would there be another person in charge or would someone who was doing night shift be the person in charge?  Who is to be deemed to be in charge?  The Minister said the proprietor was separate as the person in charge.  I would like to know how many people can be on the register.  Is there a maximum number?  Do they have to notify the board of who is in charge?  I ask this because all of this could be the circumstances whereby all these matters are adjudicated on in the local district court. If the law is not absolutely watertight in this area one could easily have a situation where the health board would find themselves in grave difficulties if there was a court challenge to this legislation.  It could be claimed that there was a panel of managers dealing with a situation on a particular night, and if something happened and a patient died and the family complained to the Minister and the health board demanded that the registration be taken away from that nursing home, the defence of the proprietor could be that the person in charge on that night was unsuitable and that it would not happen again.  It is always individual cases that highlight the flaws in the law.  I want clarification in relation to these points about the person in charge.  In what circumstances would it vary from the proprietor? What would be the relationship between the proprietor and the person in charge?  Is there any limit on the numbers of persons?  Will the person in charge have to have medical qualifications?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, to be included in the register, the proprietor must be approved by the health board, the person in charge must be approved by the health board, and the premises must be approved by the health board.  The person in charge would normally be the matron; it certainly would be a nurse. Obviously the matron could delegate who would be in charge when she is not there. Normally it will be the matron and that will not necessarily be the same person as the proprietor.</P>

    <Col N="1889" />
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the last contribution by the Minister of tremendous interest.  The Minister says that the person in charge would be assumed to be the matron but responsibility could devolve down through various grades of workers in the home.  Could the Minister clarify how far down the hierarchial line responsibility can be passed?  I am just very concerned that at some stage a nursing home could be in the charge of somebody both medically and administratively unskilled.  I would like further clarification on that question of who is responsible and what degree of qualification such persons must have.  Surely we cannot have a situation in a nursing home where a totally unskilled person with no training or with perhaps limited training in nursing could be left in charge and, in the event of some terrible event happening, we would exonerate the owner, proprietor or administrator of the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would concur with Deputy Byrne's remarks.  Amendment No. 26.4. (2) (a) which deals with this states: &ldquo;There shall be entered in a register in respect of each nursing home registered therein the name of the person by whom it is carried on, the name of the person who is in charge of it...&rdquo; There will be two names on this register.  Do I take it then that at all times only those two people can be in charge?  What is the difference between the person who is carrying it on and the person who is in charge?  Then Deputy Byrne's questions arise.  What must be the qualifications of the person in charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The proprietor and the person in charge need not necessarily be one and the same person.  Normally the matron would be in charge of the nursing home but we have drawn up draft regulations that will be sent out to a number of bodies and indeed I will arrange for the Deputies to have a copy of them. These will state categorically, and indeed it is in the existing regulations, that the person in charge of the nursing home at any given time shall be a nurse, so it will always be a nurse who will be in charge <Col N="1890" /> in a nursing home.  That is the position at the moment under the 1985 regulations and that will continue to be the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that last reference by the Minister.  This debate has made those in charge of nursing homes sit up and look closely at how they run their homes.  To be fair to the Minister, I have seen Bills come and go, but this is a perfect example of how we have had a very constructive debate with positive submissions that the Minister has carefully considered.  He has made one major substantial change, deleting &ldquo;licence&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;registration&rdquo; and I would like to compliment him on doing that.  This has had a domino effect right throughout the Bill but I welcome the change.  I appreciate Deputy Yates's position but this is very important legislation and I am anxious to see it in the Statute Book as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there are technical difficulties but that last comment by the Minister that a nurse will always be in charge is an important feature.  The most significant factor, the point made by the representatives of the nursing homes which I have always supported, is the deletion of the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; and the substitution of the term &ldquo;registration&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me comment on this section and the amendments.  First can the Minister inform me if it would be acceptable for a GP to be in charge of a nursing home instead of a nurse, maybe a woman doctor whose career is, perhaps, to be totally in charge of a nursing home?  To take up the point made by Deputy Byrne, many people might be concerned because at present nursing homes seem to be the biggest expanding commercial area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reason for that.  Old people need nursing care and it can be a profitable business.  The proprietor of this business could be quite far removed from the operation of the home and the home could be in the charge of a matron or nurse or somebody at that level.  Is there any provision for noting first the qualifications of the person in charge?  If, say, somebody <Col N="1891" /> who had committed some offence or who may not have behaved properly or who for some reason, had to leave a job in nursing and was then put in charge of a nursing home, I do not think the health board could move against that person; that would fall to the proprietor.  We should have an image or an idea of the background of the person who is in charge on a day to day basis rather than the person who does the accounts, makes the tax returns and so on.  The person <i>in situ</i> in the nursing home is possibly very important.  Have we taken that into account?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks about the regulations and look forward to seeing them because they clarify a number of points.  We now have the certificate of registration and the register which is available for inspection and on it we have the name of the proprietor and the name of the person in charge and the amendment at section 4 (3) (b) provides that this will last for two years.  There are amendments down to make it last for four years and for five years.  We have a procedure for changing the proprietor if he wishes to sell or dies or transfers the business to another member of the family.  If, as often happens, there is a high turnover of nursing staff and if the matron or the person in charge is replaced by another, what is the procedure for transfer to the person then in charge?  In other words is there a similar declaration process for the person in charge or is it to be done on the basis that the person will justify the health board and the health board will approve that?  If so where is the legal provision?  If, say, a health board have given registration but during the period for which they were registered complaints about them are made to the health board and they check up and find a different person is now in charge, what action is open to the health board to seek a proper transfer to that other person in charge?  A nurse may emigrate, or get married and give up working.  This is very important because in five or ten years' time Ben Dunne <Col N="1892" /> could get into the nursing home business and have 50 homes all over the country with a different manager in charge of each one.  At the moment we are dealing with family run, ostensibly one proprietor homes, but this might be big business in future.  Therefore, the person in charge could be more important than the proprietor. The turnover rate of persons in charge will be much higher than that of proprietors.  On the transfer of the person in charge under section 4 (2) (a) will the declaration procedure apply?  Will there be another transfer procedure?  Will the registration still hold and what will be the circumstances?</P>

      <P>I say to Deputy Fennell, no, it will not be possible for a medical officer or doctor to be in charge of a nursing home.  There is nothing to stop such a person being proprietor but he could not under the regulations be in charge of the nursing home because it is important that there be a high standard of nursing care in the home.  For that reason it should be a nurse who is in charge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt is quite right and I appreciate his comments on the Bill.  On Second Stage we took account of the wishes of the Members in the House generally about registration rather than licensing. Obviously it had consequences in terms of preparing the amendments because of the knock on effect.  Indeed, I might reiterate what Deputy Kitt said, that everybody in the House wants to see the best possible legislation, so we are all addressing it with an open mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised a point about the provision for re-registering or letting the health board know that the matron or the person in charge had changed.  There is nothing specifically in the Bill that would oblige the proprietor to notify the health board that a new matron had been appointed or that the matron had left.  I have an open mind as to whether that is necessary in terms of the legislation because obviously there is an obligation on the proprietor to ensure that he maintains the standard and staffing levels <Col N="1893" /> required by the health board.  The registration will be renewable every two years. That is also a safeguard.  Health board personnel will have the right to inspect the premises from time to time and if a health board inspector is dissatisfied when he goes to the nursing home he can take steps to revoke the registration.  As Deputy Yates said, the senior nurse or the nurse in charge, might change, might get married or go to a different job and it would be cumbersome to write such a provision into legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item apart from that of the person in charge that I am concerned about in the new section 4 (3) (b) which provides that the period of registration shall be two years from the date of registration.  We all welcome the fact that the concept of the licence has been removed and replaced by registration. I, too, appreciate the point Deputy Kitt made.  We all made it on Second Stage, but now a specific period of two years has been put in place in relation to the registration.  People involved in running nursing homes objected to the licence first of all on the basis that it implied some temporary arrangement <i>vis-à-vis</i> a nursing home. Now we have registration in place and the Minister has specified two years.  Does he not consider two years for a nursing home a very short period?  I have no objection to continuing inspections or visits from the health board and officers of the Department to ensure that standards are maintained, but to make it obligatory on owners of nursing homes to re-apply every two years is penal in that it lends an air of temporariness.  I think patients in a nursing home would want to be reassured about the permanency of their tenure there.  They tend to become institutionalised and they like some sense of security.  The Minister himself has made this point in debates about the health services.  We can create in the minds of people who are dependent on these services a confidence in the dependability of their position.  Two years is quite a short <Col N="1894" /> period and I am surprised that the Minister has provided for it in the amendment in section 4 (3) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that Deputy Ferris's colleague, Deputy Howlin, has an amendment down to make that period four years and I have an amendment down to make it five years.  The two year provision was in the original Bill.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the person in charge is the most important person.  The proprietor could say: &ldquo;I spent £50,000, I did up the building, it was in perfectly good order.  It was not my fault that the person in charge happened to have a drink problem&rdquo; or this or that.  There should be an obligation to ensure &mdash; I put it no more strongly than this &mdash; that if there is a change and another person takes charge the health board should be so informed.  That should at least be put into the regulations, and I ask the Minister to give a commitment on that.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister more questions so that I can make some progress. Under amendment No. 20 in the Minister's name it is an offence to operate an unregistered nursing home.  Would the Minister outline the penalties for an offence under the section?  Secondly, will the Minister outline the declaration fee and the registration fee for nursing homes?  Does he have in mind the sum of £50 or £2,000.  What is the range of the figure he has in mind?  Will the figure be based on trying to recoup the administrative costs?  I have grave difficulty with amendment No. 26 in the Minister's name which amends section 4 of the Bill. Section 4 (6) (b) deals with removing a nursing home from the register.  Under section 4 (6) (b) where the health board (i) &ldquo;is of the opinion that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) the premises to which the application or, as the case may be, the registration relates do not comply with the regulations, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and so on.  The words &ldquo;is of the opinion that&rdquo; are very faulty indeed.  It is not uncommon for individual public servants, in this House or individuals in any walk of life to fail to hit it off with another <Col N="1895" /> person, to have personality clashes.  It would be very easy for anyone to form opinions and therefore I think those words have the making of very bad law. I think we should substitute the words &ldquo;where the health board has reasonable cause to believe&rdquo;.  If the Minister is prepared to make that change, for example, it will be a substantial reassurance to all those operating nursing homes that his concern is for fair play together with the highest standards.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that health boards run geriatric care institutions in every community care area and they are very much in the business of minding the elderly and rightly so.  With the establishment of geriatric assessment committees which assess referrals and decide whether the person will subsequently be sent out to a subvented bed, referred for rehabilitation or put into a long-stay bed, this can involve personality clashes in a small community.  In my view the words &ldquo;is of the opinion that&rdquo; are faulty.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that and to include the obligation that the proprietors of nursing homes have to notify the health board if there is a change in the person in charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the points that were raised.  The question of the levels of fines for offences is dealt with under section 12 of the Bill.  Section 12 states:</P>
      <P>(a)  On summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000, or to imprisonment for a time not exceeding three months or to both,</P>
      <P>(b)  On conviction on indictment of an offence under section 3, to a fine not exceeding £50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ferris asked about the period for registration and it is a question of striking a balance.  While I know that both Deputy Ferris and Deputy Yates have an amendment to extend the time the working party who prepared the report <i>The elderly</i><Col N="1896" />&mdash;<i>the years ahead</i> recommended an annual licensing registration fee.  I think that annual registration would be asking too much of the nursing homes and we have extended the period to two years. Deputy Yates asked about amendment No. 26 to section 4 (5) of the Bill, and the conditions under which a health board may remove a nursing home from the register.  In amendment No. 26 section 4 (6) states a health board shall not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) remove a nursing home from the register, unless &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) it is of opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the premises to which the application... relates</P>
    <P>(II)  the carrying on of the home will not be or is not in compliance with the regulations,</P>
    <P>The grounds for the removal of a nursing home from the register are very restrictive. The health board will have formed the opinion on the basis of information supplied to them by the nursing home and following inspection of the home by some of the health boards personnel. In other words the health board will be obliged to form their opinion on the basis of fact.  Deputy Yates and Deputy Garland are anxious that the wording &ldquo;reasonable cause to believe&rdquo; would be substituted if they are of the opinion that the premises to which the application relates, or that the carrying on of a home will not be in compliance with the regulations.  As I said the grounds for the removal of a nursing home from the register have to be based on facts.  The terminology &ldquo;reasonable cause to believe&rdquo; is used where there is some uncertainty about what has happened; for example when a garda is called to the scene of an incident he or she has the power to arrest on the basis of a reasonable cause to believe.  I am satisfied that the Bill as drafted places a greater onus on health boards to act reasonably than if the wording proposed in the amendment were used.  If we were to accept the wording &ldquo;reasonable cause to <Col N="1897" /> believe&rdquo; it would increase the discretionary power of the health boards, and I feel that is not the intention of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will refer to what the Minister has just said about the amendment tabled by me and Deputy Yates. Deputy Yates had put the case very well for both of us and I am not at all pleased with the Minister's reply.  I see no reason to change my position on the matter.  I think the wording that we have proposed is infinitely superior to the Minister's wording and I would like the Minister to reconsider this matter on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>It might also be appropriate for me at this stage to deal with amendment No. 12 in my name and that of Deputy Yates, which seeks to amend section 2 (1) (b) which deals with one of the exclusions from the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Yates's remarks.  The Minister will be aware as a GP that the words &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo; are widely used throughout the country to justify the decision of any professional person which may not have any relevance to the case in point.  Anybody can state an opinion.  It does not have to be right or wrong; it only has to be an opinion. In the area of the social welfare code, medical referees give opinions which are indisputably incorrect, based on medical evidence available from consultants, hospitals and otherwise.  Still under the social welfare code the doctor or medical referee can state &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo;.  People respect an opinion but it is not a definitive statement of fact.  The words suggested by Deputy Yates, &ldquo;reasonable cause to believe&rdquo;, are completely specific.  An opinion must be based on evidence.  The Minister should address himself to this <Col N="1898" /> concept.  The opinions of experts rarely agree.  They all have freedom to state their opinion but it does not necessarily concur with the facts.  The Minister should seriously consider the wording suggested by Deputies Yates and Garland.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not reply to my question about the level of fees envisaged in respect of the declaration fee and the registration fee.  It is a bizarre use of the English language to say that &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; is more open to question than an opinion.  Whoever wrote the text for the Minister has simply got it wrong.  If registration is refused or if a health board deregister a nursing home, the proprietor is entitled to appeal on certain grounds to the District Court if he feels aggrieved.  All the health board official has to say is that he has an opinion.  It does not matter if everyone disagrees with his opinion; as long as that is his opinion, the nursing home must remain deregistered.  It cannot be argued that it would be easier for the health board official to go into court and prove that he had reasonable grounds to believe.  We would have great difficulty in accepting amendment No. 26 if this is to be the position.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider.  The advice he has received is wrong.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  I would dwell for a moment on the level of fees to be charged.  The Minister said that if somebody had paid a declaration fee, that would be borne in mind when the subsequent registration of the transferred nursing home came up.  This means that he has something in mind regarding the level of these fees and the interaction of the declaration fee and the registration fee.  Perhaps he will let us know whether the declaration fee is to be set at the same level as the registration fee.  Would he consider £50 as an acceptable level for the registration fee if it were index-linked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The opinion I have <Col N="1899" /> about &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo; is that it is a legal phrase in the context of the Bill.  It is stronger legally than the amendment proposed. I accept that in common usage &ldquo;reasonable cause to believe&rdquo; sounds stronger but in fact it is not.  The boards will be obliged to base their opinion on fact and they are the people who may have to go to court and defend their opinion and the grounds on which they formed their opinion in the first place. My advice is that the wording is stronger in the Bill as it stands.  While I take Deputy Yates' point about looking at it before Report Stage, it is one of those phrases on which we could get conflicting legal opinions.</P>
      <P>The level of fee has not been determined as yet.  It will be discussed with the nursing home owners and in my view it should not be stated in the legislation.  A change in the level of fee would then require an amendment to the legislation. If the health board have to undertake necessary investigations and inspections to ensure that nursing homes provide a high quality of care, it is reasonable that there should be a fee.  I can assure the Deputy that the fees will not be unreasonable.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he would have discussions with the nursing homes about the level of fees.  I hope agreement will be reached.  We all have opinions about what the fee should be.  We do not want the kind of position which developed in regard to the rod licence when we were told agreement had been reached and we then discovered it had not.  We have had other legislation which involved registration fees which were laid down by regulation afterwards, subject to agreement.  Probably none of us would be competent to decide on the appropriate fee.  There is no doubt that a fee should attach.  The payment of a fee by a <Col N="1900" /> qualified nursing home will give a status to that nursing home which is appropriate. I hope that agreement will be reached in discussions and that it will be communicated to us so that we can be supportive of the final agreement.</P>

      <P>Certainly I will report to the Deputy on the agreement reached. It is not our intention to fall out over it. We will be looking for consensus with the nursing homes.  It will not be an unreasonable fee.  Deputy Yates mentioned £50 which would appear to me to be reasonable. Deputy Sherlock has an amendment to the effect that it should not be less than £250 but we will not be thinking along those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not intervened since amendment No. 1, which was a matter upon which I had received persistent representations but I want to underline what Deputy Yates said at the outset concerning the manner in which this spate of amendments reached us, in my case this morning.  I hope the Minister accepts that for Deputies who are not spokespersons for their party on Health in particular to find themselves with an array of amendments which, in some cases, utterly transform the Bill and to be expected to make sense of the manner in which they are now collated makes it very difficult to make any sensible contribution to this Stage of the legislative process.  I presume there is good sense in the manner in which the Bills Office has suggested we should proceed, but it is extremely difficult to relate one's amendments back to the original Bill because of the very short period which has been given to digest what the Minister has put forward.  On a matter as important as this it is unreasonable to be put into this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the debate that has just taken place concerning the suggestion made by Deputy Yates about &ldquo;reasonable cause to believe&rdquo; as against &ldquo;the board being of the opinion that&rdquo; and so on.  The Minister said that the advice available to him is that the matter of construction, that is &ldquo;that the board is of <Col N="1901" /> the opinion&rdquo;, is legally stronger than the words Deputy Yates advanced.  That is probably correct.  Does the Minister intend to carry through that view in terms of amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 26 in the name of Deputy Sherlock which says that a person who proposes to carry on a nursing home shall be deemed a suitable person, and so forth, unless that person has been convicted of an offence under this Bill or the 1964 Act or of any other offence that is such as to render the person unfit to carry on a nursing home?</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock's amendment, coincidentally, is phrased in the manner which the Minister said is legally stronger.  It says &ldquo;or is, in the opinion of the board for any other reason, a person unfit to carry on a nursing home&rdquo;.  What is the Minister's disposition on that aspect? This is a very important section.  The Minister says that a person shall be considered suitable unless that person has been convicted under this Bill or under the 1964 Act.  I do not know if the Minister knows how many convictions there are under the 1964 Act but, as far as I recall, there were very few indeed.  In fact, I suggest to the Minister that there was only one which was initiated by my union a few years ago against a nursing home which has now conveniently changed its name.  It gives very broad scope indeed to say that, in order to render yourself ineligible to carry on a nursing home, you either have to be convicted of an offence under this Bill, the 1964 Act or be guilty of some other offence which renders you unfit.  In other words, you have to be convicted, otherwise you are a suitable person to run a nursing home.  That seems to be very broad indeed &ldquo;that unless you have a conviction you are regarded as suitable to carry on a business as a nursing home.</P>
    <P>Obviously the health authority will have an opinion about an applicant who is unsuitable, but not by virtue of the fact that he or she would have a conviction in the narrow areas defined here.  Would an owner of a brothel who makes an application be considered a suitable person to run a nursing home just because <Col N="1902" /> that person did not have a conviction under this Bill or the 1964 Act.</P>

Obviously, the board in coming to that decision, would have to be able to defend it in court if the person appealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree about the difficulties created by debating so many sections together but, as I have twice explained in the House, it is the result of accepting an amendment requested by the Opposition on Second Stage which has implications for many sections in the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of balance and of how much discretion you give to the board in terms of how they deal with registration of individual people. While as of now the board can only refuse registration if the person has been convicted, my view is that they should have more discretion but I am open to suggestions from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that is what it meant but the Minister, in his initial reply, seemed to suggest that the health boards did have authority to reject an applicant on grounds other than is specified here.  However, I do not have a ready-made construction off the top of my head but it seems that, as the legislation stands, an applicant who has not been convicted who makes application and is refused, would have a right to challenge that refusal in the courts and would be successful.  Some discretion must be given to the health board who would be expected to have a reasonable knowledge of this kind of thing so that if the kind of case I posed arises or any other case where, in the opinion of the board, there would be a manifest unsuitability, the board could refuse without <Col N="1904" /> being apprehensive of litigation by the would-be applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to turn to amendments Nos. 28 and 30 in the Minister's name and which deal with appeals. The only appeal process where there is a dispute between the health board and the nursing home proprietor is through the courts.  This is a great weakness in the legislation and the more I reflect on it the more dissatisfied I am with it.  I have approached this legislation with a number of amendments seeking that the health boards would not be given operational responsibility for the legislation but that instead the Department of Health would be given such responsibility.  I have taken that approach because of my first-hand knowledge of individual cases of different standards being operated in different parts of the country by different personnel from different health boards, people who have completely different attitudes to what is desirable.  I have even seen, within individual community care areas, different attitudes when certain directors of community care are replaced by others and I have seen desperate personality clashes.  There is an obligation on us in this House to ensure uniformity of law.  As we know, in so many of the health areas in relation to the Health Act, 1970, there is no uniformity.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister therefore to compromise on this and consider a substantial amendment whereby the day to day workings of the legislation, the registration, the conditions and so on would be matters for the health boards but there would be an appeal to the Minister.  There could be a small unit in the Department and the Minister could second one or two people from each health board to operate this system and appeals would be handled by the Department of Health.  Section 5 and amendments Nos. 28 and 30 deal with this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the courts because, first, litigation is very costly. People who could get the best senior counsel might have the best case presented on their behalf.  There is also the possibility that district courts could <Col N="1905" /> be something of a lottery in so far as a particular district justice may not like a particular health board and would invariably give judgments against the health board and <i>vice versa.</i> There may be other district justices who would not be expert on nursing homes, who would not be expected to know about medical and nursing matters and who would feel that it was their obligation to back the health board.  Conversely the only way the Minister and his officials will know how the legislation is working and whether it is meeting the desired circumstances is for people in the Department to have first-hand knowledge of the type of standards that are being set across the country and the type of standards desired.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider amendments Nos. 28 and 30 and to consider rejecting the District Court.  Of course people should have a right to appeal to the courts on points of law only but on substantial disputes of opinion about whether a home is up to standard surely the sensible thing is for the Minister to send an inspector to inspect the home.  What would a district justice know about it?  He is not going to go to look at the home and he will not be able to resolve the clashes that might arise.  If everything is done on the basis that the next step is litigation, it is a breathing ground for allegations of different kinds and that will only lead to unpleasantness. Therefore we need a buffer in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to specifically ask if the Minister envisages that the Ombudsman would have a role in this regard.  He can appeal individual matters of every health board.  All concerned, the residents and proprietors of nursing homes and health board officials, would welcome the Department taking an active interest in this matter.  As I have said, the net effect would be that it would not necessarily involve any extra cost because the Minister could second two or three people from different health boards to administer the appeals process.  He could appoint a small <i>ad hoc</i> group of three people to make judgments and he could <Col N="1906" /> lay down the details by way of regulation. As outlined in section 5 and in amendments Nos. 28 and 30, the only recourse for disputes as regards registration, deregistration and so on is to the courts. That is entirely unsatisfactory and needs amending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the argument put forward by Deputy Yates.  This type of section has been written into other legislation. Recently it was written into the legislation giving licences to restaurants to have drink facilities available after certain hours.  We discussed the pros and cons of this type of section, particularly as it relates to a premises in the service of the public.  If this is the only recourse that is available to applicants for registration to practice their constitutional rights &mdash; it is the final court of appeal and we cannot take it from them &mdash; it would be detrimental and would create a positive discrimination against the people going in to court.  Once you appear in court and try to prove that your premises or yourself are suitable for a licence you have immediately lost the confidence of the public because irrespective of the decision of the court there is always a suspicion that because you had to go to court there must have been something intrinsically wrong with the application in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has specified that he will require the person in charge to be a competent nurse and we accept that.  We are talking here about the home in particular, the actual bricks and mortar.  The newly built homes which are specially built to suit will have no problem.  The Minister has identified areas in the community where it will be satisfactory for small private houses to provide accommodation for two or three people and this is a welcome step but to do that the applicant will have to go through a whole process of investigation, first by the local authority in the jurisdiction in which the application is made and secondly the local authority will have to consult with the fire officer who advises the local authority and indeed the health board on matters <Col N="1907" /> of this kind.  Unless the normal procedure of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála or otherwise is available, there is merit in the case made by Deputy Yates that before people go to court there must be another procedure which the Minister could monitor in the interests of the health boards and the applicants who are really providing a service that normally the State should provide anyway but cannot afford.  There should be a procedure available to people who in discussions with officials of the Department would have the opportunity to put their case for registration without having to appear before a court.  I do not think people will appeal to the courts and in that regard we would be discriminating against them. We must remember that there will be personality clashes in regard to this procedure.  We would like everything to be black and white but that is not how it is in the real world.  I should like to ask the Minister to take the views I have expressed into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the points made by Deputies Yates and Ferris I do not think it would be appropriate for the Department of Health to become directly involved.  What is laid down in the Bill is reasonable.  If an application is refused by a health board the applicant can approach the health board within 21 days and if he or she is refused on the second occasion an appeal may be lodged with the District Court.  Having the District Court involved imposes a certain discipline on those who are preparing the register.  It will ensure that they will not, without justification, refuse to register an applicant on the register of nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point that has been made that it will be difficult to have uniformity throughout the country, particularly where a number of agencies are involved. We are introducing a code of practice and we will be involving the eight health boards and the nursing homes in the preparation of that code.  When preparing that code we will take account of the points <Col N="1908" /> made in the debate and, perhaps, introduce a procedure whereby those who are refused on the second occasion by the health board can have their application heard by a third party.  That is the best way to proceed.  I do not think the Department should become involved in the day to day running of nursing homes, as suggested by the Deputies.  We will be dealing with the question of uniformity in the code of practice which it is hoped to circulate to Members who have contributed before Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of some substance.  The Minister told us that an aggrieved party can within 21 days of the first refusal return to the health board and ask to have the application considered.  I do not envisage any health board giving a different verdict on the second appeal to the one handed down by another officer.  I do not see how a health board would undermine their own offices.  In that event we can disregard that suggestion.</P>
      <P>In rural Ireland the stories that sell local newspapers are those that emanate from the District Court.  Country people operate on the basis that there is no smoke without fire.  If there are any allegations on appeal put through the District Court by an applicant seeking justice for his or her nursing home one can take it that the nursing home involved is finished and will not succeed in attracting any new patients.  Such people might lose a licence on a technicality but the only way they have of appealing the health board's decision is through the courts.  They must go to the expense of paying a solicitor and, on appeal to the Circuit Court, of paying counsel.  Those people must contend with the lottery of the District Court justice system.  That is not what we should be concerned about. Our aim should be to improve and perfect the standards for the care of the elderly in residential care and nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that what I am suggesting will cause the Department a lot of hassle and that they do not want the bother of following it up because they would have to establish certain structures, appoint <Col N="1909" /> officials to take charge and pay out money.  However, if my suggestion is adopted we may have more fair play. All the advice given to the Minister is against the Department getting involved in this process but this is a matter on which politicians must exercise their judgment and sense of fair play.  I accept that the ultimate arbiters in the interpretation of any law are the courts but it would not cost very much to adopt my suggestion to deal with disputes.</P>
    <P>An aggrieved party should have the right to appeal to the Minister.  I do not think there will be any need to recruit extra staff.  I am suggesting that the Minister establish a panel of health board personnel to adjudicate on such appeals. For example, he should appoint one official from each health board. If an appeal is lodged with the South-Eastern Health Board the Department should appoint three officials from other health boards to hear that appeal.  The Minister may find that that group would write to the proprietor pointing out the defects in the nursing home, for example, that the fire escape was not adequate, that there were not enough <i>en suite</i> rooms or that the standard of hygiene was not good enough.  The proprietor would realise then how futile it would be to appeal the case to the District Court.</P>
    <P>The procedure suggested by the Minister may involve health boards in costly litigation.  The time of health board staff would be taken up dealing with court appeals.  The Minister would achieve a lot more by having his Department more involved in the day to day running of nursing homes.  We will be pressing this issue to a vote.</P>
    <P>Health boards vary in their services to the mental handicapped, in regard to occupational and speech therapy, orthodontic treatment, dental surgery and other services.  The attitude of the board depends on the drive of board members, CEOs or programme managers.  Another example is the different attitude adopted by health boards in regard to child care but children are not different irrespective of where they live.</P>
    <P>There is an established data base to <Col N="1910" /> show that health boards operate differently but there is no reason to believe that justices have a monopoly on wisdom. They probably do not have a clue about standards in nursing homes.  They are not the best people to arbitrate on these matters.  We need those who have day to day experience of nursing homes.  If my suggestion was introduced on a trial basis for one year we may find that all the appeals would come from, for example, a particular part of Donegal.  We may find that one director of community care, was having family problems &mdash; I have no reason to suspect the director in Donegal; I am using that county as an example &mdash; and that he was an aggravated person. We must couch the law in such a way that it will be fair.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that amendments Nos. 28 and 30 are satisfactory.  I should like to make an appeal to the Minister to go against the advice he is receiving on this issue and consider setting up a small inexpensive panel of experts to review appeals.  I am not suggesting that we should preclude a person's legal rights to go to court but we should have a halfway house appeals system as we have in regard to social welfare benefits.  One can appeal to the head office of a health board in regard to supplementary welfare payments and community welfare payments. It would be interesting to learn in how many appeals the health board went against the decision of a local community welfare officer.  They do not do that.  It rarely happens.  An appeals system outside of that health board is needed.  The Minister says that they can appeal within 21 days to the head office.</P>
    <P>The first thing the programme manager would do is to get the report from the local district court clerk and the report from the health inspector who saw it and he will come to his own conclusions very quickly.  He will not undermine his staff. Certainly he would make the position of the health board officials impossible if he was to constantly overturn the decisions of his own understudies.  This is fundamental to this Bill, it is fundamental to fair play and if we are putting the onus on proprietors we must remember that <Col N="1911" /> we are talking about people who are investing in the region of £40,000, £50,000 and, perhaps, £100,000. If, after a couple of years someone decides that the rules have changed the nature of this will be that more nursing homes will be built, there will be more competition in this area and there will be jealousy, pettiness, small mindedness and personality clashes.  Therefore what we are suggesting is a half way house &mdash; an appeals system that would be inexpensive, practicable and cost effective.  That is worthy of consideration and I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position in this regard.</P>

      <P>I will deal briefly with the matters raised.  First, there will be a very small minority that the health boards will refuse to register because the grounds are very clearly laid down: they would have to have a conviction in court in accordance with the legislation.  Indeed, it is interesting that Deputy Rabbitte wanted more discretion for the health boards in reply to who they would register and who they would not register.  Deputy Yates referred on a number of occasions to the advice I was getting that the Department of Health should not be the appeals body.  I would make the comment <Col N="1912" /> that perhaps they are taking on board too much of what Deputy Yates has been saying over the years.  He is one Member of the House, who, on numerous occasions has stood up and said there should be a body between the Department of Health and the agencies and that the Department of Health should not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;involve themselves in the day to day practice that occasionally they have to get involved in.  The board will not be rushing into making hasty and flimsy decisions.  In fact, the record of prosecutions &mdash; to which Deputy Rabbitte referred &mdash; has been very few over the years under the 1964 Act and it is only as a last resort that the boards have gone to court. Most homes are run to a very high standard.  I do not believe the boards would refuse to register somebody unless they had very good grounds.  They would have to go to the District Court themselves and defend the grounds on which they had refused registration.  I suggested the code of practice because I believe that will get over the difficulty to the extent that it will be drawn up by the eight health boards in association with officials of my Department and also in consultation with the nursing homes association.  That will give the opportunity to ensure that there is uniformity throughout the eight health board areas and it will also give them the opportunity to agree a protocol on how the boards will deal with an appeal that would come in within 21 days of a refusal. I believe that will meet the needs of the very tiny minority who are likely to be refused registration because the conditions under which they can be refused are laid down very clearly in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has addressed some of our concern in this area.  In respect of any legislation, there is a constitutional right to use the courts if a person is aggrieved to that extent. Because it is referred to in the Bill does not mean that everyone would want to <Col N="1913" /> use that procedure but it is a perfectly legitimate procedure.  We did not want it to be the final or the only procedure available to the people involved in a disagreement with the health boards.  If there was a code of practice I presume it would apply to the agencies or the officers in the health boards who would have the responsibility for making decisions on the applications, on the suitability of the applicants and on their homes to satisfy the Minister's requirements.  In parallel with a code of practice for the officers carrying out the investigation I presume there will be a code of minimum standards which would have to be achieved before the stage of applying for registration is reached.  Presumably there will be the procedure where one can go back to the health board or, if there is a fire problem, one can consult with the fire officer or, if it is a planning problem where, for instance, the building is too near to the national primary route, that can be discussed with the planning officer.  If we take it that all those are equal and that the home and the person running it meet the minimum standards laid down by the Minister &mdash; we would all hope they would achieve maximum standards &mdash; and if the officers inspecting live within a code of practice, I hope this section will never have to be used.  If it has to be used frequently then the whole object of this legislation will have been defeated because much good service is given by private nursing homes.  We had better realise that, because without them I do not know what we would do.  Admittedly, medical card holders have to pay additional sums on top of their meagre incomes to support their stay in these places but it is because of the lack of beds in public geriatric institutions that people are forced to go into private nursing homes.  That is the reason I welcome the concept of this Bill, it subvents the patient and not the bed.  I hope that the additional finances required by the health boards will be available to do that because otherwise the Bill will only be a pale shade of what the Minister wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that we make <Col N="1914" /> some progress on this amendment.  The only other additional point I wanted to raise is the registration for boarding out. If we are now deleting a licensing system but there is no provision for registration. There is a feeling among those in the Private Nursing Homes' Association that boarding out will be used in substitution of nursing homes.  I think that will vary. I am in favour of boarding out as a principle. It keeps people in their own community and it is cost-effective.  I would like to see provision in this legislation and in section 4, to tie in with section 11, that there would be some concept of a level playing field and, especially if the health board are to get more involved in sub-venting nursing home beds, there is a case for saying that we will put all the care of the elderly, in terms of non-institutional care, on the one playing pitch and that there will be a register for boarding out and a register for nursing homes. Health boards would be able to utilise both registers by transferring patients from geriatric assessment committees and getting financially involved.</P>
      <P>I should like to summarise my position in regard to these amendments. I call on the Minister to make it obligatory to notify a health board where there is a transfer of the person in charge of a nursing home which is registered or seeking registration.  In all cases the Department of Health should ensure that the person in charge is an aspect of the registration which should be closely scrutinised and monitored.  In relation to deregistration I ask the Minister to change the words &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo; to &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo;.  I also ask him to put an appeals system in place involving representatives of health boards, other that the health board in which the dispute is taking place. Machinery should be put in place to inspect cases rather than having to utilise the court structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the other changes proposed when we are dealing with the other amendments.  I accept the basis of amendment No. 2.  The period of registration should be extended from two years to four or five years.  I will deal with this matter in greater detail later.  The <Col N="1915" /> general workings of this system should be on the basis of consultation with the proprietors of nursing homes rather than confrontation.  I am advised that section 4 (12) of amendment No. 26 may be unconstitutional, and I will deal with this in greater detail later. I also have great difficulty with section 4 (11) of the amendment.  However, I will deal with these matters when we are discussing amendments Nos. 1 to 16 to amendment No. 26. Perhaps the Minister will consider the points I have raised.  If he fails to do so we will vote against amendment No. 26. I have outlined the substantial changes we would like to see at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for having had to leave the House briefly.  I support Deputy Yates's first amendment that there ought to be a requirement to notify the health board concerned in the event of the transfer of the person in charge of a nursing home.  That is a reasonable and desirable provision and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
      <P>I must say I am less upset about the removal of a nursing home from the register. There is a question of whether the phrase used should be &ldquo;in the opinion of the health board that X and Y conditions apply&rdquo; or whether it should be &ldquo;they have reasonable cause to believe that certain conditions apply&rdquo;.  I take the Minister's advice that the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the corporate body responsible&rdquo; is probably stronger from a legal point of view. As I said, I am not too concerned about this.  Before I left the Chamber I made the point that there have been very few convictions under the 1964 Act.  In fact, I can recall only one.  Therefore, the provision as it stands is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the last points made by Deputy Yates specifically as they relate to amendment No. 28 and the necessity for an appeals procedure.  The view taken by Deputy Yates and Deputy Ferris give grounds to believe that they distrust the health boards. Deputy Yates spoke about subjective issues, such as conflict of personalities and the fact that a vindictive person could strike someone <Col N="1916" /> off the register or not permit someone to re-register for personal reasons.  These are features of life but I am very dubious about whether a licensing authority or registration authority could function in that manner without redress being taken by nursing homes involved.  The redress body suggested here is the District Court. I would greatly prefer redress to the District Court than to the Minister for Health.  It would be entirely improper and unfair to impose on the Minister for Health this responsibility and expect him to be in a position to give an opinion or judgment on whether an institution or nursing home should be debarred from registration or re-registration.  How is the Minister to know whether this should be done?  The Minister for Health would presumably be informed by his servants who would try to establish this information through the health boards.  In any event this would diminish the standing, reputation, reliability and professionalism of the health board.</P>
    <P>The health boards are the bodies of competence and authority in this regard and they are bound to have local knowledge which would enable them to be in a position to make a decision on the matter. I believe the Minister would be open to all kinds of political lobbying.  I know many owners of nursing homes who are not unfamiliar with the political world. Many eminent persons who have political connections own nursing homes.  It would be entirely wrong to expose the Minister to any unfair lobbying when a health board have good cause not to re-register a nursing home or to register it in the first instance.</P>
    <P>This is a very important point because the present inspection and enforcement procedures are hopelessly inadequate. That is the <i>raison d'être </i> for this Bill. Conditions in some nursing homes &mdash; I do not mean to paint with a broad brush &mdash; are disgraceful.  I have had personal experience of this.  In the one case I instanced where there was a conviction, an inspection was carried out the day before the nurses in that home instituted the proceedings which led to the conviction. This happened because the brunt <Col N="1917" /> of the inspection obligations have tended to fall on public health nurses who have an extremely onerous range of duties and functions.  It is an area that has been inadequately provided for in the past. The Minister's amendments provides better for the situation envisaged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about this section.  At the risk of asking the Minister to repeat himself, perhaps he would clarify what in real terms he intends to do with the code of practice.  In relation to the right of appeal, I support the views expressed by <Col N="1918" /> Deputy Rabbitte and would be very wary of putting the Minister in a position where he would be subject to lobbying.  In the past we had Ministers in the same position and we had to change ground subsequently and be seen to put it in a judicial or quasi-judicial area.  The truth is that is somebody actually has to appeal to a District Court he has already lost half the battle because the publicity that would ensue would ultimately not be very good for his business.  It is important, therefore, that there would be clear guidelines put down, publicly known and applicable to all health boards before a refusal would be recorded.  Perhaps the Minister would outline the standards of administration and codes of conduct that he would envisage putting in place so that appeals of any nature would not be necessary.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin's colleague, Deputy Ferris, outlined in an excellent contribution how he would see the appeal develop.  What we intend to do is to draw up a code of practice with the eight health boards and in consultation with the nursing home owners we will incorporate some of the issues that have been raised here, especially the one in relation to appeals, as well as ensuring that there is uniformity in the practice.</P>
      <P>Certainly we are prepared to accept &mdash; and we will draw up an amendment &mdash; that it will be necessary to notify the health board when the person in charge changes, when the matron leaves her office or when somebody else replaces her as the official person in charge.  On the question of changing the wording, my legal advice is that this is stronger wording.  I have dealt with the points on the code of practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3: <Col N="1919" /> In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;officer of the Health Board&rsquo; means designated medical practitioners;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The position here is that section 6 (2) (i) sets out all the different things the health board have to do.  Sections 6 (2) (i) reads:</P>
      <P>provide for the inspection of premises in which nursing homes are being carried on or are proposed to be carried on or that are reasonably believed by a health board to be premises in which a nursing home is being carried on and otherwise for the enforcement and execution of the regulations by the appropriate health boards and their officers.</P>
      <P>Here we have an inspection process that will obviously feature largely in the code of practice the Minister has just referred to.  It is very important that we legislate for who is going to carry this out.  In my view it should be carried out by two officers of the health board &mdash; an officer of the health board in one instance who would be a designated medical practitioner and he or she would be accompanied by an official of the health board who would be an administrative person.  What I am trying to achieve here is a balanced approach.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that his perspective on this is to ensure that the most rigorous inspections take place and that there is no one in this House who would seek to defend less than exemplary standards of care for the elderly.  My priority and that of my party is that elderly people be allowed to live out their lives with dignity and independence and that this should be done in the most desirable setting, and if that means that the cost to the State will be an extra £20 or £30 a week to get better standards in nursing homes &mdash; and that is the cost of subvention &mdash; so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to ensure that these standards will be arrived at by people of fair mind and balanced approach, people who <Col N="1920" /> have regard to the practicalities, and to the medical factors. I do not want a situation where someone can come in and write a report which would be the basis of all future decisions.  Therefore I am seeking that this House would have an input into this code of practice and that would be two persons involved in such inspections, one, a health board doctor &mdash; most likely the director of community care, the chief medical officer or something like that &mdash; and second, a lay person who is not a doctor but who could be a health board inspector or someone else. It will be up to the Minister to decide in his code of practice who that would be in each health board.  To facilitate that in the definitions we have to make provision for fair play for both the elderly and those running the nursing homes.  We have referred a lot to opinions today, and a second opinion would be no harm in reaching a consensus on the report that will be furnished to those making the ultimate decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the notion of the second opinion.  I have listened to the reasoning behind having a medical and non-medical person acting in concert. There is possibly some merit in that one would have an administrative background and the other would be qualified medically to make a judgment on the situation.  For those reasons I support the amendments put forward by Deputy Yates.</P>

      <P>While I support the spirit of what Deputy Yates has said in regard to two opinion &mdash; two heads are better than one at any time &mdash; I am not sure that writing it specifically into legislation would be beneficial in this case. Certainly in no other health legislation are officers of boards defined in this way. There is a wide variety of staff in health boards who would have involvement in different aspects of the inspection, both of the premises and of the standards, and I suppose the people who do that at the moment are the public health nurses. They do a lot of the work in regard to <Col N="1921" /> standards. There are also technical services officers.  I do not know whether it should be necessary on all occasions that two people would go together to inspect the premises.  After all, if the premises has been registered obviously it would be inspected by a number of people who will be satisfied about the standards of the nursing home, that the staffing arrangements are appropriate, that the physical structure of the building is sound, and that it has all the safety features one would expect in a nursing home.  It would not be appropriate to write that into legislation at this time.  In drawing up the code of practice we can write into it what we would like to see, but we may well find if we write in the amendments as proposed by Deputy Yates that instead of doing what he wants to do we may well leave it restricted, in that, for example, an official of the health board might exclude the board from sending in an outside consultant engineer to look at the premises.  We may well do the reverse of what Deputy Yates intends.  I will be happy to look at it in the code of practice to ensure that the very highest standards are maintained.  In fairness to the health boards, I have to say that in regard to their responsibilities at present they ensure that the appropriate person from the appropriate discipline visits whatever institutions or premises need to be visited to maintain a high standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what has been said.  I am getting a little experience, as is Deputy Howlin, with the Special Committee on the Child Care Bill which the Minister has delegated to his Minister of State.  In nearly all amendments tabled the Minister is in full agreement with our objectives but always finds some reason to reject the specifics of them.  It never ceases to amuse me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill throughout refers to officers of the health board, officials of the health board, representatives and personnel of the health board.  Because this was hastily drafted or for whatever reasons, non-medical personnel could be deciding on medical matters, or less expert opinions could be involved in expert judgments. <Col N="1922" /> My advice is that this is a weakness in the Bill.  I do not want to have a vote on this because it is, after all, just a definition and I do not wish to hold up the House on it, but I do not believe that this provision will stop the health board from getting another opinion such as that of a consultant engineer or whoever.  If the Minister is prepared to give an assurance that in the code of practice and in the regulations, he will adopt the position that within each health board there will be a designated medical practitioner, most likely on the payroll of the health board, involved in the operation of this and that there will be one other officer who would be instrumental in any decision or report made, I will consider withdrawing this.  I ask him also to give a commitment, between now and Report Stage to look at the definitions throughout this Bill to see if they need to be made more specific in relation to the designated functions given to health board personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, some of this is dealt with in the draft regulations.  I will read out the appropriate section.  It provides that the registered proprietor and any other member of the staff of the nursing home shall permit designated officers of health boards who are authorised in that behalf by the health board to enter and inspect the nursing home and shall afford the said officers such facilities and information as they require for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the paragraph above, the registered proprietor shall permit designated officers of the health board who are authorised in that behalf by the health board to examine records kept by the nursing home and to permit, subject to Article 24d, the copying of any such records or of extracts therefrom by any officers.  He shall permit designated officers of the health board who are authorised on behalf of the health board to conduct interviews, including interviews in private, with persons, including staff, in the home where he or she has reasonable cause to believe that a resident in the nursing home is not or has not been <Col N="1923" /> receiving proper care, maintenance, or medical or other treatment and to provide facilities for the conduct of interviews.</P>
    <P>In regard to article 24d of the draft regulations I should point out that nothing in this article authorises any person other than a medical practitioner in the service of a health board, or the patient's general practitioner, to inspect any medical records relating to a patient in a nursing home, and in carrying out inspections a designated officer of the health board shall have regard to the religious beliefs or principles of the patients and the religious ethos of the home.  That is in the regulations but we will take it on board in drawing up the code of practice to ensure that appropriate person or persons will go on the inspection.</P>

      <P>Apart from the official reporters indeed.  I would like two points clarified.  I understand the Minister has accepted that there will be an inspection by at least two people.  There are two issues involved in the amendments.  One is that there will be a minimum of two <Col N="1924" /> people inspecting and not only is there a wish to safeguard the patients but the Irish Private Nursing Homes' Association themselves would like at least two people. Deputy Yates made the point that one of them would have medical experience and qualification and the other not, so there would be a balanced view and there would not be certification on the basis of one aspect of expertise alone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between <Col N="1925" /> lines 26 and 27, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;prescribed fee&rsquo; means a fee set at such a rate as to merely meet the cost of processing applications, taking one year with another;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have discussed already the question of these and the Minister was not prepared to state what he thought would be the fee in question.  He said he was ruling out Deputy Sherlock's amendment that the fee should be at least £250. I think what I am seeking here is not unreasonable. It is that the fee would be seen at best as cost recovery.  It would be in line with no more than the cost of processing these applications for registration, declarations and so on, and taking one year with another that means the fees could be increased.  We have seen health boards introducing mortuary charges.  If you are unfortunate enough to have a relative in a coffin overnight in a mortuary, you can be charged £25 by one health board for that pleasure.  We have seen people charged £10 for appealing their right to have a medical card and a £10 charge for looking for a job with a health board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Health boards have a track record of seeing an opportunity.  Where the word &ldquo;fee&rdquo; appears it lights up in their eyes.  CEOs see the potential of getting all sorts of revenue from it.  Therefore, it is important in this House that we do not leave this matter entirely to the CEOs of the health boards because they have proved adept at resolving the budgetary straitjackets the Minister put them in by trying to raise revenue.  I am seeking here in the definitions to say that a prescribed fee &mdash; which is referred to in the Bill a number of times and in the <Col N="1926" /> Minister's amendments &mdash; would mean a fee set at such a rate to merely meet the cost of processing the applications, taking one year with the other.  The other point, and it is a very important point would mean that all health boards would apply the same fee.  It would not surprise me if the North-Western Health Board and the Eastern Health Board decided on different fees.  This is very common in relation to all aspects of health board services.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there are different fees in different health boards for ambulance charges, that there are different considerations as to when a fee is payable and that there are different appeal processes in the health boards.  It is important that the prescribed fee is reasonable; I suggest that it should range between £50 and £100 and that the increases in the fee will be related to the cost of processing the registration and that one fee would apply whether the nursing home is in Donegal, Kerry or any where else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly share the views expressed by Deputy Yates on the notion that the fee should be left in the air and I would certainly oppose any notion that it should be left to the discretion of the health boards.  Obviously the health boards see any mechanism for raising revenue as simply that. Is it the Minister's intention to set a national fee?  If so that should be made known to the House.  If not, will it be a matter for the health boards? Is it within the Minister's ambit to set the fee or would it be a discretionary devolved function of the health boards? If it is not the Minister's intention to set the fee, he should set clear guidelines.  Deputy Yates's amendment, which seeks to fix the rate of fees at a cost-value, might have some merit but I think the Minister's views on the issue might help to clear our thoughts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the necessity to have a uniform fee within the eight board areas.  The question of the level at which the prescribed fee should be fixed is not exactly analogous to the types of <Col N="1927" /> instances Deputy Yates gave.  There are unfortunately many health boards charges which have to be borne by people who are less well off than nursing home proprietors.  I suspect the relatives of the poor unfortunate who is left in the mortuary overnight are less capable of bearing the fee for the service than the proprietors of nursing homes.  In my view, the fee should be fixed at such a level that it is capable of funding the operation of the Act. I am not so sure that on reconsideration Deputy Yates would differ from the view that the fee should be at least such that it will fund the operation of the Act. After all nurses, for example, have to fund the administration of their own professional body. The Minister will be aware of the recent legislation in this area.  If a professional group such as nurses are required to fund their own professional organisations, it is reasonable to expect the owners of nursing homes to do similarly.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear what the Minister has in mind, as this is not something that should be left hanging in the air. I think the Minister hinted earlier that the amendment from my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, which would seek to set a minimum level, was regarded as entirely too low.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House that the fee will be prescribed by the Minister and that the health boards will not have discretion to vary the fee. With regard to Deputy Sherlock's amendment to set the fee at £250, I consider this too high because at the end of the day it will be the consumer who will pay and the consumer will be the dependent person in the nursing home.  We will be discussing the level of the fee with the health boards and the nursing homes.  It is intended that the fee will cover the cost of processing applications for registration. What may be involved is a fee <Col N="1928" /> relative to the size of the nursing home, in other words, two fees, a fee for a nursing home of a certain size and a fee for a larger nursing home.  The fees suggested by Deputy Yates would appear to be within the bounds of reason &mdash;&mdash;</P>

But in fairness to everybody, the fees should be determined according to the size of the nursing home.  This would alleviate the problem on the smaller homes which will now have to spend money to comply with the regulations.</P>

      <P>During my 29-minute contribution last evening I was stressing the right of Parliament, the right of the Oireachtas.  I do not need to elaborate except to say that the Labour Party will be pressing their amendment which deals with neutrality.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Members on this side of the House to realise that all the arguments made by Deputy Barry and me are ones to strengthen the rights of this House to be equivalent to the rights of Parliaments all over Europe to debate foreign policy and to establish foreign policy as an accountable aspect of debate, accountable to the public.  It has inner and outer dimensions in relation to the public's perception.</P>
      <P>There would be no problem in agreeing the terms of discourse.  I would appeal to the Government even at this late stage to reconsider their position.  The thrust of my speech is that in no modern democracy does any parliament say that the secrecy, the subtlety and competence of diplomacy should be used as a substitute for accountable foreign policy which is contributed to by elected members to an assembly, which in turn is accountable to the public.  Our privileges as parliamentarians are at stake and our utility as a Parliament.</P>
      <P>If the Government side were willing to accept the principles of what we are saying they would find us accommodating, amenable and constructive.  It would be very wrong to think that people such as Deputy Barry, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, or people such as I, those in The Workers' Party and others, would be anything but constructive in such a committee.  I appeal to them to pull back from the position of last evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his <Col N="1933" /> contribution to our debate in this House last evening, Deputy Barry rightly drew attention to the many complex developments currently unfolding in Eastern Europe and the knock-on effect these developments have for Ireland and the rest of the Community.  I can assure Deputy Barry that the Government are very much aware of these developments and are actively monitoring the situation and their possible or likely impact on Ireland.  The Government's position is not passive nor could it be, given Ireland's current EC Presidency role on the one hand and the need to protect our legitimate national interests on the other.</P>
      <P>We are witnessing momentous and historical events and accelerating changes in Europe.  The moulds which have shaped and bound our continent since 1945 are being broken with a rapidity which defies imagination.  The last European Council foreshadowed these developments in its call for the strengthening of peace in Europe in which the German people will regain their unity through free self-determination.</P>
      <P>These developments hold out the promise of a better way of life for those directly concerned, the people of Eastern Europe themselves.  Throughout the region we can see how the tide of political and economic reform is bringing about change which even a short time ago would have been unthinkable.  Democracy, greater openness, pluralism and respect for human rights are still rapidly gaining ground.  We are very pleased at these developments and believe that they are not only desirable and good in themselves, but that they are also essential in order to overcome the economic and other problems of these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the changes which are taking place, both in domestic and in foreign policy, have had a profound influence on international opinion and have made an enormous contribution to the dramatic improvement in East-West relations which has come about in recent years.  In particular, the two Super Powers are now actively engaged in building a new relationship which transcends the antagonisms of the past.  Co-operation is <Col N="1934" /> replacing confrontation.  We hope that this trend has become irreversible and is leading the world ever further away from the confrontations of the past which at times threatened to turn into open conflict. I think we all share the feeling that what we are experiencing now is not just another episode in the cold war, when history itself seemed to have frozen over. The cold war is now over and we have reached an important turning point in European history and world history.</P>
    <P>The Government have actively followed developments in Eastern Europe and, from the outset of Ireland's EC Presidency we have been conscious of the rapid pace of developments there and their profound implications for the Community and its member states.  The special ministerial meeting in Dublin last January, called on the initiative of the Presidency, considered the Community's responses to the changes which were taking place in Eastern Europe.  This initiative manifested our intention and ability to make a contribution to ensuring that these changes will be to the advantage of all and underscored the relevance of the Community's own integration to the future of Europe as a whole.  Ireland and its partners in the Community have displayed their determination to support the political and economic reforms in Eastern Europe through a variety of measures, including intensification of political dialogue and increased co-operation.</P>
    <P>Two important meetings within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe take place during our Presidency.  The Bonn Economic Conference is the first major CSCE conference in the economic sphere.  Its aim is to give a new impetus to economic relations between the CSCE participating States.  Ireland and its Community partners see the Bonn conference as an opportunity to demonstrate in a concrete manner our readiness to respond to change in Eastern Europe and to strengthen moves there towards political and economic reform.  In the area of human rights, the Copenhagen meeting <Col N="1935" /> of the Conference on the Human Dimension will examine the implementation of the human rights and human contacts provisions of the CSCE documents and will seek to make further progress in these spheres.  Ireland, as EC Presidency-in-Office has an important contribution to make in bringing about a successful outcome to these two meetings.</P>
    <P>While changes in Eastern Europe have for the most part taken place peacefully &mdash; Romania being the outstanding exception &mdash; this is nevertheless a time of tension which has to be managed with care and responsibility.  German unification is a central question.  There can now be no doubt that this development corresponds to the wishes of the German people and the Government accordingly welcome it. The Government believe that it marks the beginning of a process which will restore the unity of the civilisation which is common to all European countries, East and West.  Such a major transformation of Europe's political landscape must, of course, be handled in a way which takes account of the legitimate interests of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The European Community is naturally deeply affected by all these changes.  This is why Ireland, as EC President-in-Office took the initiative to propose to have them discussed at a special EC Summit Meeting next month.  We are deeply conscious of how our own development as a Community of nations is influenced by events in Eastern Europe.  Equally the Community has an enormous influence on events in Eastern Europe and a corresponding responsibility.</P>
    <P>A number of measures of trade liberalisations have been taken by the Community <i>vis-à-vis</i> Poland and Hungary. These measures, which include the abolition of quantitative instructions and the extension of the generalised scheme of preferences, are designed to assist the Polish and Hungarian economies by boosting their export earnings.  They were considered carefully by member states, including England, before their adoption.  They are not without cost or risk but this had to be seen against the <Col N="1936" /> background of our desire and commitment and that of the Twelve to materially assist the emergence of democracy in Central and Eastern Europe.  If and when the question arises of further such measures, or of the extension of the Polish and Hungarian concessions to other countries, I can assure the Deputies that all the implications, political and economic, will be taken into account before a decision is made.</P>
    <P>With regard to EC relations with EFTA, the thrust of current Community activity is to work out a new, closer relationship between the two, particularly in the context of 1992.  The implications of a new EFTA-EC arrangement have been examined closely by the Department of Foreign Affairs and continue to be the subject of discussion in the Community.  Fundamental to our approach is our wish to see an agreement of the greatest possible mutual interest to the EC and EFTA and one that is global and balanced in character.</P>
    <P>In the context of all these rapid and momentous developments, there is no reason to believe that the Oireachtas is in practice, less well informed than other Legislatures.  In recent months, events in Eastern Europe as, indeed, also other matters such as the situation in the Middle East, Cambodia and famine relief, have been discussed in one or other of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I wish now to turn to a number of aspects of the proposed committee which I find curious.  The committee would have the power to oversee the expenditure of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I need hardly point out that this function is already discharged by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I cannot see what useful purpose would be served by a duplication of their role and activity in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Duplication could also arise in relation to the work of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  This committee examine EC legislation together with domestic implementing measures.  They report <Col N="1937" /> to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the broad range of foreign policy including issues arising from our membership of the European Communities. The committee would have the power to discuss all aspects of foreign policy.  To this extent an overlapping with the functions of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation would seem inevitable.</P>
    <P>There are, I believe, adequate arrangements and opportunities already in existence whereby Members of the Oireachtas can raise and discuss foreign policy matters of interest and concern to them. These arrangements have already been outlined by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In the view of the Government what is proposed in the motion would not involve progress in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in this House last night that the Government's attitude to the role of elected representatives in relation to the State's foreign policy is arrogant and disrespectful.  This is decidedly not the case.  Public understanding of and support for foreign policy positions are vital elements in the democratic process.  The Government fully acknowledge this fundamental fact and conducts their relationship with the Legislature in the matter of foreign policy, as in other areas, accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I should like to share my time with Deputy Connor.  Fine Gael brought this motion before the House out of a sheer sense of exasperation, because of their repeated efforts to ensure that we do the obvious thing and have an all-party committee to deal with something which is at the core of our value, an interest in foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas in which we have distinguished ourselves in relation to our image abroad has been the consistent interest which we, as a small nation took in foreign policy at United Nations and European Council levels and within the EC.  We prided ourselves on having an open, fair, objective and impartial view in relation to the conduct of foreign <Col N="1938" /> affairs.  Therefore, it seems incredible that in the much heralded, vaunted and anticipated Presidency of the EC the Taoiseach did not indicate that he is prepared to relent and set up such a committee. Indeed, when talking to members of the Government side in a private capacity they will acknowledge that such a committee is needed, although they must vote as directed by the Whip.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach was received by a foreign policy committee last week in the United States but that, if rolls were reversed, we would not be in a position to reciprocate such a gesture.  I do not know what the apprehension or worry is because nobody seeks to make such a committee a political organ, a political forum or a contentious debating chamber where there will be clear distinctions in relation to where we stand on foreign policy.  One of the things which has characterised us as a nation is that we have managed abroad to present a very unified and coherent policy in relation to foreign affairs and, therefore, I fail to see why the Government will not relent on this issue.  I was discouraged &mdash; indeed disheartened &mdash; to hear the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, in relation to the official attitude of the Government to the very reasonable thrust, performance and proposal of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Fine Gael spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly tried at Whip level to impress on the Government the genuine need and desire for such a committee and the apolitical nature of our request but we have failed to do so.  I wrote this week to the Whip of the Progressive Democrats Party, the other party in Coalition, asking them to do in Government what they maintained was so fundamental when they were in Opposition as a party of 14 Deputies.  I asked them to insist and to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Government to ensure that common sense prevails.  They should do the intelligent and reasonable thing, establish a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>I distinctly recall in the office of the <Col N="1939" /> Government Chief Whip repeatedly setting the Order of Business from the time I was appointed Fine Gael Chief Whip in August 1988 up to the demise of nine members of the Progressive Democrats, being in agreement regarding this committee with the then Progressive Democrats Chief Whip and spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Miss Kennedy.  I repeatedly requested that the Government relent in this regard and we validated our claims, put forward our arguments and showed that there was a genuine need and desire for such a committee. However, the Government did not agree but the Progressive Democrats have a golden opportunity this evening in the House to show that the position they adopted then was not simply posturing in Opposition.  They have the clout, strength, conviction and sense of purpose to do their duty, to ensure that they make the necessary impression on the Government to do something positive to set up this committee.</P>
    <P>The vote will take place at 8.30 p.m. and even though I have not had any kind of contact with the Progressive Democrats I hope when the votes are counted that they will have done the decent thing by the people who voted for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Higgins for allowing me to share his time. As a Member who has an interest in foreign affairs I should like to play a meaningful role in the formulation of foreign policy, albeit from the Opposition benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most disheartning that the response of the Government, as expressed in the very banal speech of the Minister of State last night, is, to say the least, dreadfully disappointing.  The Minister's excuses were quite unbelievable. He seemed to state that the Members of this House do not seem to have the competence to advise on or influence this country's foreign policy. Deputy Barry, Deputy Michael D. Higgins and others mentioned foreign affairs committees in other Parliaments throughout Europe.  The point has been <Col N="1940" /> rightly made that there is not a parliamentary system in the developed world as we know it &mdash; broadly speaking what we call the white Commonwealth system or the American or the French system, that does not have a very powerful committee on foreign affairs.  I will not mention the other European states because they were talked about last night but I do not think anybody mentioned the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, one of the most powerful committees of that Parliament. The Irish members of all shades participate very fully in that committee. Another good example is that of the United States of America.  At times I am a critic of their foreign policy but in that country there is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the most powerful committee in the United States parliamentary system.  Alongside that is the House Foreign Affairs committee. I would repeat that the Senate Foreign Relations committee is probably the most powerful and prestigious committee in the American parliamentary system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>So prestigious that the Taoiseach visited them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary duty of that committee is, as the Constitution of the United States say, to advise on and consent to the appointment of the American Secretary of State, the American Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The area of foreign affairs is the chief area of public policy in the United States.  The United States is a huge world power and sometimes we disagree more than we agree with their foreign policies.  The foreign affairs committees both of the Senate and of the House, have a major influence in the formulation of American foreign policy.  No American chief executive can digress or diverge too far from the thinking of these committees of both Houses. While we might be critical of their conduct of foreign policy there is one safeguard that I and other Members of this House know is there and we cannot take it from them, that American foreign policy by and large reflects American <Col N="1941" /> democracy.  American democracy via the medium of its foreign affairs committees of both Houses is rooted in the making and carrying out of American foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why we should take such an immature attitude or is it that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is so weak that he feels the Members of this House are immature or ill-informed so far as foreign affairs are concerned? I know there is a difficulty in the Government party because, by tradition they have been isolationist and anti-internationalist. Their contribution to the development of a foreign affairs policy has not been great.  I do not wish to denigrate anybody but I think that is an objective history of the contribution of Fianna Fáil to foreign affairs policy and the development of foreign affairs in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, we have moved into a whole new set of circumstances.  We are now part of a new multi-national consortium of nations, that is the European Community which is growing ever greater in a movement towards integration. Is it not only right and fair to ask that Members of this Sovereign parliament would have a say in those major movements? We pride ourselves on our influence in the world.  There is no doubt that Ireland has a major influence in the world.  One of the better things I did with my time, when I was younger and had more time and money than I have now, was to travel extensively throughout the world.  The amount of goodwill and information abroad about this country always surprised me.  I always felt it was something we never fully took advantage of and something we were never fully aware of in this House.  The populace outside were more aware of it than the people here who are the legislators.  Certainly from a political and a policy point of view we never took full advantage of that goodwill which could reap us all kinds of rewards.  One of the reasons was that we did not have the type of public participation in the formulation of foreign policy that was needed because we did not have a committee of elected public <Col N="1942" /> representatives of both Houses to make contributions.</P>
    <P>One of my major political interests has been emigration.  That is surely a foreign affairs issue.  In 1988, according to official figures 46,000 people left this country and I am sure the figure was the same, if not greater, in 1989.  I believe these official figures err on the lower side.  If we look at the last decade it is realistic to say that some 300,000 people emigrated to the United States, the United Kingdom, various parts of Europe, Australia and other places.  There are some three million people in this country at present.  The number of people, young people of one generation, who have left represents about 10 per cent of the total population and yet there is no foreign or foreign relations outreach to those people.</P>
    <P>With Deputy Barry and two other colleagues, I went to the United States last September to talk to the American congressional leaders, to lobby and to plead with them about bringing about legislative changes in US emigration laws that would be favourable to the 90 per cent or more of the Irish emigrants who are out of status there.  Everywhere we went we were told there was no great communication at official level between the Irish Government and the United States congressional leaders.  They were delighted that people like us went to talk to them.  We found ourselves having to go around from office to office and talk to ordinary representatives and Senators from all over the United States who knew nothing about the problem of Irish emigration.</P>
    <P>One of the major items on the agenda of a foreign affairs committee, if the Government had the wisdom to allow it to be established, would be a discussion on and formulation of an emigration policy, to be expressed as part of our foreign relations policy.  That is one of the other major areas in which we have found ourselves to be so wanting.  There is probably a feeling of embarrassment on the far side of the House about emigration but we all know that emigration has been a problem for more than one Government in the last decade.  We are <Col N="1943" /> not afraid to face up to that fact and we are not afraid to put in place a formal structure where we could discuss and make policies for what is a lost generation of Irish people who have left this country in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>There have been, as has been mentioned, all kinds of momentous events in Europe in recent months.  More happened in the last six months than perhaps since the end of World War II.  There is much that Members of this House would like to have said or would like to have felt they were influencing in terms of policy in relation to these momentous and historic events.  Mention was made of a procedure for Dáil questions, for Private Members' time, which we are using now, and for raising items on the Adjournment of the House.  I know the procedure we are using now is perhaps the best one because we have a better inter-face across the House and a better statement of policies on all sides of the House.  Parliamentary questions are asked on wide-ranging and complex issues but there is taciturnity and secrecy on the part of certain Ministers.  I have never got a fully satisfactory answer to any parliamentary question that I have tabled in this House, least of all to any question, and I have tabled two or three, on foreign affairs matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not asking the right questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather cheap jibe.  Items are also raised on the Adjournment.  We raise points on Cambodia and on other places and a structured statement, that may be weeks out of date, is made by the Minister.  The proposers of the Adjournment debate usually raise matters which are relevant and up to date because it is usually a reaction to something that has taken place very recently but the Minister replying has a structured, stale statement on which there can be no dialogue across the Floor of the House, no questioning of some outrageous and often very inaccurate statements by Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> Our policy on neutrality has never been fully discussed by Members.  I participated in a good debate in the Seanad less than a year ago on that subject but the matter has never been fully discussed by Members of this House.  We have not had a forum in which Members could participate in a meaningful discussion on our policy of neutrality.  I am aware that there are several Members on the benches opposite who do not agree with the policy line given to them, a line that has been turned and twisted to suit the times over the years.  To say the least, our neutrality stance has often been immature.  While I do not disagree with our stance on neutrality it is my belief that we could bring a lot more principle into the stances we have taken.  I am not referring to principles of convenience to be changed with every whim and wind that blows.  I submit that one way of dealing with this would be through a proper committee of the Houses where the issue could be discussed openly and frankly.  On such a committee we could, as adults representing our constituencies, our parties and the political philosophy and culture of those parties, put forward our views on neutrality.  An Oireachtas Joint Committee which would reflect the political philosophy and culture of all parties would be in a position to update our policy on neutrality, making it more meaningful and less hypocritical than it has been.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State suggested that we were seeking to establish a committee that would have extensive powers.  He seemed to think such a committee would be dangerous, bad or wrong.  In our motion we are not seeking extensive powers for such a committee. We are seeking the right to advise on, to discuss and consider matters of foreign policy.  We are seeking the right to influence. It should be remembered that the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs do not have a monopoly of wisdom in regard to foreign policy. Elected representatives have a major role to play.  The people of the island are interested in all aspects of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that Irish people are more <Col N="1945" /> informed about political and social matters beyond their shores then the populations of most other countries.  I represent a rural constituency and hardly a week goes by that I do not receive a letter or a representation from a constituent who is concerned about a foreign affairs issue.  I was amazed at the number of people who approached me about the problems in Ethiopia.  Some think that people in the part of the world I come from have very little interest in Ethiopia but that is not the case.  Last week a constituent raised the civil war in the Sudan with me.  Frankly, I had to update myself on the position in that war.  That is an indication of the level of interest among ordinary people about what is happening throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Deputies and Senators should demand a formal participatory system under which we can influence foreign policy and respond to the feelings of our constituents, irrespective of what aspect of foreign policy they raise with us.  It is an absurdity to say that we are seeking extensive powers; we are seeking to put democracy into the formulation of our foreign policy.  The Minister questioned why we should seek the responsibility of overseeing the activities and expenditure of the Department of Foreign Affairs. We have every right to oversee the activities of that Department.  All Departments are subject to the political control and power of the House.  The point was made that they must account for their expenditure activities to the Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member.  It will be no harm if they have to submit the reasons for their expenditure to a foreign affairs committee of the House.  They should not have anything to fear or to hide about submitting every detail about their activities to such a committee without threatening State security.  We did not ask that such a committee should be given classified information or told anything that might threaten State security.  We want a say in the general direction of our foreign policy and in advising on that policy.  That is what democracy is all <Col N="1946" /> about.  We are seeking to put democracy into the conduct of our foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have a change of heart in regard to this issue.  It will not cost a lot of money to put such a committee in place.  At the end of the day I am sure the Minister will find that such a committee will be beneficial to his.  The Minister has a considerable knowledge of international affairs and I am sure he does not always accept the advice of the officials in his Department.  I am not blaming them in any way for their actions but I am saying that the Minister should consider other inputs.  The structures of the House are not very good for advising the Minister.  Deputy Michael Higgins referred to the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in the Coalition. Deputy Molloy is on record as saying that we need a committee on foreign affairs. Deputies Harney and Quill said something similar.  I appeal to them to support the motion.</P>
    <P>I was a Member in the period from 1983 to 1987 when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, established a joint committee on developing countries. That joint committee commenced operations in 1983 and with other Members I spent four very satisfying years on that committee.  That was as near as we ever came to having a committee on foreign affairs.  In that short time we took a new look at that aspect of our foreign affairs policy.  Ireland, because of its nightmare colonial past, has a lot in common with ex-colonial countries in the Third World, particularly those in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  There is an enormous amount of goodwill for Ireland in those countries, as we discovered in our work on that committee.  In 1984 when the famine in Ethiopia was at its worst the joint committee broke from the summer recess in August after we had seen the horrendous pictures on television detailing the horrific famine in that country. Following that debate we had the Band Aid concerts and fund raising activities to help the starving people of Ethiopia. The initiation of that was the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on our relations with developing countries.  We <Col N="1947" /> did an excellent document on apartheid, and the way the various apartheid laws affect the black population in South Africa.  We also reported extensively on the effects of apartheid on the front line states in southern Africa.  That, too, was a document which was something of a milestone in the parliamentary work of this House because I think everybody agreed at the time that it was an excellent analysis, done by ordinary Members of this House of a truly explosive situation, a situation that has changed in many ways in recent years.  It would be very satisfactory if we were able to reform ourselves as a committee and look at that situation now and compare it with the situation which we looked at way back in 1984 and 1985.</P>

      <P>The Government's position in relation to the motion before the House regarding the establishment of a foreign affairs committee was set out last night by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Sean Calleary, and was taken up again tonight by the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Vincent Brady.

      <P>I should like to place on the record my invitation to all parties in the House to avail of every opportunity to have debates on foreign policy matters.  I would welcome such a discussion.  There are many issues on which the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs would welcome the viewpoint of the parties and their members and I hope there are more occasions on which issues chosen by the parties opposite will be debated.  I would welcome such debates. I am sure the Government would be willing to come to an arrangement with the Whips to provide time for this type of debate which could be by way of Private Member's motion.  Some facilities can be afforded to Members so that they can play an active role &mdash; I am sure in a positive way &mdash; in the ongoing debate which should be taking place on current issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect the role of Parliament, I am a long standing Member of this Parliament and at every opportunity I have taken great pains to ensure that Parliament is what it must and should be.  As I have said, I would be glad to have more discussions on foreign affairs issues.  When I was in Opposition and Deputy Peter Barry was Minister for Foreign Affairs I <Col N="1954" /> asked &mdash; this is on the record of the House &mdash; for more time to be allowed debate foreign affairs matters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are not of the view that the proposal contained in this motion and the amendments to it are helpful in this context.</P>
      <P>I accept that some Members opposite are of a different view.  Indeed in the discussions on the motion in this House last night and tonight a number of points were made to which I feel I should reply.</P>
      <P>I was saddened to hear, once again, the false accusations about Government policy on Cambodia being brought into this debate.  I have on many occasions explained clearly in this House the Government's policy on this question and, especially, our total rejection of the genocidal Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.  The Twelve, under the Irish Presidency, have made clear that they share this position and are fully supportive of measures &mdash; such as those promoted by the Australian Foreign Minister &mdash; which would give the Cambodian people the opportunity to choose their own leaders in free and fair elections and prevent the return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be in all our interests if we had more debates in this House on matters which are of importance, and not just by way of committee, so that we can at least understand each others point of view.  If there are differences of opinion on policy these can be teased out by way of debate. I am prepared to do this because I would not like the present situation to continue where, according to the unofficial reports of last night's debate, some Members are <Col N="1955" /> still not sure about the position on the issue I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>The question was asked as to why this Parliament, alone of all Parliaments in the European Community, lacks a foreign affairs committee.  The House will be aware that parliamentary system and parliamentary procedures vary from country to country.  The functions and powers of parliamentary committees and, indeed, of parliamentary committees on foreign affairs vary from country to country.  While the question is an interesting one, and no doubt one of significance to some Members of the Oireachtas, I do not believe that we ought to be over eager in our criticism of our institutions and arrangements solely on the basis of international comparisons. The essential question must be whether our procedures, institutions and arrangements serve our needs.  I believe they do. In an effort to make sure that they do, I will involve this House in as much debate as this Dáil wants on policy issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that is all I have but that is not the fault of anyone in this House.  That I am sure of and that I accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was claimed that the Government's position on this motion, based in part on the frequent sensitivity and confidentiality of diplomatic and foreign policy matters, is offensive to Members of the Oireachtas.  The assertion was made that: the Government's position amounts to saying &ldquo;that you cannot trust the elected representatives to speak <Col N="1956" /> about foreign policy&rdquo;.  This is most emphatically not the case.  There are adequate opportunities available in both Houses of the Oireachtas for Members to raise any aspect of foreign policy of interest or concern to them.  I go further than this.  There is an obligation on elected representatives to be well-informed on international affairs and the State's foreign policy.  But I also believe that a straightforward and clinical dichotomy between foreign policy and the means by which foreign policy objectives are achieved, in other words diplomatic activity, which is best pursued out of the public domain, is not always practicable.</P>
    <P>Exception was taken to the reference to sectional interests.  I believe this is misplaced.  Let me be clear about this and re-state what has been said on a previous occasion.  Unlike individual Members of the Oireachtas, Governments cannot allow themselves to be swayed by sectional interests but must take all factors into account in deciding on the pursuit of foreign policy objectives.  This is not because sectional interests are, in themselves, wrong or unworthy, but because the Government unlike individual and I emphasise the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo;, elected representatives have a bounden duty to be directed by broad national considerations.</P>
    <P>Likewise there is nothing disrespectful in the use of the word &ldquo;select&rdquo; to decribe a small group.  My dictionary defines the word select as meaning &ldquo;chosen for excellence&rdquo;. Does this use of the word present a problem to the supporters of the motion?</P>
    <P>I would like to reply to Deputy Higgins' remarks yesterday on not &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; with opposition groups, with specific reference to the African National Congress.  He referred to &ldquo;an established principle&rdquo; and went on to say that &ldquo;we could deal with the South African Government indirectly but we could not deal with the ANC&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not totally sure what the Deputy means by &ldquo;an established principle&rdquo; of not dealing with opposition unless he is referring to the generally accepted principle that in international relations governments deal with governments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" /> This does not exclude contacts with opposition groups.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the case of the ANC, to which the Deputy specifically refers, we have had contacts at official level with ANC representatives over the years.  I might also add that ANC President Oliver Tambo was received by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs when he visited Dublin in 1979.  Most recently, the Taoiseach last month extended an invitation to ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela to visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>Much was made last evening of the powers, extensive or otherwise, of the proposed committee and whether it conformed to the Netherlands model or to the Danish model or to some other model.  The motion provides that the committee would consider such aspects of the Government's foreign policy and, in particular, the Government's official development assistance to developing countries as the committee may select; oversee the activities and expenditure of the Department of Foreign Affairs; report annually to both Houses and make other reports as it thinks fit; have the power to send for persons, papers and records.</P>
    <P>This list of powers is significant and, dare I say, extensive.  Would the supporters of the motion have it otherwise? Would they wish to have the powers of the proposed committee described as &ldquo;weak&rdquo; or &ldquo;circumvented&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins noted in the debate that Ireland last year ratified the two international covenants elaborated on the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The ratification of international legal instruments always entails a full examination of what legislative or other measures may be necessary to allow Ireland become a party to a convention. It is sometimes necessary, for constitutional, legislative or other reasons, to enter a reservation as to the full application of a provision of an instrument.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to a reservation entered by Ireland on prison accommodation. It is worth noting that Ireland accepts the principles referred to in the <Col N="1958" /> Article in question and implements them as far is practically possible.  We regard full implementation of these principles as objectives to be achieved progressively.</P>
    <P>The question of political and social studies in schools was also mentioned last night.  In so far as development education is concerned I should say that considerable progress has been made in including development education components in subjects such as geography, where a significant element in the leaving certificate course covers Third World development issues.  Furthermore, my Department have, through their support for the Development Education Support Centre (DESC) and through grant assistance for teachers' in-service courses and for schools materials, encouraged and increased emphasis on development education in classrooms at all levels in the education system.</P>
    <P>I regret, a Cheann Comhairle that I cannot deal with this as I would like to. I will conclude by saying again to Deputy Barry and the spokespersons for the other parties who are here that I welcome every opportunity for debate in this House on foreign affairs matters because I think it would be helpful.  I want to make one comment on what Deputy Connor said in regard to a visit he made recently to Washington with Deputies Barry and Deenihan.  He said that from his contacts there he discovered that there was no official contact between the Department of Foreign Affairs officials and the legislators on Capital Hill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wonder.  If I am misreading what the Deputy said I apologise. I want to pay a special compliment to the ambassador and staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Washington for what they are doing on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland on Capitol Hill to help those out-of-status young people in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat what Deputy Connor said just now.  The Minister is mistaken.  Deputy Connor did not say that.  In fact I am not absolutely sure, but I was with him in America and I certainly heard him pay tribute to the contacts being built up between the Embassy and the officials there and Capitol Hill.  The Minister should not go away with any other impression.</P>
      <P>Before I start, I want to put on the record that I think that Deputy De Rossa was totally out of order tonight in interrupting and I am afraid he made a farce of what should have been a useful debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has taken the opportunity tonight to correct and reinterpret some of the language used last night by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I would have to say that I admired the dexterity of the wielders of the pen in the Department of Foreign Affairs when they reinterpreted some of the words that were used by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, last night for the Minister, Deputy Collins tonight with, I must say, good effect, because I would certainly think that the speech delivered by Deputy Seán Calleary, the Minister of State, last night, spoke down to the Members of this House and treated us with almost dismissive contempt as people who had no contribution to make to foreign affairs.  It is entirely regrettable that a speech of that nature should go on the record of this democratically elected Parliament at a time when we are constantly hearing speeches from that side of the House &mdash; indeed, I make them myself &mdash; saying how much encouragement we must give to the democratic process in Eastern <Col N="1960" /> Europe.  It is very regrettable that a speech like that went on the record of this House last night.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said it is fair to state that many of these negotiations stand little chance of success if conducted in the public eye.  We all know that, but that is not what we are talking about when we talk about a foreign affairs committee. We are talking about the opportunity of discussing with the Minister, his representatives and the officials in his Department, aspects of foreign affairs, to get an explanation as to what way certain things are done and to suggest other things that might be done some time in the future.  There is no question of this being a star chamber in which Ministers and officials would be paraded in front of a group of parliamentarians to rap their knuckles or to pass motions.  A rather insidious phrase crept in later to which I will refer in a second.  The idea is not to rap their knuckles or force policy decisions to which they must adhere. Even in the unlikely circumstance of conflict, because of the way committees are formed in this House, the Government have a majority on a committee and therefore any attempt to force a policy decision on the Government would be defeated by the Government majority on the committee.  If it is not and the Government lose by some chance of a person being missing or something like that, it comes back here and the Government will put on a three line whip and make sure that does not happen.  Therefore, it is a nonsense to suggest that this committee are going to behave in an unreasonable and undemocratic way.</P>
    <P>I agree with virtually everything the Minister who spoke tonight said.  It is more or less what I was saying myself. The speech tonight was almost an apologia for what was said last night.  I am referring to what was said last night to show that it was an unhelpful contribution to this debate.  The Minister repeated tonight what the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, said last night about the opportunities we have in this House for discussion.  I welcome every one of these opportunities.  I suggested <Col N="1961" /> on many occasions when I was where the Minister, Deputy Collins, is now that we do not have enough debates in this House on foreign affairs.  I hope to see more. The pressure on the timetable of this House is partly responsible for that lack. Therefore, committees work in a far better atmosphere and far better work can be done by them.  I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. The Minister, the Chief Whip and the Minister of State, have said that there would be an overlap between that committee and this new committee were they to be set up.  In theory that could be correct so far as affairs relating to Europe are concerned, but there is a big world outside Europe, and certainly we could not debate, except in regard to their effect on the EC, what is happening in Eastern Europe now, whereas we could debate it on a foreign affairs committee. That would be helpful.</P>
    <P>The Minister tonight and the Minister of State last night referred to the debate on Cambodia and motions such as that. The problem about such motions is that only statements are made.  There is not a real debate there.  There are only statements made by certain people in the House in that regard, so it is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The other example given is parliamentary questions.  They are helpful.  A great deal of information can be got in that way.  Deputies have the opportunity of questioning Ministers about certain things, but again the time pressure is here.  I say, somewhat against myself, that Question Time is weighted against those who are not spokespersons for the respective parties because we have the priority questions.  When questions on foreign affairs come up next week some time, of the five priority questions put down which will take up 20 per cent of the time I will have three, Deputy Higgins will have one and Deputy Rabbitte or somebody else will have the other and that will be it.  On the remaining maybe 100 questions put down to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, about 20 of which will be taken, only a limited number of <Col N="1962" /> Deputies will be able to contribute. Therefore, while Question Time is helpful it is not a substitute for a committee on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night mentioned the reports on developments in Eastern Europe.  The last published report for that related to the period June to December 1987.  The Estimates debate, which used to be very broad ranging and would last for maybe three days for each Estimate, now embraces maybe ten or 12 Estimates pushed into one day at the end of every term and foreign affairs might get three quarters of an hour or, at most, an hour and a half which is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State last night referred to the sensitivity of these other sovereign states with which he has to do business.  He said the sensitivity arose because we were dealing with other sovereign states either bilaterally or multilaterally and that they, like us, had an important national interest to defend or promote.  That is true; that is what foreign affairs are all about.  Every country promotes its own national interest in foreign affairs.  Of course, every one of these sovereign states has its own foreign affairs committee.  That did not occur to the Minister last night.  We are very sensitive about insulting them but they have not the slightest difficulty about insulting us.  We have no foreign affairs committee.  It is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>As we said a number of times last night, we had a committee here between 1981 and 1989 dealing with overseas aid.  That was appreciated by all Members of this House whether in Opposition or in Government at the time.  To the best of my knowledge Fianna Fáil Deputies who were on that committee and who were then in Opposition made no effort to embarrass the Government of the day.  I am waiting to be contradicted by Deputy Owen who was Chairman of that committee. Members treated that committee very seriously.  It enabled them to make substantial constructive suggestions and they felt they were making a contribution towards the Government's policy on overseas development aid.  I do not see <Col N="1963" /> why any Member of this House, if he was on a foreign affairs committee meeting in a much broader sense than just dealing with overseas aid, would behave differently. There is no question of any Member of this House wanting to embarrass the Government when they are dealing with another country but there is every wish by those in this House who want this committee established to have some say in the foreign affairs of this State.  We do not want to usurp in any way the Government's role in this matter or the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We do not want to dictate policies to Government.  We do not want to haul an assistant secretary in the embassy in Peking in here and question him about how much he spent for his lunch the previous day.  That is not what is intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister tonight and the Minister of State last night went through the terms of reference I listed for this committee, picked holes in them and poked fun at some of them.  That is fair; that is politics and I do not object to it.  I would do exactly the same if I were on their side in certain circumstances.  Let me say that if the principle of establishing a committee on foreign affairs is accepted by this Government &mdash; I cannot speak for the Labour Party in this regard and the Labour Party's amendment to this motion is the only one that has been moved &mdash; I will be entirely reasonable and open to discussion with the Minister or anybody else as to the terms of reference of that committee.  If the Minister will now indicate that he will do that I will withdraw my motion and will have discussions in the next week or ten days with him, with no preconditions, with a view to having that committee established.</P>
    <P>Reference was made last night to the cost and effort involved in the difficult period of the Presidency.  We are not talking about something that is going to <Col N="1964" /> last for only three months.  By the time we get this committee established our Presidency will be nearly over.  It is now half way through so we are talking about only three months.  There is a considerable increase in the Estimate for Foreign Affairs for this year to deal with the Presidency, and whatever costs will attach to running this committee will not take up 1 per cent of that increase.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of this House, I thought the condescending, patronising speech of the Minister of State last night was not helpful to rational debate.  Leaving that aside, I have been extremely reasonable about this and I am prepared to sit down with the Minister and talk about the matter.  I cannot say in advance that I will agree but I am willing to talk to a set of terms of reference which the Minister feels would protect whatever reserves and concerns he and his Department have about this committee.  I hope the Minister will accept that and I will then not put the motion to a vote, so that we can be constructive.  It would be very much appreciated if the Minister set up a committee of the Oireachtas on foreign affairs.</P>

      <P>It is now 8.30 p.m. and unless the Minister wishes to make a short reply, I will proceed to put the question on amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Spring and others.  I gather that is what is required of me in the silence of the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following definition: &ldquo;`records' shall mean all records excluding clinical and financial records;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment.  I would refer the House to section 6 (2) (g).  In that section in which are stated the regulations health boards may lay down in relation to having proper standards in nursing, paragraph (g) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prescribe requirements as to the <Col N="1973" /> records to be kept in nursing homes and for the examination and copying of any such record or of extracts therefrom by officers of health boards.</P>
    <P>In my last amendment which was not accepted, I defined officer of the health board as &ldquo;designated medical practitioner&rdquo; because I believe it could be of some concern as to the definition of the records, as envisaged in paragraph (g) of section 6.  Therefore, I am moving an amendment that records shall mean all records, excluding clinical and financial records.  It is envisaged, under paragraph (g), that these clinical records would be photocopied &mdash; it is clearly stated that they would be copied &mdash; and that they would be taken by officers of the health board.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is appropriate that lying around in administrative offices of health boards would be the personal, clinical and medical details of elderly patients.  While there is, of course, a need for a rigorous investigation in relation to the standards of care available in nursing homes and, of course, they should be available for inspection in relation to all aspects, we should put some limit in relation to copying and the taking away of clinical records.  I believe that if one wishes to make a case against a particular nursing home obviously one will have to get evidence and statements from people to say that it was unsatisfactory.  I do not know if it is desirable that the personal financial details of individual proprietors would be made known to everybody.  I would like to see a separate procedure in the regulations set out for the Minister so that the medical and clinical records could be inspected in some discreet way if it was found to be absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I consider that the provisions of paragraph (g) are excessive for these types of records because it could lead to two problems; I will put it no stronger than that.  I hope people understand what I am getting at.  I am not trying to stifle investigations; I am not trying to stifle accountability, but I believe what are private and personal matters should be dealt <Col N="1974" /> with in a different way from other records about the number of patients treated, circumstances about overcrowding, circumstances about the purchasing of food, etc.  Personal financial details and secret clinical records should be as they are with any doctor-patient relationship in a hospital, reserved for a very careful eye and not just for officers of the health board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the amendment moved by Deputy Yates adds clarity to the section although I understand exactly what he wishes to achieve. The amendment does not actually state personal financial records.  I hope it would not be implied from his amendment that the health board would not have access to the financial records of the institution itself, if that was required. There would obviously be occasions when an individual's medical history would be looked at in relation to an assessment for assistance and also the financial support they may have.</P>
      <P>From an earlier contribution I understood that the Minister indicated that it would be improper and that he would not envisage that a non-medical person would have access to anybody's clinical or medical records.  Perhaps the Minister would reaffirm that it would not be his intention to do that and that it would be inserted in the regulations subsequent to the enactment of this Bill, that only a medical practitioner would have access to anybody's clinical or medical records. The import of what Deputy Yates wants to achieve could be achieved.  It is a proposal that would exclude access to information that would be proper for the health board so perhaps it is possible for the Minister to look at the intention underlying Deputy Yates' amendment and see if it is necessary to come back with a ministerial amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about clinical records.  Deputies know that in a number of homes when a person needs medical treatment they are sent into a hospital and the medical records follow them into the hospital.  The unfortunate <Col N="1975" /> thing is that many homes will not take an old person back into the home following hospital treatment.  Geriatricians are very annoyed at the fact that when they accept a person into hospital they are given the medical records of the person and when the person is fit to be returned to the home, the home refuses to take them back.  If an old person is admitted to hospital for a month or two there will be a vacant bed in the home which will lead to a loss of finance for the home.  Something must be done in this Bill to ensure that when a person from a nursing home has to go into hospital they have every right to go back again to a nursing home. It is very easy to dispose of the problem by saying they are being admitted to hospital. However, geriatricians will complain that they have no beds, they are getting no co-operation from the nursing homes and there will be no beds available for the more urgent cases.  I ask the Minister to comment on this point.  This is happening at present in some homes. Tremendous work is being carried out in most nursing homes but others abuse certain privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the point raised by Deputy Wyse which highlights the need for an admissions policy in circumstances where the health boards are subventing the patients in private nursing homes. Obviously the issue of patients being admitted to hospitals and being referred back to the homes is appropriate to the health boards.  I will take note of this issue and see what can be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Yates.  At present nursing homes are not required, nor is there any intention to require them, to make financial records available for inspection.  Under the present regulations clinical records may only be inspected by a medical practitioner in the service of the Minister or health board or the patient's general practitioner.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out, I dealt with this issue earlier when I quoted from Article 24 (d) of the Draft <Col N="1976" /> Nursing Home Regulations which states very clearly, and I quote:</P>
    <P>nothing in this article authorises any person other than a medical practitioner in the service of a health board, or the patient's general practitioner to inspect any medical record relating to a patient being maintained in a nursing home,...</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members accept the need to maintain confidentiality in relation to medical records.</P>
    <P>Article 18 of the draft regulations deals at length with the keeping of records and the records which it is necessary to keep. Such records include the name, address, date of birth, marital status and religious denomination of the patients; the name, address and telephone number, if any, of the patient's relative or other person nominated to act on the patient's behalf as a person to be notified in the event of a change in the patient's health or circumstances; the name, address and telephone number of the patient's medical practitioner; the latest date on which the patient was admitted to the nursing home; where the patient has left the nursing home, the date on which he or she left; where the patient is admitted to hospital, the date of and reasons for the admission and the name of the hospital; and, where the patient dies in the nursing home, the date, time and the certified cause of death.</P>
    <P>These are some of the records it will be necessary for a nursing home to keep. It will be enshrined very clearly in the regulations what is expected and who will have access to the records.  I want to assure the House that there is no question of asking the nursing homes to make financial records available for inspection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister cannot accept my amendment.  My amendment would have made this section watertight.  However, having looked at the draft regulations I accept that there is no reference to the availability of financial records and proprietors will not have to make them available.  The necessary safeguards about who will see the <Col N="1977" /> clinical records are included in the draft regulations as they stand.  By and large, I am satisfied at the list of records which should be made available.  On that basis I am happy to withdraw my amendment. I hope that during the many years when this legislation is in operation it will be recorded that the intention of this House was that these matters should be dealt with sensitively.</P>

      <P>The parliamentary draftsman proposed these amendments in order to clarify the meaning of the section.  It is not a material change.  The section provides that a reference to any section, subsection or subparagraph will be construed as referring to a section, subsection or subparagraph of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We spent some time discussing the inclusion of old age in the definition section of the Bill.  Thanks to Deputy Fennell, I now have a copy of the <Col N="1978" /> Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964.  Section 1, the interpretation section, of that Act is quite revealing in so far as it defines an incapacitated person as a dependent person. It defines an incapacitated person as one who is incapable of looking after himself by reason of (a) old age, (b) physical infirmity or a physical injury, defect or disease, or (c) mental infirmity or a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the latter definition. The language used in section 1 of this Bill is identical to that used in the Act except for the definition of old age, which we have already dealt with, and mental handicap.  I specifically raised this matter on Second Stage with the Minister because it was not clear from his Second Stage speech whether homes for the mentally handicapped would be included in this Bill.  It is very important that such homes should be included.  There is no amendment down to this effect but it is in order to discuss this matter under the section.  I ask the Minister to afford the mentally handicapped the same protection we are giving to elderly people. This Bill deals with a comparable situation. We are trying to update the 1964 Act and there is no lesser reason why we should not now protect the mentally handicapped in the same way as we did in that Act.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was replying to the Second Stage debate he said it was his intention to include the mentally handicapped in this Bill.  We have had many debates in this House about the needs of the mentally handicapped, and I will not labour this point, but I ask the Minister to incorporate the mentally handicapped in the Bill on Report Stage.  If he does not do this we will table an amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to comment on the point made by Deputy Yates.  We will have an opportunity to discuss this point under section 2.  I understand The Workers Party put down an amendment in regard to the exclusion clause where the Minister hopes to exclude institutions for the care and maintenance of the mentally handicapped under section 2 (1) (e). <Col N="1979" /> We may well debate this point at that stage.</P>
      <P>We have had an opportunity, when discussing section 1, the definition section, to think about the importance of this Bill and the need which would be applicable to many institutions and individuals.  The term &ldquo;old age&rdquo; has been discussed at length and the Minister will look at this issue again.  We can take up the point made by Deputy Yates when we are discussing section 2.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to include homes for the mentally handicapped in this legislation.  The position is that there are systems in place to monitor non-profit making institutions for the care and maintenance of mentally handicapped persons.  I believe they are satisfactory and that there is a high standard of care provided.  There are at present no private profit making homes for the mentally handicapped and if it ever became necessary to include them in the legislation, there is power to do so under section 2 (2) of this Bill and they can be included by regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 15 and 16, to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>This section defines the scope of the Bill in terms of which nursing homes and which institutions will be affected.  Section 6 defines the rigorous requirements that should be put down in terms of maintenance, care, welfare of dependent persons in these homes, staff requirements, design, maintenance, repair of accommodation, the food and all the other things that we would like to add to them. It seems that the people who are writing the rules want to exclude their own institutions from the same rigorous standards as they would impose on others.  I do not think we should afford any less protection to those who happen to be in county homes, long stay geriatric homes, welfare homes, geriatric hospitals and psychiatric hospitals, and I am sure there are lots of nooks and crannies and different variations of all of those things with different voluntary and statutory bases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This principle that we have the same standards in public care as we have in private care &mdash; and certainly no less &mdash; should be adopted.  We should not be presumptuous enough to say that just because a home is run by the health board <Col N="1981" /> or the State it has reached these standards. As legislators we should, therefore, look for equality before the law.  I would be strongly of the view that institutions caring for the elderly and dependent persons managed on behalf of the Minister by the health board should not be excluded and there is no cogent case for excluding them.  In fact that would be quite unfair.  I believe the same rights of complaint and everything else that people would have to ensure that standards would be enforced should be available wherever elderly persons are.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Health may not want this, and may say that this has never been done before, but it is significant that the first group to be excluded, at the top of the list, is the Minister's own institution.  In my view that is wrong and I am glad other Opposition Deputies have the same view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in my name.  Clearly there are a few principles that have to be established.  The first is that we treat elderly people in like fashion whether they are in a public or private institution.  That is a fundamental principle.  The fundamental object of this Bill is to bring order, regularity and enforceable standards into the running of private nursing homes, and we should lead by example.  There are excellent facilities in most geriatric institutions run by the health boards and the State as there are in most privately run nursing homes.  The framework we are establishing here is to enforce standards on those who might not live up to the expected norm.  That is in everybody's interest.  It does ourselves and the institutions of the State a disservice if we seek to exclude from the compass of this legislation the institutions that are managed and run by the Department of Health directly or by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument could be made that in a way this is asking people to monitor themselves in as much as the health boards will be the monitors of their own institutions.  The example where we placed statutory obligations of enforcement on local authorities to monitor their <Col N="1982" /> own activities has stood up to that test.  I am very anxious that we would not exclude institutions managed by the Minister or health boards from the provisions of this Bill.  It would be a very wrong signal to give as it would indicate to the public at large that we are expecting standards from the private sector which we do not desire to enforce upon ourselves. It would be unfair to most institutions which already maintain extremely high standards.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the exclusion of those institutions.</P>

The House appreciates <Col N="1983" /> that, even though they will all be discussed together, only one is moved, but anywhere along the line the question can be put on any one amendment separately if the House so requires.

      <P>I thank you, Sir, and Deputy Howlin.  From my point of view I find it more convenient.  I agree with the points made by Deputy Yates in regard to amendment No. 10 and I feel they relate to other amendments in Deputy Sherlock's name.</P>
      <P>The Bill is placing a statutory duty on health boards to license, register and inspect nursing homes.  I think it would be expected that health boards should license, register and inspect all nursing homes, including those in their own bailiwick. Under this Bill there are exclusions some of which are very difficult to understand. An institution for the care and maintenance of mentally handicapped persons operated otherwise than for profit and to which grants are paid by the Minister or a health board is being excluded.  I would like the Minister to explain why.  It is only on rare occasions that a problem arises and it is necessary to be able to inspect.  You can withdraw a licence if the problem arises, and one does not expect that to happen every day, every year or even every ten years.  If it arises one needs to be able to take the necessary action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 relates to premises in which children are maintained in pursuance of an arrangement with a health board.  I would think a health board should not make an arrangement with any premises unless they have already been licensed and registered and are suitable to be licensed and registered as a nursing home within the meaning of the Bill.  To exclude in advance premises in which children are maintained in pursuance of an arrangement with a health board allows health boards to be very careless in the arrangements they make and the premises they make the arrangements with.  If within the meaning of this Bill they are not licensed, registered and <Col N="1984" /> subject to inspection and withholding of a licence or whatever is necessary if everything is not in order under the regulations which have been set down, if a premises is not being maintained in accordance with these regulations, the Minister must be in a position to take action under the Bill.  If health boards are allowed to make arrangements for the care of children with any premises they like in their own health board area with no necessity for licensing, registering or anything else, that is excluded from the Bill.  It seems meaningless.  I cannot understand the purpose in excluding such premises.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 in the names of Deputies Yates and Howlin, and a similar one in the name of Deputy Sherlock, refer to the exclusion of premises in which a majority of the persons being maintained are members of a religious order or priests of any religion.  Why should members of a religious order or priests not be entitled to the same care and the same responsibilities in nursing homes as everybody else?  Are they allowed to be in any kind of nursing home which is not subject to licence, registration or inspection? Simply because they are members of a religious order, nobody bothers about them.  I cannot understand why nursing homes which are caring for religious should be excluded from the regulations set down for all nursing homes.  There is an impression here, possibly correct, that most of those would be run by the particular religious order, but that is not necessarily so.  There are nursing homes for the care of elderly religious or retired priests or whatever, and these could spring up all over the place.  Why should they not be subject to the same regulations as all the other such premises?</P>
    <P>I am making similar points in regard to each of the areas because we put down the amendments to delete these exclusions.  To say that because there is an arrangement with the health boards there is no need to have these premises licensed, registered, or inspected is unacceptable. Bureaucracies can create enormous problems if these places are not <Col N="1985" /> subject to inspection.  As Deputy Yates said, they must be subject to the same regulations of licensing, registering and inspection as any other nursing homes.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Deputy Sherlock, who is unable to be here, I am putting forward amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 10.  The Minister is suggesting that we exclude nursing homes controlled by the health boards.  What is the present procedure in relation to the control of the homes in the Eastern Health Board? How does the Minister propose to have control uniformly right across the board in private and public nursing homes? That is vital.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude, in particular in relation to amendment No.10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also urge the Minister to reconsider items here under these paragraphs that are being challenged by various Members of the Opposition.  I find it difficult to see justification for this. I can see that various interest groups might press to be excluded.  I cannot see why we in the sovereign Parliament should concede anything to such pressures.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 2 (1) (a), given the problem of staff embargoes in the public sector, it is entirely possible that in many cases an institution managed by or on behalf of the Government, or a health board, might be less well staffed, because of the way embargoes operate, than a private institution.  I am well aware that the embargoes introduced to try to control staff have had perverse effects in many areas and, as the Taoiseach of the day who introduced the embargo system at first, I am aware of all the anomalies. I know we have had great problems in other parts of the health service because of the way the embargoes operated.  It cannot be assumed that staffing would necessarily be more adequate, to take staffing as one factor which might be under consideration here in the public and private sectors.  It is almost a perverse assumption, given the way the embargo was operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> Secondly, I do not know why we should assume, because somebody's name is entered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners, that the person is capable of running an institution of that kind well and efficiently.  There are many of us with particular aptitudes in life who do not have other aptitudes and the fact that somebody is a doctor does not mean he has the management capacity to run an institution efficiently, and there could well be problems of mismanagement. That assumption has no basis whatever in reality so far as I can see.  I take it that this applies to an institution where people are being treated for acute ailments but I am not quite sure what is envisaged and the Minister might explain that perhaps a particular case is envisaged but whether it is for acute or other ailments the mere fact that it is under the supervision of a person whose name is entered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners does not seem to me to be adequate grounds for exclusion.</P>
    <P>I take it that sections 2 (1) (c) and section 2 (1) (d) are covered by other Acts and therefore I understand why they are there and are not being challenged. The fact that an institution covered by section 2 (1) (e) is not operated for profit does not necessarily mean it is efficient. The opposite view is sometimes held by people who have a great belief in the profit motive.  I am not challenging that one way or the other or saying that one is necessarily more efficient than the other but there could well be problems in a non-profit making institution.  The fact that grants are paid by the Minister or a health board does not necessarily mean that the institution is operated efficiently.  I do not see why we should discriminate against members of religious orders or priests and remove from them the protection afforded to lay people.  I wonder whether it is constitutional to make such a distinction in terms of the protection of the State and I do not understand the thinking behind this paragraph. What have we got against priests or nuns?  I do not see why we should pick on them in this respect.  These are most <Col N="1987" /> curious exceptions, perhaps the Minister can explain them but I do not think he can justify them.</P>
    <P>The Minister then adds another number of exceptions.  I wonder how many interest groups have got at him. Then we come to amendment No. 15, paragraph (g) which he has not put forward yet:</P>
    <P>...physically handicapped persons a majority of whom do not receive whole-time nursing care in the institution,</P>
    <P>God help the minority who will not be protected.  Why should they not be protected? Another institution to be excluded in paragraph (g) (ii) is an institution:</P>
    <P>In the management of which representatives of the Minister or a health board and representatives of the persons being maintained in the institution participate with other persons.</P>
    <P>I know cases of bodies of that kind where certainly the public authorities have alleged there are problems.  I am familiar with a recent case where there was a running battle for many months.  I thought that the public institution, the health board, were wrong in their judgment in that case but they insisted though they had representatives on the board and though some of the other people were representative of the people being looked after.  Nonetheless there was a long campaign on the question of the management of that body, on the question of who should manage it and whether the existing manager should be retained.  I thought the health board were wrong and I did my best to ensure a different outcome from the one a Deputy from another party wanted.  However, the fact that the health board took a certain views in that case does not seem to me to provide a reason for exempting such bodies.  It a body with that kind of representative management and health board representation on the management is one with which the health board can be unhappy why should they not be inspected?  The very case I am talking of <Col N="1988" /> makes nonsense of the amendment that is being made.  I cannot imagine on whose behalf it was introduced.  The fact that a body are being paid grants does not mean they are efficient, in fact some people would say the opposite.  The fact of being grant aided will not make a body efficient or guarantee that nobody will be ill-cared for and that everybody will be properly cared for.</P>
    <P>What the Income Tax Act has to do with the Minister has yet to be explained. No doubt there is a very good reason for the provision of paragraph (g) (iv) in the amendment and I am quite willing to hear him and if there is some special income tax provisions that ensure that people are well looked after, well fed and well cared for I would like to hear about it.  I should not prejudge because that is a matter which the Minister has not yet spoken about.  It is a pity that the Minister has not proposed his amendment as we are talking about an amendment that has not been proposed or justified.  Perhaps we should allow the Minister get in at this stage before we talk about something about which we know little and perhaps the little we know may be wrong.</P>
    <P>On all those grounds it seems to me that the amendments are perverse.  With all due respect to all concerned they represent what one could describe, not in a pejorative way, as bureaucratic thinking and vested interests seeking to be protected and trying to narrow down the provisions of the section so that everything is excluded except what is left, some kind of residue, ragtag and bobtail.  Most institutions of the State are excluded, what is the Bill about?  What are we at? I do not understand why the Minister should take this line.  I have no hang ups about public or private care but from the point of view of caring and looking after people we are all agreed that the Minister should look again at these provisions and I hope he will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all of the previous speakers, I, too, have great reservations about the exclusion of various homes and institutions.  Under section 2 (1) (a) &ldquo;an institution managed by or on behalf of a <Col N="1989" /> Minister of the Government or a health board&rdquo; is excuded.  Let us look for a moment at what might happen if a health board decided that a third party would be engaged to manage a home on behalf of a health board or if in turn the Minister decided to engage some third party, other than a health board to manage a home. Why would they be excluded from the provisions of the Bill which cover suitable accommodation, proper food and proper care, and all the important aspects we have covered here today, such as the provision that the person in charge of the home would have to have nursing qualifications and that there would be proper standards of cleanliness, ventilation and maintenance.  Why are we excluding these institutions, and in that, members of religious orders, from the benefits of all these good provisions in section 6?  If the Minister or the health board decided to have an institution managed for them there is no doubt in my mind that in times of financial restraint if the funding to the home was cut or was inadequate, staffing levels would have to be cut and there would be a very severe prospect of the standards falling to a level below the level we expect from the private nursing homes.  I argue most strongly that all these amendments should be accepted by the Minister and I would be interested to hear his comments on the serious implications of the provisions he is proposing.</P>

      <P>I concur with what all the other speakers have said.  Perhaps the Minister could give his reasons for the exemptions.  I would not make exceptions for any of them.  I think they should all be treated in the same vein though there are no amendments down and I question seriously why they should be excluded.  I have a horrible feeling that it might be because it has always been done in legislation and one gets a feeling very often that the skeleton of one Bill is lifted to form the basis of another Bill just because it was there.  The Minister should be able to give us a reason under each heading for excluding these other institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> Let me say that there are great expectations among the general public for the Bill.  There is a perception that there are abuses and problems in the growing number of nursing homes.  I do not necessarily think that the perception is true, there are a great many good homes where there are very high standards but people feel that things are wrong.  I do not know what they are going to say if they discover that some homes are embraced by the Bill while others are not.  In order to try to ensure that we have uniform and comprehensive standards we should try to include all homes.</P>
    <P>I would like specifically to refer to two areas which nobody else has mentioned. Deputy FitzGerald said in passing that section 2 (1) (c) was governed by the Registration of Maternity Homes Act, 1934, and that it probably did not need to be examined too carefully.  Although maternity homes are no longer popular places in which to have a baby when I was having children many people went to maternity homes, many of which left a lot to be desired.  We do not know what will happen in the future.  It could again become the practice for women to go to maternity homes to have their babies. They should come under this updated legislation, not the 1934 Act which could not be appropriate to present gynaecological and obstetric needs.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this. We must legislate for likely trends in the future.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the section dealing with premises in which children are maintained in pursuance of an arrangement with the health board.  This service should be under the protection of this Bill.  We are talking about standards, supervision and control and in this type of institution where there would be children in care there should be maximum protection.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat baffled by the references to &ldquo;for profit&rdquo; or &ldquo;not for profit&rdquo;. I do not think that matters.  Regardless of whether people are running nursing homes for profit or otherwise, the same basic standards should prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go over <Col N="1991" /> ground convered by previous speakers and I would basically go along with what they have been saying.  I would refer briefly to two paragraphs of section 2 (1).  In regard to paragraph (b) there is an amendment in my name which is identical to the amendment tabled by Deputy Yates.  I can see no reason a nursing home controlled by the medical profession should be any different from another nursing home.  This seems to be an extraordinary privilege or exclusion and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  I can see no reason for it.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1) (g) refers to &ldquo;priests of any religion&rdquo;.  There are a number of religions in this country.  Possibly the Church of Ireland might be quite happy to have their ministers called priests, but I am quite sure that Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians and others would be very offended and hurt if their ministers of religion were called priests.  Surely if we are to have such a reference, the term &ldquo;ministers of religion&rdquo; would be more appropriate.</P>

      <P>I have already spoken and I will not repeat comments from others with which I substantially agree.  The Minister may have cogent reasons for these exclusions but the impact of them is to gut the Bill.  We are moving on to the protections to be enforced, having excluded a huge proportion of the institutions to which we would like to afford protection.  It makes nonsense of later sections.  I regret not having put down an amendment whereby there should be no exclusions.  There is no cogent reason for excluding anybody unless they are covered by similar protections in existing legislation.  Since the legislation covering maternity homes dates back to 1934 I <Col N="1992" /> doubt if it is as comprehensive as the legislation we are now enacting.  Notwithstanding the title given to a minister of religion, I would seek to give them the same protection, under whatever title they wish to take to themselves.  It is wholly improper that they should be excluded.</P>
      <P>The Minister's new amendment No. 15 is quite sinister in that it gives a new power to the Minister to exclude new categories of institution.  Basically under the Minister's amendment any institute or institution to which the Minister appointed a director or to which the health board appointed a director would be automatically excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  That is quite wrong. It would give an amazing opt out facility to a health board and to the Minister. They could put somebody on the board and by agreement exempt them from the provisions of the Bill.  I agree entirely with what has been said in relation to all the other categories, the physically and mentally handicapped, children and those in maternity homes who should all be afforded the comprehensive protection of this Bill.  If we do not have progress on this section it will devalue all the remaining work which the Bill seeks to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what the Deputies have said and I appreciate their concern.  We will deal with each amendment in turn.  The institutions managed by or on behalf of the Minister or a health board are not included in the scope of the Bill because they have already been subject to a statutory and publicly accountable system of management. The Bill is all about accountability and there is already accountability in the system.  Not alone have I the authority to send an inspector into health board institutions but also they are subject to scrutiny by their own health boards, the visiting committees of health boards and by Members of the Oireachtas who are in a position to ask questions and raise issues of concern. There is in place a statutory and publicly accountable system of management.  Of <Col N="1993" /> course, they are expected to have standards which are at least in keeping with the standards in the legislation before us.</P>
      <P>On the question of general practitioners, Deputy FitzGerald is correct in drawing attention to the fact that the reference is to hospitals where people are being treated for acute ailments under the supervision of a person whose name is entered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners.  I do not think the amendment in the names of Deputy Yates and Deputy Garland is necessary. If we accept the amendment we will have to include all acute hospitals in the legislation, places like St. Vincent's Hospital and the Mater.  This is purely to exclude hospitals which are run as acute general hospitals.  They may be small private hospitals.</P>
      <P>If medical practitioners are running nursing homes, by all means they will be included in the legislation.  Indeed, if they try to run a nursing home under the guise of an acute hospital the inspectors from the health board will be in a position to report them and they will very quickly be brought in under the legislation.  I am told that the legislation would not be strengthened by accepting that amendment which would have the effect of including many acute voluntary hospitals which are outside its scope.</P>
      <P>There is no amendment tabled to paragraph (c) but Deputy Fennell referred to it.  Of course there is quite an adequate system of maintaining high standards under the Maternity Homes Act, 1934, and while the practices in obstetrics may have changed, the need for an updated premises and proper staffing is still enshrined in that legislation and it is not necessary to include them in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees that there is a very high standard in the homes for mentally handicapped which are run by voluntary organisations.  As they are all run on a voluntary basis, I felt it appropriate to exclude them but if Members of the Opposition think they should be included I will look at the matter before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (f) deals with the question <Col N="1994" /> of homes for the care of children. Arrangements are already in place to ensure that the care of children maintained in pursuance of an arrangement with a health board is to a high standard. These arrangements will be strengthened by the Child Care Bill currently before the House.  That is a more appropriate place to enshrine legislation guaranteeing the standards in homes for children.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (g) the Bill excludes convents, monasteries and anywhere in which a religious community live and in which some of their dependent members are maintained.  We see the community as the family of the members of the religious order and the difficulty is that under the legislation if you keep more than two persons who are not related you are within its scope.  In a community of nuns, some are elderly and need a certain amount of help and it would be unreasonable to ask the community to register and to be subject to this legislation.  It is not necessary or reasonable because you are merely referring to convents and homes for the religious in which they are part of the community whom they see as part of their family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill empowers the Minister to alter, by regulation, the definition of a nursing home to include or exclude any class of home.  It is considered that to provide in the Bill the power to include any class of institution within the scope of the Bill is sufficient. The possibility of excluding institutions already covered by the Bill could give rise to suspicions as to the class of homes which might be excluded.  If it is necessary to exclude a class of homes in the future, exclusion will require new legislation.  In other words, it is only a class of home that can be included or excluded, not a specific home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new section we are introducing caused concern on the Opposition Benches and I will say a word on it.  The first point is that in order to qualify for inclusion, the institution must fulfil the <Col N="1995" /> four conditions set out in paragraph (g) (1), (2), (3) and (4).  The purpose of this is to exclude homes run and managed by the Cheshire Homes Foundation from the scope of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The reason we want to include the new section is that the Cheshire Homes Foundation made an extremely reasonable case for inserting the amendment.</P>
      <P>The important point about this is that the homes they own and manage cater for physically handicapped persons, some of whom would fall within the definition of &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; in the Bill but many would not.  Their primary aim is to provide support to enable dependent people to live independent lives.  The homes are managed to a very high standard and have a warm and caring ambience.  They are funded largely by the health boards which are represented on the boards of management.  The residents play an active part in managing the homes and they do not cater for highly dependent elderly people for which nursing homes cater and, give the health boards' close association in the running of the homes, it is not considered appropriate to bring the homes into the scope of the Bill.  It is not possible to exclude the Cheshire Homes specifically in law as a class of institution, a specific institution or an individual cannot be included, only a class of institution can be included and that is why the amendment is in that form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald raised a point about the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Section 3 of that Act provides for the institution to be treated as a charity for income tax <Col N="1996" /> purposes and the Cheshire Homes. Foundation qualifies in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not go with the idea that there should not be any exemptions from this Bill because its terms are quite specific as to the type of nursing care and staffing requirements involved.  They deal with a particular type of dependent person.  In general, very acute care in general hospitals should be exempt.  The Cheshire Homes wrote to me some months ago seeking an exemption and I wrote back saying that I saw no grounds for justification for their exemptions.  I subsequently visited one of their homes and, having done so, I am satisfied that many of the people there are not sufficiently elderly or dependent to require this type of thing.  Some of them go to work, they come in and go out and they do not have anywhere else.  Some of them are disabled but they live in a hostel environment. If you were to put in place the sort of nursing and staff ratios required under the Bill it would cause bedlam.</P>
      <P>While there is a case for some exemptions they go too far.  I will develop that argument.  Religious persons should not be excluded.  There was a celebrated case of a fire in St. Stephen's Green in relation to a particular religious home.  I do not wish to make a direct comment on that other than to say that there are very frail and elderly people, religious sisters and so on, in some of these establishments and there should not be a total exemption.  We will be dealing with this matter when the Bill is next taken.  As a general principle all dependent people who require residential nursing care should be afforded the same protection whether they are in public or private care, even though there are different categories of people.  Perhaps in the intervening time, before this Bill comes back to the House, the Minister would have a substantial look at section 2 and its exemptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you very kindly, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  It is an important issue because it impinges on the quality of services being provided by the community services schemes around the country.  I am going to concentrate particularly on the Dublin area from where my information emanates.  It is important that I raise this matter here and that the Minister explains the position to the House.</P>
      <P>On 9 February last I issued a statement explaining my concerns about some of the work practices and got a cursory, single line response from the Department of Justice to say that my information was completely wrong and that everything was correct in the Department of Justice work services.  I would like to have the record put straight but more importantly I would like to see something done to regularise and put in order the conditions of work of the supervisors, of which there are approximately 15 on the north side of the city; the Minister will have to tell us how many are employed by the service throughout the city and country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Community Services Act was passed it took some time to put in place the national service.  The probationary service had to be expanded and the idea was that people who might otherwise be put in prison could be put to community work.  There was agreement with the unions that they would not generally do work that was capable of being done by tradespeople.  The service then started cleaning up graveyards and public open spaces and, more regularly, because of the non-availability of funds in other areas, their work related to the decorating and painting of many of our national and secondary schools.  The idea is that at night time when offenders are not required elsewhere they would serve out their orders under supervision.  This posed a practical problem for probation officers in that they could not supervise multiple locations and they were not in a <Col N="1998" /> position or did not have the trade skills necessary to know how a particular trade job might be done.  Therefore the Department correctly sought to employ skilled or trade supervisors, people with experience in the area of painting, decorating, maintenance work and the like. These people were employed through the National Manpower Service and FAS.</P>
    <P>In late 1985 or early 1986 these people started work &mdash; all of them had been on the dole &mdash; and were employed for a maximum of 14 hours a week at a rate of £5 per hour, which amounted to £70. That was considered to be equivalent to two day's work and they were paid for the other four days on the dole.  These people are still in that same position and are still being paid under the probationary service scheme.  As a consequence problems arose.  It was only after some months that the people inquired about their tax situation and were told that was a matter for themselves. I have correspondence in my possession, dated 13 November, from the Revenue to one of these people, indicating that it was considered they have earned fees.  This was a device contrived by the Department of Justice to say they were not employees but were on contract to the probationary service.  While these people are community service supervisors they are paid through an account which is considered to be the petty cash account of the probationary service in Anne's Lane.  The account is with the Bank of Ireland, St. Stephen's Green, account No. 90/0084/75806965.</P>
    <P>Each week these people are paid £70 and that rate has not increased.  No wage slip is provided to them.  Because they have not paid tax there was a demand for huge back tax.  The Department say that matter has been resolved but that is not so.  It is being addressed but it certainly has not been resolved.  One person received a tax bill for over £1,000, money that person simply does not have and will not be able to pay unless this matter is resolved.  On the PRSI front, after 18 months the Department back paid, by lump sum, all the PRSI that was being demanded of the Department of Social <Col N="1999" /> Welfare and thereafter they began to deduct the payments on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>This whole service was introduced haphazardly but with all good intentions.  The primary reason was that due to the embargo the Department could not employ full-time workers who were needed.  Many of us have argued here that we have to respect and support the expansion of the community services schemes and they are slowly expanding. The time has now come to regularise the position of these supervisors who have been in this twilight employment for nearly four years.  Because they are not in permanent employment they have no entitlement to and are given no allowances for holidays.  There is no opportunity, under the operation of the scheme, for a person to be let go for two or three weeks in order to take holidays because it is an ongoing operation.</P>
    <P>The tax demands that are being currently made should be sorted out and the people should be employed on a proper and permanent basis.  They are needed for the scheme and are an important feature of it.  If they were employed full-time it would allow the probation officers to get back to the job that they should be engaged in, that is counselling and work closely related to the courts.  Because these people work under 18 hours a week they are considered to be dependants of their wives if they are working and consequently their rate of entitlement is the J1 rate.  It is claimed, for example, that if they had four more hours work a week they would be entitled to unemployment benefit of £29.70 on top of what they are currently getting.  Because of this arbitrary cut-off to comply with one scheme of the Department of Social Welfare, they are being penalised in another way.</P>
    <P>I hope I have outlined succinctly in the short time available to me, the problems that exist.  The tax problem is being addressed but in a way that these people simply cannot meet.  Their PRSI is now on a proper basis, although inconsistently because they are paying PRSI on the basis that they are employed but they are taxed on the basis that they are being <Col N="2000" /> paid fees.  They are being paid out of the account of the probationary service that is there for general cost purposes.  They are in a twilight zone.  They are in an irregular position at this stage given the number of years they have been employed.  They are described as being in receipt of fees.  They do not consider themselves to be professional people. They are thankful for the small amount of work they have but they believe strongly &mdash; and I support their claim &mdash; that after such a long time it is incumbent on the Minister to regularise their position, to put them in a permanent and proper position within the scheme.  As a result, the community services scheme would be all the better because it would be formalised and there would be a formula whereby the scheme could be properly expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy first accused my Department of irregular employment practice in the employment of sessional supervisors under the community service order scheme in a press release on 9 February last.  The Deputy alleged that my Department were guilty of grossly irregular practices in the employment of tradesmen as sessional supervisors, an allegation he repeated tonight.  In response to these allegations my Department immediately issued a statement which was read out on the &ldquo;Today at 5&rdquo; radio programme that evening, to the effect that there was no basis for the Deputy's allegations; that those engaged as sessional supervisors are taken from the FÁS register; that their tax arrangements have been fully agreed with the Revenue Commissioners and are in order; that there is no question of any irregularity nor is there any question of trying to get around either the public service embargo or worker protection legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who was being interviewed on the programme at the time availed of that advantage to say that he believed my Department were trying to mislead the public in the matter.  This was totally unfounded and, may I say, most regrettable statement in view of the very <Col N="2001" /> clear-cut rejection of his allegations by my Department.  However, not satisfied with that, the Deputy tabled an oral question on the matter to my colleague, the Minister for Labour, for answer on 20 February.  The Minister for Labour pointed out, among other things, that there was no contravention of labour law in the method of employing these sessional supervisors.  Moveover, as regards the tax situation, I made matters perfectly clear again on 27 February in reply to written questions from Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should now take this opportunity to, I hope, clarify once and for all the circumstances under which sessional supervisors are employed by the probation and welfare service under the community service order scheme.  Persons engaged as sessional supervisors are taken from the FÁS register.  They are usually unskilled.  Some, of course, may have a trade or skill but they are not taken on on that basis: in fact, they are taken on on the basis that they have an ability to oversee the work done by offenders and ensure the work is being done to a reasonably good standard.</P>
    <P>The supervisors work from five to 14 hours in any one week depending on the nature of the project and the attendance arrangements for the offenders.  As regards the latter consideration &mdash; the attendance arrangements for offenders &mdash; I think it would be helpful to invite the Deputy's attention to what the law actually provides.  Section 7(3) of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, specifically provides as follows in relation to work directions that maybe given to offenders:</P>
    <P>Directions... shall, so far as practical, avoid any interference with the times the offender normally works or attends a school or other educational or training establishment.</P>
    <P>One of the practical effects of securing compliance with this provision is that community service work tends to be performed, for the most part, in the evening or at weekends.</P>
    <P>This arrangements, therefore, has <Col N="2002" /> nothing whatsoever to do with any effort to have the people concerned categorised as part-time workers and excluded from the scope of workers protection legislation or to get around the public service recruitment embargo.  The fact that the appropriate rate of PRSI is deducted, precisely for the purpose of securing social welfare benefits, in itself indicates that there is certainly no intention of dodging legislative benefits and shows how grossly unfair the Deputy is in his reference to back street practices.  The whole arrangement is based entirely on practical necessities having regard to the job to be done and the availability of the offenders doing it.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Labour, in dealing with the Deputy's question to him on 20 February made it quite clear that my Department will be keeping the question of full-time employment under review should that prove to be an efficient manner to carry out the work concerned. I can assure the Deputy that if full time employment appeared to be a feasible and efficient proposition there would be no question of its being rejected on the basis that it would bring workers within the legal protection to which my Government and I are committed.</P>
    <P>As the sessional supervisors work for a maximum of 14 hours per week at £5 per hour they are unlikely for the most part to incur a tax liability during the income tax year unless they have income from other sources.  Tax is not deducted and persons engaged are advised that an end of year tax return will be made to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the moneys paid to them.  This arrangement has been fully agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.  They are entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance less the amount received during the period of engagement of one week.  I should, incidentally, mention again, as I did in the Dáil on 27 February in reply to Deputy Mitchell's questions, that the question of applying public service pay rises to the hourly rate of £5 is under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that sessional supervisors provide a valuable service <Col N="2003" /> under the scheme and I am satisfied that the conditions under which they are employed are not open to the kind of criticisms made by the Deputy.  The suggestion that my Department would involve themselves in back street style tactics in employing labour and on top of that would seek to mislead the public on the subject is to put it mildly offensive and I sincerely hope the Deputy will take a suitable opportunity to retract it.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Death of Female Prisoner.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to indicate to the Chair that I intend to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and with Deputy McCartan.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for coming to the Chamber to hear my case. It is with considerable sadness that I speak tonight about the conditions in Mountjoy female prison as it is overshadowed by the death yesterday of 19-year old prisoner, Sharon Gregg.  First, I should like to extend my sympathy to the Gregg family, to the prison officers and the other women prisoners.  However, sympathy is not enough.  It is poor comfort when one is condemned to exist in appalling Dickensian conditions such as exist in Mountjoy female prison.  That prison is one of the scandals of every political administration in recent years; it is also a scandal that women prisoners have been neglected in the development of facilities for male prisoners.  They are outcasts who are deprived of their freedom by the courts on the one hand and further punished by a system that tolerates a hell hole of a women's prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited that jail in the past and I intend to go there tomorrow morning as part of an all-party delegation.  I was a prison visitor for some years and as junior Minister in the Department of Justice I tried to improve conditions.  I was able at that time to have a women doctor appointed. That was a small but relevant change and one that was recommended by the <Col N="2004" /> Whitaker Commission.  There is a prevailing notion in the Department of Justice that promises will do, the promise of renovations, the promise of better work conditions, better education, better exercise facilities, but none of those promises has been fulfilled.  The prison is worse than it was five years ago although Mountjoy Prison is now the only place of detention for women here.</P>
    <P>Very obviously the Minister, and his Department, must now take responsibility for conditions in the prison and for what occurs in it.  I suggest that it is time to look at the operational structure of the Department of Justice and question their ability to cope with all their serious areas of responsibility.  We must ask if it is too centralised and understaffed.  Should some important areas like the prisons be hived off to a separate unit?  I believe that the women's prison should be closed down and gutted not next year, or next month but next week.  Women there are subject to grave deprivation, much of it due to the overcrowding.  That means that two or even three women are sharing a cell.  I have been told of consequent serious sexual harassment and coercion of younger women by older lesbian women prisoners because of that overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison should be closed down and the women prisoners moved to a decent place, to Wheatfield which was originally intended for women and not to a face-lifted St. Patricks.  Wheatfield was planned in the late seventies for women. At that time it was envisaged that there would be in the region of 170 women prisoners, but, of course, we know that is not true.  The Whitaker report of March 1984 dealt with the problem and made all the necessary recommendations one could possibly need.  Those recommendations should be acted on now. Women prisoners need decent accommodation, one prisoner per cell, proper exercise facilities, proper educational facilities, treatment for drug and alcohol abuse and proper work facilities.  I should like to quote from the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> 8.6 The survey confirmed the impression gained by the Committee during its visits to the prisons that women in custody were mainly young and the victims of an array of personal problems which cried out for attention. Sadly, very little was being done to help them.  The accommodation was so inadequate and of such poor standard that it could only have aggravated their problems.  There were no comprehensive therapeutic programmes for drug/alcohol abusers and psychiatric treatment was available only for the serious cases.  Work and education programmes were limited and poor.  Welfare Service staffing was insufficient to provide the intensive counselling service which these women needed to help them cope on release with normal living, home life and children.</P>
    <P>The people working in our prisons are doing a very difficult job.  I know women officers and welfare workers in the women's prison are caring and committed people, but we are asking them to fulfil an impossible role.</P>
    <P>As has been said, there are very few women offenders compared to the male prison population at any one time, 40 women to about 1,600 men, and most of them are young, under 30, and have been sentenced for petty crimes.  As a small group their needs, one would think, could be easily catered for but it is my view that because they are a small group they are ignored.  They are easily passed over and, unfortunately, nobody up to now has championed their cause.  I intend to do so and I call on the Council for the Status of Women, the ICA and other women's organisations to use their muscle to help those unfortunate women.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister that we will have an independent examination and report on what happened yesterday in the female prison and on the condition of the women's prison.  I want a commitment from the Minister that he will make the changes that are long overdue. I certainly intend to make the Minister's political life intolerable until the <Col N="2006" /> position of women in prison is dramatically improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all affected by the sad and tragic circumstances surrounding the death of the 19 year old girl in Mountjoy prison last night.  I join with my colleague, Deputy Fennell, in expressing condolences to her parents and relatives and, indeed, to the prison officers and let us also spare a thought for her young baby.  She was the first girl to commit suicide in our prisons.  I understand that many more have attempted suicide and that the number of incidents of wrist slashing and attempted throat cutting is such as to be almost commonplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of the prison staff it is clear that the women's prison in Mountjoy is totally unsuitable.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, will no doubt tell us about the committee he established last December to examine the issue of deaths in prison and to make recommendations generally.  This pass-the-buck approach will not do, particularly when we are dealing with matters of life and death.  The Minister should answer specific questions as follows: (1) what are the circumstances surrounding this young girl's death?  (2) Why has he not addressed the reforms recommended in the Whitaker report on penal reform? (3) Why will he not have a full Dáil debate on the issue of penal reform as I have requested many times?  (4) Has he examined the research on prison suicides which is available from the Home Office in the UK and is he aware that our suicide rate here is almost twice the UK average? Their figures are 45 to 50 a year out of a prison population of around 45,000 to 50,000, while our figure last year was four out of an average prison population of fewer than 2,000.  Is he further aware that as a result of the implementation of recommendations made, following the research into the 1972-87 period in the UK, there is evidence already that the rate of suicide in their prisons is now falling?  (5) Will the Minister explain to the House why the annual report on prisons for 1988 has not been published?  Has <Col N="2007" /> the report merely been deferred or is it being suppressed?  (6) Will the Minister accept that the health of prison inmates is an issue which is tossed around between the Departments of Health, Education and Justice and that, in particular, psychiatric and psychological treatment for drug abuse, alcoholism and sexual deviation is not available except on a very occasional basis?  (7) Why has the post of director of prison medical services been advertised merely on the basis of a two-year contract, thus making it almost certain that those interested, who are now in permanent posts, will not be able to accept the post?  (8) Why has the Minister failed to appoint prison visiting committees whose terms of appointment expired on 31 December last?  (9) Do the inmates in our prisons and, in particular, in the women's prison receive proper assessment, particularly drug addicts, with proper medical and nursing care?</P>
    <P>In circumstances where inmates need psychotropic medication are they administered by professional staff with the same regulatory practices as apply to the dispensing of drugs within the community as a whole?  (10) Has the Minister addressed the problem of sexual abuse in the women's prison?  Is he aware of incidents of such sexual abuse of young female inmates by other female prisoners? What is he doing about it?  Last, and most important, does the Minister now accept that he, as a part-time Minister, is not able to devote sufficient time to his many responsibilities in the justice area which require the full-time attention of a full-time Minister for Justice?  It would, as I suggested last Saturday at our Ard-Fheis, be an improvement if the Minister now resigned one of his portfolios and devoted himself full-time to the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Fennell for allowing me an opportunity to put on record my deepest regrets to the family of the young girl who, it appears, took her life in Mountjoy prison yesterday.  This morning I put a question to the Taoiseach in regard to <Col N="2008" /> his remarks about the need to appoint a Deputy or a Minister of State to the Department of Justice to assist the present Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Burke, responded by asking what had the death of the girl to do with him.  My reply then was that the Whitaker report would tell him all.  I should like to refer to a brief passage of that report which puts the matter beyond any doubt.  I should like to say to the Minister that that report sets out clearly what has to be done with regard to women in prison and it is, unfortunately, the Minister's duty now, in the long line of Ministers who have ignored its recommendations, to do something about it before another life is lost.  Paragraph 8.7 of the report states:</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that facilities for women prisoners have been neglected and that advances made in male prisons, for example, in the development of education work and skills training activities, have not touched the women's prisons.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 8.12 states:</P>
      <P>The Committee is still satisfied that there is no suitable building or unit for a closed women's prison in the present prison system.  It is imperative that one be designed and built without delay.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 8.15 states in regard to services that:</P>
      <P>The Committee would like to emphasise that it is essential to introduce immediately for all women in custory (closed or open) a full range of services including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;adequate health care...</P>
      <P>&mdash;facilities for the care of any child born in prison;</P>
      <P>&mdash;full back-up psychiatric care with easy access to in-patient psychiatric hospital treatment;</P>
      <P>&mdash;programmes for the treatment of drug/alcohol abusers;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a full welfare service programme;</P>
      <P>&mdash;counselling services...</P>
      <P>&mdash;purposeful work activities;</P>
      <P>&mdash;skills training to AnCO and CERT standards;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" />&mdash;a full education programme...</P>
    <P>It is all there in the report.  As long as the Minister ignores it, the death last night has everything to do with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, share the concern to which deaths in prison give rise.  As for the death which has led to the debate tonight, I am sure the House will agree that the death of someone so young and in such tragic circumstances &mdash; whether it occurs in prison or in the community &mdash; must be a matter of great regret.  In expressing my sympathy to the family and friends of the deceased I think I should mention that anyone who heard her mother being interviewed on the radio at lunchtime would be filled with the deepest sympathy for her and respect for the dignified way in which she bore her grief.</P>
      <P>An inquest into the death will take place in due course and, as all matters relevant to the death will be inquired into on that occasion, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment on them in detail here.  There is the further point that sensitivity to the feelings of the family and friends of the deceased, particularly at this time, so soon after the death, requires a considerable degree of reticence in that regard.  I am sure no-one would wish anything to be said which could add in any way to the distress of the bereaved.</P>
      <P>Deaths in custody are an unfortunate reality faced by prison administrations the world over but because of the concern which deaths in prison understandably give rise to, I established, towards the end of last year, an advisory group to examine specifically the issue of deaths in prisons and to make recommendations in relation to any aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group comprises a governor and deputy governor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a chaplain, a senior member of the probation and welfare service, a representative of the Prison Officers' Association and a principal officer from the prisons division of my Department. Not only is there a high level of expertise among the members of the group but <Col N="2010" /> they are also consulting with others who may be able to assist them in their task. The group fully appreciate the urgency which attaches to their task but, given the enormously complex and sensitive issues which they have to address it is clearly vital that they have sufficient time to enable them to deal with these matters comprehensively over whatever period proves necessary.</P>
    <P>A report on each death is carefully examined within my Department with a view to establishing whether there was any action that might have been taken that might have helped to bring a risk to notice or that might have lessened any risk that was known in the particular case. Riders to inquest verdicts are carefully examined by the prison authorities and implemented when considered appropriate and practical.  One rider recommended the installation of a cell-call system to enable offenders to contact staff.  As part of a long planned rewiring project at Mountjoy which has been underway for the past few months a new cell-call system is being installed.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the specific issue of deaths in custody, it has been common cause for many years that physical conditions at Mountjoy women's prison were in need of improvement.  That is why at an early stage after becoming Minister for Justice I decided that priority should be given to completely refurbishing the accommodation there and the Government provided the necessary funds in this year's Estimates to enable refurbishment to take place.  This work is being undertaken as part of the refurbishment of the St. Patrick's Institution complex of which the women's prison forms part.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the refurbishment of the women's prison at Mountjoy represents the most effective way of improving the quality of the accommodation for women prisoners, at least in the relatively short term.</P>
    <P>Physical conditions are, of course, only one of the factors which determine the quality of life for prisoners.  It has to be said that women prisoners have a wide array of services made available to them, <Col N="2011" /> including psychiatric, psychological, welfare, educational and chaplaincy.  In recent years a medical officer has been appointed to deal exclusively with the needs of female offenders.</P>
    <P>While I emphasise again that it would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the circumstances of the death last night, I think it only right to say, in case it appears from public comment that no services were available to the deceased, that she had been availing of medical services at the prison on a regular basis and had the benefit of a consultation with a medical adviser at noon yesterday.  I think it would be a pity if any comments were to be made which would detract from the efforts of these agencies, and of those of management and staff in the prison service, to provide a humane regime for those in their care.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it is not possible in the course of these few minutes to comment in detail on recommendations made in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System.  I think I should mention, however, two points: the post of medical director and the question of alternatives to imprisonment.  The House will be aware that despite two competitions for the post of medical director it did not prove possible to make an appointment to it.  I had this matter reexamined and, as a result, the post was readvertised two weeks ago with a substantial increase in remuneration and improvements in conditions of services in an effort to attract a suitable candidate.</P>
    <P>I should mention that in recent years the duties of the medical director have been undertaken by the chief medical officer of the Civil Service and I am happy to acknowledge the contribution which he has made.  I should make it clear, of course, that in addition to the chief medical officer there are 15 medical <Col N="2012" /> doctors visiting the prisons and places of detention on a regular basis with at least the same number of psychiatrists being available to provide their services as and when required.  Where specialist services or hospital treatment is required, the necessary arrangements are made.  The role of the chief medical officer &mdash; and medical director when appointed &mdash; therefore, is directional and administrative rather than clinical.</P>
    <P>With regard to alternatives to imprisonment, the House will appreciate that the sentence imposed in a particular case is a matter for the courts which have a wide range of non-custodial alternatives available to them, including community service and which, in fact, make wide use of alternatives.  Finally, if Members of this House have specific points &mdash; I want to emphasise this and I say it in a totally non-political way, I am not the fountain of all knowledge on this no more than anybody on the far side of the House is &mdash; which they believe should be considered by the advisory group on prison deaths, I would, of course, be happy to pass them on to the group and to take them into account when consideration is being given to the matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the comment made by Deputy Fennell about making my political life intolerable in relation to this issue, I feel a deep sense of commitment in this area.  That is the reason I tried to do as much as I have done and I will continue to do so in the length of time I am in the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer was on sick leave for a period in the current year, 1989-90, during which time refunds of tax totalling £258.77 were made to him by his employer.  The total tax deducted from his earnings in the current year was £291.75.  The taxpayer went on pension on 15 September 1989, and as a result he is entitled to a refund of the balance of tax deducted, i.e., £32.98. This amount will be refunded to him by his employer with his next pension payment.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the <Col N="1848" /> Revenue Commissioners that a return of income was received from the taxpayer in December 1989.  Unfortunately, because of an oversight in the tax office, a certificate of tax free allowances was not issued to the taxpayer for use against his retirement pension.  The payer of the pension is now being advised of the allowances due to the taxpayer and the tax deducted from his pension in the current year will be refunded to him with this month's pension payment.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes is also writing to the taxpayer for the details required to carry out a review of his liability for 1988-89 and to determine if he is entitled to relief in respect of the lump sum payment received by him when he retired. On receipt of the relevant details his liability will be reviewed and any tax found to have been overpaid will be refunded.</P>

The scheme also applies to registered blind persons over 18 years and to certain categories of disabled persons under 66 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment, including those in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board. The scheme also applies to spouses under age 66 for journeys on which they accompany the qualified person.</P>
      <P>Under present arrangements, payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance may be continued for a maximum of eight weeks after recipients go into institutional care.

    <P>He continued to receive payment of disability benefit and was examined by a medical referee on 20 February 1989 who expressed the opinion that he was not <Col N="1853" /> incapable of work and payment of disability benefit was disallowed by a deciding officer from 28 February.  The claimant appealed against the decision and was examined by a different medical referee on 1 June 1989 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
    <P>Following an oral hearing on 1 November 1989 the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  The claimant submitted further medical evidence in January 1990.  However, this was not deemed by the appeals officer to warrant a revision of the decision made. The claimant has continued to submit medical certificates of incapacity and arrangements have been made for a further examination by a medical referee.</P>
    <P>In the meantime investigations made confirmed the circumstances of the accident concerned and injury benefit was allowed from 15 July 1988 to 21 December 1988, the end of the 26 week injury benefit period.  Payment of injury benefit over and above the disability benefit paid was issued to him.</P>

      <P>The grant approved for the provision of sewerage facilities and a bathroom, and for repairs to the house, has been paid. A grant cannot be allowed for a water supply as an existing supply only became defective in March 1988 by which time the house improvement grants scheme had been terminated.</P>

      <P>Following discussions between my Department, the National Council for Educational Awards and the college authorities, it was agreed that the one year certificate courses in visual education should be discontinued in all of the VEC third level colleges.  The position generally in relation to art and design courses in VEC colleges is that national certificate level courses are of two years duration and diploma courses are of three years duration.  These are similar to the duration of courses at the same level in other disciplines and do not compare unfavourably with courses internationally having regard to the entry requirements and the level of award.</P>

      <P>Investment in the upgrading of most categories of accommodation already qualifies for relief under the business expansion scheme.

There is also a provision in the agri-tourism scheme under the revised western package which allows farmers in disadvantaged areas to obtain assistance for accommodation where it is linked to the development of amenities.</P>
