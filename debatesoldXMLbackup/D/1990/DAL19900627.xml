    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 13, 14 and 15.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that (1) business shall be interrupted at 1 a.m. tomorrow; (2) the sitting shall be suspended from 7 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.; (3) there shall be no Private Members' Business today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I do not agree with any of the matters proposed, subject to the agreement of the House.  I am opposing the Order of Business because of the Government's refusal to withdraw the ludicrous Broadcasting Bill now before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I object to the manner in which the Government are proposing business for today, primarily because it seems unprecedented for the Government to suggest that the House should address one item until 1 a.m. tomorrow and for the rest of this week.  There are other items which should be discussed.  I am afraid that this Bill, given the manner of its introduction, the divisions between the Government parties and the subsequent alterations by <Col N="934" /> Minister, reflects very badly on the Government.  We are opposing the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>As the other Deputies have said, the way in which it is attempted to do the business of the House this week seems extraordinary. We facilitated the Taoiseach earlier this week by not sitting yesterday because of his involvement in the Summit.  We are faced with a sitting of 15 hours today. Whatever concerns the Taoiseach may or may not have about Deputies there should be at least some concern for the staff.  It is unreasonable to expect them to work a 15 hour stint with only a break of a half an hour between 7 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. this evening.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Government are trying to drive through the Broadcasting Bill in less than five weeks when a child care Bill has been on the Order Paper for five years.  Apparently we will not reach this Bill until the autumn.</P>

      <P>I have not been on my feet for more than one and a half minutes which I believe is quite brief given the length of time some speeches take in this House.  May I continue to make my point, a Cheann Comhairle?  It is extraordinary that the Government are prepared to drive a coach-and-four through the democratic traditions of this House and are trying to force through a Broadcasting Bill which virtually nobody wants at a time when there is widespread demand from a cross section of the population for the introduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the child care Bill which has been on the Order Paper for more than five years.  It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach is prepared to do this.  Perhaps his attention has been diverted because of his role as the President of the EC and the Summit business which we had to carry out over the past couple of days.  I ask the Taoiseach to allow the normal sitting time today to deal with the Broadcasting Bill today, to schedule the child care Bill for the rest of this session and, if necessary, to sit until the end of July to deal with that Bill.  The Government need a cooling-off period&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Opposition seem to wish to deny the Government the right to introduce legislation and to deal with it in this House.  We are not accepting that type of dictation from the Opposition. I find these interventions extraordinary. The Opposition complained because their ineptitude led to a shortening of the debate on the Second Stage.  We are now offering all the time they want to deal with the Committee Stage and they are objecting to that.  Will they make up their minds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On item No. 3, the Government, when making their proposals in relation to the Order of Business for today, offered an hour and a half for debate on Private Members' time this week on condition that the House sat until 2 o'clock tomorrow morning.  That, Sir, is utterly inadequate; it is bullying tactics on the part of the Government. My party have an important motion for debate before this House concerning the situation in Arigna, a matter that will affect literally thousands of families over wide areas of Counties Leitrim and Roscommon.  I see no reason whatever that we should not make three hours available during our business this week to discuss that issue.  What is being proposed here, that there be no Private Members' Business, is the Government simply endeavouring to muzzle debate on this important issue, and I am opposing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would likewise wish to be on record in relation to the elimination of Private Members' Business for this week.  Private Members' Business is obviously of major importance to the Opposition parties and I request the Taoiseach at this stage to allow Private Members' Business to take its normal course during this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points.  The House did not sit yesterday in order to facilitate the Government and, as a result, we are now being penalised by not having Private Members' Business.  In addition to that, the Private Members' Business periods are quite restricted in any event.  If all of the periods available in any given year were used, The Workers' Party would be lucky to get two of them in the whole year.  If the procedure which is being adopted today is carried through, the likelihood of The Workers' Party having <Col N="947" /> a further period of Private Members' time this year is practically nil.  I am proposing, therefore, an amendment to No. 3, that the words following &ldquo;There&rdquo; be deleted and that the words &ldquo;shall be Private Members' Business today from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. and tomorrow, Thursday, from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.&rdquo; be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to tell the House that the proposal that there will be no Private Members' Business today is made under Standing Order 86.  Standing Order 86 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a member of the Government may move, <Col N="948" /> without notice, at the commencement of public business on any Tuesday or Wednesday that specified Government business shall not be interrupted if under consideration at the time fixed for taking Private Members' Business and that such motions shall be decided without amendment.Therefore, I cannot accept an amendment in this case.</P>
      <P>The question, therefore, is for the House to consider that consideration of Government business be not interrupted today at the time fixed for the taking of Private Members' Business.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That there be no Private Members' Business today.&rdquo;</P>

I am aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Education went to Rome yesterday.

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Higgins, was in possession for quite a long time, to very good effect.  However I was the Deputy in possession when the Dáil reported progress.  At that time I was dealing with amendment No. 1 to section 1 or, more correctly, the lack of a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in the Bill. The Workers' Party amendment proposes that &ldquo; `advertising' shall mean advertising, other than promotional material broadcast by the authority within its own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting its own commercial activities&rdquo;.  It is very fortunate that this is the amendment, or some similar amendment, we are dealing with at the beginning of the Committee Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This initiative on the capping of RTE advertising was not part of the Minister's first thoughts with regard to RTE.  His first thought was the now infamous proposal to kill off 2FM.  In fairness to the Minister, he told us it was a Government decision that the entire programming of 2FM should be changed with a view to making it no longer a popular station.  At the same time that the Minister announced his intention to kill off 2FM, he brought in the now discredited idea of taking £6 million from the licence fee and making it available to the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  This proposal still stands in the Bill, but the Minister has told us of his intention to change it.  After all this we have the capping of advertising.  With all these wild changes and gyrations in the space of two weeks, is it any wonder that people on this side of the House would mistrust the Minister's intentions? We are seeking an accurate and total definition of advertising in this definition section, which usually gives rise to very little discussion or debate.  This amendment, or one on the same lines drafted by the Minister, is absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our indications are that the Minister, with his concept of advertising, intends to take in a very broad canvas.  He also tells us that there is no need to define the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; since it is a well-known concept.  It is anything but.  It is an area where great change has taken place from one year to another.  It is to a great extent the land of fantasy peopled by men of great imagination.  Because of this and because of changes in media technology, advertising is changing very much.  Thirty years ago in Dublin all we had in respect of advertising were the print media, and maybe the Bovril sign in College Green, David Allen hoardings and the occasional auctioneer's poster <Col N="960" /> hung outside a firm offered for sale.  That was the totality of advertising then.  Now we have vast changes, especially the major change generated by television.</P>
    <P>Massive sums of money are put into sponsorship of people and of events.  Various people are paid lots of money for wearing highly identifiable products. Who would have thought 30 years ago that people would be paid for wearing football boots?  Everyone taking part in the World Cup is paid a small fortune or a large fortune, depending on where he comes from, for wearing highly marked football boots.  The same applies, perhaps in a more sophisticated manner, at Wimbledon where mega bucks are being paid for a similar type of advertising.  Players in the World Cup competition may gain our sympathy if we think they are injured but perhaps they are taking a dive, waiting for the camera to focus on the soles of their well-sponsored boots.  The same thing is happening in many sports.  Who could have imagined 30 years ago that a horse at the RDS would be named after a cigarette or a pound of butter?  There is also subliminal advertising.  Who knows what the future will bring in advertising?</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that there should be a clear cut definition of what we mean by &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in this Bill.  The Minister says there is no need for it and presumably he is acting on the advice of his parliamentary draftsmen, yet the same parliamentary draftsmen who are responsible for this Bill have also produced the Control of Horses Bill which arrived on our desks this morning.  They find it necessary in the latter Bill to define what a horse is.  If anyone has a clear concept of anything, surely it must be of a horse.  The smallest child in the biggest city must know what a horse is from the earliest moment of perception.  Yet the parliamentary draftsmen who tell the Minister there is no need to define &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; define a horse.  Most people would presume that a horse is a horse.  Caligula's horse, after getting his nomination to the senate on one of the emperor's 11 at the time still would be recognisable as a horse even walking <Col N="961" /> through the corridors of power, but, to prove beyond all doubt that we should have a definition of advertising, I will refer to the definition of a horse as given by the parliamentary draftsmen in the Control of Horses Bill which we got this morning.  Herein, according to the parliamentary draftsmen, a horse means any mare, gelding, pony, foal, colt, filly or stallion.  Also a horse means any ass, mule or jennet or any other equine animal.  Therefore, a horse can mean an ass as far as this Bill is concerned.  Surely if we have that kind of thing in that Bill there is definition for what is a far less clear concept, the very quickly changing area of advertising.  This is the purpose of the amendment we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>It seems the Minister's intention, in addition to capping advertising as we know it in the popular concept of advertising, is also to cap sponsorship and, if he proceeds along that line, the whole area of promotional activities within RTE.</P>

      <P>Without this amendment to the Bill what we are talking of here <Col N="962" /> would be the total freezing of RTE revenue as it is at this time, the blocking off of all new outlets of potential income for the station.  The Minister may say the licence fee would be increased in due course.  What will the public reaction be to that, the public who now know that RTE if they so wish can make far more money than they will be allowed to make? How will they react to an increase in the licence fee?  We should be seeking to hold the licence fee as it is now or perhaps to decrease it for certain categories of people or to phase it out altogether. Instead, obviously the mechanism that will be used in future in order to give RTE some limited increase in their resources will be an increase in the licence fee.  Of course, that in turn will give the Government of the day an inordinate hold over the entire operation of the station, so they would know that to be viable they would have to have the goodwill of the Government.  It is an area RTE feared in the past when they did not have so much money for advertising, and I am afraid they will be re-entering that area now if this Bill goes through especially if it goes through without this or some similar amendment to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the Minister's idea that he would not allow promotion of RTE commercial enterprises outside the quota time.  What is wrong with RTE trying to make extra money in that fashion and use it for the good of the station?  The lifeline of all their commercial enterprises, their total life-blood, is that they should be able to promote outside the ordinary quota. People involved in publications or broadcasting of any sort, be it on TV, radio, in the print media or even down to the sedate printing houses, all use their own publications and programmes to promote commercial enterprises by themselves.  It is extremely important that this be retained by RTE.  The result of this practice has been all around benefit to the station in their income and to whole areas, particularly in the field of culture. Take, for example, the symphony orchestra and attendance at the National Concert Hall.  These are very popular because <Col N="963" /> they are very vigorously promoted by RTE in their ex-quota advertising time and we see the result of that in terms of benefit to the whole country and in particular to the cultural area.  At least it compensates RTE in some small way for having been asked to take on what is basically a national duty &mdash; that of running the national orchestra.  If the Minister goes down the line with this action, I would, at least, expect that he would make provision for RTE to promote their commercial enterprises so as to allow them to offset the obligations they have had to take on, such as the National Symphony Orchestra and other activities.  I hope the Minister will drop the idea of curtailing the commercial enterprises of RTE &mdash; indeed I hope he will drop the whole Bill, which is the purpose of our opposition to it, because we think it is faulty.</P>
    <P>I have already said that RTE are engaged in many potentially unprofitable areas.  Let us consider the <i>RTE Guide,</i> the house magazine, which is profitable at present and is one of the most popular magazines sold in this country.  I believe that without the ability of RTE to promote this magazine in their ex-quota time the <i>RTE Guide</i> would die a death within two years, if perhaps not a year, or if it did not die it would become a nonprofitable, loss-making magazine, as it was in the past.  The <i>RTE Guide,</i> in turn, helps RTE and encourages people to view RTE rather than the opposition channels, which are coming in from all over the place.  At present the <i>RTE Guide</i> is a profitable enterprise and brings in extra money to RTE but if they were not able to use their ex-quota advertising time for promoting their activities, then the <i>RTE Guide,</i> the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Concert Hall would certainly be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The effects of the Bill will be to kill off initiative and enterprise.  If RTE cannot make any more money, what will they do?  They may simply put a girl at the end of the telephone to take in advertisements at rates which will be jacked <Col N="964" /> up until they hit the ceiling.  We are stultifying enterprise of a very valuable nature if we proceed along the lines the Minister is proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>While I can see the purpose of diverting potential advertising from RTE &mdash; although I do not agree with it &mdash; to prop up the incoming TV3 channel, I find it very hard to see any real purpose for the attack on RTE's commercial enterprises. If the Minister persists with this line, one must conclude that it is his intention not only to curtail RTE but to impoverish them.  There have been allegations that the Minister is pursuing a personal vendetta against RTE.  I do not see why he should be worried about them and I find it hard to believe this is the case.  It is not right to assume that people are huddled in corners in the corridors of RTE figuring out how they can get at the Government in one way or another, yet sometimes the Government or the Establishment have that idea.  It is also incorrect to think that the corridors of RTE are peopled by The Workers' Party members' as is often alleged.  The Workers' Party members are not an unknown species, but they do not people the entire organisation of RTE.  There is a strong body of Fianna Fáil supporters and members &mdash; indeed one needs to go no further than the RTE Authority to look for them.</P>
    <P>There is no question of anyone in RTE at any stage seeking to get at the Government and to get at the Establishment. RTE like to be adversarial &mdash; that is the concept of how the job should be done and that is to the benefit of the people who are being interviewed or taking part in programmes.  Indeed, I remember a public person commenting on me when I worked in RTE that I was equally offensive to all sides and I took that as a compliment at that time.  I see no reason the Minister should pursue a vendetta &mdash; if there is a vendetta &mdash; against RTE.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment which has the effect of curtailing future capping of RTE advertising, I will be left with no alternative but to believe the Minister is pursuing a personal vendetta. Why should the Minister seek to stop <Col N="965" /> RTE promoting their commercial enterprises in an area that is not interfering with anyone?  This amendment is extraordinarily important and I appeal to the Minister and all those concerned to ensure that a definition like the one in this amendment, if not that one, is drafted by an imaginative parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>If RTE are capped &mdash; unless they can gain some money for themselves through new commercial enterprises &mdash; it is my firm belief they will not be able to compete in the competitive world of new, highly sophisticated satellite stations with vast resources.  At present a very good example of the difficulties RTE face is that their total budget for news on both radio and television is £5 million whereas the BBC have a budget of between £120 million and £130 million for their news and current affairs programmes, which is more than the entire budget RTE have for all their programming on RTE 1, RTE 2, Radio 1 and FM2.  We are in direct competition with the BBC and other channels.  The Sky channel have a budget of £45 million for their new service and they are also in direct competition with RTE.  We cannot dictate to the public what station they will watch because they will watch whatever is the best and most immediate, but RTE has to compete against all stations.  In addition, we will also be able to receive the new British satellite station which, because of the resources available will probably be better than SKY, which is an excellent news station.  These are the people with whom we have to compete and this is why RTE need the resources they get from advertising.  If the money RTE get from advertising is to be capped &mdash; I do not agree with this proposal &mdash; then &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; must be properly defined, as proposed in this amendment, to enable them to get revenue from other areas.</P>
    <P>If we cap RTE's advertising it is possible, but not certain, that TV3 will be a success &mdash; there may not be enough advertising to fund a new channel but it may get off the ground and succeed. However, if RTE have to operate on <Col N="966" /> reduced resources and TV3 have to operate on limited resources, we will have two helpings of mediocrity.  Competition does not necessarily mean that we will have better or more home produced programmes &mdash; there may be more popular programmes &mdash; and if we go on numbers alone we can see what competition can lead to, for example the type of stories the British tabloids publish.</P>
    <P>As a sovereign nation we need a strong national broadcasting service.  We must ensure that our national station is not sidelined in all this competition.  If RTE are not extremely well endowed as far as resources are concerned, they could well become sidelined and irrelevant.</P>
    <P>At present television is very much about funding.  There is talent in TV stations but it is only those stations which have the necessary resources who can buy this talent.  If we proceed along the lines proposed in the Bill I am afraid that we will stifle initiative.  This Bill has already had a devastating effect on the morale of RTE staff and, as we know, it will lead to a loss of jobs in the station.  For example, if we curtail commercial enterprises &mdash; a small section &mdash; it will lead to the loss of 100 jobs.  At 7.30 this morning I met a man at Elm Park Golf Club who was about to set up &mdash; with expertise and resources from outside the country &mdash; to make commercials.  However, he has had to put this proposal on hold pending the outcome of the debate on this Bill.  That is the kind of thing that is happening at present.  Many prominent people within RTE have said that if this Bill is enacted it will lead to the loss of between 300 and 400 jobs.  In any event, it will inevitably lead to job losses on a massive scale.  It will also lead to a loss of talent because these people will go where the money is and RTE will be impoverished as a result.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, we are totally against the Bill.  We agree that it is necessary to look at the operations of RTE but we do not agree with the hurried fashion in which this was done.  When matters did not meet with popular support or with the support of the Progressive Democrats, they were changed.  Obviously these proposals have not been thought <Col N="967" /> out; many of them in my opinion, did not originate within the Department of Communications; and many of them reflect the Minister's ideas &mdash; obviously he has changed his ideas very quickly. There is a need to set up a review body to look into the operations of RTE in the interests of broadcasting generally and I would advise the Minister to withdraw this Bill until such a review is carried out.</P>
    <P>I strongly support this amendment.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with an amendment concerning the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  It is highly appropriate that we are dealing with it because the revised Bill is all about advertising.  The Government, for the moment, appear to have abandoned their wish to transfer the licence fee but now seek to achieve the same end by capping RTE's advertising and, effectively, transferring advertising revenue.  The Minister, in his statement, estimates that in a full year the capping of advertising for RTE, simply by reducing the amount of time that RTE can advertise for, will cost the station £12 million.  It has been stated by management, trade unions and others that that move will cost in the order of 500 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning the Minister for Energy came to the defence of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whom he said was in Japan trying to encourage industries to establish there in order to create employment.  It is interesting to note the efforts being made to try to attract employment to this country and they are efforts that all Members, by and large, support while at the same time through the Bill and the capping of RTE's advertising 500 secure and well paid jobs are being put at risk.  In addition, the employment of people on contract to RTE, those who contract services to RTE for a variety of reasons &mdash; in many cases it is in the area of advertising and I am referring to actors, film makers and so on <Col N="968" /> who contract their services to RTE &mdash; are having their employment put at risk.</P>
    <P>We have a habit of exporting our best talent.  We often point to the fact that on many occasions some of the best people go abroad and we wonder how it is that Irish people when abroad seem to do so much better than when at home.  We no doubt will wonder in future years why it is that there are so many Irish film makers, broadcasters and professional people in the broadcasting area doing so well in broadcasting stations abroad rather than at home.  The answer is simply; every time initiative is shown here it is killed off by Government action of one kind or another.  Every time, for example, people in the broadcasting services in the last 30 years built up a record of initiative and enterprise it was killed off or driven out to other countries.  Deputy Nealon's point about mediocrity is a valid one because what we are getting is a recipe for mediocrity.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate the Minister gave two replies, one more pathetic than the other.  In the first reply, after he was invited by a number of Members to avail of the opportunity of the amendment to respond to the shortened Second Stage debate and the points raised during it, not only did he reject that offer but he read into the record a reply which was pathetic and failed to address the substance of the amendment before us.  His second intervention was on the arrangements for advertising by charitable organisations, and I shall deal with that later.  The best the Minister could say in his first reply on advertising was that there was no need for a definition of advertising, that everybody knew what an advertisement was, that people would be able to work it out by common sense.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the possible loss of £12 million, on the Minister's admission, for RTE by virtue of the capping of advertising revenue.  On top of that we are talking about further losses because out of the four-and-a-half minutes per hour will now come, according to the Minister's statement, any cross-service promotions done by RTE and, possibly, any programme which involves any kind <Col N="969" /> of commercial promotion.  This should not be left to some loose definition of &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; particularly when the exercise of the common sense will be carried out by the Minister when making regulations under the Bill.  It is interesting to note that when it came to the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; the Minister was not prepared to leave it loose or something that could be defined by common sense.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's statement on Second Stage that he has a clear idea as to what constitutes advertising.  In the course of his Second Stage speech he said:</P>
    <P>Thus for example I will be making sure that cross-service promotions &mdash; for example promotion by RTE of their radio services on their TV service &mdash; count as advertisements for the purpose of complying with the 7.5 per cent advertising time limit.  Likewise promotion of commercial activities &mdash; such as the <i>RTE Guide</i> or video-cassettle compilations &mdash; will count as advertising.  RTE have a number of current practices in this area which they do not count as advertising for time limit purposes.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing?  He is writing himself a blank cheque.  In the Bill he states that it is his intention to limit the amount of advertising RTE can carry but, secondly, he states that he is going to reserve to himself the right to make regulations under the Bill to define what constitutes an advertisement.  At some future strage that may be used as a further limitation on the advertising that RTE can carry.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister doing this?  He is doing it because what the Bill is ultimately about, and why the Government are in such a rush to get it through, is an attempt to impose a form of censorship on the Irish media that has not existed in the history of the State and that is intolerable in any democratic society.  A censorship which does not rely on the making of straightforward statements of censorship or legislation but relies on the exercise of controlling advertising money is what we have here.  RTE, on the one <Col N="970" /> hand, will be frightened because of the loss of revenue that will occur.  There will also be the further threat that if they do not behave themselves in the future further measures will be taken because the Minister will have the right to define what constitutes an advertisement.  Ultimately, this is about censoring RTE and making the private broadcasting media in some way beholden to the Minister. The belief is that if RTE lose advertising revenue somebody else has to gain it.  It will be a unique situation whereby the Government will, effectively, disburse advertising revenue to whoever plays the game the way the Government want. Ultimately that will kill not just the home productions to which previous speakers referred but what remains of independent news and current affairs broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister also fails to understand what RTE have been attempting to do over the past number of years, to build up certain packages, not just engaging in broadcasting activity, but trying to use their enterprise and talents to promote certain packages which will not just be broadcast on the airwaves but which could subsequently be sold.  They have shown the kind of enterprise about which we hear so much and which we are often led to believe does not exist in semi-State companies or in State organisations.  I am talking about the enterprise that looks at the kind of activity in which they are engaged and asks how it can be expanded to other areas, for example, making a programme in order to make a video or record which can then be sold to contribute to the revenue of the organisation concerned.</P>
    <P>Orchestras have been identified as a prestige part of the RTE service broadcasting brief and which cost a considerable amount of money to keep going.  The music department in RTE &mdash; and the orchestras themselves &mdash; over the years have been attempting to try to bring about a situation where they could get revenue into the station.  It was not a question of performing concerts or simply being broadcast on the station, they produced products which could be sold, <Col N="971" /> increasing the revenue to RTE and to their own well-being.  For example, a concert in the National Concert Hall is advertised by RTE to encourage people to attend to fill the hall; it would then be broadcast by RTE, made into a record which would sell and of course RTE would expect to have the right to promote it on their airwaves.</P>
    <P>Not long ago RTE made a video &ldquo;Christmas at St. Patrick's Cathedral&rdquo;, a joint venture with an American distribution company.  The Minister is saying that if the RTE orchestras engage in that kind of activity in the future and if RTE decide to announce that their orchestras are playing in the National Concert Hall, they will have to drop an advertisement for Heinz beans to accommodate that.  The Minister is also saying that RTE cannot announce that a record has been made and where it is available unless such an announcement is paid for from the normal advertising revenue.  This amendment seeks to address that and to close that option to the Minister.</P>
    <P>RTE are covering the World Cup; the advertisement they are using in relation to the video they made about the qualifying series will have to come from the normal advertising time, in other words, it will cost RTE money to advertise the videos they make.  It will mean that RTE will not make any more videos of that kind and the whole buildup of enterprise in RTE over the past number of years where these kind of products have been promoted will be dropped.  The programme in relation to the national entertainment awards is a public service which tries to bring together the whole entertainment scene each year and RTE's advertisements in that regard will also have to be dropped.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address the question of political events?  During an election if RTE announce a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; debate between leaders of political parties, will it count as an advertisement and be taken out of advertising time?  That is the logic of the Minister's position.  If it is announced during a radio programme that the proceedings of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="972" /> Ard-Fheis can be seen on television, does it count as an advertisement?  If there is an announcement that there will be a special &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, will that count as an advertisement?  According to the Minister, the cross-service promotion of programmes will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>What about community events?  On the previous day the Minister said he was making a concession to charities.  It did not sound so to me as it was subsequently represented because in reality the Minister found another way of penalising RTE.  From his point of view it would be great if RTE could be made to advertise charities on a no cost basis because they would incur another penalty.  That is the way the Minister's statement came across, not as an altruistic gesture by the Minister to allow charities additional facilities.</P>
    <P>Let us take the question of charities. What is the logic of the Minister's new position in relation to them?  How does it affect the Telethon?  Does it mean that if RTE advertise it it will not come out of the normal advertising time?  What about coverage of events like the &ldquo;Live Aid&rdquo; concert?  Will those events &mdash; and others organised by 2FM &mdash; be affected? What about the position of community radio?  There was much emphasis here on the private radio service and the transfer of revenue to them to allow them to become commercially viable.  What about the events very often associated with community radio which RTE promote?For the past number of years RTE &mdash; for the period of a week &mdash; organised very successful community radio in my constituency.  If RTE announce on their normal RTE 1 or RTE 2 service that there is a community radio in Dún Laoghaire, Clonmel or somewhere else, will it count as an advertisement of one of RTE's products and come out of advertising revenue?  The same would apply to Raidió na Gaeltachta or to Teilifís na Gaeltachta, if that ever sees the light of day.</P>
    <P>We then come to dealing with the common-sense definition of an advertisement. If we apply such a definition, do we mean <Col N="973" /> an advertisement at some stage in an interval within a programme or between two programmes?  Is it an advertisement when the presenter of a programme announces a commercial break?  Where would that leave the announcing of events within programmes themselves? Let us take the Minister's statement about cross-service promotions.  For example, Gay Byrne regularly on his radio programme refers to his television programme &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;; he might announce how much has been collected for a charity promoted on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;; make some reference to some guest on his &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; or make some announcement in relation to a future &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  On his radio programme coming up to Christmas, for example, he might announce that on the following Friday evening, the toy show would be the subject of &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  Does that constitute an advertisement; does it count as cross-service promotion as defined by the common-sense approach being taken by the Minister?</P>
    <P>Let me come to the question of the types of packages that have been developed by RTE under which RTE have produced programmes but have also developed certain commercial projects around those programmes.  Take the example of a cookery programme &mdash; Darina Allen's cookery programme on RTE in association with which there was a book produced.  RTE promoted that book in two ways, first, by having a straightforward advertisement on it and, second, by also having announcements during the course of those programmes. When Darina Allen completes her recipe, the meal is portrayed on the television screens for all of us to see, and she announces that the recipe for that meal can be had from the book available to bookshops for whatever price.  Does that count as an advertisement?  We need to know this because, if the Minister's position is to be carried through, we will have a Bill which deals with advertising but which does not define &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;. That being the case, the only way we will know what constitutes an advertisement <Col N="974" /> is through the exercise of the Minister's common sense.  I should like to know where stands the Minister's common sense on the kind of examples I have given.  I am sure RTE would want to know where the Minister's common sense stands in these areas because they are the kind of areas which could cost the station a lot of money.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the levelling of the playing pitch.  In relation to advertising now the expectation is that the advertising which will be cut from RTE will be picked up by other brodcasting organisations, not necessarily based in this State, and by the print media.  I should like to tease out the level playing pitch question somewhat further. If the Minister's logic were to be carried into the print media it would mean that <i>The Sunday Independent</i> could not advertise what was going to appear in the <i>Irish Independent</i> the following week or, alternatively, it would have to be charged as an advertisement, one against the other. Furthermore, if legislation was introduced in this House seeking to limit the rights of the print media, for example, in the same manner as there is now a Bill before the House seeking to limit the rights of RTE, I have no doubt that serious questions would be raised about its constitutionality.  Very possibly we would have the Minister himself, or Members of his party, telling us that this was in defiance of the constitutional position or private property, that one could not limit the right of a private organisation or seek to restrict their rights in the manner in which the Minister now seeks to restrict the rights of RTE. It would raise the question of where the constitutional position on property stands in relation to public property or public organisations.  That may well be something that will have to be teased out elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The amendment before the House seeks to exclude from the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; any promotional material broadcast by RTE within their services for the purpose of promoting their commercial activities.  It is not an <Col N="975" /> unreasonable amendment.  It causes me great worry that the Minister has not accepted that amendment.  It suggests to me that the Minister is holding in reserve further draconian measures against RTE which he may or may not use depending on how well he is pleased or displeased with RTE particularly in their news and current affairs broadcasting.  Ultimately this legislation is about censorship.  What we are now attempting to do is in some way qualify the severe measures the Government intend taking.  This Bill constitutes one of the ways of doing so.  So far the Minister has not given any serious response to the amendment before the House.  Bearing in mind particularly the long debate we are having on this amendment, a serious response on the part of the Minister is required,</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the discussion so far has been taken up with the problems associated with the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; or &ldquo;advertise&rdquo;.  A number of previous speakers have adverted to the problem and to the need to insert in the legislation a definition of the word.  The Minister has indicated that everyone knows the meaning of the word &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; and that, therefore, it is not necessary to have a definition in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has been about the fact that the word &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; is not defined in the relevant legislation. The Minister said that everyone knows the meaning of the word and that, therefore, it is not necessary to define it despite the particular difficulties this legislation will create for RTE in the context of advertising.  It should be drawn to the Minister's attention that in the context of legislation where advertising has been <Col N="976" /> relevant, other Ministers in other Departments have found the need to define the word.  For example, for the purpose of planning legislation under section 2 (1) of the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963, advertising is said to mean &ldquo;any word, letter, model, balloon, kite, poster, notice, device or representation employed for the purpose of advertisement, announcement or direction&rdquo;.  I do not know what particular balloons the Minister might have in mind in regard to RTE, but it seems that in the absence of a definition, if a row arose about it, the Minister, the RTE Authority or possibly some legal counsel at some stage may have to revert to the 1963 Planning Act to get the meaning of the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;.The point I want to make is that in an area much less controversial it was found necessary to define &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;.Indeed it has been found necessary in English legislation to define it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House by going through the different applications of the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in English legislation but there is a reference in section 23 of the Theft Act, 1968 to the effect that advertisements offering a reward for the return of stolen property and promising that no questions would be asked constitute an offence, and the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; is defined. It is a difficult word.  It appears to be such a difficult word that some three or four columns of the Oxford Dictionary Volume I are taken up with trying to define it.  It could be suggested that the fact that the television programme, &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; which deals with problems of crimes committed in particular locations on occasions puts on screen photographs of household items, jewellery or paintings that have been stolen, constitutes an advertisement because it is bringing a matter to the notice of the general public.  If time is allowed by RTE for the programme &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; to continue as a public service programme, as a programme that Garda get benefit from, for example, by asking on occasions whether people would come <Col N="977" /> forward with information in relation to a particular offence, it would see in the context of the definition of the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in the English Oxford Dictionary if &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo;, lasted for the requisite period laid down in the legislation, without any shadow of a doubt, it would fall within the scope of the legislation.What else would fall within it?</P>
    <P>Again I will refer to the definition in the English Oxford Dictionary.  It may come as a surprise to the Minister that, in the context of that definition the Angelus would fall within the category of an advertisement.  Is it the Minister's intention to curtail the Angelus?  Is there to be a reduction of a minute &mdash; the length of time of the Angelus &mdash; in the marketable advertising time available to the authority?That would be extraordinary but I suspect that is not his intention.  I equally suspect that in the context of this hastily drafted and ill-conceived legislation, the Minister has not to any great extent addressed the complexities of the terminology of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; and of the amount of time RTE can devote to particular types of public service or religious broadcasting and the time they can devote to their money-raising function in the area of commercial advertising.  I wonder whether the term &ldquo;commercial advertising&rdquo; should be contained in the Bill.  I disagree with the Minister's intentions but, if we take them at face value, perhaps there should be a reference to commercial advertising as opposed to advertising <i>simpliciter</i> and there should be, within the context of the definition section, not just a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; or &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; but of the more complicated concept of commercial advertising.</P>
    <P>In the last two and a half weeks we have celebrated the success of the Irish soccer team in Italy.  You may ask, Sir, what relevance has the Irish soccer team in Italy to this Bill.  The overwhelming majority of people who have not been able to go to Italy have been sitting in front of their television screens watching what can only be described as the superb broadcast and television presentation by RTE Network 2 on a daily basis, with <Col N="978" /> Bill O'Herlihy and the other members of the panel, Johnny Giles and Eamon Dunphy, whom some people like and some hate but who certainly adds a great deal of interest to the programmes.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the problems the Bill would create for RTE in continuing to broadcast this type of programme in the future?  If the Minister had got his way and this Bill had been pushed through all stages in the House last week, RTE's World Cup broadcasting would have had to come to a halt.  Has anyone noticed that every time the programme is interrupted to go into what are recognised as the real commercials, every time the programme commences or there is a to-ing and fro-ing between the various broadcasts, a little Bord Gáis logo appears on the screen?  An Bord Gáis are sponsoring and contributing to the financing by RTE of this superb programme, a programme which in its presentation, approach and panel far excels any programme from the competing channels either across the water or by satellite.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention to prevent bodies such as An Bord Gáis from sponsoring such events in the future?  Is it the Minister's intention, not merely perhaps to take the Angelus off our screens but the weather forecast as well?  Do people notice that nowadays the weather forecast is sponsored by Bord Telecom Éireann?  Every time there is a television weather forecast, the Telecom sponsorship logo appears on screen.  It can take two or three minutes to broadcast a weather forecast or, on a particularly stormy day, it may take three of four minutes.  Is that time to be counted as the advertising time within any particular hour?  Is this type of sponsorship of programmes, which allows RTE to excel in a number of areas while ensuring at the same time that it is not necessary to increase the licence fee, to be brought to an end?  If this sort of programme could not be sponsored through advertising by An Bord Gáis and Telecom Éireann, it would inevitably be taken off our screen or the quality would be diminished. Alternatively it would be a substitute for <Col N="979" /> advertising proper.  I do not believe this is the Minister's intention.  I do not believe this matter has been thought out. I do not believe the Minister wants to take the World Cup off our screens.  If everyone on the Opposition side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the contribution I was making I was adverting to the various problems raised with advertising.  This Bill needs to distinguish between the sponsorship of programmes and advertising.It is clear from the examples I have given of the weather forecast and the World Cup coverage that there should be a distinct difference between sponsorship of that nature and advertising but, of course, the two are interlinked.  Whatever the Minister's intentions may be, the <Col N="981" /> Bill as currently drafted curtails those activities.  It includes the Angelus within the area of advertising, it includes the World Cup coverage as sponsored by An Bord Gáis in the area of advertising and it includes the weather forecast.  It tries to do something else &mdash; and this is what I would describe as the miserable element of the Bill &mdash; it tries to take the fun out of public service broadcasting by RTE.</P>
      <P>How many people in Ireland sit and watch the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; regularly and participate in quizzes where a major motor manufacturer has given the prize of a motor car which can, result in hundreds of thousands of people sending replies to those quizzes?  If Toyota, Fiat, Ford, Mitsubishi or any of the other motor manufacturers donate a car for a quiz, they do so because they think it is a worth while advertisement on a widely watched television programme.  The viewers participate in a quiz from which they may benefit if they are lucky enough to win.  It seems clear that the type of &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; quizzes that have been run as a result of such sponsorship &mdash; the mix of advertising and public service broadcasting &mdash; by the provision of a product to the winner come within the concept of advertising.</P>

      <P>All sections of the National Archives Act, 1986, are now in <Col N="984" /> operation.  By 31 December 1990, departmental records which are more than 30 years old should in general either be transferred to the National Archives to be made available there to the public, or be covered by certificates made under section 8 (2) or 8 (4) of the Act authorising their retention in Departments.</P>
      <P>The transfer of such a large quantity of records has meant that additional accommodation has had to be provided for the National Archives.  Accordingly, the Government decided last year that premises at Bishop Street which are owned by the State should be allocated to the National Archives.  The occupation of these premises by the National Archives commenced earlier this month.  I am satisfied that the front block of the building at Bishop Street will meet the immediate need of the National Archives for accommodation for records due for transfer from Departments by 31 December 1990.  I have been advised by the director of the National Archives that, with eventual restructuring, the building as a whole will meet the storage neds of the National Archives until well into the next century.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Departments have been made fully aware of their obligations under the National Archives Act.  The progress being made by Departments in preparing records for transfer is being monitored by the director of the National Archives and his staff on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>The director of the National Archives has recently sought information from all Departments concerning the measures which they propose to take to ensure that the deadline of 31 December 1990 for the transfer of records is met.  The need for any further action in the matter by my Department will be considered in the light of the replies received by the director.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to ask two supplementary questions.  First, will the Taoiseach consider the request made by the Leader of Fine Gael this morning to have a debate on the Summit by way of motion rather than statement? Would the Taoiseach give that request some consideration as many important decisions have been made and will be made, during the next six months?  There are many Deputies in the House who would like to have an opportunity to debate the issues involved.  I understand that Ireland is now committed to some form of political union.  As even a minimalist form of union would involve a willingness of the partners to defend the intrigity of the union, will the Taoiseach explain in his statement next week how our commitment to political union equates with the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on television last night that this has absolutely no implication whatsoever for Irish neutrality?

Given his reluctance to set up a foreign affairs committee which would have been able to deal with these matters, would the Taoiseach consider allowing the committee to look at the question and try to establish a common position in this House in view of the huge changes that will be taking place on the European front?</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy has read the declaration, which fully covers all these matters.  The declaration has been welcomed by environmentalists everywhere as a major declaration and a commitment by the Community to an enlightened policy on the environment.  The conclusions only refer to the declaration, but the full text of what the Community decided is in the environment declaration.  If the Deputy has not got it, I will be very happy to provide him with a copy.</P>

      <P>In response to Deputy Spring the Taoiseach indicated that he would have no objections to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC addressing the questions of political and monetary union.  Would the Taoiseach therefore agree to whatever changes are necessary in the terms of reference of that committee to carry out that function?  The terms are quite narrow and the Dáil has only once debated a report from that committee. The terms of reference should be adequate to deal with the issues concerned and we should be given an undertaking that the report will be debated here prior to the inter-governmental conference.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Taoiseach saw his role as that of chairman trying to seek a consensus and he did that very well.  This had the unfortunate result of fudging the Irish policy position.  When will the Taoiseach be in a position to spell out clearly and in detail the Irish position on economic and monetary union and on political union?  It is not clear, which is perhaps understandable in that the Taoiseach was seeking a consensus.  When can the Taoiseach give the detail necessary for debate?</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce a special scheme of grant assistance specifically for the restoration of old stone buildings of historical importance. The National Heritage Council, however, has responsibility for distributing national lottery funds to heritage projects coming within its area of <Col N="992" /> responsibility and this includes restoration of buildings of architectural importance.  Applications should be made directly to the National Heritage Council and all applications are considered on their own merits.</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's professed love for historical objects and buildings and also in view of the fact that his Minister for the Environment recently introduced special grants for thatched houses, surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a similar grant can be extended to stone buildings and buildings of historical importance.</P>

      <P>It is much better that these important buildings be dealt with through the National Heritage Council who have the expertise to consider the whole merits of the building and so on and have the capacity to decide what aid should be given.  They have been doing a very good job and I hear no complaint throughout the country about the National Heritage Council.  They have not a very big budget but they are dispensing their budget very judiciously and with great care and selectivity.

      <P>One of the issues under consideration is the development of a methodology for accounting for the environment.  The World Bank publication <i>Environmental Accounting for Sustainable Development</i> is a collection of workshop papers on the topic and these form an important input to the discussions.

    <P>Maidir leis an cheist eile, tá sé seo á plé anois idir Access agus an duine atá taobh thiar de sin, duine as paróiste an Teachta féin, an tUasal Ó Baoill.

Maidir leis an Institiúid Athshlánaithe i gCasla i gContae na Gaillimhe, tá 24 dhuine fostaithe ann.  Maidir leis na Bráithre Carthanachta i gCasla, tá naonúr fostaithe go lánaimseartha agus beirt go páirtaimseartha.  Glacaim leis na pointí éagsúla a luadh.  Mar a dúirt mé, ní féidir le hÚdarás n Gaeltachta coinníoll nó brú a chur ar fhostóirí.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 123/85 of 12 December, 1984 on the application of Article 85 (3) of the treaty to certain categories of motor vehicle distribution and servicing agreements.  This entered into force on 1 July 1985 and expires on 30 June 1995.  This regulation provides for a block exemption of motor vehicle distribution agreements from the scope of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>Neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor the Council of Ministers have any function in the administration of the regulation, which is solely a matter for the EC Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulation itself does not refer to any percentage figure.  However, at the request of some of the commercial sectors involved, the Commission published <Col N="999" /> a notice which set out some of the conditions by which agreements would be assessed.  The notice also lays down certain administrative principles for the procedures which the Commission might initiate.</P>
    <P>In the notice the Commission indicated that, for the time being, certain circumstances would not of themselves justify an investigation of whether an agreement exempted by Regulation (EEC) No. 123/85 is incompatible with the conditions of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty.  One of those circumstances would be where list prices of a motor vehicle in one member state and of the same or a corresponding motor vehicle in another member state differed by not more than 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course that circumstance and any other in the notice does not affect the right of any person to make a complaint to the Commission.  The Commission, whose responsibility it is, will examine all such complaints with due diligence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a recent survey showed that the net price, that is the price before tax, of motor vehicles in Ireland were 45 per cent higher than in Denmark; that there was a 48 per cent difference between Denmark and Italy, and a 49 per cent difference between Spain and Denmark? There is a huge rip off in the sale of motor vehicles and there is a huge difference in the basic price of the vehicle from the point of manufacture to the point of sale. Now that we are talking about a single market, surely the net price of a vehicle should be the same in any of the Twelve member states of the Community? Would the Minister of State not agree that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, particularly in his role as President of the Council of Ministers, to see to it that this arises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no standard ex factory price for motor vehicles anywhere in the Community.  There are very considerable variations and the question of the final price to the consumer is more a <Col N="1000" /> matter for the Minister for Finance, in the context of excise duties and VAT.  In all of these areas, the Community has not taken a position for the post 1992 period. Having examined the matter and on the basis of the reports, which the Deputy has referred to, it seems to me there are no standard ex factory prices on which to base a judgment.</P>
      <P>I accept that prices in this country, comparatively speaking are quite high. However, there are some instances where tax regimes are quite high but factory prices to those countries are lower than the factory price in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that unless you have a situation where the net price of motor vehicles is the same in all Twelve member states, the removal of barriers will be detrimental to the Irish motor industry and a consumer will be able to travel to Denmark, purchase a car, bring it back into the country and pay the taxes and it will still cost less than purchasing the car here and paying all the taxes?  Surely it is time that the manufacturers are forced into a situation where they would sell into the single market and that the tax is a matter for the Minister for Finance of each of the member states.  The basic prices should be the same in all the member states because of the single market and there should not be a differential of 45 per cent between the basic price of a vehicle of a car in Ireland and in Denmark?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The competitive environment now and after 1992 does not give rise to any need to amend the mergers, take-overs and monopolies legislation. However, the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 could benefit from some refinement.  Experience with its operation, particularly in more recent years, points to the need for such refinement.  In addition the EEC Council Regulation on the Control of Concentrations between undertakings (No. 4064/89) will have to be accommodated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Have there been moves afoot within the Council of Europe and the Commission to have a common policy on mergers, take-overs and monopolies? The reason I ask this question is to know whether there is a danger that if it is left to the Commission it will endeavour to seek a common policy on mergers, take-overs and monopolies that could have a serious effect on Irish industry and would not be capable of dealing with large monopolies within the single market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the responsibilities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to proposed merger or take-over of State assets in the context of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987.  This legislation sets out to control, in the public interest, proposed take-overs and mergers involving any two or more enterprises coming under common control, where at least one carries on business in the State and where certain financial thresholds defined in the legislation are exceeded by each of two or more of the enterprises involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a proposed merger or take-over <Col N="1003" /> falls within the scope of the legislation, notification of the proposal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is obligatory.  A proposed merger or take-over cannot be concluded until the Minister has stated that he does not propose to prohibit it either absolutely or conditionally or, in the absence of such a statement, until a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, or from the date of receipt of such further information as the Minister may require.</P>
    <P>The Minister has discretion under the legislation, initially, to approve a proposal without further investigation, or to refer it for investigation to the Fair Trade Commission.  The commission are obliged to investigate every proposal referred to them and report to the Minister on their investigation.  The report of the commission must state their opinion as to whether the proposed merger or take-over would operate against the common good in respect of criteria set out in the Schedule to the 1978 Act. These criteria comprehend such matters as the effect on competition in the marketplace, the interests of the consumer, the effect on continuity of supplies or services, the effects on employment and on employees, the interests of shareholders, the impact on regional development and whatever economic benefits might arise for the enterprises and the industry involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister, having considered a report of the Fair Trade Commission, may then approve the proposal, but he is also empowered to make an order prohibiting a proposed merger or take-over, either absolutely or except on certain conditions specified in the order.  It would not be unusual for the Minister, in allowing a notified merger or take-over to proceed, to secure the agreement of a party or parties involved in the proposal to undertakings or assurances in relation to areas of concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  However, I had hoped he would refer to the role of his Department in the sale of a State controlled company <Col N="1004" /> such as Cablelink.  At what point do his Department get involved in so far as damage might be caused to our reputation by certain action, as happened in the case of Cablelink where the Minister for Communications directed the sale of that company to Telecom?  There has been talk of legal action being taken against the Government.  Damage has been caused to our reputation at an international level because outside bidders who were told it would be an open competition suddenly found that the Minister for Communications had directed the sale of telecom to another State company.</P>
      <P>Has any consideration been given to the loss of investment to this country as a result of the action taken by the Minister for Communications and the lack of consumer choice in regard to the developments which can take place in the future in Cablelink?  What effect will the take-over of Cablelink by Telecom have on consumers?</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the repayment costs by Telecom will be £4.5 million as against an income of £1.2 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy what really happens in relation to the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce in these areas. The Deputy specifically referred to Cablelink and made a number of inferences.Even though questions in relation to Cablelink which were submitted for today's Order Paper have been ruled out of order I should like to respond to one or two aspects of Deputy Barrett's question.</P>
      <P>First, the Deputy referred to the Minister for Communication as if he were acting independently of the rest of the Government.  The sale, disposal or merger of State assets in the context of this question are matters, first for the functional Minister and then for the Government in accordance with the relevant legislation.  In this instance the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred the Cablelink proposal to the Fair Trade Commission and sought their report.  That report and analysis took account of the various matters referred to by the Deputy, the public interest and other common concerns.  In the final analysis the Minister decided not to prohibit the proposal.  There is nothing hidden about that.  It was not the sole responsibility of one Minister and in the final analysis it was a Government decision.  I do not think any inferences about a particular Minister are fair.  The matter was debated in the Dáil only two weeks ago.</P>

      <P>We spend a considerable sum of money promoting this country abroad.

Does the Minister not agree a clear indication was given that this would be an open competition and that those who made their bids would be treated equally?  Does he not also agree that the decision taken by the Government &mdash; I assume the Minister for <Col N="1006" /> Industry and Commerce is included in this &mdash; could have serious reperussions for the image of Ireland as a good place to do business?  The Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Leyden, spends a considerable amount of time abroad promoting this country as a place to do business.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated to the House on 20 February 1990 in reply to Question No. 155, volume 395, columns 2333-4, by Deputy R. Bruton, the decision of the Government to prohibit the supply and distribution of coal in the Dublin area from September next should have, as one effect, the development of a competitive market among the suppliers of various smokeless fuels.  Accordingly, as he <Col N="1011" /> informed the House at that time, the Minister asked the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to monitor developments in this regard and in view of the changing situation in the marketplace the investigation into the competitive pricing structure of one particular type of smokeless fuel has not been proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, in the course of carrying out this ongoing monitoring, publicly invited views and comments from interested parties on the competitive conditions in the market.  To date no submissions have been received.</P>
    <P>In announcing the ban on the supply and distribution of coal in the Dublin area, the Minister for environmental protection, Deputy Mary Harney, indicated that the Government had taken a decision on arrangements for assistance to low-income groups in the restricted area in order to minimise the costs arising for such groups.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, has since announced details of assistance to be provided in the form of extra fuel allowances for certain recipients of social welfare assistance.  I understand that details are available from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the delay in producing the report by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is disturbing?  Will he accept that the matter is urgent?  Will he tell the House what the Government are doing to expedite this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the report is relevant.  At the time the Minister invited submissions so that the report could be compiled by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, a decision to ban the marketing and distribution of coal had not been announced.  From September the marketing and distribution of bituminous coal will be banned and, therefore, the difference between bituminous coal and Coalite is not a relevant factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1012" />
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the description by the Minister for the Environment that he found the difference between the price of Coalite and coal to be &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo;, Will the Minister accept that, referring to the measures introduced to minimise the impact on certain categories of social welfare recipients, to allow a differential of £3 to people on fuel vouchers, which is precisely the differential between the price of a bag of Coalite and a bag of coal, is inadequate?  It is wrong to expect social welfare recipients to live on one bag of Coalite per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is failing to take into account the developments which will take place in the coming months in relation to the price of Coalite and other fuels.  For the first time bituminous coal will be banned and the other fuels will compete for the market.  It would be unrealistic to assume that the existing price of Coalite, and its comparison to the price of coal, should remain.  The £3 million allocated by the Minister for Social Welfare will have to be monitored in the light of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister implying that because of the ban on bituminous coal there will be a greater demand for Coalite resulting in the price of Coalite falling?  If not, does the Minister have in place a mechanism to ensure that advantage is not taken of the fact that only Coalite can be used resulting in a bonanza for certain people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Deputy underestimates the capacity of alternative fuels to Coalite to take a dominant position in the market.  Clearly, it is an opportunity for Bord na Móna and the producers of other suitable fuels to be more competitive.  We will have to await the outcome and the Government will take note of developments as they arise.  However, as an initial thrust to help lower income groups in specified categories, an additional £3 million is <Col N="1013" /> being provided under the free fuel allowance scheme.  Developments thereafter will be monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that, well in advance of the next heating season, if it transpires that the differential between acceptable fuels and coal is not reduced, despite the aversion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to price control, such measures will be adopted, if necessary, to protect the most vulnerable people in relation to the measures to ban coal in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a long period &mdash; going back to the third last Government &mdash; each succeeding Government have resisted the temptation to get too involved in price control as it did not seem to work satisfactorily.  Nowadays they tend to allow for competing market forces to determine prices which seems to be better for the consumer.  It would not be fair for the Deputy to take any more out of my reply than the assumption that we are taking initial steps to provide for the lower income groups and assuming certain developments in the market.  We will await developments before we take any further steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's reply.  Now that bituminous coal has been taken off the market, will the Minister agree that the profit margins on smokeless coal should be urgently investigated because that is the only type of coal available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried on a number of occasions to indicate the position to the Deputy.  I am prepared to have a little wager with him &mdash; if time permits and if we can afford it &mdash; that developments in the market will be different from what he seems to assume.  If the Deputy is saying that he expects Coalite to be a dominant factor to the exclusion of all other alternate fuels, he will find that will not be the position.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>if he has seen a report from the Irish Insurance Federation which suggested that Irish motorists, particularly those under 25, will be facing large increases in motor insurance for the next five years unless there is a dramatic fall-off in personal injuries claims; if this is in contradiction to the undertakings given by insurance companies when juries were abolished; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen no such report. I understand that a recent article in a national newspaper refers to the likelihood of motor insurance premia continuing to rise for the foreseeable future. The Irish Insurance Federation have assured me that they have not produced a report which concludes that Irish motorists, including those under 25, will be facing large increases on motor insurance for the next five years.</P>
      <P>However, I have to stress that it is not realistic to expect a reduction or even stabilisation in motor insurance rates when the cost of claims and the claims rate are going in the opposite direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard that sort of reply from the Minister on so many occasions that is has become boring.  Will the Minister agree that the reality is that motor insurance premiums &mdash; particularly in respect of young drivers &mdash; are increasing on a regular basis?  Is he not alarmed at the fact that there are now between 80,000 and 100,000 uninsured drivers on our roads?  Will he also agree that the more premiums increase beyond the reach of the average individual the more likely it is that the figure will get bigger?  Will he also agree that it is time for him to enter into discussions or &mdash; as I suggested some months ago &mdash; to set up a review body to examine ways and means of (a) implementing our existing laws to ensure that they are kept, particularly in respect of the Road Traffic Acts and (b) that alternative methods of underwriting motor insurance will be <Col N="1015" /> examined, such as insuring the individual as distinct from the vehicle?  Will he also agree that the policy to date of allowing matters to drift&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan, promised consumers a better deal on insurance following the abolition of juries?  Will he agree that the situation has disimproved to the extent that tens of thousands of young people under 25 cannot viably get insurance?  Has any progress been made on the suggestion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a form of tribunal be established to hear cases in this category?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the Courts Act, 1988, something like 303 cases have been heard since its implementation, over 40 per cent of which await appeal to the Supreme Court.  It was hoped that, in the process of time, implementation of that Act would bring greater predictability of awards so as to avoid the necessity for fully fledged legislation or court proceedings in all cases.  Unfortunately it will take a little time to assess that but it does appear at present as though it is not having &mdash; though it is early days yet &mdash; the kind of effect which the insurers had indicated would be the case should that Act be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we must examine broader <Col N="1018" /> measures.  Regrettably one of those is that we are proving to be &mdash; by any comparative statistic on which I can put my hands &mdash; rather careless on the roads and, as a consequence, the incidence of accidents, fatalities and costs on all fronts are exceedingly high, running at twice the European average.  I take the point that there are considerable numbers of people who have been unable to get insurance cover.  But there are others who decide for one reason or another &mdash; I am not going to go into the question of whether they can afford it &mdash; they will not take insurance cover.  The numbers of people driving uninsured vehicles is approaching a national scandal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is a fact that, before the Courts Bill was introduced, the insurance industry themselves said that a major element in insurance cover cost was the high level of awards being made by the courts and that the introduction of non-jury trials in accidents involving motor insurance claims would have the effect of reducing the cost of insurance to all motor drivers? Have the Government put that contention to the insurance industry?  Have they got from the industry an undertaking that they will live up to the promise they made when the Government facilitated them by the introduction of that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Barry's point that there was very good faith on all sides at the time of introduction of that legislation that its provisions would have the beneficial effect of reducing premia.  Since the enactment of that Act, something in the region of 303 cases have arisen, almost half of that number still subject to appeal.  At this stage there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that it is having the beneficial effect &mdash; even though, as I said, it is early days yet&mdash; we all considered it might have.  I might add that the total legal cost in the context of insurance premia represents about 20 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the one counsel rule certainly has not contributed to lowering of premia.  In fact, I can tell the House that the average costs of the present changed system appear to be on a par with what was the position obtaining before those changes were effected; it does not seem to be realistic.

On the basis of any such comparisons, would he indicate to the House the specific areas in which the disparity arises <Col N="1020" /> and how he feels such disparity should be dealt with?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Of 19 countries &mdash; which included those mentioned by the Deputy &mdash; Ireland figures worst in a survey undertaken on this matter; on average our costs of motor car insurance premia are double those in other EC countries.  I do not have the kind of detailed information the Deputy seeks with regard to the various areas in which this arises.  It would be no harm if we could put all that together and have it assembled in a way which would have an effect on the public mind and attitude, indeed on all our attitudes in this area.  We dearly want to be able to compete better in this area.  I realise that there are people finding it difficult to meet the cost of car insurance premia and there are others avoiding paying for their own purposes but, one way or the other, our costs are too great in comparison with those of our competitors.  We are the cause of it in that we are so careless on the roads.  The answer would appear to lie in a number of remedies but the one that will have the most beneficial effect &mdash; apart from those already mentioned by Deputies &mdash; would be more care being exercised on the part of the public themselves.</P>

      <P>To illustrate the difficulties that could arise, I would now like to specifically refer to the definitions given in the Oxford English Dictionary. The word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; is defined on page 138 of the Oxford English Dictionary, 1933 Edition as follows: &ldquo;To take note, give heed, to consider, to turn one's attention to, to take note of, attend to, notice and observe a thing... to give notice of anything, to notify, indicate or make generally known&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If to make something generally known constitutes an advertisement, to make the weather forecast generally known under the sponsorship of Telecom Éireann seems to fall into the category of advertising.</P>

The three parties on this side of the House have different views as to how this definition should be incorporated, and the Government have a separate view.

      <P>Very late in the evening last week the Minister's attention was drawn to the difficulties this amendment may create for various charities in the context of the lower rates RTE apply to charities for advertising.  That matter is not referred to in the amendment tabled by the Workers' Party but it was discussed at some length.  The Minister quite correctly responded by saying this is not a problem &mdash; I do not want to quote the Minister incorrectly&mdash;he thought existed in the context of the Bill, but he was prepared to amend the Bill to deal with charities.  This would require a different definition of the concept of advertising, presumably in the context of advertising for charities.  It is not unusual on this Stage that we would tease out the meaning of this concept in the context of the definition before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party amendment states that advertising, within the capping system envisaged by the Bill, is to exclude promotional material broadcast by the authority within their own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting their own commercial activities.  That is obviously designed to ensure that the Authority can advertise concerts they organise as well as forthcoming programmes, cross-advertise television items that will be broadcast on radio and <i>vice versa.</i>  Clearly if this amendment is not incorporated in the Bill, any such self-promotion by RTE to attract an audience for their programming will have a detrimental impact on the finances of RTE because it will be regarded as advertising time from which no income can be derived.  There is no other broadcasting service of which I am aware that is beaming into this country, be it from the <Col N="1190" /> United Kingdom mainland, Northern Ireland or from satellite, which is so restricted.  BBC, UTV, Sky Television and the various other television stations are constantly promoting their future programming in an uninhibited way without any time curtailment or without it in any way affecting, in the context of the commercial stations from abroad, their commercial revenue.  In the absence of The Workers' Party definition being adopted it seems that RTE are being asked to operate with one hand tied behind their backs.  There can be no rational reason for regarding advertising as including the station's own promotion of their own programming.  Unfortunately the definition which has been tabled does not tackle the various other problems that need to be tackled.  As Deputy Mitchell indicated on behalf of my own party, after we have teased this out in this House it will be necessary, if the Minister intends to proceed to enact this very bad legislation, to provide a far more comprehensive definition of promotions that are excluded from the application of the legislation.  Sponsorship of programmes should not be included as being advertising.  I instanced &mdash;I do not want to repeat myself&mdash;Bord Gáis helping to sponsor the World Cup coverage and An Bord Telecom sponsoring the weather forecast.  Those things should not fall within the ambit of advertising under the Bill; they do at present and will even if this amendment is accepted.  In the context of the definitions of advertising or of advertisements, the Oxford English Dictionary states that an advertisement is something that turns the mind of someone to anything, attracts attention or observation, the action of calling the attention of others, admonishing, warning or instructing.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to see the <i>rationale</i> behind the Minister's approach. It is difficult and probably impossible for this legislation to be implemented without us having a proper definition of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; and without us having a more extensive definition of exclusions from the concept of advertising than that <Col N="1192" /> contained in the very laudable amendment that is before the House and which has allowed us to deal with this issue at this stage.  It would be my hope, Sir, that we can tackle this problem and that we can overcome this difficulty created by the Minister for this House.</P>
      <P>This Bill has a lot of absurdity in it. When approaching a Bill that is absurd one can put forward propositions that leave people somewhat aghast.  In the context of the fall-out from Chernobyl, if RTE had to make public announcements that this was about to hit the country that would be an advertisement under the terms of this legislation.  That is the reason this legislation is a nonsense.  If the Department of the Environment, as I instanced, can, in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, have a definition of advertisement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I think I have detailed at some length, the difficulties with the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  In conclusion, let me say that if the Minister intends to proceed with this legislation I <Col N="1193" /> hope he will take seriously the concerns voiced about a number of areas which will fall within the undefined concept of advertising in the Bill and which could do damage in areas where we on this side of the House do not want to see damage done.  The Minister indicated last week in the House that he will look again at the position of charities but there is also now a need to look at RTE's self-promotional advertising, public service notices, to assess the impact this Bill will have on the sponsorship of programmes, in terms of the making available of prizes for programme quizzes, and a variety of other areas where this Bill will curtail the activities of RTE in a way that is inimical to public service broadcasting.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is enacted in its present form, without advertising being defined it will be a recipe for difficulty and confusion.Apart from the fact that the Bill itself is bad, if the Government intend to push it through this House they have a duty to the House and the public broadcasting service in RTE to ensure that its meaning and application to a variety of different activities which form part of the normal course of broadcasting at present are clear.  It seems there is no desire to tackle that problem.  Perhaps the new division between the two Government parties, as shown by Senator Martin Cullen's objections to the Bill, expressed on an RTE programme only a few days ago, might now impress on the Government the need to agree to bring about changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that the wisdom behind introducing this Bill must be questoned.  We need to bear in mind that approximately two years ago, in 1988, we passed another Broadcasting Bill.  Despite the assurances given to us from time to time by the Minister that that legislation was effective, the fact that he is back here with another Broadcasting Bill would seem to indicate that the Broadcasting Bill introduced in 1988 did not stand the test of time.  The cornerstone of our broadcasting legislation, the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, dates back to 1926 while the principal Act in this case has been in <Col N="1194" /> existence since 1960.  Attempts have also been made to introduce Bills in 1981, 1985, 1987, 1988 and now in 1990.  I have already conceded that the Minister has achieved a fair measure of success.  He has been successful in getting the pirate stations off the air but he did not have to wait until 1988 before attempting to do that, given that the necessary legislation had been in place since 1926, the only difference being the size of the penalties. For that reason it is regrettable that we find ourselves today discussing this matter.</P>
      <P>I make no secret to of the fact that I was one of those who stymied the efforts of Deputy Mitchell, when Minister for Communications, in this area for the very reasons we are now outlining.  The position of the Labour Party has not altered since 1979.  I think I am entitled to make a few introductory remarks as a preamble to what I have to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If each Deputy were to interpret the profoundity and importance of his own words, each would talk for an hour.  Deputy O'Sullivan appreciates that when we are dealing with a Committee Stage section and amendment, after making a very gentle or short introduction, he is expected to apply himself to what is in the amendment.This amendment refers to a definition, put before the House in the names of Deputies De Rossa and McCartan, of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  The Deputy is at liberty, and I am sure the House would welcome him doing so, to discuss that particular aspect of the legislation but he is not entitled to make a new Second Stage debate.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I have no intention of delaying the House but as you say we are discussing the first amendment to section 1 of the Broadcasting Bill and what Deputy O'Sullivan is simply doing is making reference to and commenting on the several references which have been made so far on Committee Stage to broadcasting legislation and the changes which have been made to it.  What he is seeking to do, by way of locating his comments on this first amendment, is to put the Labour Party perspective.  This is required as there have been several references to Deputy O'Sullivan and me as well as to other Labour Party Deputies.  It would be very unfair to Deputy O'Sullivan if he was unable to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been endeavouring to get an acceptable agreement on the interpretation of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  It has been said that the advertising media consists of any means by which sales messages can be conveyed to potential buyers.  The Workers' Party amendment states that &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; shall mean advertising other than promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting its own commercial activities.  The Minister in a rather simplistic reply claimed that the meaning of advertising is well established in common sense terms.  We will endeavour to establish what exactly are common-sense terms.  There seems to be a dire absence of common sense in the debate today.</P>
      <P>The amendment would minimise the damage to RTE if the Minister's Bill is inflicted on them.  The Bill would definitely have an adverse effect on the day-to-day operations of the station.  It could very well reduce the standard of broadcasting and lead to substantial job losses within RTE.  Private producers who work for RTE under contract will no doubt suffer.  Perhaps 500 jobs will be threatened.This highlights the importance of defining &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  When we discuss advertising in a later section we will be talking about the future of 500 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Nealon made a very good contribution, one of the finest speeches we have heard in quite a while.  He highlighted the point that talent will be lost <Col N="1199" /> to RTE.  It is extremely important to take this into consideration.  In Britain they have defined various types of advertising in trade Acts, but we have not the benefit of this type of legislation here which clearly spells out what advertising means. For that reason we are in this morass.  We cannot say with any degree of certainty the effects the Minister's legislation will have on people who are employed in RTE.</P>
    <P>This raises the question as to why the Minister insists on pressing on, despite overwhelming disapproval from RTE and from the public at large and particcularly from those working in the advertising industry.  They have pointed out that if this legislation goes ahead there will be significant job losses in that area. Equally important is the fact that if RTE are forced to cap their advertising, the people working in firms who depend on advertising to publicise their products to increase market share will also suffer. This will have a long-term effect.</P>
    <P>We have here an abuse of power by the Minister.  The majority of Irish people are quite happy with RTE as it is.  They have offered a good service throughout the years.  The only people who are openly supportive of this Bill are those who will benefit from it if passed by both Houses.  This would be the most serious body blow every inflicted by a Government on an institution of the State &mdash; and for the wrong reasons.  It will no doubt undermine democracy.  We have had a demonstration of that in recent days.</P>
    <P>It is now being suggested that if sufficient progress is not made in this debate to the satisfaction of the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Vincent Brady, he will insist on the application of the guillotine, again no doubt in the interests of democracy.  I regret that when the quorum bell rang earlier one of the suggestions made by a Government back bencher was that the guillotine should be applied.  I sincerely hope it does not come to that and despite the fact that we will be here for long hours I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  We were <Col N="1200" /> deprived of that opportunity on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already indicated that he is not prepared to accept this amendment.He said he would be prepared to tease out amendments as we went through the Bill but the Taoiseach was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying at a press conference on Friday last that he rejected suggestions that the Broadcasting Bill might be withdrawn by the Government or significantly amended, despite the concerns of the Opposition Parties and trade unions.  He is reported as telling journalists that he had no intention of withdrawing or amending the Bill. He said the Bill was before the Dáil and that the Government had decided on certain amendments to the original proposals and would see that these proposals were put into effect.  This would seem to be at variance with what the Minister said last week.  He implied they were going to go through it section by section and hoped to reach some agreement at the end of the day.  The Taoiseach's intervention has done little to allay the fears about the urgency of these measures. Why do we need them?  What is the great hurry?  Is the Minister acting under the instruction of the Taoiseach or with the approval of his Cabinet colleagues?  Has he the full support of Cabinet?  It is important to inform the House because to date the Progressive Democrats' role in this debate has been questionable.  Their absence from the House during this debate and the debate on the Labour Party's no confidence motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's reply I feel it will be necessary for the House to examine his defination in greater detail as his curt response did <Col N="1203" /> little to clarify the matter.  Overall his manner has not been extremely helpful in this regard.  The day on which we had Second Stage will go down in the history of this House as the greatest day of infamy in the House.  He refuses to accept this amendment, unlike myself and my colleagues within the Labour Party and, no doubt, the other Members in Opposition.He sees that something is well established in commonsense terms.</P>
      <P>It will also be necessary to address the second point made by the Minister in his response.  He said the definition proposed is discriminatory since it seeks to put the options open to the Authority with respect to the promotion of their commercial activities on a more favourable plane than that of the independent broadcasting sector.  I fail to see where there is discrimination in the amendment as put forward by Deputy de Rossa and Deputy McCartan or how it can in any way be interpreted as being discriminatory.We have use and abuse of the term&ldquo;the level playing pitch&rdquo; but it is a good job Jack Charlton's team were not playing on that pitch.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that I have been subjected to both, at this stage I am immune to them.  I would like the Minister in his reply to this discussion on the amendment to be specific regarding the areas of discrimination.  I do not think <Col N="1204" /> it acceptable that on an amendment which is quite specific the Minister should suggest that some form of discrimination is implied.  It is not there in writing or by implication.  That he comes to this conclusion is a surprise to me.  Other Deputies made a point regarding RTE's own promotions.  Deputy Shatter mentioned Board Gáis and their type of advertising.Large numbers of people are dependent on RTE, such as young artists and musicians.  It is quite legitimate for orchestras to advertise on RTE.  If anything, it is the Minister who is discriminatory.He is adopting the line that attack is the best method of defence.</P>
      <P>The third point made by the Minister needs examination because here in some degree he is exposing his real objectives. He is saying in this inference that he intends to enforce control by a blunt instrument in the Act of 1990.  He said the intention of the definition is inimical to the objective of section 5 of the Bill which is to achieve a harmonised approach to self-promotion among all broadcasting services.  When the Minister says it is inimical what precisely does he mean?  He owes the House an explanation, a clear definition of his real intent. I understand &ldquo;inimical&rdquo; to mean hostile to or harmful to.  Is he suggesting that the Bill is likely to be harmful to the private broadcasting sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much weight has been placed on the fact that RTE have enjoyed a monopoly down through the years.  I have said in other discussions regarding RTE that the monopoly they enjoy was brought about simply because there was a void there which had to be filled by the Government of the day.  Never yet in this House has a decision been taken on ideological grounds to nationalise any industry, that refers to broadcasting, transport, energy, shipping, you name it.  The reason the State became involved was not that The Workers' Party or the Labour Party had sufficient votes to ram through any legislation to nationalise any industry.  The State intervened simply because the private sector did not respond to the need of the people and as a result the State had to take up the challenge.  By strange <Col N="1205" /> coincidence it was the Minister's own party who were instrumental in setting up some of these State agencies, and nobody can accuse the Minister's party of being pro-State in this day and age. May be in the thirties there was some feeling for the people.  I regret to say that no longer exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured the House last Thursday that he would be delighted to tease out the amendments with the Deputies during the debate on what he referred to as a normal Committee Stage. We will have to ask why we are not having a normal Committee Stage debate?  It is simply due to the fact that Second Stage debate was aborted on purpose by the Minister and as a result matters that should have been resolved and questions that should have been answered were left hanging and now have to be answered on Committee Stage.  That is the reason we are having this acrimonious exchange in the House today.</P>

      <P>Before comments from other Members, you said something which I found quite objectionable.

    </Speaker>
    <P>What we now have to establish is if the Minister's offer to tease out the amendments still stands following the Taoiseach's edict on Friday last that no further amendments would be accepted.  Once <Col N="1209" /> again we have witnessed the negation of democracy by this Government.  The task now facing the House is to decide for the definition of advertising in the amendment in the names of the co-sponsors, Deputies De Rossa and McCartan, and that of the Minister who has stated that the meaning of advertising is already well established in commonsense terms.  My one regret is that on that occasion the Minister did not elaborate on what he saw as a commonsense term.  Had he done so on that occasion, I feel we would have avoided this whole discussion.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;, which we are now trying to define, is as old as civilisation itself and from the day that man began to produce goods for the purpose of selling them it was the means by which he communicated with the market that his produce was available at some given place and no doubt at a price.  It represents part of a process that begins at manufacturing stage and ends with the customer.  It may also have been used during the pre-manufacture stage.  I am referring to advertising where a person making the goods may have had to advertise to secure the raw materials necessary for him to create a particular product which will eventually find its way into the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The one definite thing which can be said about advertising is that it has never remained static and is forever evolving.  It can also be said that it has not always been at one with mankind and his environment and at times has acted as a pollutant and has not been, to use the correct term, environment friendly.  Advertising has been used with great artistic skill to enhance many towns and cities.  This is very much in evidence in cities and towns throughout the country where shopkeepers have shown great interest in restoring their shop fronts by using a more traditional style of advertising.  I welcome the growth in the use of Celtic lettering and symbols on shop facia boards as a form of advertising.</P>
    <P>In the past advertising took on many forms as it evolved.  I am sure some Members of the House will remember <Col N="1210" /> the town criers.  The last town crier in Macroom used to advertise forthcoming events for a given fee.  He was an early form of an advertising contractor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Up until recently one of my colleagues in Cork Corporation was a latter-day town crier in that he went around the city with a sandwich board.  I am sure Members will have seen the young men on Grafton Street who have placards with advertisements on them.  This is an acceptable form of advertising.  In the past innkeepers and publicans used to display signs outside their premises.  Some of these signs are now very much sought after as they are of a very high artistic standard.  The names of some of these premises are extremely interesting and helped in no small way to advertise the establishments concerned.  As a result of this method of advertising some premises have been immortalised in literature.</P>
      <P>Another form of advertising was the use of the symbols of a particular trade. The ones which immediately spring to mind are those of the barber or pawnbroker.I think the barber's pole was to be found in every village throughout the country.  The bone of contention in this debate is the RTE logo.  If RTE use their logo between programmes it will be regarded as advertising.  This is not realistic.  Should we suggest to a barber or pawnbroker that he can only display the barber's pole or the pawnbrokers symbol of three balls for so many hours a day?  This is an indication of how ridiculous this proposal will be.</P>

      <P>The symbols used by barbers and pawnbrokers were as recognisable to the would-be customer as some of the advertising jingles we hear today on radio and television and were immediately associated with the product or service which was available.</P>
      <P>The next significant phase in the development of advertising came with the growth in industrialisation and the resultant growth in towns and cities when people left the land and moved to urban areas in the pursuit of employment.  With the growth in production came a growth in marketing which, in turn, created a demand for advertising.  This demand was met by the newspaper industry which was experiencing growth through the use of more efficient means of production. Because newspapers could be produced in greater numbers and at a cheaper rate this led to an increase in readership.  This growth in circulation proved attractive to manufacturers who were not slow to tap into this segment of the market through the medium of newspaper advertising. This was a significant milestone in the whole area of advertising.  There was an increase in readership as people became more literate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue from advertising is an important factor in the survival of the newspaper industry today and was one of the reasons given by the Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke, as to why RTE have to be penalised to ensure its survival.  There are many things which can be said about newspaper advertising as distinct from television advertising. Newspaper advertising is of a more durable nature, lasts longer and as a result <Col N="1212" /> is more valuable.  The life span of a newspaper may be only a day, depending on whether it is a daily, evening, morning, weekly or Sunday newspaper, but it can have a longer impact and the capping of RTE advertising has to be measured against the advantages enjoyed by newspapers.Under this Bill RTE advertising will be limited to four and a half minutes every hour.  If there is sufficient demand for advertising there is nothing to stop a newspaper from running a supplement. The national dailies usually run a weekly supplement on property.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> runs several supplements, depending on which side of the city or county the readers come from.</P>
    <P>I hope we can devote some time during this debate on Committee Stage to the relationship between advertising in newspapers and advertising in the electronic media.  I believe this issue has been distorted by the Minister in an effort to fulfil his post election promise to &ldquo;get RTE&rdquo;. As a result of his vengeful pursuit of RTE and his insistence on protecting the financial investments of his friends, the Minister has completely disrupted the legislative programme of this House by foisting this Bill on the agenda.</P>
    <P>During the pre-industrial revolution period advertising appeared in static form outside business premises in order to attract the passing trade.  The next significant development in advertising came with the increase in the demand for newspaper space.  This enabled advertisers to penetrate further into the market place and further away from home and thus create greater product demand.  The next important development in this area was the use of various means of transport, for example, trams, buses and lorries, for advertising.  This form of advertising has continued to grow in scope and variety. The Lawrence collection of photographs depicts Ireland in the early years of the century and provides very definite evidence of this type of advertising, stretching back almost 100 years.</P>
    <P>The reproduction of pre-Second World War advertising material in the shape of bar mirrors advertising various brands of drinks and cigarettes has given the <Col N="1213" /> younger section of the population an insight into the commercial life of 50-60 years ago.  This type of advertising of bars, whiskeys, stout, cigarettes, etc., has become fashionable and some of these reproductions adorn the bedrooms of today's teenagers who regard them as things of historical and artistic merit.</P>
    <P>Another type of pre-Second World War advertising was the enamelled metal sign which was used extensively by coal merchants, cigarette and tobacco companies and soap manufacturers.  These signs did not always blend in with their surroundings and at times clashed with the local environment.  At times the location of these signs indicated a lack of sensitivity on the part of the advertisers to the needs of the locality, particularly when they were located in areas of high amenity value or in areas important to the development of tourism.  I regret that the same can be said of some of their modern counterparts.  It is upsetting when one visits attractive locations like Killarney to see unsightly outdoor advertising signs that do nothing to enhance the appearance of a town or village.  Some of those enamel signs can be seen occasionally in antique shops and are popular with collectors who are prepared to pay substantial prices for items of interest.</P>
    <P>In regard to modern advertisements it can be said that no industry made the transition to the electronic media like the producers of soap and its by-products. Through their sponsorship of programmes during which they advertised their products in the early days of television in the United Stages the phrase &ldquo;soap opera&rdquo; was introduced to the English language.  RTE are now very much involved in such productions, &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; being examples.  It can now be said that the Minister is making his contribution to this type of production in an effort to impose the Bill on the Irish people.</P>

      <P>We have our own type of soap opera today in the House. <Col N="1214" /> However, the Minister's actions are likely to have a far more damaging effect on the economy than any of the problems which regularly confront the denizens of &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo;.  The Minister's actions will result in the loss of real jobs here.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have said that there will be job losses and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland have said that there will be job losses.  Those organisations have stated that there will be a loss in investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disturbing aspect of this is that charitable organisations have said that they will lose if the Bill is passed in its present form.  The Irish Cancer Society have written to me stating that the Bill will damage continuing research into cancer and when that happens the House should not ignore it.  I should like to ask every fair-minded Member to bear that in mind when voting on the Bill.  The Minister has chosen to ignore the appeals from all sections of the community. Despite the warnings and the outcry, the Minister insists on pressing ahead to ensure the survival of Century Radio. In that event we should examine what motivates the Minister and why he insists on capping RTE advertising.  The public were concerned about the Minister's action to bail out Century Radio but that is not the primary reason for the introduction of the Bill which will have the effect of reducing RTE's advertising revenue.That was the original idea but in my view the Bill is an effort to cover up the blunders made two years ago with the passing of the 1988 Act.  On that occasion the Minister chose to ignore all advice regarding the introduction of a third national radio station.  He rammed that legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas in a manner that the Opposition had become accustomed to.  He told us then that he wanted to rid the airwaves of the pirates.  The Opposition knew that that could have been done by updating the 1926 Act.  I read through the debate on the 1988 Bill and I discovered that all parties assured the Minister that they would support any amendment to the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, which <Col N="1215" /> would enable him to take the pirates off the air.</P>
    <P>The fact that the House is, two years later, again discussing broadcasting legislation proves beyond doubt that the Miniister blundered in 1988.  He is now making a desperate effort to cover up in the interest of self-preservation.  That desperation came to the surface during the Second Stage debate when the Minister callously suppressed an attempt by Deputy Callely to contribute to the debate.  The refusal of the Minister to accept the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in the amendment must be carefully examined.The amendment seems to me to be a reasonable attempt by the sponsors to overcome the problems we have encontered since the Bill was introduced.  The attitude to it does not do the Minister, or his Department, any credit.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for greater clarification of what he means by &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in what he described as &ldquo;well established common sense terms&rdquo;. The House has yet to agree on a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  It will be difficult to make progress in this debate until such time as we can resolve this issue.  In an effort to advance the debate I suggest that we examine what other people, and organisations, say about &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;. The British Institute of Practitoners define it as such:</P>
    <P>Advertising presents the most persuasive possible selling message to the right prospects for the product or service at the lowest possible cost.</P>
    <P>Another, much simpler, definition is:</P>
    <P>Advertising is the means of making known in order to sell.</P>
    <P>Do those definition come within what the Minister has described as, &ldquo;well established common sense terms&rdquo;?  The amendment should be accepted by the House and the Minister should withdraw the Bill for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>I listened for some considerable time today to the debate and it might be <Col N="1216" /> appropriate if I elaborated at this stage on the brief statement I made on the amendment.  I made the point then that I did not think it was necessary to have a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; because it is used in broadcasting legislation in its common sense and well established meaning.  In this regard the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; or &ldquo;advrtising&rdquo; first appears in broadcasting legislation in the Broadcasting Act, 1960, which set out the regime governing advertising on RTE.  It arose again in the next important broadcasting legislation, the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976, which made some adjustments to the 1960 regime.  Finally, the word was used in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, setting out the regime governing advertising in the independent sector.</P>
      <P>In none of that legislation was it deemed necessary to have a defintion.  In other words, we had 30 years of broadcasting legislation in which the term &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; has been used without any problems of definition arising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That, to my mind, confirms the view that the meaning of the term is sufficiently well established as not to require a specific definition in the Bill. Leaving the Acts of 1960 and 1988 aside, I should like to point out to the House that no less a person than the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, in 1976 introduced legislation and, learned gentleman that he is, he did not consider it necessary to have the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of a code of practice will be defined in secton 5 in relation to advertising.  I accept that there will be grey areas and it is because of that that I have provided for a consultation process with the RTE Authority and the IRTC in the drafting of that code of practice. A certain amount of play was made about sponsorship and the role of sponsorship in broadcasting.  Members referred to the fact that RTE's excellent coverage of the World Cup was sponsored by Bord Gáis <Col N="1217" /> and that weather forecasts were sponsored by Telecom Éireann.  They are not revelations and, certainly, we have no problem with the principles of such sponsorship.It is a pity, however, that the Deputies did not take their research a little further and ask the question, &ldquo;how are RTE reconciling their practices in this area with existing laws not to talk about the current legislative proposals&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>For instance, if Deputies had done their research a little more thoroughly they would have found a reference to the matter of sponsorship in section 20 (8) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960. Reference to advertisments in that Act includes references to advertising matter in sponsored programmes.  Now the question arises &mdash; I am not going to push it&mdash; as to how RTE in the context of their World Cup coverage are reconciling a fairly constant display of the Bord Gáis logo which is, essentially, an advertisment, with the currently operating time limits &mdash; not the new ones.  It is perhaps a matter of indifference to Deputies that the existing law is being at least bent. Likewise, Deputies might be interested in knowing with the EC Directive on broadcasting, adopted last October and which comes into effect in October 1991, has to say about sponsorship.  If I never introduced a Bill we have the EC Directive coming into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>What does that directive say about advertising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It provides, among other things, that the name and the logo of the sponsor should be shown only at the beginning or end of the programme. There are, incidentally, a whole range of other requirements relating to advertising, surreptitious advertising, etc. in that directive embracing other issues raised by Deputies, including the matter of prizes on programmes.  In that context they will only be permitted to give basic information about a prize in question, in contrast to the current practice where the merits of the product in question are highly extolled by particular broadcasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> Another point raised was the situation in relation to the independent production sector in the advertising area.  On the general broad question of that sector, Article V states that member states shall ensure, where practical and by appropriate means, that broadcasters reserve at least 10 per cent of their transmission time, excluding the time appointed to news, sport events, games, advertising and teletext services, or, alternatively, at the discreation of the member state, at least 10 per cent of their programming budget for European works produced and created by producers who are independent of broadcasters.  The role of the independent is not just protected in the 1988 Act, which I introduced, in relation to the independent sector, it is also protected in the directives from the EC.</P>
    <P>There was great play here this morning on the word &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;.  It was said that this legislation meant that the Government would censor the output of RTE. however, censorship is more likely to occur when there is a monopoly and the whole object of this legislation &mdash; as well as that of 1988 &mdash; is to provide a choice, alternative news, current affairs and entertainment from an Irish source as well as the excellent services of RTE 1 and RTE 2 and the RTE output generally on radio and television.  We need a strong, alternative, independent sector to counter the many influences coming in on satellite and from elsewhere.  It is also important, in the context of the word &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;, that if we merely featherbed a monopoly that that will, in a sense, be censorship.  It is intended in this legislation that not only will we encourage a strong alternative electronic media but that we will also ensure a strong point media to disseminate the news and the criticism of Governments, the Opposition, establishments and others.  The question of censorship, in relation to this legislation, does not arise.</P>
    <P>I want to speak on the amendment because I do not want to be out of order or to range widely over the subject, like other Members.  As far as the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; is concerned, as suggested in the amendment, there have <Col N="1219" /> been three Acts since 1960, 30 years of experience, which all refer to advertising and there was no need for a definition in any of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, when the Minister rose to intervene for the second time, that he would add something to the debate but, unfortunately, he did not.  It is a little ingenuous of the Minister to reject the allegations of other Deputies and to say that there is no possibility or implication of censorship in what he proposes.</P>
      <P>Even if the Minister has pristine and pure motives, the powers he is now providing for a Minister who might not be terribly conscientious about freedom of speech or using heavy-handed methods to influence people, mean that he has a very powerful weapon at his disposal in relation, not only to RTE, but to the private sector in broadcasting.</P>
      <P>A central remaining purpose of the Bill as proposed to be amended by the Minister is to give the impression to the newspapers that they will benefit from this ill-conceived measure and in that way reduce their critical faculties which, it has to be said, the Minister has largely succeeded in doing.  The Independent Group of newspapers, the largest group in the country, have allowed what they see as commercial opportunities and possibilities to supersede their role of independent comment and analysis.  In editorials over the last few weeks &mdash; and, indeed, the day after the Minister made his original announcement in Cork on 29 March &mdash; there were lavish editorials from the Independent Group which do not reflect any credit on them and certainly takes from them the independence which their title seeks to give them.  That is where censorship comes in.  The Minister has taken unto himself extraordinary powers and if the RTE Authority, the independent radio sector or the newspaper are not nice to him and the Government, they could suffer commercially. That is where the grave danger arises from the Minister's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> It may well be that we could, on Committee or Report Stages, introduce amendements which would ameliorate that possibility while leaving the central proposal in place.  We could circumscribe the influence of the Minister and invest the power in an independent Authority or a consultative process.  Even if we could do that &mdash; and I cannot see how we could &mdash; in not defining &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; clearly and by the proposals in section 4, the genuinely independent sector have come to the conclusion that it will only divert money from the State.  Iregret that when the Minister rose to speak for the second time on the amendment he did not undertake to bring in a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; on Report Stage.  Will the Minister accept the principle of the amendment now proposed even if the precise terms are not agreeable to him and to introduce an amendment on Report Stage which would define &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;, which would be more flexible in its interpretation than that hitherto proposed by him?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something the Minister said today and also to something he said the last day we debated this matter. He mentioned the excellent coverage by RTE of the World Cup and their sponsorship by Bord Gáis.  He invited Members of this House to examine whether RTE are obeying &mdash; or bending &mdash; the law in providing that coverage. The implication by the Minister is that RTE are at least bending the law or driving a coach and four through it by having sponsored coverage of the World Cup which received unanimous praise.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is this: regardless of whether RTE are bending the law in their coverage of the World Cup, it is very clear that the next World Cup will not be covered similarly by RTE because the Minister's proposals utterly exclude that possibility.  It will be impossible for RTE to have the sort of sponsorship they have now which allows them give such excellent coverage of the World Cup.  On account of the additional restrictions on promotions and advertising in addition to sponsorship the Minister proposes it will render such coverage impossible.  I invite <Col N="1221" /> the Minister to consider that point.  It is a self-evident point if the Minister's proposals &mdash; as he proposes to amend them &mdash; are carried.  In future there will be no effective World Cup coverage such as we have experienced this year on account of those proposals.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see, for some part of Committee Stage debate, a representative of the Progressive Democrats present.</P>

      <P>As an aside, before commencing my remarks, I should say that Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan took umbrage at an interjection I made some time ago as to whether what he was about to say would be relevant to the amendment.  He described me as a grunt.  I am sorry he felt that way about me.  There is no acrimony on my part; I do not see why acrimony should form any part of this debate at all.  But when one says one regards some contributions as banter and others <Col N="1222" /> as abuse obviously one was touching a more sensitive soul than one had thought existed in the first place.  In addition, on the last day on which this debate took place, I made an interjection in the course of Deputy McCartan's remarks when his Leader took great umbrage, asking when was the last time I had spoken in the House.  I did not realise he took such an interest in the progress of my parliamentary career.  For the record, and his information, it was on 12 May last when I was preceded by Deputy McCartan on a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  Therefore, it will be seen it was not that long ago.  I also recall speaking a while ago when Deputy De Rossa was a Member of the House on a full-time basis &mdash; before he had other responsibilities &mdash; when he gave me full support on the abolition of the dual mandate which support he was unable to continue subsequently.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment before the House basically what is involved is a question of funding, whether Members on all sides of the House believe we should have an independent, commercial broadcasting sector at all.  While I would not agree with it I would respect the view of some Members &mdash; whatever about the number of parties who might hold the view &mdash; that there should be no independent broadcasting sector at all, that the airwaves are the prerogative of the State or of State organs only.  I would rather that those Members opposed to the section or to the Bill would simply state that fact.  It was not made clear in the course of their Second Stage contributions that they were opposed in toto to an independent broadcasting sector. They appeared to give the impression that they were but that, for some reason, this Government or Minister were involved in something underhand and sinister, which makes for good political rhetoric in the House but does nothing to serve debating the facts in a coherent, non-acrimonious way which will be my intention for the duration of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Spring indicated that the purpose of this Bill was to ensure that no obstacles be placed in the way of there <Col N="1223" /> being as lucrative and independent a broadcasting sector as possible.  Deputy Spring said he was against subsidising public service obligations to private stations.He advanced that as one of the reasons there should be an attempt to level the playing pitch, contending that because we have an independent radio sector with statutory public service broadcasting obligations, in order to create a more genuinely competitive climate, we must give a subvention &mdash; whether by way of licence fee or access to the advertising pool &mdash; to enable them to remain viable.  The Labour Party's position is that they are against subsidising public service obligations to private stations, that is in accordance with the statement of their leader.  However, they have no problem in subsidising the public service obligations of RTE 100 per cent; not only that but allowing that licence fee subvention to be devoted exclusively to their public service obligations but for any other purpose they might want once they have utilised whatever proportion there of they may need for their statutory public service obligations.That is one example of how the same rules are not being applied to both sectors.  If one is to be consistent, if one believes in a subvention for public service obligations in the State broadcasting sector there must be a case to be made for those public service obligations to be honoured by the private broadcasting sector; at least consideration should be given to the possibility of a subvention of some kind.  Then the argument arises as to how such subvention should be funded.</P>
    <P>It appears, as a compromise within the Labour Party's position, that they are prepared to put up with the existence of an independent broadcasting sector once that sector receives no help whatsoever from anybody so that, if it transpires that it is non-viable, they can say: we told you so.  Deputy Spring in the course of his contribution said he regarded the full apportionment of central service costs to RTE 2, or the idea that the Minister <Col N="1224" /> would be forcing it to stand alone financially as an independent station, as evidence of his intentions to render 2FM non-viable.  That was the position enunciated by the leader of the Labour Party in the course of his Second Stage remarks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wished to make quickly is that, whilst 2FM, on the one hand, was properly praised as being the most popular station of its type in either the State or independent broadcasting sector, we were told that, if it were to stand on its own and apportion its full central service costs to that station alone, such would render it non-viable. That is supposed to be the most successful station.  Therefore, how in heaven are we supposed to expect a viable independent broadcasting sector to stand alone if we do not apply ourselves to the question of funding?  That is precisely in relation to advertising and this amendment before us.  A decision has to be made by the Opposition parties.  If they believe in a commercial broadcasting service they must grasp the nettle of how it is to be funded.  It can be done either by adverting the licence fee or providing access to an advertising pool that is at present available to the sole agent in that market at the moment, that is RTE, who have a dominant position in the market.  Until that is decided the question of whether funding is to be way of advertising or diversion of licence fees is something which can form a coherent part of the proceedings here.  If people on the Opposition benches say there can be no <Col N="1225" /> question of diverting the licence fee and no question of a cap on advertising, would they kindly let us know if they believe at all in the viability of an independent sector?  Is it that they do not want it, and is that the real reason they are opposing the Bill rather than on the merits and demerits of the funding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make some response to some of the points made by the Minister in the debate so far.  As the proposer of the amendment we have been seeking from the outset to elicit from the Minister the thinking behind his approach.  I already explained the difficulties that we on this side of the House are faced with given that the Minister appears to be introducing a radical departure in the whole ordering and administering of the affairs of RTE.</P>
      <P>He has gone back over a number of basic pieces of legislation and explained that since 1960 there has not been a need to define &ldquo;advertisment&rdquo; in the context of broadcasting legislation and that for that reason there is need to address the issue now in legislation.  I would put it to the Minister that since 1960 there has never been a concerted attempt to invade the affairs of RTE in the way the Minister is doing at this stage.</P>
      <P>The history of the administration with regard to advertising allowed the RTE Authority as established under the 1960 Act to set up its rules and regulations with regard to advertising and the extent to which RTE, as a broadcaster, could advertise.  Those rules, once established, were to be presented to the Minister for his agreement and in that way at least the motivation was from within the broadcasting station to get on with the job. That basic structure was repeated in the 1988 Act where the Commission was given the power to set up the rules and regulations with regard to advertising in the independent sector, again subject to review by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is an entirely new departure.  The level of restriction on advertising is probably the lowest ever contemplated, far lower than the levels <Col N="1226" /> that exist in comparable broadcasting countries in Europe which are twice the levels the Minister has quoted.  The levels are being introduced in a regime where the Minister intends to have the entire absolute say in the matter from now on. Whilst he is laying the ground now for capping at the unbelievably low levels he has stated, he is providing for himself power at the stroke of a pen without having to come back to the House.  At least in the original legislation he would have had an obligation to come back to the House with proposals.  Now he is under no such obligation.  In the original Bill it was a positive resolution.  Now it is a negativing provision.  While the Minister is doing the unbelievable at this stage he will virtually have a free hand in the future if this legislation passes into law. It is in that context that we are attempting to introduce some clarity as to what is understood by advertising.</P>
    <P>The second reason we believe there is a need to address this is because of the remarks the Minister made on Second Stage.  I went into them at length when this amendment was first moved.  I had hoped that the Minister would have made some effort to explain to the House the views outlined on Second Stage.  I put questions to him and I do so again very briefly in an effort to understand exactly what is in the mind of the Minister because it is the Minister who will have the ultimate and virtually unassailable say on these concepts from now on.  On second stage the Minister outlined the view that there were currently practices in RTE that were not just unfair but potentially abusive of the market.  I asked him if he was able to expand somewhat on that view and say where these problems existed in the practice of RTE.  If the Minister had that view, clearly he would be seeking to address them and dispose of them to level things for players on the pitch.  If there were abuses one would have thought they would certainly go, and that if there were unfair practices the Minister would be tackling those very quickly.</P>
    <P>Having expressed that view, the Minister went on to deal with cross-service <Col N="1227" /> promotion and said that he would be making sure that these ideas would be included in the time allocated for advertising purposes with RTE.  That is one example, and the Minister is being quite precise there.  One could argue that saying one would be making sure is as strong language as one could hope for. The Minister intends to end these practices or if not will certainly ensure that they are included in the time allocated to RTE for advertising purposes.  I would like to have that absolutely clearly on the record if that is what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say that, likewise, promotion of certain activities such as the &ldquo;RTE Guide&rdquo; and video cassette compilations will count as advertising.  Is that then an absolute indication that this is another area that will be included?  He then goes on to talk about prizes and the impact they have and suggests that they in some way blur the distinction between a programme proper and advertising.  It seems that is an area the Minister is going to tackle at an early stage in this whole process.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has made any quantification on the current practices in RTE to the extent to which cross-service promotion, commercial activities promotion and the use of prizes amount to programming or advertising time available to RTE at the moment.  The Minister is limiting the overall advertising time in a day to 7.5 per cent, with a maximum four and a half minutes per hour.  There is every possibility that almost all of that time will go towards commercial advertising, in other words for the potential of raising revenue.  I would ask the Minister to indicate his intentions and his views in this area rather than suggesting in short that there are abuses if not unfair practices. He should give an indication of the timescale, in percentages or minutes, that will be consumed by the practices in which he believes RTE are at present engaging and that are not included in his concept of advertising.  In that way, RTE, who will be affected, and the public will know exactly where they stand.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that charities <Col N="1228" /> and the promotion and advertising of activities of charities will not be included. That is a concession and is to be welcomed but it cannot just end there.  I have received correspondence, prompted no doubt by the Minister's remarks in this area, from the Irish Cancer Society who indicate that the implications are real as far as they are concerned.  While they have been well treated by RTE up to now, it is likely that RTE will not be capable of affording a slot to charitable organisations in the future because of the pressure on them to fill the very spare period available to them with prime commercial advertising.</P>
    <P>The current practice is that charities do not get a free service from RTE, as the Minister seems to believe they should. The Irish Cancer Society stated in a letter &mdash; I hope the Minister has received a copy &mdash; dated 19 June:</P>
    <P>Presently we spend IR£26,000 p.a. on radio spots promoting our programme of Rehabilitation, Education, Information and Funding.  Should the charity rate be abolished the costs of the above advertising would rocket to IR£132,000.</P>
    <P>That is what it would cost if they were charged the going commercial rate, which RTE would have to seriously contemplate if they were to capitalise on the time available to them in order to maintain their revenue.  Does the Minister intend, as his comments seem to indicate, to require RTE to provide space without charge to charitable functions and will that time be excluded from the time that will be allowed to RTE for the purposes of advertising?  Is that how the Minister proposes to deal with the concerns of charities?  That needs further explanation.</P>
    <P>The matter should not rest there because there are many other activities that may not necessarily be absolutely charitable or originate from a charitable organisation but which nonetheless are vital as regards the public service functions that RTE provide, some of which are sponsored and some self-promotional.The Minister should explain in <Col N="1229" /> more detail his views on those functions that are self-promoting &mdash; I am talking about ideas such as &ldquo;Beat on the Street.&rdquo; He has not explained the position adequately enough for us to understand it.  He suggested that the problem arises only with regard to broadcasting of services and not with regard to the roadcaster.The Minister seemed to suggest that the &ldquo;Beat on the Street&rdquo; function would not constitute advertising for the purposes of his future regime.</P>
    <P>When RTE advertise the activities of the roadcaster and tell people where it will be in the country, is that self-promotion?Does the talk about the social or community services provided by radio and TV amount to self-promotion or is self-promotion confined only to the commercial or money-earning activities such as video cassettes or the RTE Guide?  I would like the Minister to clarify that matter a little more because it will have a very profound impact on the way in which we as a party, and no doubt other Members in the House, would like to address this whole issue.  It is due to the lack of engagement by the Minister in a substantial portion of this debate that we have been pursuing these very important questions to such an extent. Some matters which were to be included in the legislation have been taken out and the Minister said he will deal with them through directives to the Authority consequent on the legislation passing into law.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that for 30 years there has been no definition of advertising, and I presume he would suggest that a further 30 years could pass without such a definition.  In this legislation, the curtailments and inroads into subsidiaries and related matters are so wide-sweeping that it behoves the Opposition in this House to try to put a brake on what the Minister intends to do.  We should clarify, as far as possible, for the consumer and the Authority what exactly is involved.</P>
    <P>That is why we were compelled to introduce the definition.  As far as the definition goes it is not an embracing or inclusive definition or proposition, it is, in fact, exclusive.  It is not attempting to <Col N="1230" /> say in a comprehensive way what the concept of advertising is.  If one reads it one will see that it is an attempt by us to say what it should not be.  To that extent I am acknowledging that it can have, in the best of senses, a commonsense connotation.  Because of the Minister's remarks in his Second Stage speech we examined this legislation to see if there was a device available to us where we could confront those remarks.  The definition of advertising in the way we have drafted it, helps to allow this House express a view contrary to what the Minister is seeking to promote in his speech but does not include in the legislation proper.  We say that advertising shall mean advertising &mdash; a horse shall mean a horse &mdash; but it should not include the other items that we have sought to mention in our amendment.  It will not include promotion of material broadcast by RTE within their own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting their own commercial activities.  In other words it is giving RTE the opportunity to use their own resources to self promote.  A more basic principle of commercial activity cannot be applied to any enterprise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the existing legislation, to which the Minister has referred, including the EC directive I would make the point that the directive has a very interesting provision which the Minister clearly does not want to tell us anything about in regard to advertising times.  This aspect should be mentioned here.  The amount of advertising shall not exceed 15 per cent in a daily transmission time.  That is what the EC directive is allowing for broadcasting generally, public or private, State or independent.  What have we in the Bill?  Exactly half of that, 7½ per cent. The directive goes on to say that the percentage may be increased to 20 per cent to include forms of advertising such as direct offers to the public for the sale, purchase or rental of products or for the provision of services, provided the amount of spot advertising does not exceed 15 per cent.  Those are the figures contained in the directive to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> The directive also defines advertising in general broad terms.  It is an inclusive definition and tries to embrace all the concepts that one would like to address. The one thing it does not include is cross-commercial or cross-reference advertising.To use the words of the Minister, &ldquo;cross service promotions&rdquo;, is not included in its definitions.  The definitions section, article 1 (b)  states:</P>
    <P>`television advertising' means any form of announcement broadcast in return for payment or for similar consideration by a public or private undertaking in connection with a trade, business, craft or profession in order to promote the supply of goods or services, including immovable property, or rights and obligations, in return for payment.</P>
    <P>Our European masters have no difficulty in acknowledging for the purposes of their legislation and laying of directives that there should be a definition of advertising.The Minister is out of step.  The directive goes on to talk about a definition not only of advertising but of surreptitious advertising and also a very comprehensive definition of sponsorship for the purposes of the legislation.  The 1926 legislation is interesting in terms of how many concepts of common-sense terminologies are given definitions for the purposes of broadcasting.  The argument that advertising is a common-sense notion and does not need to be legislatively addressed is unbelievably facile coming from a Minister who claims he is leading the march into the 21st century with regard to advertising.  The point that has been acknowledged by legislators down through the decades is that broadcasting is a highly technical phenomenon where what would appear on the surface to be common-sense notions do require very specific definition.  Television broadcasting is defined in the EC directive, so also is television advertising, surreptitious advertising and sponsorship.  In the 1988 Act which the Minister pushed through this House the motion of &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of the <Col N="1232" /> legislation.  An apparatus for wireless telegraphy &mdash; common-sense concepts &mdash; is defined in the 1926 Act.  The concept of a television programme service is given legislative definition in the Acts because it recognises that there is a very peculiar need for the definitional basis of each concept that would seem otherwise to be common-sense.  In the context of broadcasting generally, there is a need for a very precise definition of the concept of advertising.  The fact that we have not had it up to now is because such crucial attention has not been given to this whole area.  In the 1926 Act the term &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; and even the word &ldquo;functions&rdquo; is defined for the purposes of the legislation.To say that we should exclude a definition in this legislation because it has a well established meaning is facile in the context of article 18 of the directive.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being entirely inconsistent.He made the case on his own behalf &mdash; with the honourable exception of Deputy Cowen, there was not a great rush of Deputies from his side or from the Progressive Democrats to come to his defence in the early stages of this debate or even at this stage &mdash; that he played a significant role in the progress we have made recently in regard to broadcasting. I fully acknowledge that he had a central role to play in tackling the pirates and in steering through the House the long outstanding legislation regarding independent and community broadcasting, although the community side appears to have been forgotten for the time being. However, it is a great pity that that Minister who started out so well is now seeking to do so much damage to the reputation, to the whole fabric of the ethos of advertising.  On Second Stage of the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, the Minister, recognising the importance of the European measures being taken and the development of the broadcasting legislation at that level, presented the following as his second reasons for moving the Bill:</P>
    <P>Secondly, the earlier concentration in Europe as a whole on structures, controls and regulation to ensure that <Col N="1233" /> the limited number of broadcasting services then available catered for all strata of society, is no longer relevant. Accordingly taking account of these two developments I have attempted to devise a regime that will not be an obstacle to the emergence of radio services which the general public clearly wish to see developed.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from column 1190 of the Official Report of 8 December, 1987.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The real difficulty we face in preparing this legislation is to strike the right balance between the main objective of getting a variety of new radio services on the air and establishing the means to achieve this objective.  There are really two issues here: one, what legal framework should be put in place to oversee the development of the services; and, two, what programming requirements should be imposed on those who wish to establish the new services.</P>
    <P>In that debate, when the position at European and national level was reviewed, a profound overview was taken of where broadcasting was going at that stage. What has happened in the two years since then to compel the Minister to introduce these draconian measures which mark a radical departure from the traditional practice and which were not apparent to him when debating the fundamental principles of broadcasting?  We were given some insight into the Minister's thinking from his remarks on Second Stage on advertising when he indicated he had received representations from the print media on one aspect of the matter and when he referred to the experiences of the independents established under the 1988 legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give some indication of what exactly is going on and what is happening in broadcasting today that compels him to introduce this kind of regime and move in this direction.  The Minister said that the real difficulty they faced in preparing the legislation was to strike the right balance between the two objectives.  He went on to appeal to <Col N="1234" /> Deputies to apply the critical tests of realism, practicality and workability to any views they felt inclined to put forward and to bear in mind that radio broadcasting cost money.  I also ask the Minister in this debate to apply the critical tests of realism, practicality and workability to his views on RTE and also to his views on the workings of those independents in the field set up since the legislation was enacted who have got themselves into unbelievable difficulties, not because they did not understand the nature of the playing pitch, their terms of reference or the conditions under which they would have to work, as these were spelled out clearly to them both in the debate on the legislation and at the interview with the Independent Radio and Television Commission, but rather because they did not apply the tests of realism, practicality and workability. Indeed, they overspent and overextended themselves in their promotions, plans and aspirations with the result that they now find themselves in difficulties which they are incapable of overcoming.</P>
    <P>Is that the real reason we are being asked to agree to this legislation which profoundly attacks the commerciality of RTE?  If it is, the Minister should be frank and honest and indicate why we should be asked to agree to the introduction of such a restriction on RTE. There may well be Deputies in this House who think the independent sector is deserving of this extraordinary attention and saving.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen challenged the proposers of the amendment and those who support it to indicate whether they believe in an independent radio sector. Let me say in response that we welcome the broadening of choice on the airwaves. On numerous occasions during the course of this debate I and other spokespersons of The Workers' Party have made it absolutely clear that we would not like to see the demise of Century Radio or any of the other existing independents.  Just as the Minister was concerned in 1988 about the need to strike a right balance, <Col N="1235" /> we wish to ensure that a correct and fair balance is struck in this legislation.</P>

These have adopted a more realistic, practical and workable approach to the running and promotion of their operations.  In short, they have worked within their budgets.</P>

      <P>There are profound issues which need to be clarified, understood and debated here before we pass <Col N="1236" /> on from this legislation, because of the extraordinary impact it will have.</P>
      <P>The Minister in 1987 dealing with the broadcasting legislation indicated that he would approach broadcasting from a minimalist point of view.  His intention was to interfere as little as possible in the working and regulation of radio.  It was to be a hands off, stand back approach. Let us try to adopt that principle in dealing with advertising and the right of RTE in this area.  The minimum the Minister should do is adopt a broad standard of capping level, according to the EC Directive.That level should be applied across the board to the RTE Authority and the independents.  The market would work out its way after that.  I do not accept that the Minister should contemplate the invasion of the advertising rights and opportunities of RTE and their revenue raising capacity in the way he has indicated.</P>
      <P>During his Second Stage speech the Minister spoke about ensuring that any codes of practice drawn up would incorporate various international obligations, such as the extensive provisions on advertising standards in the EC Directive on advertising activities adopted in October. The Minister recongises that the directive should as far as possible be incorporated and should have an influence on our practice and legislation, yet in the area of advertising he is not doing what the directive requires.  We have to be clear in our reservations about what the Minister is proposing because he is taking no regard of the directive handed down on 3 October 1989.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to look again at the basic principles he enunciated in the more broadly based debated on broadcasting in December 1987.  He extolled the minimalist, non-interventionist approach, allowing the airwaves to regulate and police themselves.  I have made the point that radio is not differentiated here, but the Minister has not responded. He said in December 1987:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the regulation of the radio services, simplicity is the key.  The emphasis under the regime <Col N="1237" /> I propose is self-regulation.  I do not accept that radio services need the degree of control, of monitoring or of overseeing which would warrant the creation of a new State structure.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister abandoning those principles entirely?  Why does he believe that radio advertising needs all the regulation, control and restriction he is proposing?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to raising doubts about the current legality of work in which RTE are engaged relative to the World Cup.  My reading of section 20 (8) would not appear to be in accordance with the Minister's.  It is an extremely important issue.  The Bord Gáis logo is being phased in and out when coverage moves from the studio to an Italian city in which a match is being played or when a commercial break is about to take place.  Is the period of time of sponsorship the entire programme of two hours from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and a further two hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., or is it the second or two when the logo is displayed?  If it is the former, the Authority would have difficulty in justifying their current practices in the context of section 20 (8).  It would suggest that the Minister is of the view that the entire programme constitutes a sponsorship slot.  That means that RTE would consume their entire advertising capacity in broadcasting one football match per day.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point since it would have a profound impact on the capacity of RTE to function in the commercial area.  Section 20 (8) states:</P>
    <P>In this section references to advertisements shall be construed as including references to advertising matter in sponsored programmes, that is to say, programmes supplied for advertising purposes by or on behalf of an advertiser.</P>
    <P>I am thinking particularly of the old Jacobs programmes on RTE radio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the forbearance of Deputy Cowen.  This is crucial.  If the involvement of Bord Gáis as a sponsor in part, with passing visual references throughout the programme, amounts to the entire programme being considered as sponsored or as a programme supplied for advertising purposes by or on behalf of an advertiser, the Minister is correct and the RTE Authority would have difficulty explaning it.  What the Minister is obliquely suggesting has a profound impact for the future broadcasting of sport and other major events for example the weather broadcast referred to.  I would have thought that would have to go.  There would be no possibility of RTE raising the revenue to broadcast agricultural farming commentaries or to televise the Eurovision Song Contest if the opportunity arose again.  There force, I am asking the Minister to try to find the goodwill and the capacity to respond to some of the questions we are raising.  The more we debate the more questions arise that need to be answered explicitly.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the directive dealing with independent productions and the protection of jobs in this area under Article 5 whereby there is a 10 per cent reservation for home produced programmes.  Can the Minister clarify the position?  My understanding is that RTE currently would broadcast for in excess of a 10 per cent slot of home produced programmes.  I would have thought we were talking about 30, 40 or 50 per cent or thereabouts, so Article 5 of the directive which provides for only a 10 per cent ceiling offers no hope whatsoever for the independent film makers and broadcasters or of protecting jobs.  If we were to adopt the EC Directive in this area as a maximum we would be shedding a huge amount of home produced programme time with the consequent loss.  There is no doubt jobs will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> The Minister closed with the view that the potential for censorship would be far greater in a monopoly.  I think nobody would disagree with him on that, but to suggest that we were not going to have censorship and were going to have open and free broadcasting in the context of what he is proposing and what he intends is again somewhat disingenuous.  We all look for, would welcome and believe in a strong independent sector as an alternative and competing voice in the broadcasting area.  Does it require the very heavy-handed actions currently being proposed by the Minister?  Does he have to go so far?  Any suggestion that up to this there has been a featherbedding of monopoly &mdash; the Minister's words &mdash; is having no regard to the facts or to the important social function RTE perform and all the very good services they provide.To suggest that they are some form of monopolistic animal that is devouring the best interests of the broadcasting consumer is painting the wrong picture, a picture that might serve the concepts and language of the Minister well in this very divisive legislation but would have to be challenged by any of us who have a far greater understanding of what broadcasting should be all about both in the independent and community areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has been able to glean from the remarks I have made some of the questions that are still worrying me and my group in regard to the potential impact of what is being proposed, and that he will be able to find the time to answer some of the queries and so help us understand the full impact of what we are dealing with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what Deputy McCartan has raised was a rehearsal of what went on the last day.  He quoted at length from Article 18 of the Directive of the EC in relation to the amount of advertising not exceeding 15 per cent of the daily transmission time.  He did not then go on to Article 19 which provides: &ldquo;Member States may lay down stricter rules than those in Article 18 for programming time and the procedures for <Col N="1240" /> television broadcasting for television broadcasters under their jurisdiction, so as to reconcile demand for televised advertising with the public interest, taking account in particular of (a) the role of television in providing information, education, culture and entertainment; (b) the protection of pluralism of information and of the media&rdquo;.  It is a pity he did not go on to that because Article 19 says quite clearly that member states may lay down stricter rules for the protection of pluralism of information and of the media.  The whole principle behind this legislation is the need for pluralism of information and of the media generally and of entertainment within this country coming from Irish sources.  I am quoting in relation to advertising.</P>
      <P>Most of the points Deputy McCartan made in relation to teasing out what is involved in advertising make my point very well as to why the amendment put down by The Workers' Party should not be accepted.  It is clearly laid down in section 5 of the Bill in relation to the codes of practice.  The codes of practices will be devised in association and in consultation with the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  Many grey areas will have to be teased out in detail, such as sponsorship of football matches that we talked about earlier and the time allocation for, say, Bord Gáis sponsoring the football. By the way, I want to take the opportunity to compliment RTE on the excellent job they are doing on the coverage of the football.  It is superb coverage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan indicated at the beginning of his contribution that in some way the Minister of the day, whoever it would be, would have the power by order at the stroke of a pen to decide on time <Col N="1241" /> limits etc.  The time limits will now be embodied in Statute itself and no Minister will have power to vary them other than by amending legislation itself.

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  It is Committee Stage and he will have the opportunity to come back in.  That is the point I wanted to raise with him.

      <P>I notice the Minister did not reply to my interjection or to the point I raised earlier.  It is clear that what the Minister is proposing to do will end the sort of sponsorship we have seen in the World Cup which he so lavishly praised in the last few moments.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a point made by Deputy Cowen in his brief contribution. I acknowledge that Deputy Cowen is one of the Deputies who makes contributions on Committee Stage and in this case he made very interesting points.  He asked whether we, on this side of the House, were in favour of competition in broadcasting.He further asked whether, if we were in favour of it, we were in favour of creating the funding for it by either diverting the licence fee revenue or advertising revenue from RTE.  That in a nutshell is what he said, but it gets to the crux of the Minister's broadcasting policy, in so far as he has one.  The Minister has repeated that his broadcasting policy was to provide for a plurality of broadcasting.  The Minister's own intention, and it was not the result of the advice of the civil servants, was that we should have an alternative national radio service, and an alternative national television service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are elected for &mdash; to make decisions.</P>

    <Col N="1242" />
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits implicitly by his interjection that that is what he was elected for &mdash; but it was not. The Minister has confirmed what I said: it is his own proposal.  However, the problem is that we cannot create a market if it is not there.  The Minister will know, because Century Radio have told him, that the consultants' report on the national radio service &mdash; and the Minister has a copy of that report &mdash; states that an alternative national radio station cannot survive so long as 2 FM is on the air in its present form.  In other words an alternative national radio service can only survive if 2 FM is made into what I call a station of the cross, a drudge station. That, too, is what the consultants told me when I was Minister for Communications at a time when some people thought that a broadcasting licence was a licence to print money.</P>
      <P>The Minister has now come in with a proposal which does nothing for Century Radio and holds out no prospects for the long term survival of Century Radio because the Bill, as proposed to be amended, does nothing whatever for Century Radio.  We must ask ourselves what it does for TV3.  Is Deputy Cowen seriously contending that diverting £10 million or £12 million from RTE will be enough to fund TV3?  He is right when he says it will not be enough, but it is enough to penalise and damage RTE very seriously.  That is my point and that is why I plead with the Minister to think again on his broadcasting policy.</P>

Some people <Col N="1243" /> would say that I was forced to do so by Deputies O'Sullivan and Higgins and other members of the Labour Party.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Cowen asked a very pertinent question.  He asked if we were in favour of alternative broadcasting and, if so, if we were in favour of creating the funding for it by diverting the licence fee revenue or advertising revenue from RTE.  This comes very much to the point.  I advise Deputy Cowen to go and talk to the Minister privately and ask the Minister to show him and his other colleagues in Fianna Fáil the research on which his policy is based.  Do we set up TV3, knowing that within months there will be a threat it will collapse and the Minister will have to get a consultants' report that will say that TV3 can only survive if Network Two is put off the air or becomes a station for opera and other minority <Col N="1244" /> interest groups.  This is a very serious point because Deputy Cowen in his brief interjection got right to the heart of the matter.  The definition of advertising and the extent to which it confines and restricts advertising on RTE gets right to the folly of the Minister's broadcasting policy.  The Minister knows there are consultants' reports by Touche Ross available from the last interim radio commission which show there is a limited viability for alternative radio but there has been no study whatever of alternative television broadcasts.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputy McCartan had to say about the EC draft directive on broadcasting.  What is permitted is more liberal than what the Minister has proposed but the Minister is correct that it is also permitted to have more restricted national circumstances. However, one cannot generalise because just as in transport matters, you have to think about the market and what is good for a market of 60 million people with a single language may not be good in a market of 3.5 million people with a dual language but if you consider the states in the European Communities generally comprising a population of over 55 million speaking a single language, and Britain is in the same position, what is true for them is not true for us.  The Minister should be asked for the research that shows that Century Radio can survive even with these amendments.  Is there research to show that TV3 can survive even if £10 million is diverted from RTE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that TV3 can in no way survive on the £10 million or £12 million diverted from RTE and that is assuming that they get all the funds that will be diverted, which they will not.  The diversion of this money from RTE will do tremendous damage to them.  Taking this sum of money would stop all enterprise and initiative in RTE.  Let us remember that the real competition facing RTE and the providers of pluralists views will come from stations outside the State.  The BBC News have a budget half as big as RTE's entire budget.  ITN News has an even <Col N="1245" /> bigger budget but RTE have to compete with these stations with fewer resources.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that there are at least two Government backbenchers in the House to listen to my contribution and I ask them to go back to their party meetings and stop this folly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my remarks to what the Minister said in his fourth intervention.  I should like him to expand on some of the points to which he has referred.  He said that the 1960, 1976 and 1980 Acts did not define advertising.I am afraid that the Minister is not comparing like with like.  I am not going to go down the road the Minister did when he referred to the distinguished Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who was in office in 1976.  The difference in those cases was, to use the Minister's phrase in his first intervention, that one could have used the commonplace usage of advertising in those Acts or one need not have defined it precisely because advertising was just that, a relationship to the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The difference between this legislation and those Acts is that in this case the Minister is just at one remove from being the advertising manager for relevision advertising in the State.  No Minister in 1960, 1976 or 1980 would have sought the power to say &ldquo;the national station shall only have this portion of the advertising market&rdquo;.  The Minister switched this around the other way and said, that none of the Ministers who were responsible for those Acts &mdash; I hope he has been advised on this &mdash; had sought the power to take a certain level of the licence fee and use it to intervene in the marketplace and define the level of the advertising income. No Minister could do that.  One cannot say that a Minister using the licence fee to generate a ceiling in the marketplace for a station while at the same time not specifying where the revenue will go is operating in the same way as the Ministers who brought in the 1960, 1976 and 1988 Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It logically follows from that that it is even more absurd for the Minister to not alone define the level but to justify it on <Col N="1246" /> the basis that he is destroying a monopoly.How can the Minister, to use his phrase in his fourth intervention &mdash; I welcome these interventions because it is the only way in which we can tease out the Bill &mdash; say it is his intention to set his face against a monopoly?  What deregulation of monopoly is he talking about?  Is he talking about the total market for television advertising and its distribution between stations outside and within this country?  The Minister is hardly using the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; in any literary economic sense when he says: &ldquo;I am taking the income which is there and keeping it in reserve for what might come into being&rdquo;.  Nobody has used the word &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; in that sense and it is an absolute nonsense to be speaking about it.  If TV3 and other stations were up and running and a Right wing politician spoke about putting a limit on their advertising ceiling one could justify talking about intervening in those cases.  In his first and second interventions the Minister referred &mdash; I hope he has not been badly advised on this &mdash; to regulation and deregulation.This is exactly as I said it is in the American legislation and no one has used it like that.  We are not talking about a State monopoly in relation to advertising in the television medium because no pure market or monopoly exists; we are talking about a mixed market.  The State station is a mixture of licence fee income and advertising.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with a succinct list of questions from Deputy McCartan.  The Deputy asked him a number of questions which were strictly in accordance with the text of the Bill and the regulation and relevant to the EC directive.  I ask the Minister to reply genuinely to my questions.I think in his third intervention he said we were getting worried about the slot for charities, the fee for charities, the special rate and so on.  If someone uses a few words of Irish in an advertisement he will get a 10 per cent discount and if the whole advertisement is in Irish he will get a discount of up to 35 per cent.  How could RTE, faced with the Minister's conditions, consider putting on a 10 per <Col N="1247" /> cent or 35 per cent adjusted advertisement during peak times?  The Minister, as advertising manager, will be able to put a ceiling on them and they will have to decide to which clients they will say yes and to which they will say no. Will they be put in the position of having to say to the person who wants to buy advertising space on RTE &ldquo;we are sorry, we are near the quota and we are accepting no advertisements after March&rdquo; or &ldquo;we are keeping some of the quota back for other advertisers&rdquo;?  How will they handle such situations in the case of advertisements in the Irish language?</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say to me &mdash; as he said to Deputy McCartan in reply to a related matter &mdash; that these matters can be discussed under section 5.  I have read section 5 and there is nothing in it which can given me an answer to the question I have put now. Section 5 deals with standards and not with the proportions of the advertising market.  The Minister should not mislead us into thinking that we can leave this amendment and section with out answers being given to our questions on the proportions of the advertising market.  I agree there is an extension of my question about the Irish language in sections 4 and 6.  In order to help the constructive atmosphere of the House I will not elaborate on this point at this stage.  I will simply stick to the text of the Minister's last intervention.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which arises in relation to the independents.  Deputy McCartan asked about the consequences for the independents and the implementation of the most recent EC Directive. The independents will only be able to get around the limit put on the RTE budget by calling themselves European independent film makers and coming in the back door.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received the report of Údarás na Gaeltachta about the capacity of RTE to put out Teleifís na Gaeltachta.  That report included a commitment in relation to advertising revenue and the licence fee to Teilifís na Gaeltachtal.  By putting the advertising <Col N="1248" /> cap on RTE one is putting a strain on the capacity of the station to have any resources left over to set up that station. The allocation of one of the four UHF channels to TV3 rather than to Teleifís na Gaeltachta has also made the setting up of this station very difficult.  The Minister cannot have it every way.  This is why the debate on the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; is so central to this Bill.  We are not talking about a plurality of competition because the competitor is not there; we are talking about somebody making a will and seeking to damage the most obvious beneficiary by saying &ldquo;even though you have looked after me I am not going to leave the farm to you because I know you too well and there might be somebody else to leave it to.&rdquo;  This has more to do with damage to RTE than with any pluralism in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I have a number of comments to make on points raised by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Before the sos I was referring to the difficulties that might arise in relation to advertising through the medium of the Irish language.  In the spirit of making progress on the Bill I do not intend to labour the point or be repetitive but I want to spell out the implications of the Bill.  I have been referring directly to the latest contribution by the Minister.  If there is a 10 per cent discounted rate, and a 30 to 35% discounted rate for advertisements in Irish and if there is pressure on the station through a cap on their advertising, they will have to choose which, in terms of the TAM ratings, of their programmes, they will use in their advertising allocation. <Col N="1249" /> That creates a real problem.  How will the station, those who take decisions in regard to advertising, and the advertising industry respond to a situation where there is a reduced chance of an advertisement with either the low or the high quotient in Irish appearing?  It would mean that if there was a limited amount of advertising per day there would be an inevitable pressure downwards on the making of advertisements in the Irish language.When referring to the Irish language and the Gaeltacht in the House I speak in the Irish language but on this occasion it is important that I should try to get the Minister to understand the principles involved.</P>
      <P>Following the passing of the Bill there will be an inevitable effect on the making of advertisements and that in turn will affect those who work on the making of advertisements through the Irish language.I am thinking in particular of the Irish-language-speaking actors in the non-animated advertisements.  Those people will be casualties of the Minister's proposals.  We could have gone the other way.  Suppose the Minister had constructed this the other way and that the first version of the legislation had stated that the licence fee plus whatever was spent by the station on promoting the Irish language would be added to the advertising, we would be doing something positive to encourage the Irish language advertising-making activity.  What about the advertising revenue that will be released following the passing of the Bill? We know that the top seven customers of UTV are among the top ten customers of RTE and we know that the money in the short term will flow out of the State to UTV, Channel 4 and so forth.  That will mean that the people about whom I am speaking will not find their needs accommodated.</P>
      <P>If TV3 goes on the air will they be required to adopt any policy in relation to advertising through the medium of the Irish language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faraor, tá sé rí-shoiléir dom féin nach mbeidh ach drochthionchar ag na moltaí seo ar fad ar chumas an aisteora agus cumas na ndaoine a oibríonn i dtionscal <Col N="1250" /> na bollscaireachta agus mar sin de trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Mar a dúirt mé ar an Dara Céim, beidh deacrachtaí ann i leith Teilifís na Gaeltachta a bhunú mar gheall ar easpa airgid.</P>
    <P>The unresolved issue raised by Deputy McCartan is important.  It relates to the definition of &ldquo;promotion&rdquo;.  It is not adequate to say that that question is answered in the directive.  Deputy McCartan maintains that it is defined accurately in the directive and I do not have a problem about the definition but I have a problem about its implications. I should like to give an example of how this has worked.  Published studies in the different advertising journals by international advertising agencies have shown that some sports have changed in format to accommodate the needs of television advertising.  In other words, the generic development of the sport might suggest the breaking of times into certain slots but there has been pressure internationally to break up sports to suit television.It is rather like the question facing the person putting on a play, does he put up Coca Cola signs when producing the Cuchulainn saga in the Abbey Theatre, one of our more recent developments, or does he ask the actors to wear Coca Cola on their costumes when on stage?  One gets to that absurd level.  What are the constituent elements of &ldquo;promotion&rdquo;?  Is it defined, for example, by the visual images on the screen?  Is it defined by the placing of the advertising material?  Is it defined in terms of its impact?  They are real and practical questions.</P>
    <P>I will concede that one or two minor parts of those questions may be answered by section 5.  The Minister may say that we will have an opportunity of discussing standards under section 5 but we face a real difficulty earlier because of the curious definition of advertising.  We will have to say that it shall only be so much, of such and such proportions and shall have counted within it &ldquo;promotions&rdquo;.  It behoves the Minister to define &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; at the outset; that is inescapable. We will discuss the standards, once the proportionflities have been allocated, under section 5.  That is the logic of the <Col N="1251" /> legislation in so far as I can see any logic in it.  The difficulty, therefore, is for example, that the directive makes possible 15 per cent of the proportion for advertising but that the Bill makes provision for 7.5 per cent.  You can read from Article VIII of the directive down to Article XVIV and realise that there is the capacity to have a harsher regime and technically that is correct.  However, even in the spirit of the Treaty of Accession and in the spirit of the discussion on the transmission of secondary legislation of the European Community, it behoves the Minister to say why he is adopting the harsher strategy instead of the norm which has been established.</P>
    <P>If you go back to the directive, it is obvious that there has been a drift towards deregulations in relation to telecommunications in Europe, towards privatisation and towards an anti-State involvement in communications generally.The interesting point is that in the absence of its stated alternative only one conclusion can be drawn, that if we were living in a country which had largely privately owned televisual networks, we would be allowing them 15 per cent without the inheritance of a public service broadcasting ethos.  However, because it is RTE, in the absence of private commercial alternatives, we make it 7.5 per cent &mdash; that is the level playing field. If I am wrong &mdash; we are all sophisticated people willing to listen to each other's arguments &mdash; I should like to hear the other interpretation.</P>
    <P>I worry about this for many reasons, especially the consequence of reducing a station of the character of RTE to the 7.5 per cent when the 15 per cent was permitted by its directive.  One of the enormous developments &mdash; I am sticking strictly to new material in response to what the Minister is saying &mdash; in information technology is what has given us modern developments in television and, more importantly, in modern international telecommunications, has been MMDS, cable and satellite.  The Minister mentioned satellite and one of its effects is that the footprint defined an area or a <Col N="1252" /> market and the citizens' relationship to it is that they are the target of the televisual activity.  The old inheritance of broadcasting was very different, moving as it did from the print media to radio and television.  I said that the definition of public service broadcasting was the target; the citizen was the arrow.  In other words, the public service broadcasting was always amenable to what people wanted.</P>
    <P>What happened in the Irish case was that the information technology went out of control of the power context.  A great number of people imagined that there was a fortunate to be made in it and people who had money &mdash; but not broadcasting experience &mdash; moved into the area and saw the capacity to define a new kind of Europe of potential consumers, simply the consumer content of the new imprint of the satellite.  It is very interesting that the surveys carried out did not show a great public demand for a marketing-led, advertising ridden type of third commercial channel.  The surveys showed that people had something foisted on them for which they did not ask.  It was certain that they wanted editorial choice within the existing system.  It was interesting that they wanted editorial choice because, under the format concept of broadcasting, they could get accountability through the RTE Authority.</P>
    <P>To take up Deputy McCartan's point, the interesting thing is that the directive of the European Community, structured at 15 per cent, would have given them a market-led communications system but, because RTE had inherited the public service expectations and ethos, they had to act within what the Minister in his last intervention called a harsher regime, made possible in Article XVIV.  You cannot use Article XVIV to defeat Article VIII unless you give the reasons.  Why did the Minister go for a permitted allocation?Was it because there were no private operators only the public service station?</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated in his last contribution that there would not be any ministerial orders, that time limits would be established by statute.  If that is the <Col N="1253" /> case, where is there anything in the legislation to take care of the right of a station to give priority to the Irish language? How has the Minister responded to the directive which will come into effect in 1991 to cater for any of the situations I have described?</P>
    <P>All this is very important because three scenarios had unfolded.  One was that RTE would operate in a sheltered and protected environment enjoying the licence fee and advertising revenue; the second scenario was that if people were unhappy with that the station would decide to become more commercially oriented; the third scenario is that the station will be in competition with the potential third network.  What kind of logic justifies stifling what you have for what is not yet in existence?</P>
    <P>A former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, used to speak about the benign and the malign model of history.  The malignant model of history in the making is that TV3 might not work, in which case&mdash;if you analyse the thinking behind this legislation&mdash;the pressure will be for Network 2 to become a commercial station.  If that happens programmes for minorities, documentaries and the short Irish film which involves about 90 independent film makers on contract will be affected.  The Minister can work out the knock-on effect in regard to employment.  Also if Network 2 had to change in character, I am afraid, it would also change so tragically the particular experience of the people in colleges such as Rathmines and elsewhere &mdash; the colleges of marketing who knew, when they would emerge, they would have a potential customer in RTE.  Now that customer cannot compete, cannot buy from them because the customer has a more limited project and time frame; is limited in income, limited in time, limited in capacity to be forever able to deal with the specific case I am making for the Irish language.  It is a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>In terms of our view we, the Labour Party, are perfectly willing to involve ourselves in constructive action with the Minister about the future of broadcasting <Col N="1254" /> by responding to some kind of White Paper when we could deal with these definitional issues, these policy issues and so on.  I would suggest that the Minister would be very well advised to think very seriously of pulling back somewhat from this legislation to give us a chance to ascertain how we can have a dialogue about broadcasting.  If there is a danger in relation to the visual media, in relation to Network 2&mdash;which I suspect will come under assault if TV3 does not work&mdash; equally the Minister will have an easier job in relation to turning over 2FM to the private commercial sector.  What one is then stuck with is an incredible problem: what happens to the two spine stations, in the case of the visual, RTE 1 and, in the case of radio, Radio 1?  These are the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming this Minister at all. People on both sides of the House will acknowledge that I have been involved, with Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan and others, in the argument about broadcasting since about 1981 or 1982.  Always the argument we made was that these issues should have been set out in a White Paper.  I am not interested in making capital about why such a White Paper was not published, about who did not publish it or whatever.  I am simply saying that if the broadcasting framework was there all of these questions being posed would become very much easier to handle.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister in his last reply said that some of the issues raised by Deputy McCartan and so on are ones with which we can deal when we come to section 5. When we reach section 5, if ever&mdash;when we reach the question of standards&mdash; may I say, in anticipation, that the language used there is extraordinary.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Chair restraining my impulse to depart from section 1.  I will save it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main point about it has been that <Col N="1255" /> advertising quite simply is not the same as envisaged in the three basic Acts the Minister mentioned in the course of his last intervention &mdash; the basic Acts of 1966, 1976 and 1988.  There are unresolved questions all over the place in relation to the EC Directive.  There is need to specify precisely why we have chosen the lower figure.  There is also the need to deal with the questions I raised in relation to advertising using the medium of Irish.  We need to answer the questions I posed in relation to the implications for Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  There is need to answer the question of the implications of capping, how one decides proportions or apportionment between potential advertisers.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the Minister to answer the other points I have been making &mdash; in asking this I am asking no more than when the Minister spoke about charities; there is no reason he cannot speak in the same way&mdash;about the Irish language.  There is the need to answer my point &mdash; in respect of which I may or may not be correct &mdash; in relation to the position of the independents who supply, on contract, to the station because it has a particular advertising budget; whether they have to place themselves as part of the European or part of the national allocation.  I asked a specific question in relation to the directive and the possibilities that will obtain by way of making any kind of provision particularly in relation to the Irish language.  When I spoke in Irish &mdash; I might say out of courtesy to some Members &mdash; I was speaking really about the employment implications not only for actors in general but for Irish-speaking actors in particular whom the advertising agencies would not feel very much like hiring to make advertisements with such a low opportunity of ever being shown.</P>
    <P>I am really intrigued by this fundamental question of the definition of &ldquo;promotion&rdquo;; the question as to when promotion begins; whether it is defined by time, by the objects worn, by the mode of advertising, by the materials used and <Col N="1256" /> so forth.  That question simply must be answered as well.</P>
    <P>I will end on this: where is there one scintilla of evidence to suggest that, when advertising is capped it moves from one medium to another?  One does not have to be a trained advertising executive to know, for example, that the print media dominate the property market; it is easy to advertise a house, a farmer's land and so on in the print media but one rarely sees such things advertised on television; it works the other way; the whole manipulation of subliminal images very often in relation to advertising, those ones on television, do not shift to the printing industry.  Where is there any evidence to suggest that anywhere ever in Europe at any time revenue of a capped kind shifted from television to the print media or indeed to the aural media, the radio?  How then does one justify this concept of capping, of contending that, at the end of the day it will not be handled by ministerial order, but rather by statute?That poses a real problem.</P>
    <P>I would have a certain sympathy with the Minister's contention that nobody wants monopoly.  But the main thing about it is that neither do people want cosseted possibilities for future embryonic developments in respect of something one does not like.  The fact is that RTE have gone commercial and been successful in a number of ways.  Why should one interfere with what is there in endeavouring to make possible something that is not out there?</P>
    <P>The spirit of this amendment is a very simple one.  It began a debate about the nature of advertising.  It is all about advertising.In a way the question with which we are stuck is this: how can the station with which we live, that we are told must change its role, continue to function as a very severely limited functionary in the marketplace?  &ldquo;Monopoly&rdquo; by definition &mdash;no more than oligopoly or whatever&mdash; has a very precise meaning in economic theory, which is basically that one breaks up something that is taking an excessive share of the market in competition with other people seeking to sell products in <Col N="1257" /> the same marketplace, but the other product is not there?</P>
    <P>These are questions on which I would very much appreciate the Minister's response.  I look forward to hearing his reply.  Perhaps the one about which I am most worried is whether it would ever again be possible to see the regular usage of advertisements in the Irish language. I feel very pleased that the Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht, the man responsible for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, has joined us. It would be very appropriate for the Minister to reply in his presence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>At a quarter to four I indicated that I wished to make a brief intervention.  So much has transpired since then that I feel we are inexorably moving towards a vote on this amendment and that there is little point in repeating the substantive points that have been made.</P>
      <P>What I would seek to do, however, is to ask the Minister, in all seriousness, to address the more substantive questions that have been raised.  I have listened with fascination since a quarter to four to this debate and I can only join with Deputy Mitchell in appealing to the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, who were here with us occasionally, to go back to their offices and study the record and, for God's sake, to appeal to this Minister to change his direction on this Bill.</P>
      <P>A great many points have been made with which many of the Government backbenchers would find sympathy.  I listened with particular fascination to Deputies McCartan and Michael Higgins, and if the Minister does nothing else he should do us the courtesy, before there is a vote on this amendment, of addressing the points made by those two Deputies because it is a regrettable dimension of the debate so far that the Minister has not sought, in any serious fashion, to address the arguments made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has now been well established that advertising and the definition of advertising is central to the entire debate. That point has been made and accepted <Col N="1258" /> but other than that, the Minister has not chosen to reply to the points made.  I will give only two examples in the interest of brevity, one from Deputy McCartan and one from Deputy Michael Higgins.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan took up the Minister's point in his third intervention.  The record will show that the Minister clearly conveyed the impression that if he had never brought this ignominious legislation before the House the impact would be the same in any event because of the impending enforcement here of the EC Directive in 1992.  Deputy McCartan drew his attention to the fact that Article 18 of that Directive provides not for the Minister's limits but for an amount of advertising which shall not exceed 15 per cent of daily transmission time and that, however, this percentage may be increased to 20 per cent provided that the amount of spot advertising does not exceed 15 per cent and that subsection (2) provides that the amount of spot advertising within a given period shall not exceed 20 per cent.  That is so dramatically and radically different from the impression conveyed by the Minister that even his own backbenchers who were in the House at the time took serious note of the point.  In his fourth intervention the Minister chose to deal with that point because he knew it was a telling one. He said that that may well be so but wondered why Deputy McCartan did not go on to read Article 19 which states that member states may lay down stricter rules than those in Article 18 for programming time and the procedures for television broadcasting for television broadcasters under their jurisdiction so as to reconcile demand for television advertising with the public interest taking account in particular of (a) the role of television in providing information, education, culture and entertainment and (b) the protection of pluralism of information and of the media.  That clearly is again entirely different from what the Minister sought to imply in his riposte.  There is nothing there that obliges the member states to bring in more strict limitations than are laid down in the EC Directive.  One would get the <Col N="1259" /> impression from the Minister that not only is the directive there but that it is imperative and mandatory on individual Governments to seek to make it more strict.  There is no such mandatory implication, and in so far as the facility is there at all it must be reconciled, as the Article states, with the public interest; it must reconcile &ldquo;the demand for televised advertising with the public interest&rdquo;, and it specifies that.  There is a substantive point on which the Minister has sought to give the impression, that I was certainly left with and that his own backbenchers were left with, that there was a major point unanswered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins, for example, has blown out of the water the Minister's reliance on the Broadcasting Acts of 1960, 1976 and, indeed, 1988.  The Minister sought to make an analogy in that he sought to imply that the same relationship existed between advertising on the one hand and the marketplace on the other as understood in that legislation and the legislation that is before the House, where an entirely artificial ceiling is created in a situation which, as Deputy Higgins said, the competitor does not, at this time, exist.</P>
    <P>Even in so far as the Minister is considered to have made a concession to arguments made on Second Stage with regard to the definition of charities, I am completely dissatisfied with how the Minister intends to cause that now to be intruded into the Bill.  For example, there has been considerable discussion about the coverage of the World Cup during the course of which a campaign has been run by the presenters of the programme for the purchase of essential equipment for the children's cancer unit of a particular hospital of which the captain of the Irish team, Mick McCarthy, is a patron.  Is that a charity?  Is the purchase of essential equipment in the health services to be eligible under the definition of charity?  Deputy Higgins went on to elaborate on that point and to deal, in a good deal of his own latest intervention, with the question of the Irish language, with the necessity to acknowledge that <Col N="1260" /> old techniques and styles of attempting to foster the language or to keep it alive even have changed, that there is a necessity for new techniques, innovative methods to at least foster some kind of love of the language or to keep it alive. For the Fianna Fáil dominant share of the Government that puts the retention of the Irish language on a par with the unification of the country, I would have thought that was a rather important point to address.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made during the course of the debate to a large number of organisations who have shown themselves extremely hostile to what they call the absurdity of this legislation.  That in itself is intriguing since many of those organisations are very much in tune, in my opinion, with other views of Fianna Fáil or of the Government.  It is extraordinary to find them out of kilter on this one and that the Minister proves impervious to any of the points made.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to one particular organisation that is not always in tune with the Government, much as the Government would seek to convince some people that it is.  That is the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Nothing in this debate highlights better for me the single-minded obsessive preoccupation of the Minister in bringing forward these legislative proposals than his determination to ignore the views expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Quite recently the general secretary of the congress made clear that in his view persistence on the part of the Government in seeking to enact this Bill as it stands could prove an insurmountable obstacle to the negotiation of a new programme for national recovery. In my opinion &mdash; I suggest in this respect that it is an informed opinion &mdash; next week at the annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that view will be reiterated in more trenchant terms.  I find it extraordinary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The amendment before us deals with advertising and the definition of advertising which, as I have said, I think we have agreed, is central to the Bill.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions who are central to an economic cornerstone &mdash; I would say the only economic cornerstone &mdash; of this Government have come out very strongly against this point for reasons on which they have elaborated, that have on the one hand to do with the retention of jobs in RTE and, on the other hand, with the quality of public service broadcasting.  Despite the fact that congress are so central to the continuation of the Government's economic strategy, it appears the Minister and the Government are prepared to ignore the possibility of the continuation of that co-operation because of their single-minded, obsessive determination to enact this Bill.  It is relevant to ask why is that the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your wishes in that matter, but it is a point that was not made in the debate so far and one which highlights the fact that the Minister has other than broadcasting considerations in mind in persisting with this legislation. No doubt at some stage of the debate he will tell us what that motivation is.  I would be very happy if he would put on the record of the House some of the views that are being expressed in the bars and outside the confines of the House so that they could be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was happy to be a member of a local authority chaired by the present Minister, but I never joined in the whingeing that went on about his style.  I have some admiration for his style, but then of course he does not have his foot on my neck as he has on the neck of RTE &mdash;<Col N="1262" /> and in this case he is twisting the shoe on it, and we are entitled to an explanation for that.  Advertising, as we have been discussing in this debate, cannot be treated as if we were discussing the quota for the national beet output, and treating the public service broadcasting organisation as if they were a sugar beet factory in Thurles or Carlow, which is the import of what the Minister has been seeking to do.</P>
    <P>The advertising organisations have come out against this Bill in summary for two reasons.  First, they say it will bring about a severely inflationary impact for consumers and, secondly, it will shift a major element of advertising outside of the country.  Again, I find that hard to reconcile with the nationalistic and patriotic aspirations of the Minister's party. How, in a country where the pool is so small, would anyone wish to take measures that would cause a part of the sustenance of the national public sector broadcasting organisation to be diverted outside of the country?  There should be no doubt, as Deputy Higgins explained, that there is no domestic competitor.  The competitors in this case are not national but are based outside the country, and they are the people who will benefit.  It is accepted at this stage of the debate that to shift a portion of the available advertising revenue to a different medium is unlikely, and that means that organisations like ITV, Sky and so on will be the major beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I had a number of other points to make but I think they have been better made by other speakers.  I do not believe this section of the debate has been over-long because when you are dealing with a measure whereby the capping of advertising has been chosen as an instrument of broadcasting policy, the definition of advertising seems, for all the reasons that have been given, to be central to that and therefore deserves the amount of time the House has bestowed on it so far.  The disappointing thing is that, with the exception of Deputy Cowen, there has been no participation from Government backbenchers, a good number of whom, if they have studied <Col N="1263" /> the issue at all, are in agreement that motives of vindictiveness or whatever are not good bases for broadcasting policy. They have the same apprehensions, reservations and opposition as many on this side of the House to the measures the Minister has threatened to pursue at all costs.  It would do justice to the debate that has taken place up to now if the Minister was to address seriously, and show himself to be not completely impervious to the arguments that have been made here.</P>
    <P>I do not know who knows what the Minister's broadcasting policy is at this stage.  For example, I do not know if his Department know what elements make up his broadcasting policy.  It seems to be politically motivated rather than in broadcasting terms or any other considerations.Very serious points have been adduced in this debate &mdash; I have referred in particular to the contributions of Deputies McCartan and Higgins.  It would be a suitable prelude to the vote on this section if the Minister decided to take more seriously arguments that are fervently held on this side of the House, and tried to rebut them if they are capable of being rebuted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a couple of brief questions, particularly in regard to the definition of advertising under the 1960 Act and the amending Act of 1976.  Section 20 of the 1960 Act refers to advertising but not in the context as envisaged in the amendment by the Workers' Party.  Section 14 of the amending Act of 1976 refers to advertising, but again, there is no clear definition.  The Minister has misled the House and the matter should be clarified.  Under the terms of these two Acts there is no clear definition of advertising as proposed in the amendment in the name of the Workers' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the whole issue of teasing out the issues.  At a press conference on Friday last the Taoiseach said there would be no amendments and the Bill would not be withdrawn.  This puts <Col N="1264" /> an entirely new light on this whole exercise.It seems it is a rather futile exercise if there is a diktat from the Taoiseach that we have no business discussing this document and he has already instructed the Minister to push it through at all costs.  It makes a mockery of the whole system of democracy.  Has the Minister in any way investigated the effects, in terms of job losses and job prospects, on RTE of the measures he proposes in this Bill, if carried?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate, intervened on four occasions and I think my views are well known in relation to most of the points that have been raised during the day.  I thought the rationale for my proposals had been set out quite thoroughly in my Second Stage speech, in radio and television interviews and in debates in this House since.  The objective is to create a fair competitive environment in the broadcasting sector in relation to the print media.  That environment cannot be fair when the main competitor has two sources of funding one of which, the licence fee revenue, is not available to the independent sector or to the print media.  My approach in dealing with that situation is to put a limitation on RTE's role in the advertising market and to create some balance between the two sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins had some difficulty in coming to grips with the idea that to bring about deregulation there was, as a first step, a need for some regulation.  This is happening every day of the week as we move towards 1992 within the European Community under the internal market council and every other council as we try to achieve within Europe an open free market.  Directives are being passed every day which are doing exactly what I am trying to achieve.  The rationale for the 7½ per cent limitation is based on the premise that since approximately 50 per cent of RTE's revenue comes from licence fees it is appropriate, in trying to create a balance between the two sectors, to limit their advertising time to half that of the independent sector.  I appreciate that the rationale I have outlined may not <Col N="1265" /> be acceptable to some Deputies opposite but that is the background to it.</P>
    <P>The whole principle is that we have an alternative radio and television environment in this country.  That was decided in the 1988 Act.  What I am attempting to do in this legislation is to create the environment to allow that to thrive and to develop.  One of Deputy Higgins's queries related to the role of and his concern for those involved in the independent sector.  I accept his genuine concern in that area.  With further outlets for radio and television services available there will be more scope for their talents to be used.  In response to the question of whether they have to declare themselves European, they are European, they are Irish, and there is no such thing as having to declare anything of the sort.  The 50 per cent of time which excludes news, current affairs and sports programmes is of European origin, which is also Irish. The 10 per cent limitation under the Directive involved in the independent sector, outside of the direct broadcaster, is of European origin.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to the World Cup coverage by RTE.  I made the point earlier that RTE have done a superb job in relation to the coverage of the World Cup, something of which we can be very proud. Something that seems to be missed in all of this &mdash; I am quoted at length by Deputies &mdash; is that at all times I have made the point that in my view RTE will continue to be &mdash; and rightly so as it is our national station &mdash; the premier broadcaster in this country.  There is nothing in this legislation that will in any way reduce that role.  Deputies have spoken on this amendment as if RTE were to be suddenly stripped of their funding.  The reality is that we have a population of 3.5 million people and RTE will have an income of approximately £100 million to cater for those people. That, by anybody's reckoning, is a sizeable sum of money, and is equivalent to their 1988 figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte suggested that I was misleading the House.  The point I was referring to, and which I specifically <Col N="1266" /> answered, was in relation to sponsorship, which had been mentioned by Deputy McCartan, and not to the general overall advertising question to which I was referring.</P>
    <P>In relation to charities I assured the House on the last occasion &mdash; and I want to reiterate it here &mdash; that I am conscious of the position of charities.  I believe that RTE, rather than just providing them with a reduced rate, should carry the listed charities' advertising in their public service announcements, as part of their obligation for which they receive almost £47 million of licence fee, and this would not be taken into account in their advertising cap.  I did say to the House &mdash; and I take the opportunity to say it again now &mdash; that I will bring in an amendment clarifying the position of the charities.  I am conscious of the work being done there.  I congratulate those involved in the RTE World Cup team, and the others involved in raising funds for equipment. If there is a need for clarification &mdash; and Deputies apparently think there is &mdash; I will clarify it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins was concerned about the role of the Irish language.  I should like to say to him that there is already a capping involved in RTE.  They have a capping of six minutes; it has been extended to seven and a half minutes over the years and it has not affected the amount of Irish advertisements.  I share his concern that probably there is not enough of them at present.  I share also his concern that probably there are not these advertisements in the future. However, there should be greater scope and demand for the services of the actors involved because of the fact that we will have more channels from an Irish source in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Many other points were made but during Second Stage and at various stages I have answered the various points.  As far as I am concerned the particular amendment would be too restrictive in its wording as put down by The Workers' Party and I am not prepared to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`the I.R.T.C.' means the Independent Radio and Television Commission;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> Apart from the House having this view at the outset of the debate, throughout the Bill there is reference to the Authority and it is defined in the definition section to mean the RTE Authority, yet any time in a section or an amendment where we refer to the Independent Radio and Television Commission we have to use that lengthy phrase.  It would facilitate brevity if we inserted in the definition section that &ldquo;IRTC&rdquo; means the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>You will be aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the Independent Radio and Television Commission was created by the Radio and Television Act, 1988, but the circumstances in which it was created are almost directly parallel to the circumstances of the Bill before us.  The Bill as published by the Minister at the time was called the Sound Broadcasting Bill and had no provision for an Independent Radio and Television Commission.The Minister wanted to control the giving out of licences himself and because of the furore on this side of the House from all parties he was forced to change his mind and had to bring in major amendments on Committee Stage to set up the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The reality at the end of the day is that the Minister really got his way because he was able to appoint the commission, the vast majority of whose members are active supporters of his own party.  That defies the spirit of all broadcasting legislation which requires the commission, like the RTE Authority, to be balanced.  How can they be balanced if they are politically slanted from the very word &ldquo;go&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It is important that the definition of the Independent Radio and Television Commission be inserted here.  We cannot use the definition at &ldquo;the commission&rdquo; as meaning the Independent Radio and Television Commission because there is a second commission called the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  For that reason some other abbreviation has to be found.  That is why I propose we use the initials IRTC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> The commission have a very important role which is to oversee and lay down the guidelines for the independent broadcasting sector, the alternative sector.  The present commission are the successors of the former Interim Local Radio Commission, the former commission having been chaired by Professor Colm Ó hEocha, President of University College, Galway, and previously Chairman of the New Ireland Forum.  The entire debate on this Bill, never mind the definition section, is forcused on the question of funding and the role of the commission we are here defining in the definition section is greatly unfluenced by the amount of funding available to them and to the independent broadcasters under them.</P>
    <P>The Minister in one of his replies confirmed that the central purpose of the legislation now before us is to try to ensure the continuation of alternative broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the Minister ignored any research available to him.  As I said, a forerunner of the present commission were the Interim Local Radio Commission, who commissioned an independent consultant's report from Touche Ross &amp; Co. and that is the only research done under the auspices of the Department of Communications in relation to the viability of alternative broadcasting. I have that report synopsised in my notes here.  It shows very clearly that the number of local stations to operate under the IRTC that could be viable is very restricted indeed.  It quantifies its findings in facts, figures and analyses of the advertising pool and it says that in the consultant's opinion at most about seven commercial stations would be viable, two in Dublin, one in Cork, one in Limerick, one in Waterford and perhaps one in Galway.  If that is the case, on what basis did the Minister unilaterally decide, without the advice of his Department or any research, to impose the alternative national radio on the commission which we seek here to define?</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted implicitly in one of the exchanges in this debate that it was a political decision, in breach of all Civil <Col N="1273" /> Service advice.  He said, &ldquo;That is what we are elected for, to take these political decisions&rdquo;.  It was political, and it was also political to get alternative national radio, Century Radio, on the air before they were ready to broadcast.  Here we are, nine months later, and after the Minister's famous speech launching Century when he said, &ldquo;It is great to be in Government to make things happen&rdquo;, Century is on the ropes.  They thought legislation was coming forward to save them.  That was the original intention and the original reason for the urgency of this Bill.  What is now proposed as an amendment to this Bill scuppers any hope of salvation, aid or assistance for Century, yet, despite the difficulties Century are having in staying alive and maintaining themselves as an alternative national radio service under the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the Minister proceeds with his plan to try to divert some income from RTE ostensibly to allow a third television channel to set up, commence and survive.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the last amendment I asked the Minister, not once but twice, to tell the House what research he had available to him that would show that an alternative radio service, let alone an alternative national service, could be viable when I know the only research available shows it is not viable and it is certainly not going to be made viable by diverting £12 million from RTE.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell, if you address Deputy Cowen you might be inadvertently encouraging him to interrupt you.  I ask you to direct your attention to your own amenment which says that IRTC means the Independent Radio and Television Commission which is a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>You can appreciate that later on when we are talking about the roles and functions or anything connected with them we can elaborate.  In so far as we are on the matter of defining them, it would seem to me, and I think the Deputy will accept, that in respect of that it must be limited to what is there, and the only point Deputy Mitchell would have to defend would be an indication from some other Deputy present that IRTC refers to something other than what is referred to in the amendment.  That is the logic of what is in that amendment.  Subsequently, when you are dealing with other matters I can appreciate an elaboration and movement <Col N="1275" /> back into history and so on, but on that one I appeal to the good sense of the Deputy to let us treat that for what it is and proceed to matters of greater profundity.Now we have to stay with what is there.  Only in circumstances where somebody wants to prove otherwise, that IRTC means something else, will the House accept it is relevant, otherwise, no.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for clarifying the matter.  The amendment before us is definitional rather than just a drafting amendment.  It allows us to reflect, Sir, on the circumstances which led to the setting up of the Independent Radio and Television Commission and it helps us to recall that the Minister was forced to amend his own legislation to create this commission, when he originally sought to control the granting of licences.  Now he wants to control advertising.  There is a consistent thread&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has introduced legislation in this House and he knows that when we deal with definitions we do not deal with other matters, especially when in subsequent sections the Deputy can roam at will over things to which he is referring now.  Could we not have a degree of sanity about this? Let us look at all the other words defined in the Bill, definitions are about definitions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you really consider there is nothing extraordinary about it? May I ask you, Sir, if you know of any Minister, in your long experience in this House, who had to amend his own legislation twice within 24 hours of both Bills <Col N="1276" /> being introduced?  Is there a precedent for a Minister having to substantially amend his own Bill within 24 hours of its introduction on two occasions in a row?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like answering a question by asking another, but can the Deputy demonstrate if there is anywhere in Standing Orders that allows him or any other Deputy to move away from what is prescribed in Standing Orders?  That is the sole function of the Chair.  There will be fair scope in the sections that follow for Deputy Mitchell to wade in to his heart's content but it is manifestly clear that the definition means what it means and nobody else is contending that it means anything else.  What are we talking about?</P>

      <P>Given the extraordinary background to the introduction of the broadcasting legislation and the fact that the Minister has been consistently forced to change the Bill within 24 hours of its publication, it would be remiss of us as the Opposition not to highlight the extraordinary record of this Minister for Communications.</P>
      <P>The Bill begs the question of what preparation and what consideration any Minister could have given to the issue under consideration, if on each occasion he introduces legislation he is forced to change it substantially within 24 hours, even before we get to the Committee Stage.  That speaks volumes about the Minister's attitude and approach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Independent Radio and Television Commission which was forced on the Minister by the furore and pressure from this side of the House have been given an impossible task because all the data available to them shows that the number of alternative radio stations that are viable is very limited indeed.  Yet when announcing the IRTC, the Minister announced there was to be an independent radio station for every county together with a national alternative radio and television service. Now the Minister realises that not alone is the viability of the national radio and television service highly questionable having started off with the ambition of taking urgent steps to maintain the national alternative in being &mdash; that is Century Radio &mdash; but because of the furore and sharp reaction the Minister has been blown off course and the Bill has not only lost its urgency but its real purpose.  This unfortunate commission which we seek to define in this section have to preside over the independent sector of broadcasting which has been created, not without research but in total breach of the research available to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill should look at the original Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1988, and the debates on it.  She should also look at <Col N="1280" /> the words of wisdom spoken by the then Deputy Cullen in that debate, the same words of wisdom he spoke on television.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us seeks to retrospectively justify the Minister's decision to set up alternative radio and television. He put forward this proposal against the advice of his Department &mdash; the advice he got would have been consistent with the advice I got &mdash; and in breach of all the research available to him.  The Minister dismissed the interim local radio commission, a non-political commission, and appointed his own commission who now have an extremely difficult job to do.  The Minister can be forgiven a certain amount for rushing his fences given the difficulty experienced by me as Minister and the previous Fianna Fáil Government from 1979-88 in resolving the problems in the broadcasting area.  The difference between the Minister and I is that I had a plan but could get no action while the Minister is all action and no plan.  Having started off well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is all words and no direction to his amendment.  I appeal to Deputy Mitchell, in the interests of the standards of debate which are honoured here and of which we are proud, to direct himself to the words of his amendment.  The Deputy may have lingering thoughts, or subconscious feelings, about what happened in the past but unfortunately that does not make proper what he proposes to say now in respect of the amendment he put down on Committee Stage.  It is no joy for me to have to remind him of this, but I have to do what is required of me or of anyone who sits in this Chair.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell knows that the origins, pedigree or period of gestation of the Bill has nothing to do with the fact that we presume to define something in it.  We must deal with the definition and later the Deputy will have an opportunity to refer to those matters.  I ask the Deputy to finally accept that he has taken and been given certain freedoms in respect of the amendment in his name.  I appeal to him to allow us to dispose of the amendment one way or another and to move to other <Col N="1282" /> amendments where his contribution will be more relevant.</P>

      <P>On the specific amendment to the definition, it is not necessary so far as my proposals are concerned, to define the IRTC because any time they are referred to in my proposals they are given their full title.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested the creation of a new method for appointing bodies.  I do not want to go into this in too much detail, but I feel it incumbent on me to defend the integrity of the members of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  I reject the suggestion made by the Deputy that the members are appointed merely on the basis of political affiliation and I consider it a gross insult to the people who give selflessly of their time and expertise in the service of this country for very little remuneration.  I find his remarks particularly strange when one considers that the chairman of the commission is the distinguished former Supreme Court Justice Henchy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke at great length about me having changed my mind about legislation and referred to the viability of stations.  I want to remind him that he brought a Bill into this House on which there was a half day's Second Stage debate and it never saw the light of day again.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when the Minister took a view about Deputy Mitchell being out of order, having been reminded by me, I indicated to him that it would be better that he take the advice I tendered to Deputy Mitchell and postpone references to matters not provided for in the amendment until the appropriate section or amendment is reached.  If Deputy O'Sullivan heard me saying that he will appreciate that I must say the same to him.  We are dealing with the statement in the amendment to which Deputy Mitchell has his name, that four letters mean what is stated in the amendment.The Deputy can elaborate on the functions and the role of the commission on other sections.  He may also refer to the membership of the commission at a later stage but he cannot do so on the amendment.  If the House does not accept that, I will have to throw the debate into an irregular state that no Member would <Col N="1285" /> wish at the end of the day, and that would be against my better judgment.  I should like to ask Deputy O'Sullivan to be as brief as he can on the amendment and to feel free on subsequent sections or amendments to be relevant.  He will not be interrupted.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to do so.  Deputy Mitchell wishes to define the commission.  Staff were recruited <Col N="1288" /> with out an advertisement being placed in the paper, nobody knows how they were recruited and who was responsible for recruiting them.  In the 1988 Act the Minister gave the commission a very definite role; the most important matter was the advertising of franchises.  My information is that at present there are many applications with the commission from local community broadcasting organisations which have yet to be processed.  I raised this matter during the no confidence motion and since then there was an announcement to the effect that the commission were now examining the application.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell us whether the commission have taken a decision to grant broadcasting licences to the various community broadcasting organisations through the country because that was one of the reasons Members of this House accepted the amendments of the Minister to the 1988 Broadcasting Bill.  For some reason best known to the Minister, the licences &mdash; with one exception in the Minister's constituency &mdash; have not been granted.  There is a case to be answered in this regard.  I have yet to be convinced that the commission are impartial.  I support Deputy Mitchell's amendment and I will listen to other Members.  I may comment on their contributions later.</P>

      <P>I want to take up something which the Minister said.  This is not the first time he has resorted to the ruse he used tonight.  In reply to what I said earlier on this amendment, the Minister quoted the distinguished chairman of the IRTC, Mr. Justice Henchy, as exempting them from my main charge, that the overwhelming membership of the IRTC are active supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Will the Minister deny this?  Mr. Justice Henchy, a distinguished former Supreme Court judge, cannot decide anything on his own, decisions can only be made by the IRTC who, in common with the new RTE Authority, are overwhelmingly composed of members of the Government parties. How can the commission and the Authority discharge their duties in a balanced <Col N="1289" /> way when that is the case?  We sought to get away from that nonsense in the appointment of the local radio commission and the RTE authority which were in office until recently.  We did the same in regard to appointing people to State boards.  We did not regard it as a substitute honours list and although some of these people may be worthy in their own right, they may know little about the business and, partly because of this, the State sector was in a mess in 1982; every single company were losing money.  We tried to change that in the 1982-87 period of Government.  I appointed Mr. Paul Kavanagh, one of the leading Fianna Fáil fund raisers, to Telecom Éireann because of his business expertise.</P>

      <P>The commission have a very difficult job in presiding over an independent sector which is more expansive than the market can bear.  The Minister knows that, as he had access to the independent report of the consultants, Touche Ross, which was paid for by his Department when I was Minister.  The salient point is that the cornerstone of the Minister's broadcasting policy belies the facts spelt out in the report, which is the only report on the viability of alternative broadcasting.  It was undertaken because there was a view in certain parts of the community that independent radio licences would be licences to print money.  It was a strongly held and genuine view by a number of people and I encouraged the interim local radio commission to obtain a report.  It showed that the number of local viable stations was very limited but the Minister superimposed his will to add an alternative national radio and television service.  I want to repeat, in the presence of a number of Government backbenchers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I seek to insert a definition of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  First of all it is inconsistent that throughout this Bill and in other legislation the RTE Authority are constantly referred to as the Authority whereas the Independent Radio and Television Commission are constantly referred to as the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  It leads to unnecessary repetition in section after section of broadcasting legislation, whereas, if the abbreviation was accepted, it would considerably reduce the amount of lines taken up by its long title.  It appears to be a reasonable amendment which the Minister should accept.  The Minister sought to relate it to the next amendment in my name.  To some extent it is pertinent to that amendment is quite different.  We will deal with it when we come to it.  It is regrettable that the Minister does not have the grace to accept a drafting amendment of this kind even if it does allow us to highlight his appalling record in being forced to change legislation, thereby drawing attention to the negligence of his approach to legislation being introduced in this House.</P>

      <P>I might point out to the Minister that Deputy Jim Higgins was offering.  Should we hear him first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so, a Cheann Comhairle.  If it is all right I would like to respond to a couple of points.  Before getting to Deputy Mitchell I might reply to a charge which has been levelled here for the second time in regard to a hospital radio in St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane in my constituency, an allegation made by Deputy O'Sullivan as though, in some way, there was something improper about that hospital radio being on the air, or that it was in some way receiving very favourable treatment. First of all, I would have no apology to make to anybody if I was in a position to give it favourable treatment because it is doing an excellent job in relation to the staff, patients, their needs and the general work being done in the Portrane-Donabate area.  I genuinely do not understand why the Labour Party continue to attack it.  If Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan was familiar with the legislation with which he was involved in debating in this House in 1988, he would know that the reality of the position is that there is in that Act a specific section, section 8, the sidenote of which reads: &ldquo;Contracts for temporary or institutional sound broadcasting services.&rdquo;Section 8 (2) of the Radio and Television Act 1988 reads:</P>
      <P>The Commission may enter into a sound broadcasting contract with an applicant therefore for the provision of a low-power sound broadcasting service which is intended to serve only such single educational institution, hospital, or other similar establishment as may be specified in the contract.</P>
      <P>Then section 8 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>Sections 5 and 6 shall not apply in the case of a contract applied for, or awarded, for the provision of a sound broadcasting service under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> I might add that sections 5 and 6 deal with applications for sound broadcasting contracts and determination of applications for award of sound broadcasting contracts.  It is dealt with in a totally different way.  I must say that since St. Ita's Hospital got its licence in accordance with that legislation &mdash; which provision was specifically written in for hospitals and other educational institutions &mdash; they have been doing an excellent job of looking after the needs, interests and caring for the general wellbeing of the hospital and the staff in its environs.  I just do not understand why the Labour Party seem to have such a grudge against that hospital having its radio when it is doing such an excellent job.</P>
    <P>As far as the general question of community radio is concerned, my understanding is that the commission have now invited indications of interest from community groups around the country in particular areas which they wish to serve. Like Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan I am a keen supporter of community radio and would like to see it developed in this country as soon as possible.  I emphasised that in the course of the debate in 1988. I want to reiterate it now.</P>
    <P>To revert to St. Ita's Hospital radio, I should say the provision is specifically written in here that hospitals, educational institutions or others can make application outside of the normal type of advertising or recommended criteria with which somebody must comply when applying for a licence for a town, county or other station.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell seemed to raise the whole question of creating a new method of appointing bodies.  He went on to talk about the President doing it. I believe the existing arrangements are satisfactory and are parallel with the method of appointments to most State boards and bodies, as distinct from Deputy Mitchell's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to balance surely I am entitled to defend accusations about the appointment of boards.  One can only judge the Deputy who makes the accusation on his record.  For example, two bodies were set up when he was Minister, Telecom Éireann and An Post, and I did notice any great anxiety on his part to provide for the elaborate and unusual arrangements he is proposing here.  Likewise in his time in the Department of Transport, there was a very large number of bodies in existence <Col N="1297" /> and again I am not aware that the Deputy made such changes as he is now proposing for the numerous State boards in question.Nobody questioned the integrity of those people.  At least in the case of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, for which I am responsible, the legislation sets out the categories and the range of people who may be appointed and there will be additional safeguards in regard to their independence, which apply equally to RTE whereby the members cannot be removed without the express approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, in the Schedule to the Bill the criteria set out in relation to the membership are the same as those which were set out in Deputy Mitchell's ill-fated Bill.  It provides that a person shall not be appointed to be a member of the commission unless he has had experience of or shown capacity in media or commercial affairs, radio communications engineering, administration, social, cultural, education or community activities.  I went one step further and extended that to include also interest in trade union affairs.  It ill-becomes Deputy Mitchell to question the integrity of people and I reject completely the suggestion that the members of these bodies are appointed on the basis of political affiliation.  I consider that suggestion a gross insult to the people who give selflessly of their time and expertise in the service of the country for very little remuneration.</P>
      <P>It is interesting also that the same Deputy is so out of touch that last week he adverted to the membership of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission &mdash; he has an amendment down on it as well &mdash; in such a derogatory fashion.  He seemed to be completely unaware that all but one of the members of that broadcasting complaints commission were appointed by none other than himself.  I repeat that I believe the existing arrangements for such appointments are satisfactory.They have stood the test of time and I see no reason to depart from them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell seems to have some <Col N="1298" /> problem with the fact that we live in a democracy where legislation is introduced and can be altered.  It is part of our democratic system that a Government listens to its people, to the general view as expressed through various interest groups and can, on balance, decide to alter legislation, and that has been done in regard to previous legislation.  Let me say, however, the legislation was passed in 1988 and brought about a situation where we had about 20 stations around the country together with a national station, and it allows for other television stations.  Compare that record of achievement which is being refined now in this legislation to that of Deputy Mitchell.  It is fine that he asked for the Touche Ross report and that he said he would do the devil and all and remove the pirates.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion Deputy Mitchell was going to take Chris Carey's station up in Rathfarnham off the air. There were protests out on the streets, children out on the streets and Deputy Mitchell ran away from the protests.  He then introduced his ill-fated legislation and if I am not mistaken &mdash; if I am wronging the Deputy he will excuse me &mdash; it was Deputy O'Sullivan's speech on Second Stage that torpedoed that Bill, never to be seen again during the lifetime of Deputy Mitchell.  While the Labour Party were part of that Government and were supporting that Government, pirates were allowed free rein and brought the law into disrepute.  When my party came into Government we had a situation where there were about 70 pirate stations, and Deputy Mitchell has the gall to lecture me about changing my mind on legislation.  I make no apologies to Deputy Mitchell or anybody else for the fact that we live in a democracy, that the Government are prepared to listen to the views of the people and change if something is seen to be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that I totally reject his accusations against the integrity of people who have given of their time to serve on boards.  Much play was made by Deputy Mitchell about boards and the RTE Authority.  In 1982, on 1 June, an Authority of nine people was appointed. <Col N="1299" /> We come to the Authority of 1985 when a new authority was appointed by the Government and only one of the previous members of the authority was retained; there were three women as distinct from the two that were there before.  Let the Deputy not talk to me about party affiliations when I look at the names of those on the Authority.  I do not want to mention names across this House.</P>

      <P>One of the implications being made on the other side of the House is that Deputy Mitchell put down this motion for flippant reasons and that asking for a definition of the IRTC is in some way superflous.  I do not think it is. We can take the RTC out of it.  What Deputy Mitchell is trying to do is to focus on the opening initial and to ensure that it is put in there in block letters.  Independence is the whole essence of the commission and there should be absolutely no doubt whatever about it.  The whole thing hinges on the absolute integrity of the commission which should be above and beyond question of compromise or bias and above any allegation, suspicion or taint of partiality.  This is reasonable and should be written into this section of the Bill.  This should be done because of the very sensitivity of the role of the commission itself, because of the vast powers that will be devolved on even small radio stations throughout the length and breadth of the country and because, human nature being what it is, there is every possibility that power will be abused because in local stations decisions will be taken by people, by personalities, and there is a possibility that such people might, from time to time, be subjected to pressure.  Therefore, it is vital that we <Col N="1300" /> have a truly independent television and radio commission.  Not alone should the commission be truly independent but the stations themselves should be absolutely independent.</P>
      <P>In this regard I would like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken on an ongoing basis to ensure that in the programme agenda the balance is correct, that the treatment of topics is correct and there is ongoing monitoring of the embryonic development of the radio stations.  Are stations from time to time asked to submit to the commission sample agendas and sample programmes, and are recordings taken from time to time to see how those stations are carrying out their duties?  I would also ask the Minister whether or not there have been any complaints to the commission about bias, lack of balance or lack of impartiality?</P>
      <P>All of this helps to amplify what Deputy Mitchell is trying to achieve in this amendment to the Bill. Let me say that I happen to be extremely fortunate in living in Mayo where we have an exceptionally good independent community radio station, indeed, the most successful in the country, in WRFM.  Deputies Morley, Calleary and I can testify to the fact that they discharge their remit with a tremendous amount of verve and imagination and there is no hint of partiality on the part of the people who manage this station.  Would that this could be the guaranteed situation throughout the length and breadth of the country.  This is what is vitally important. This is what Deputy Mitchell is trying to ensure by this amendment.</P>

      <P>I will be brief in dealing with this amendment.  I understand there is only one meaning of the IRTC; &ldquo;I&rdquo; stands for Independent, &ldquo;R&rdquo; stands for Radio, &ldquo;T&rdquo; stands for Television and &ldquo;C&rdquo; stands for Commission.  Therefore, the <Col N="1301" /> IRTC is the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  I thought that would be the most common-sense approach to take to the amendment but unfortunately we flew off at a tangent and ended up on some satellite.  I did not realise it was possible to put all Deputy Mitchell's contribution into the very simple statement that the IRTC means the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  I agree it does not mean the Institute for Recycling Telegraphic Confusion.  I think there is fairly broad agreement on what it means.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of Deputy Mitchell's contribution which I must counteract, in the same way as the Minister has done, and I do not wish to duplicate his performance in that respect.  I would emphasise that it is my intention, as soon as everybody is ready, to get down to the basic disagreements that exist between various sides of the House as to how this matter is to be dealt with.  While awaiting that moment, I am not prepared to listen to innuendo &mdash; it ill becomes a politician to make this statement inside or outside the House &mdash; that anybody who actively supports any political party is <i>ipso facto</i> incapable of being a member of an independent board and acting honourably and with the utmost integrity.  No Member of this House should state that a person who actively supports a political organisation should be deprived of serving on a semi-State body, to which he has the privilege to be appointed by a person who is democratically accountable to the people, that is a Minister.  It particularly ill-behoves a former Minister of an Irish Government to make such a statement, given the fact that he exercised the right to appoint such people.  I do not doubt for one moment that he exercised that right with the same propriety as his predecessors or his successors.  It ill-behoves a politician of considerable experience, particularly inside this House where one has privilege, to state that anyone who actively supports a political organisation is incapable of acting with independence and integrity in the performance of their duties on any board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go further and bring to Deputy <Col N="1302" /> Mitchell's attention that there is a Member on this side of the House, an active supporter of the party and a very dear colleague of mine who, having been appointed to the RTE Authority by a Fianna Fáil Minister, resigned that position when he was elected to this House.  That person's independence and political support for the organisation he supported all his life was not compromised by joining that Authority.  It is time politicians stopped putting out the idea that people who support me and you, who help us get into this House and serve the country are incapable of sitting on a board and performing with the utmost integrity.</P>
    <P>I would like to dismiss the myth put out in an attempt to make political capital &mdash; this side of the House is as culpable as the far side &mdash; that people who are independent and have no political view, who do not support any political party, should be members of State boards, that these are the people who are non-active, who are passive, and on whom the monopoly of integrity or honour rests.  That is a myth and we know it.  I reiterate that it ill-behoves any Member to pursue an argument along those lines.  It does no credit to himself, his party, or more importantly, the profession to which we all belong &mdash; and I do not say that in a sanctimonious way.  We all know honourable people, even from Opposition parties, and I respect them for it, who are well capable of sitting on any board appointed by any Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, it was stated on Second Stage by the Leader of the Labour Party, with whom I was most surprised, and by the spokesman from Fine Gael that with the exception of the chairman &mdash; we would not dare accuse an eminent and accomplished former Irish Justice of being non-independent &mdash; everyone on the commission is tainted with some sort of political bias.  As has been outlined by the Minister, there is provision in the legislation regarding the personnel who would be on the commission.Since that commission were set up everything has been done in the open <Col N="1303" /> and is subject to public inquiry.  It goes without saying that the chairman of the commission is independent.  In all cases it is the commission as a whole who make the decisions.  If you smear one member, you smear them all.  The commission make decisions in the same way as this Government make decisions.  If we can proceed with the implementation of this legislation on that basis, we can make progress.  We can have a coherent and proper debate on which there will be genuine disagreement, as outlined by the Tánaiste in the no confidence motion.</P>
    <P>If people proceed with the idea that there are active supporters waiting to do things at the behest of the Minister or anyone else, we are trivialising this debate to a very poor L &amp; H debate in UCD.  It ill-behoves any Member to proceed on that basis, particularly when no evidence has been put forward of any wrong-doing by the commission.  The only thing that could be said is that people, prior to their appointment to the commission, were active political supporters.I do not know whether that is the case but it does not matter once they do their job competently.  Regardless of their political affiliations, there should be no insinuation by any Member of this House that such political affiliation prevents them from acting honourably and with integrity in the performance of their duties.  I reiterate that there is a Member on this side of the House who was a more active supporter of this party down the years than anyone on any commission and when he was appointed to the RTE Authority his honour and integrity were maintained as I would expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond briefly to the Minister and Deputy Cowen in regard to the role and functions of the commission.  It is well known that there have been a number of applications in the office of the commission for a considerable time, which to date have not been processed.  I do not seek the abolition of the radio station in north County Dublin but equality of treatment to which all the applicants are <Col N="1304" /> entitled.  If I have any criticism regarding the commission it is their inactivity in this area.  It was an integral part of the Broadcasting Bill in 1988.  In another section of the Bill I will be spelling out precisely what the Minister said on that occasion.  By 1990 there was supposed to be 100 frequencies available throughout the country but this has not happened. Regardless of the integrity of the commission, their ability must be called into question.  How is it that the other applications have not been processed?  That is a fair question.  I am not attacking any one in particular but for some unknown reason this has not been done.</P>
      <P>In relation to another point raised by the Minister and by Deputy Mitchell, the Deputy and I had many heated arguments, even more so than I am having with the Minister, regarding broadcasting legislation.  He had a point of view and the Labour Party had a point of view.  I felt my point was valid and it was part of the agreement by which we entered into government.  We could not reconcile our differences on that occasion and that is the reason the legislation was not passed.</P>
      <P>I fail to see how the Minister can criticise Deputy Mitchell for not taking action on the pirate broadcasting stations.  In the lead up to this discussion today I went back over some of the speeches made during the 1988 period prior to the introduction of this legislation.  When I pleaded with the Minister, Deputy Burke, to introduce the Wireless and Telegraphy Bill in advance of the Broadcasting Bill he refused until he got both in tandem. With all due respect he is not in any position to throw stones at anybody in this regard.  He mentioned the rent-a-crowd we had on the streets of Dubline when Deputy Mitchell attempted to take the pirates off the air.  Equally it could be said about the Minister that he too jibbed on that occasion; that he would not go unless he was armed with the second piece of legislation to ensure that he had the commercial local stations in position. The only criticism I have to offer on the commission is the fact that they have not yet made available to the applicants the licence which they require to go on air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> We are entitled to an answer.  This is negligence on the part of the commission who have not done their job in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the debate to go off in a tangent and into many other areas in an atmosphere of liberality in allowing Members to push a point of view, a contrary point of view if necessary.  We must not forget the fact that we have deviated in a very substantial and serious way from the simple amendment before us in respect of the words IRTC &mdash; meaning Independent Radio and Television Commission.  This should not give rise to a wide debate of the kind we are embarking on.  The Chair will have to intervene pretty rigidly and say this cannot go on.  It is a very minor amendment.  If we were to permit a wide ranging debate on it, the mind boggles as to what could happen in respect of a more substantial amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much understand your ruling and I tried to guide you in that direction earlier.  However, I should reply to the points made.  Deputy Cowen is always worth listening to in this House.  He has again made a very pertinent contribution.  Of course he is right when he says that it would be utterly wrong to exclude people who are supporters of political parties from appointments to State bodies etc.  That would be absurd.  It would be a built in reason for people not to join and support political parties.  That is manifest and I fully accept it.  In anything I have said I did not seek to reflect on the integrity of any individual member of a State board even though <Col N="1306" /> Deputy Cowen and the Minister used that expression.  I can understand that in their defence they will seek to muddy the waters.  The Minister made the point that when I was Minister I presided over a number of State bodies and made many appointments to An Post, Telecom Éireann etc.  That is true.  I can honestly say with my hand on my heart that those appointments were made irrespective of party political affiliation.  People of political affiliation were not excluded on that basis.  Indeed, I did appoint people who were Fine Gael and Labour supporters but I appointed also people who were Finna Fáil supporters.  That extended from the time of my first ministerial appointment as Minister for Justice with the appointment of the prison committees.When I became Minister they were all members of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with those who see in the amendment before the House a desire to move from an acronym, IRTC, to the words Independent Radio and Television Commission.  A certain argument can be made in favour of doing so.  I find it a remarkably rewarding artistic exercise to put myself in the position of a Minister, given the remoteness of this chance in the immediate short-term, but if I was in the Minister's position I would accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment because it addresses <Col N="1312" /> what I feel is a piece of bad drafting in the legislation.  It is very bad in legislation to use an acronym, as I said, instead of the substantive title of the commission referred to.</P>
      <P>If one were to make the transition from these capitals to the four words, Independent Radio and Television Commission, one could spend a great deal of time debating what is meant by the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  I have sympathy for the point of view being expressed by people, on this side of the House.  However I take the point being made by other Members that some following amendments come to the heart of the matter.  I am thinking here of the amendments which would allow the commission to discuss and establish a broadcasting policy but the point I wish to make is that I am not convinced that the Minister could not have accepted this amendment without accepting Deputy Mitchell's mechanism for appointing the commission.  Let me say on behalf of the Labour Party that while we can support this amendment which proposes that we change IRTC to Independent Radio and Television Commission &mdash; I am speaking entirely to the amendment as listed &mdash; we do not accept the mechanism for establishing that commission suggested by Deputy Mitchell. We believe it would raise a number of constitutional and practical issues.  My reason for rising is to indicate the Labour Party's position and to ask the Minister why he will not accept the amendment if he holds the view that it is a minimalist drafting amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very valuable point has been made by Deputy Cowen in which he contrasts people who are involved in politics with those who feel it is a merit not to be involved in politics.  I have never regarded it as a particularly good thing that one could get a round to applause by saying one was not political.  It is a mark of the good citizen to be political. I support much that Deputy Cowen says about people becoming involved in politics, whatever their political point may be.  Would he please use his influence with the Minister for Education to make sure that his children and mine will be <Col N="1313" /> able to study political and social studies in school so that we can get the involvement he speaks of?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also agree with much that Deputy Cowen and, except that I do not agree with the highminded position he ascribed to the Fianna Fáil Party indicating that they had some high-minded notions on the issue of appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some minor personal experience of that.  I have never complained about it before but I was stung by the comments of Deputy Cowen.  It is inappropriate for Deputy Cowen to raise the Fianna Fáil Party to a pinnacle as though they were whiter than white.  They are far from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was responding to a point made by Deputy Cowen and I thought it was appropriate to do so.  To come to the generality of the discussion on this issue some casual observer listening to the exchanges between the Minister and Deputy Mitchell might think there was some major ideological difference, some clash of views, in the basic intent and thrust of this Bill as between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  The truth is that on what matters in this Bill they are <i>ad idem.</i>  They both subscribe to the view that it is right and proper that RTE should have their wings clipped.  They both support the idea of commercial independents and believe they should be assisted at the expense of the State sector.  That is the reality.  That <Col N="1314" /> is why when Deputy Mitchell was Minister progress was not made.  The identical position was taken up then as now by the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>We are again getting back to the area of generalities. The amendment before me is very precise and very limited in scope, designed to provide the &ldquo;IRTC&rdquo; shall mean the Independent Radio Television Commission.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It escapes me why the Minister did not stand up before the debate began and accept the amendment. It would be in accordance with good draftsmanship to use a shortened form for the commission and this whole debate could have been sidetracked.  That would have been the appropriate and sensible thing to do.  There is a lot of good sense in the amendment and in the general <Col N="1315" /> context of draftsmanship one should make it as simple, clear and concise as possible.  Where it is possible to devise a definition by description, that should be done.  That is the purpose of a definition section.  There is a long list of items where simplifications are used for definition purposes.I do not know why there should be a difficulty about accepting this one. References to the Independent Radio and Television Commission appear a number of times in the Bill and the Minister should have accepted the amendment at the beginning.</P>
      <P>The essence of the matter is that I want to nail this myth, this nonsense, this ruse and illusion that there is any difference in the ideological structure of what is being attempted in the Bill between the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party.  If the Tallaght Strategy were still in place, as it could have been if the circumstances of the election had been different, the response of Deputy Mitchell and the Fine Gael Party on these issues would have been very different. This upfront, aggressive type of opposition which has no meaning in relation to the thrust of this Bill would not be there and there would be the same kind of shifting abstentions on votes on crucial issues that took place when the Tallaght strategy was in position.  The Fine Gael Party ought to upfront enough and honest enough to admit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It maybe unusual and unwelcome, but it is my view and that of the Labour Party and I am entitled to express it.  I am a Labour Party speaker and that is our position.  We are as entitled to put our position as the Government side or the Fine Gael side <Col N="1316" /> and to point out what the Fine Gael Party are attempting by putting in amendments like this and having them debated for hours on end.  In the days of the Tallaght Strategy this kind of ruse would not have been put forward or argued at length in that way and when voting time came up the response of the Fine Gael Party would have been to abstain on it as they did then.</P>

For Deputy Taylor's information, let me say that was achieved by the Tallaght strategy.

      <P>The Workers' Party do not agree to the inclusion of section 1 as it is currently drafted.  The Workers' Party are opposed to the Minister's proposal to cap RTE advertising and our amendment sought to restrict his attack on the promotional material resources used by RTE to promote their commercial activities.  We have had a long and detailed debate on the attempts made by the Opposition to inject some reality into what the Minister is proposing in regard to the future commerciality and viability of RTE.</P>
      <P>The efforts of Fine Gael to introduce a simple and staightforward drafting amendment did not attract a favourable response from the Minister.  We have not had a good introduction to the Committee Stage debate because the Minister is unresponsive.  Efforts were made by Opposition Members to try to understand the Minister's intentions in regard to this issue.  I am referring in particular to future funding that will be affected by the advertising capacity of RTE once the Bill has been passed.  I should like to repeat the questions I put in relation to advertising.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been acceptance by both sides of the House that the House ranged too wide in regard to the amendments we disposed of.  Is the Deputy suggesting that we should proceed to do the same again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised if the Deputy was suggesting that.  I should like to ask him to confine his remarks to section 1 which refers to definitions.  We will be happy to listen to him on that section but we do not want a rehash of something that has been rejected and, as admitted by both sides, <Col N="1323" /> did not appeal to anybody.  The Deputy should let us have something new and relevant to definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Chair has missed my point.  I was attempting to indicate the reason The Workers' Party will be opposing section 1.  The section does not contain the definition of the concept of advertising which we sought to include.  The decision of the House was that the section should not include the definiation and it is clear that that decision came from the lead of the Minister who considered it inappropriate.  The Minister said that the reason he would not be prepared to include a definiation of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;, why he would like to keep matters fluid, was that there were so many issues to be teased out.  He said that this would be done in section 5 (3) which states that the Minister shall consult the Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission when drawing up or amending a code relating to such matters as advertising.  Will the Minister indicate his concept of consultation?To what extent will the Minister be guided by the views of the commission or the Authority?</P>
      <P>There was great play some years ago on whether a previous Government had given an undertaking to a national organisation representing tenants to negotiate or consult with them.  We were given a good lesson in the House on the substantial difference between the idea of negotiating on the one hand and consulting on the other hand.  I would like an indication from the Minister of the extent to which the concept of consultation will apply.  Will the Minister adopt the attitude that he will not be bound by or guided by the views of the Independent Radio and Television Commission or the Authority in regard to advertising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate I raised a question with the Minister in regard to sponsorship.  The Minister will recall our discussion on a particular programme about the impact and importance of section 20 (8) of the 1960 Act.  I asked for guidance on the extent to which an <Col N="1324" /> activity or a programme that would carry reference to its sponsor would be in its entirety an act of sponsorship or whether those segments within the programme that acknowledged sponsorship would be the time computed for the purposes of advertising.  That question has not been answered.</P>
    <P>In regard to cross-service promotions, I asked the Minister why he announced on Second Stage that he intended to deal with this matter and why should the Authority be denied the right to use in an unfettered way their own resources to promote their own services.  The point was made that the print media had canvassed the Minister on this.  In fact, the prind media actively engage in cross-services promotion and enjoys the licence fee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will be happy to give it in the hope that it will be taken as given.  On Second Stage any Member is entitled to refer to what is in the Bill or what, in his or her opinion should be in it but on Committee Stage a Deputy is entitled to refer only to what is in the Bill.  Taking the Committee Stage formally we should proceed through the <Col N="1325" /> section line by line and that is stated in Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed and unhappy with the section as it now stands because it does not adequately deal with what is required of the legislation in regard to the section in the general sense which I indicated.  I am also dissatisfied with the section because fundamental questions on important areas of the legislation were not answered by the Minister. For that reason, the need for the insertions in the section is stronger.  Because the debate and the Minister's responses have been so unclear and do not help me to understand the legislation in depth, I am not happy to support section 1. However, I will leave it for the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party are opposed to this section because of its obvious major defects.  The section outlines in some detail a number of issues ranging from the 1926 Act and the Principal Act of 1960 to the subsequent Acts in relation to broadcasting.  However, the section lacks a clear definition in relation to advertising in particular and we have had a detailed debate in the House in that regard.  There have been positive and constructive contributions but, unfortunately, the Minister's response has been very inadequate.  He talked about leaving it to commonsense.  Whose commonsense?Is it that of the Minister, the Department, departmental officials, the Broadcasting Authority or the Commission?So much has been left unsaid that the Bill is very unsatisfactory.  Section 20 (8) of the 1960 Act is interesting, it says that &ldquo;advertisements&rdquo; shall be construed as including references to advertising matter and sponsored programmes.  This is significant as it goes on to refer to programmes supplied for advertising purposes by or on behalf of an advertiser.  There has been no clear definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; from the Minister.We are expected to accept that, as a matter of common sense, someone will interpret the various Acts which have preceded this Bill but that is not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various solid proposals were put before the House by a number of speakers and I hope that the Minister is in a <Col N="1328" /> position to give an indication to the House that he will put down amendments on Report Stage in line with those tabled on Committee Stage in relation to advertising and the IRTC.  The Minister cannot ignore the points put before the House in relation to both these amendments as they are relevant and important.  The public in general are concerned about this matter and the Minister should respond to this on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister has adopted such a stemrolling attitude to the amendments because they are in the interests of unbiased broadcasting and the general public.  It is very important in a democratic State to have an independent radio and television commission which can monitor our broadcasting system.  The Government's response has been inappropriate and dogmatic and should be condemned by the House.  Fine Gael cannot support this section and I again ask the Minister to introduce amendments along these lines on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If necessary, I will mention the various Acts cited in the section.  The purpose of this Bill is the first question the House will have to address. The most striking feature of the Bill is the Minister's admission that there are major flaws in it.  The fact that there are so many amendments in the Minister's name which pre-dated any discussion on the Bill proves beyond doubt that the Minister had erred in a major way.</P>
      <P>I will now refer to the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  The question I should like to ask is why was it necessary to introduce this Bill since it was the same Minister who, in 1988, introduced the Radio and Television Act and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already acknowledged that the Minister was successful in taking the pirate radio stations off the air, which was done under the provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  It should be stated that the same result could have been achieved under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, <Col N="1329" /> 1926, had the Minister so desired.  But the Minister needed the Radio and Television Act of 1988 to provide for the replacement of the pirate stations which was done through the granting of licences to local commercial stations.  Again I am referring to the 1988 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, this is to help the House.  We are in the process of making laws.  If I may be allowed, in concluding, I will refer to the explanatory and financial memoranda.  The community care included in the legislation has largely been ignored despite the fact that so many community broadcasting organisations have made application to the commission.  Again I refer to the Radio and Television Act, 1988, referred to in section 1.  In recent days I read that at long last the commission will process these applications.  Therefore, perhaps my remarks in the course of the no confidence debate in the Minister had some effect after all.  At every given opportunity the Minister has informed the House of what he achieved in 1988, how he brought order into broadcasting, how efficiently it was running.  That contention is indeed open to question.  If that were the case one might well ask why is it necessary to introduce another Broadcasting Bill two years later?  Who was the capitalist in this instance?  I would suggest that the Minister, having created a monster in 1988, then proceeded to try to cover up his tracks with an instrument <Col N="1330" /> that has proved to be faulty already, the Bill now before the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, I am sorry, but the fact that there is reference to those in the interpretation section does not give the Deputy licence &mdash; as he and every other Deputy knows &mdash; to embark on criticisms of a particular Act or, indeed, criticism of the Minister in respect of any such Act.  There will be later sections on which that may be appropriate but it is not appropriate on this section.  Again I ask Deputy O'Sullivan why can he not retain what he is understandably anxious to say and make it relevant to sections we will meet presently when he will not have the frustration of having the Chair remind him that he is not in order.  That is the proposition that the Chair puts to the Deputy.</P>

      <Col N="1331" /> An Act to make further provision in relation to broadcasting and wireless telegraphy and for this purpose to amend the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1979...</P>
    <P>The key phrase there is &ldquo;to make further provision&rdquo; and anything we would suggest, say or do would be in furtherance of the Bill before the House.  Therefore, I would respectfully suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on a point of order, in relation to the Standing Orders of this House, in so far as they refer to a Committee Stage of a Bill, at this stage the issue to be decided &mdash; amendments having been disposed of &mdash; is the question of the adequacy of section 1 which contains the major definitions.  The issue that this House has to be free to consider and discuss is the adequacy of the definition section of the Bill in view of the fact that the succeeding sections are dependent on it.  Therefore, it seems to me that the notion that one could, for example, have to be confined to the text of section 1 is a very narrow interpretation of the Standing Order in relation to the handling of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is an intelligent Deputy.  He has a copy of the Bill and of section 1.  If in his opinion &mdash; having examined and studied the section &mdash; it was inadequate he had ample time to apply himself to that correction.  In so far as, for whatever reason, he did not do it he cannot take that licence unto himself now.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I would submit this to you, with all due respect, that when a Deputy stands up in this House and tells the House that he has come to a very serious decision and is going to oppose a section &mdash; in this case section 1 &mdash; the Deputy, under Standing Orders and in common sense, is entitled to explain to the House for what reason he is opposing the section.  One cannot just stand up and say I am opposing it. One has to say why one is opposing it, what is the matter with it &mdash; it falls short, there is something in it one does not like, or there should be something in it which is not included.  That is completely relatable to subsequent sections of the Bill.  That is the essence of a definition section.  It is meaningless standing alone.  It takes on any relevance or meaning only when connected to those words, which are in the definition section, which appear throughout the entire length of the Bill.</P>

      <P>My point of order is very simple.  In the time I have been in this House the procedure has usually been that when a Deputy from either side of the House departs from the Standing Orders and precedent of the House, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Ceann Comhairle or chairman in possession at the time indicates such to the Deputy.  As somebody who respects the Chair of the House, I have been frequently in that position.  The Standing Orders and precedents you quote &mdash; and you are entitled to quote them&mdash;require the Deputy to comply with the orders of the Chair at that time, but what one cannot do is to <Col N="1343" /> say that from the history of the Deputy's previous contribution one can anticipate what he or she is going to say.  It is not envisaged in the Standing Orders or in precedent that the Chair should address a Deputy before he or she speaks and say: &ldquo;I need an assurance before I allow you to continue&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan, it is not the practice, nor is it accepted by occupants of the Chair, that any Member points the finger at the Chair.  I would say to Deputy McCartan that if he is uncomfortable he has the remedy in his two feet: he can leave the House.  The Deputy will not talk me out of this Chair.  I will ask you to leave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be helpful if we returned to the precedent that has been established of accepting rulings at the time and of the normal discourse that exists between Members. With the greatest respect, Sir, may I say it is not helped by remarks that one has heard enough or by saying, for example, that a Deputy is an intelligent Deputy &mdash; I respect the intelligence of every Members of this House &mdash; neither is it helped by drawing distinctions between new Deputies and long-established Deputies.

      <P>I will proceed.  By any standard two years is a very short period in the lifetime of any piece of legislation compared with the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, which is mentioned in section 1, which has stood the test of time, and still remains the cornerstone on which all subsequent broadcasting legislation was based; likewise the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which is also referred to in section 1 and referred to in this Bill as the Principal Act.  It could be said that both have stood the test of time, they have worn well.  Compare the <Col N="1348" /> Minister's creation of the 1988 Bill with the Acts of 1926 and 1960 and you have a fair measure of how effective this man has been as Minister for Communications.If you need further evidence of the Minister's performance in communications let us examine the Broadcasting Bill, 1990, and section 1, which we are now discussing.</P>
      <P>This document was presented by the Minister on 30 May 1990 and already has been extensively amended by the Minister in less than one month.  The contents of these amendments were known to the Members before this Bill was actually circulated.  The proper course that should have been adopted was to redraft the Bill before its circulation but the Minister refused to do this.  The result is that we have a hodge-podge which we are now trying to put into some form or shape.</P>

      <P>I would like now to refer to the explanatory memorandum which is central to this discussion.  This debate has received extensive media coverage, some good, some informed and some biased, but for me the most telling observation was made on Saturday last by Dick Walsh in the <i>Irish Press.</i> In one sentence he sized up what the objectives of the Bill are.  He stated that &ldquo;It is about technological development, the control of communications such as the microwave transmission systems now in their infancy and the power which such control will vest in those who wield it&rdquo;. <Col N="1349" /> That is the most significant statement made about broadcasting in the nine years I have been a Member of this House.  That is the long-term objective and, with all due respect, all other considerations are of little importance.  I will refer to that later in the debate as I have no doubt I will have an opportunity to do so on the many sections yet to be discussed.</P>

It would seem there is an obvious need to bring forward a consolidation Act.  The section states, at line 20, that &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; means Radio Telefís Éireann.  Listening to this debate and the Minister trying to defend what he has done one may think &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; means Mr. Burke's Authority or the Fianna Fáil Authority.</P>

      <P>We have to interpret what the section means.  I know that the Minister is the Minister for Justice and Communications.The Minister for <Col N="1350" /> Communications and Justice who recently appointed the Authority, which according to section 1 means Radio Telefís Éireann, has indicated that he will recommend to the Authority that they do certain things.  This would seem to suggest that the Authority will do what he wants them to do.  It is my understanding that it is the function of Radio Telefís Éireann to broadcast the programmes as laid down and not programmes the Minister may ask the Authority to broadcast. It is quite difficult to interpret this section in the way the Minister expects us to interpret it.  I respectfully suggest that a consolidation Act be brought forward to avoid confusion.  I am totally confused by the way in which this section is drafted.</P>

      <P>I can assure you, Sir, that you will have my co-operation, which you requested from all the Members of the House.  I very much share your concern about what took place earlier this evening, which was entirely avoidable.  I do not want to go over old ground now but it is deeply regrettable and I will leave it to the public and the commentators when they read the record to decide on the source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to line 20, there appears to be a real difficulty with definitions.  The section states, at line 20, that &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; means Radio Telefís Éireann.  The question which arises is whether this means the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority, Radio Telefís Éireann as a corporate entity or Radio Telefís Éireann in terms of its staff and their activities.  I will be amenable to the House if the Minister says, for example, that he will clarify this matter on Report Stage.  One of the references he might make is that, given the references to the Acts of 1926, 1966 <Col N="1351" /> and 1976, this matter is taken care of but that would not deal with the question adequately.  For example, section 1 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 states that &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; has the meaning specified in section 3 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>There shall, by virtue of this section, be established on the establishment day an authority to be known as Radio Éireann (in this Act referred to as the Authority).</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue and be sued in its corporate name and to acquire, hold and dispose of land.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of that Act deals with the members of the Authority.  On the question of definition, even in its very narrow sense, we are encountering once again looseness in drafting which would seem to indicate that the Bill was hastily prepared, with the result that one is left with the Acts of 1926, 1966 and 1976 and an unspecified term, even in relation to the principal victim of the legislation, Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other pieces of language in the section that one could easily refer to.  For example, subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>A reference in this Act to a section is a reference to a section of this Act, unless it is indicated that a reference to some other enactment is intended.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make life difficult for you, Ceann Comhairle, but I have to say when the Bill was introduced the definition section referred to the Bill as initiated.  It could not have anticipated the Minister changing the text.  Therefore the question that must be asked is how adequate is the section as an introduction to the sections which succeed and how adequate are the terms used in section 1?</P>
    <P>We should make progress on important amendments.  The Labour Party are opposed to the section because of its total inadequacy.  The amendment to define <Col N="1352" />&ldquo;broadcasting&rdquo;, which we supported, has now been decided.  What comes before the House for decision is whether we should accept this section.  We will oppose it because of the failure to define &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; which is at the heart of the debate and because of the sheer sloppiness of the drafting of the terms and the failure to relate adequately to the legislation which has been referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given notice that the section is inadequate and deficient in certain definitions that should be added to it.  I hope that will be taken note of, if and when we come to Report Stage and I table amendments.  There is need for clarity.</P>
      <P>Apart from the substance of the Bill, there is poor drafting and in normal circumstances the Committee Stage would be used to improve it.  Both amendments would have improved the drafting.  There should be far more extensive definitions and parts of other sections could have been better drafted if definitions of phrases had been used.</P>

      <P>Earlier I raised specific questions with the Minister because of the absence from this section of any definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  I have two very brief questions.  The Minister will recall speaking on Second Stage about unfair practices, if not abuses, in RTE. For the information of this House and of RTE, we should know exactly what is being talked about and I ask for some indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final issue related to the outdoor activities, particularly of 2FM.  I refer for example to Roadcaster or the Dublin marathon.  Do they come within the Minister's concept of sponsorship?  Would their duration be taken into account for time purposes within the limits of advertising?The Minister correctly drew our attention to the fact that section 20 (8) of the Principal Act would seem to suggest that sponsorship of that nature can be part of the definition of advertising.  Perhaps the Minister will address those remaining points in the ensuing debate. <Col N="1353" /> I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity of raising these points.</P>

      <P>I will be brief and relevant to the section.  Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Michael D. Higgins faoin Údarás.  The Authority means Raidió Teilifís Éireann. Má Chuirtear i nGaeilge é, agus dá mbeadh leagan Gaeilge againn ar an mBille seo, bheimis ag rá gurb é an tÚdarás Raidió Teilifís Éireann, ach is é an t-ainm atá ar an Údarás ná Údarás Raidió Teilifís Éireann.  The Authority means Raidió Teilifís Éireann Authority.</P>
      <P>It is stated that &ldquo;The Authority&rdquo; means Radio Telefís Éireann.  It is quite important that the Minister takes this on board and amend on Report Stage.  Legally it is a very inaccurate definition which would not be appropriate in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;licensee&rdquo; is explained in detail but the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is not defined.  We are told that it is the same definition as in the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraph Act, 1988.  I do not have that Act and I am not a good interpreter of legal documents.  I should like to have the Minister's interpretation of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, which also is not defined here but which is defined in the other Act.  This will be coming up in sections 10 and 11.  It is important that these words be clearly defined at an early stage.  We should know whether &ldquo;owner&rdquo; means the ground rent owner or the beneficial owner.  Could an open space or a handball alley be a premises?  It is possible to operate from open spaces that may not be defined as premises.  The Minister should explain in detail what he means by both words.  I would ask him to take note of the point about the Authority.The definition is not adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 calls into question the words or expressions selected by the parliamentary draftsman to be specifically defined.  One wonders on what basis this is done.  Does it relate to the number of times the word appears in the body of the Bill?  If the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; appeared only once it would not warrant a special interpretation such as <Col N="1354" /> we have in section 1.  The number of times a word appears is clearly an important factor.  When we were debating Deputy Mitchell's amendment, the Minister said it did not warrant a specific interpretation because he said the expression &ldquo;Independent Radio and Television Commission&rdquo; appears only three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is anticipating what may happen to later sections. It is not correct to say the expression appears only three times.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission are given a clear expression in the Bill without an interpretation provision having been applied.  Surely section 1 must be defective by reason of the fact that the Bill is using an abbreviation for the Independent Radio and Television Commission without dealing with it in section 1.  To be specific, I refer to page 4, line 29, where the Independent Radio Television Commission are referred to as &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;.  I presume that when the Bill mentions &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo; it means the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The word &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; appears at line 44 on the same page and at line 9 on page 5.  The Bill uses the expression &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo; at least three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it not be appropriate, essential and necessary to have within the interpretation section the provision that the expression &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo; means the Independent Radio and Television Commission if that is what it means.  Some clarification on that point is called for. Either we have interpretation provisions or we do not.  I find it strange that the Minister was at pains to point out, on Deputy Mitchell's amendment that it was necessary to put in <Col N="1355" /> any interpretation clause for the Independent Radio and Television Commission, yet in the Bill itself on at least three occasions an abbreviation is used. Why is he using an abbreviation if he feels an abbreviation is not necessary at all?</P>
    <P>It has always puzzled me that the first section of many Bills contains this interpretation clause in which many expressions are set out and interpreted, yet later on in a Bill one finds that an expression which logically ought to be in section 1 is taken out of context completely and put into a different section altogether.  For example, in this Bill we find that on page 10, section 16 (3), an interpretation is provided where the term &ldquo;encrypted programme transmission&rdquo; is given a special definition.  For the life of me I do not understand why that definition is not included with all the rest in section 1.  Why is one definition taken out and put into a different section altogether?There ought to be a logic about these things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Following from the point Deputy Taylor made, I pointed out when discussing the amendment I tabled that there are two commissions in the broadcasting field.  There is the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Independent Radio and Television Commission and referring to &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo; can be confusing especially when in subsequent amendments another commission is proposed by The Workers' Party, a commission to look into the future of broadcasting.  It becomes very confusing.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, as indicated in the Title to the Bill, a Bill to amend, among other things, the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1979.  Section 4 of the 1976 Act provides that the following section shall be inserted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>18.A &mdash; (1)  Not later than the 31st day of March, 1977 there shall be established by the Government, on the request of the Minister, a body to be known as the Broadcasting Complaints <Col N="1356" /> Commission and which is in this Act referred to as the Commission.</P>
    <P>It highlights the sloppiness of the way the legislation has been drafted by the Minister.  There is a requirement to elaborate on this definition section on Report Stage to distinguish between the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, the Independent Radio and Television Commission and any other commission who may be set up to look into the future of broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and try to relevant to the Bill.  There has been a long debate on the definition section, which is the first section of the Bill, and many Deputies might find it unusual that the definition section, which often in Bills is passed on the nod, is assumed to be all-encompassing.That is not always the case.  We had a very long debate on the Child Care Bill on the definition section, such is the importance of definitions for the whole import of the Bill.  The contributions you, Sir, have heard over the last hour have highlighted in very great detail the importance of the definition section, first, seeking that all the terms that may be ambiguous and may need clarity or might be confusing would be spelled out in clear detail at the beginning of the Bill.  Many Deputies have found ranges of anomalies where phrases, words and sentences have occured later on in the Bill that are not defined and would simply be a cause of confusion should the Bill be enacted as it is drafted currently.  The other difficulty with definitions is in relation to the omissions from the definition section.  Phrases that occur are simply omitted altogether from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For both those reasons the case has been strongly and irrefutably made that the definition section as drafted and as before us could not be supported.  The Minister must accept those ponts at this stage and I ask him to say if he is going to insist on pushing the Bill tonight that at least it will come back on Report Stage with his own amendments to encompass definitions of phrases that are omitted <Col N="1357" /> and give clarity to phrases that are included but are obviously ambiguous.</P>
    <P>The very first definition included refers to the Act of 1926.  One is struck by the fact that so many years have elapsed yet this legislation has been found worthy of that passage of time without serious amendment, except for the Radio and Television Act, 1988.</P>

      <P>True.  I am drawing a comparison between the longevity of the original Act of 1926 and the short-lived Act of 1988, which needed amendment so recently.  I do not want to be repetitive. I want to lend weight and support to two Deputies who have referred so far to the difficulty in relation to the fourth definition, the definition of &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; meaning Radio Telefis Éireann. Deputy Mac Giolla explained as Gaeilge the difficulties that would arise had there been a leagan Gaeilge of the legislation and under-scored and underlined clearly that there is a need for an improvement <Col N="1358" /> in this section lest there be a misunderstanding subsequently.  I do not want to touch on the many points that have been made, but for all those reasons there is a very clear and cogent case made for the Opposition to take an opposing line on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say just a few sentences in elaboration of the point introduced by myself and extended by Deputy Mac Giolla.  I will be perfectly satisfied if the Minister indicates this can be clarified on Report Stage.  There is an additional difficulty in relation to the use of &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo; in this section where reference is made to the 1960 Act.  The 1960 Act has been succeeded by the establishment of, let us say, Údarás Raidió na Gaeltachta who are the Raidió na Gaeltachta Authority.  There are several problems involved in relation to the question of drafting this Bill.  When this Bill is translated into Irish it will be the definitive legal document.  We have been down this road before now.  In the Rape Bill the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; was translated inadequately as acts of violence against women, the assumption being that you could not have rape other than against the female sex.  I am not interested in that but I am interested in this question of &ldquo;the Authority&rdquo;.  It is absolutely important that the Bill specify in the later porvisions upon whom the burden of responsibility for managing or for the capped advertising will fall?  If the Bill is left as it is, things will be very vague.</P>
      <P>My simple question is whether it refers to those persons referred to and defined in the 1960 Act.  For example, does it refer to section 4 of the 1960 Act, which specifies the method and procedure of appointment of members of the Authority?Does the burden of this proposed legislation fall on the members whose method of membership, whose form of holding office and whose method of removal from office are specified in the 1960 legislation?  Does it fall in some other way on RTE as a body of workers or does it fall on an individual decision-maker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the basic Act establishing RTE this <Col N="1359" /> question is not addressed and there is no provision in that Act for the devolution of responsibility, and there is no such linkage established either in the Act of 1976.  The linkage between the 1960 Act and the 1976 Act does not afford the Minister an answer to the question that is being put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Mac Giolla on the definition of owner, &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is defined in the 1988 Act as:</P>
      <P>(a)  a person, other than a mortgagee not in possession, who, whether in his own right or as a trustee or agent for any other person, is entitled to receive the rack rent of the premises or, where the premises are not let at a rack rent, would be so entitled if they were so let, whether the interest of the person is held solely jointly or severally, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a lessee or occupier, whether the lease is held or the occupier is in occupation solely, jointly or severally;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Owner&rdquo; has the same meaning-definition for this Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general drafting of the legislation, I do not accept the Deputies' points on the drafting and they can be assured that my officials have fully satisfied themselves on the appropriateness of the various references with the legal advisers of the Attorney General's Office in the normal way and we have stamped copies of the legislation.  In relation to the use of the word &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; as an abbreviation, it is used where it is clear from the context in which it is being referred to, as is the case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the point made by <Col N="1360" /> Deputy Higgins and again by Deputy Mac Giolla on the Authority Radio Telefís Éireann, I am assured that in the 1966 Act both of these terms are interchangeable, but I would prefer to come back to the point and clarify it for the Deputies at a later stage.</P>

      <P>The omissions in section 1, the definition section, have all the hallmarks of the rushed job that the Bill is.  Several definitions are omitted and there is repetition throughout the Bill, which is sloppy draftsmanship, but that is no reflection on the parliamentary draftsmen because, if they are asked to produce Bills in a matter of hours and without proper consultation or proper cross checking, that is not their fault.  It is the fault of the Minister who tries to rush his fences and fool his colleagues in Government and make a mess of it.  This is not the first time he has done this.  We had a similar situation when he introduced a Bill in 1988.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage we will be tabling further amendments seeking to clarify the meaning of the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; and to distinguish between the IRTC and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, and also to distinguish between the Raidió na Gaeltachta Authority and the RTE Authority, and a further definition of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair I should like to share my time with Deputy McCormack.  I should like to express my sincere thanks to the Chair for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am anxious to stress the serious problems facing the sheep industry and I should like to give some background information regarding that industry.  The number of ewes here increased from 1.6 million in 1980 to 4.2 million in 1989, a rise of 160 per cent. However, the industry is now bordering on collapse and immediate action must be taken to avoid a serious disruption of it.  Farmers were encouraged by the Department, the Minister and the advisory service to get involved in sheep breeding as an alternative line of farming.  They borrowed money to erect special units and fencing and purchased modern equipment to help them cope in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The marketplace is completely overloaded with sheep meat.  We have reached a peak in Ireland and Great Britain.  We are the main suppliers to the French market accounting for 30 per cent of imports to that market.  Almost 90 per cent of our exports of sheep meat goes to the French market.  The stage has been <Col N="1366" /> reached where sheep meat is being dumped on the French market and I suggest that the EC prevent dumping on the only market that is available to us.  The EC self-sufficiency in sheep meat currently stands at about 85 per cent and there should be no reason for a collapse in the price of that product.  In 1981 the cost per ewe per annum was £11 while the gross margin in the same year was £50.  In 1988 the cost per ewe was £18 and the gross margin was £63.  In 1990 the cost per ewe is £19.50 and while it is impossible to say what the gross margin will be, it is estimated that it will be about £38.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will take into consideration fixed costs and borrowings for housing and other facilities.  In my view the net margins in many cases will be in the region of £10 per ewe and in the case of over-borrowings it will be nil or a loss.</P>
    <P>In 1981 40 kilo lambs sold in the third week of June in Enniscorthy fetched between £48.80 and £52 and in 1987 in the third week in June at the mart in Enniscorthy 40 kilo lambs were sold at between £44 and £47.  In the third week in June this year a 40 kilo lamb fetched between £34.50 and £37.  I understand there was a further reduction of £2 in the price last week.  Some of the lambs were sold at the low price of £31.</P>
    <P>The price of wool has fallen from 80p per pound three years ago to approximately 27p or 30p per pound this year. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that steps will be taken to rectify this imbalance.  In this regard we must immediately suspend New Zealand imports to the EC for three months to allow the market to absorb the present over-supply.  New Zealand are allowed to export 200,000 tonnes of sheep meat to the EC.  I accept that this is a GATT agreement which cannot be broken but, at certain times of the year, we should seek derogation from this rule.  The EC is merely a dumping ground for New Zealand and the only way to rectify the situation is to suspend the importation of lamb for about three months.  There should be an early payment of premiums for ewes. The Department is computerised and I <Col N="1367" /> appeal to the Minister of State to pay the premiums now instead of over the next four to five weeks.  Some of these premiums will not be paid until next December, which will cause difficulty in relation to cash flow for farmers.</P>
    <P>We should also put the APS scheme into operation.  If the scheme is not put into operation we just fill up the cold rooms which have to be emptied at a later stage with the resultant flooding of the market.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made that we should give aid to Iran on humanitarian grounds. It would be a very good idea to send them sheepmeat as they are short of food.  The Minister should also ensure that the ewe premium for the 1991 season will compensate for the losses this year and I understand that there is provision in the regulations for this.  If the marketplace deteriorates further, adequate provision will not be made for winter feed resulting in high mortality in the ewe of flock. Action must be taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>I appeal to factory owners not to take advantage of the present situation, to share profits with the producers and to remember that they have a great interest in the sheep industry.  Sharing the profits and cushioning the financial losses to the producer will benefit everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister &mdash; through the Minister of State &mdash; whether he has any concept of the crisis facing farmers, particularly the small family farm?  In County Galway &mdash; in my constituency &mdash; small and medium sized farmers depend on sheep and lamb production.  My county is the most intensive sheep producing county in the country and the income of the farmers involved has been completely eroded this year.  It would be a slight help if the 1989 headage payment was made because lamb prices have dropped to 80p per kilo, in other words £25 per head less than this time last year.  What other section of the community would put up with this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Athenry mart last Monday, ewes were sold at £17 per head.  That was a despairing act by the farmers and a vote <Col N="1368" /> of no confidence in the future of the sheep industry and lamb production.  Those farmers are being forced to abandon their sheep enterprise and, as lowland sheep are making so little, what chance will mountain sheep producers have with the opening season in Maam Cross on Saturday?They will get practically nothing for their lambs this year.  Will the Minister stand idly by while despair and frustration build up in the farming community?  Will he also stand idly by while rural areas are depopulated and the whole fabric of society is irreversibly wiped out?  In the meantime, three factories, Goodman, Kepak and Halal, have formed a cartel which is controlling the price of sheep. Farmer producer groups are forced to supply lambs to those factories at give away prices.  Shame on the Minister and the Government for allowing this. Farmers and their families are being devastated but, if they apply for the dole or medical card, they are refused on the grounds that their income is over the eligibility level.  The guidelines in this regard were fixed in April 1989 and they were based on the farm income of 1988.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to <Col N="1369" /> the motion put down by Deputy D'Arcy regarding the difficulties facing the sheepmeat sector.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years sheep production has proven to be a very profitable enterprise as evidenced by the enormous expansion in sheep numbers which, on the basis of the latest available statistics, are at present at a level of 7.7 million head, an increase of approximately 1.1 million head over the previous year.  Our current breeding flock stands at 4.5 million head, an increase of 0.5 million head on the previous year.  This expansion in numbers was helped by obtaining a strong foothold in the valuable French market, the main export market for sheepmeat, and by assured Community support arrangements by way of the ewe premium and headage payments.  In 1989 alone, 48,000 producers were in receipt of some £70 million in direct payments under the ewe premium scheme and some 26,000 producers received £14 million under the sheep headage scheme.</P>
      <P>The current difficult market situation in relation to sheepmeat prices is due to a number of factors, including the advantage to British lamb exports to the French market caused by the drop in the value of sterling <i>vis-á-vis</i> the French franc, the lower level of clawback on British lamb exports and increased slaughterings both here and in Britain leading to increased supplies on the market.  The cumulative export slaughtering figure for Ireland for this year to the week ending 16 June is up 31 per cent on 1989 with the figure for May showing a 43 per cent increase on the same month last year.</P>
      <P>The price of wool and skins fluctuates from time to time but is dictated by supply and demand on world markets. The international wool and skin prices are unduly low at present but good returns were achieved in 1988 and in most of 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 ewe premium will, however, help to compensate Irish producers for income loss sustained this year.  Indeed in 1990, producers will receive a once-off additional payment arising from changes in payment procedures.  As a result of these changes the following payments per <Col N="1370" /> eligible ewe will begin in July: the advance of £6.53 which is the first instalment (30 per cent) of the 1990 premium for all areas; the £8.25 balance of the 1989 premium in disadvantaged areas; and the full 1989 premium of £17.75 in all other areas.  Payment of a further advance of 30 per cent of the 1990 premium will commence in December with the balance to be paid in March 1991.</P>
    <P>The estimated total benefit of the ewe premium to Irish producers in 1990 will amount to some £130 million as compared to a normal annual figure of £70 million to £80 million.  Headage payments will also amount to £14 million.  In addition, as part of the EC prices package, an additional payment of about £3.40 per ewe will be paid from 1991 onwards for all eligible ewes to beneficiaries in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>These substantial payments will be of considerable assistance to producers especially in the context of cash flow problems as a result of the current difficult market situation.</P>
    <P>The common organisation of the market for the sheepmeat sector provides for private storage aid arrangements. Monthly tenders have been in operation since the beginning of this year for those regions of the Community where prices fall below the 70 per cent benchmark level.  The private storage arrangements provides a safety mechanism for the sector.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures CBF's export market development and promotion programme in 1990 will continue to be concentrated on moving more of our lamb sales into higher priced outlets.Promotional campaigns will continue to emphasise the grass-based method of production and the improvements in quality which have taken place since the introduction of the code of practice. It is vital that we continue to make every effort to improve product quality in the years ahead if we are to remain competitive and increase our share of the premium export markets in Europe.  In this connection the Department, in co-operation with the Pedigree Sheep Breed Societies, are continuing to expand the <Col N="1371" />&ldquo;lean meat improvement programme&rdquo; in pedigree flocks to help improve carcase quality.</P>
    <P>A CBF-sponsored campaign to promote lamb on the home market was launched recently.  This campaign highlights lamb as a natural product which is now of particularly good value.  Indications of the response to this campaign are very positive with consumption of lamb in Ireland showing a considerable increase.</P>
    <P>All of these measures should be of considerable assistance in providing stability in the lamb market both now and in the future.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas pearsanta a ghabháil leat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an seans a thug tú dom an cás seo a thógáil.  Tá práinn ag baint leis an chás seo, mar is cuimhin liom go raibh seans againn an rud a phlé nuair a bhí an Teach ag imeacht ar athló, an 4 Bealtaine 1989, agus tá tagairt déanta dó sin sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil, colún 1394, Imleabhar 389.  Ag deireadh na díospóireachta ar an ócáid sin, dúirt an tAire Stáit ag an Roinn Oideachais, an Teachta Fahey: &ldquo;I agree completely with the Deputy in the case he has made in regard to this school.&rdquo;  Agus téann sé ar aghaidh:</P>
      <P>The facilities in all the technical subject rooms are obsolete.  I accept that many of the science subjects are taught in general subject rooms.  Physics and chemistry are taught in classrooms that do not have any facility for practical work.  French is being taught in the metalwork room.  In general, the accommodation in this school is grossly inadequate.  We have reached tender stage, but while I am anxious to accede to the Deputy's request to put the project out to tender, it is not possible for me to do so, or to say when we will be able to take the next step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa mhí chéanna thug an tAire Stáit le <Col N="1372" /> tuiscint do na tuismitheoirí go mbeadh na feabhsúcháin ar an scoil ar siúl, sin an 4 Bealtaine 1989.  Ina dhiaidh sin, sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil de 27 Márta 1990, ag colún 1217, imleabhar 397, chuir mé ceist, Uimh.  175, ar an Aire Oideachais agus dúirt sí:</P>
    <P>Chomh luath is a bheidh an t-athbhreithniú críochnaithe, tiocfar ar bhreith maidir le hiarratas tógála na scoile.</P>
    <P>Is é sin an gheallúint a bhí tugtha ag an Aire Stáit do na tuismitheoirí agus do na múinteoirí, go mbeadh na feabhsúcháin curtha i gcrích.  Ní raibh said ann i mí na Márta 1990.  Bhí cruinniú againn go léir leis na tuismitheoirí agus le muintir na háite roimhe sin i 1989.  Ar an 5 Nollaig 1989, scríobh cathaoirleach thuismitheoirí Ghairmscoil Cholmchille chuig an Uasal Cathal Ó hEochaidh, Aire na Gaeltachta:</P>
    <P>A Aire Uasail,</P>
    <P>Mar is eol duit, bhí cruinniú ag an gCoiste Tuismitheoirí leis an Aire, Proinsias Ó Fathaigh, TD, fé dhó agus freisin, fé dhó, leis an Aire Oideachais maidir le leathnú na gairmscoile thuasluaite.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin, tá an-imní fós ar na tuismitheoirí go léir maidir leis an éiginnteacht a bhaineann leis an gcás seo uilig.</P>
    <P>Mar sin is uile, iarraimid anois ortsa agus ar Aire an Oideachais, Máire Bn. Uí Ruairc, TD, comh-chruinniú a shocrú idir an Coiste Tuismitheoirí agus an bheirt Aire, Aire na Gaeltachta agus Aire an Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Bheadh muid an-bhuíoch as ucht seo a chur ar fáil dúinn chomh luath agus is féidir, ach é bheith roimh an Nollaig.</P>
    <P>Mise le meas,</P>
    <P>Ruaidhrí Ó Tuathail.</P>
    <P>Táimid ag caint faoi láthair faoi scoil, an t-aon ghairmscoil i gcroí na Gaeltachta, áit inar tógadh Máirtín Ó Cadhain, mar shampla, agus sa scoil sin níl ach trí leithreas chun freastal ar chéad cailín agus seachtar banmhúinteoirí, agus trí leithreas chun freastal ar chéad buachaill agus ochtar fear.  Baintear úsáid <Col N="1373" /> as an leithreas mar sheomra cótaí; níl aon seomra gléasta do bhuachaillí ná cailíní. Chomh maith leis sin, tá péire de na seomraí réamhdhéanta, agus tá siad fós in úsáid agus iad os cionn 20 bliain d'aois. Tá dhá sheomra ar iasacht ó Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Caithfear dul trasna phríomhbhóthar na Gaillimhe-Cois Fharraige seacht n-uaire in aghaidh an lae chun freastal ar ranganna sna seomraí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá na háiseanna sna seomraí, mar tá a fhios ag an Aire Stráit, cuid mhaith as dáta.  Níl aon chúirt chispheile ann, níl aon halla spóirt, níl seomra bia ag na scoláirí.  Tá an scoil tógtha ar acra talún agus tá contúirt anois ann go gcaillfear an talamh breise a bhí le fáil, toisc nach bhfuil aon chinneadh déanta fós an t-airgead a chaitheamh air.</P>
    <P>Tá an-phráinn ag baint leis an gcás seo agus tá sé thar am dul i mbun réiteach na ceiste.  An tábhacht atá ag baint leis ná, nuair a rinne mé teagmháil leis an Roinn Phleanála den Roinn Oideachais, dúirt siad liom ar an Luan, 18 Meitheamh, nach bhfuil aon airgead curtha ar fáil fós don scoil.  Níl haon mhaith don Aire Oideachais a rá liom go bhfuil sí sásta cruinniú a shocrú, mar shampla, idir Coiste Gairmoideachais na Gaillimhe agus an Aire Oideachais nó fiú an Aire Stáit, mar táimid bréan de chruinnithe. Ag an chruinniú roimhe thug an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Fahey, a fhocal do na tuismitheoirí go ndéanfaí an leathnú ar an scoil, chomh maith leis na feabhsúcháin atá riachtanach agus práinneach.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, tá daoine ag caint, mar shampla, faoin scoil a cheangal le meánscoil sa Spidéal.  Thug mé féin cuairt ar an scoil, agus bhí mé ag cruinniú poiblí leis na tuismitheoirí, na múinteorí agus muintir na háite.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil eolas faoi sin ag Aire Stáit Roinn na Gaeltachta féin, an Teachta Pat the Cope Gallagher, agus tá mé buíoch de as teacht isteach chun an cheist a chíoradh liom.  Is í an mhórthábhacht a bhaineann leis an scoil seo ná go bhfuil dílseacht di ag na múinteoirí, ag na tuismitheoirí, ag muintir na háite ach ní féidir an dílseacht a choinneáil léi mura dtugtar a gcearta do <Col N="1374" /> mhuintir na háite maidir leis na deisiúcháin atá práinneach agus atá riachtanach.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach leithscéal an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Fahey, a ghabháil os rud é go bhfuil sé as an tír.  Tuigim go maith na deacrachtaí atá ag cur as don scoil Ghaeltachta seo faoi láthair, go háirithe nuair atá foirgneamh breise trasna an bhóthair ón scoil féin á úsáid mar fhoirgneamh shealadach, Caithfidh mé a admháil go bhfuil sé deacair ranganna a eagrú mar gheall air sin. Ní miste a mhíniú go bhfuil sé riachtanach ag an Roinn breathnú ar na hiarratais uilig maidir le cóiríocht bhreise agus a dheimhniú go dtabharfar tosaíocht do na cásanna is mó fiúntais.</P>
      <P>Tuigtear go maith an drochdhóigh atá ar ghairmscoil Indreabháin.  Ba mhór an sochar don fhoirgneamh feachtas tógála ar bith a bheadh beartaithe dó.  Dá thairbhe sin, tuigim an fonn atá ar na húdaráis scoile, ar na múinteoirí, na tuismitheoirí agus ar na daltaí, go gcuirfí tús leis chomh luath agus is féidir.  Mar sin féin, caithfear a thuiscint go bhfuil obair bheacht, chasta le déanamh le cóiríocht bhuan a sholáthar a bheas de réir riachtanais fhoireann deartha na Roinne.  Ní miste fosta súil ghéar a choinneáil ar riachtanais chóiríochta na scoile.  Is gnách go gcuireann sin le fad an tsaothair ach ní féidir pleanáil mar is ceart a dhéanamh gan é.</P>
      <P>I gcás Indreabháin tá an phleanáil ailtireachta agus deartha curtha i gcrích chomh fada le hullmhú na mbillí cainníochtaí ach is iomaí scéim tógála eile don dara leibhéal atá ar bhealach a ndeartha agus tá forbairt gach cinn acu ag brath ar an airgead caipitil atá le fáil agus na gealltanais atá tugtha faoi dháiliú an airgid sin.  Ar an drochuair, is ar éigean gur leor an soláthar airgid do na gealltanais sin a tugadh, rud a fhágann nach féidir tógraí ar nós Indreabháin a fhorbairt mórán ag an bpointe seo.  Rud eile, an srian atá ar chaiteachas, cuireann sé iachall ar an Roinn gach tógra tógála a mheas i gcomhthéacs chúrsaí daonra gach ceantair sna blianta atá amach romhainn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin de, caithfear breathnú arís ar gach feachtas tógála, agus gairmscoil <Col N="1375" /> Indreabháin a measc, féachaint an bhfuil siad ag freagairt do na riachtanais chóiríochta atá ann san am i láthair agus a bheidh ann san am atá le teacht.  I gContae na Gaillimhe thit líon na mbreitheanna, sna blianta 1980 go dtí 1988, ó 3,637 go 2,600 nó 2,700, sin titim 25 faoin gcéad.  Tá sé seo inchurtha leis an titim i gcoitinne ar fud na tíre.  An scéal mar atá sé anois, níl cuma ar bith air go gcuirfear stad nó moill féin leis an titim sin.  Tuigfidh an Teachta, mar sin, go bhfuil sé riachtanach breathnú go cúramach ar gach feachtas caipitil agus na hathruithe sa phatrúin daonra a chur san áireamh.</P>
    <P>Tá scoil eile, Coláiste Croí Naofa, an Spidéal, atá ceithre mhíle ar shiúl, agus san abhantrach chéanna le gairmscoil Indreabháin, agus is é 484 líon na ndaltaí <Col N="1376" /> uilig sa dá áit le chéile faoi láthair.  Mar atá ráite agam, tá na huimhreacha ag laghdú faoin cheathrú cuid.  Ardaíonn seo ceist eile, an mbeadh sé cóir san fhadtéarma an dá iarbhunscoil seo a fhágáil mar atá siad agus coimhlint bhuan eatarthu faoi líon daltaí atá ag dul i laghad go rialta.  Ag amharc siar dúinn i gceann dhá scór bliain eile, abair, an mbeimis sásta gurbh é seo an réiteach ab fhearr don cheantar i dtéarmaí oideachais ó thaobh chúinsí sóisialta nó chúinsí airgid.  Tá mé cinnte go n-aontóidh an Teachta liom go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an Roinn machnamh domhain, cuimsitheach a dhéanamh ar na rudaí seo sula dtiocfaidh siad ar shocrú bhuan i leith na gairmscoile in Indreabhán.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary and, indeed, statutory duty as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.I must, therefore, respect the right of insurers to make their own underwriting decisions, including the setting of insurance premia, in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
      <P>At the request of my Department, the Irish Hotels Federation, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Confederation of Irish Industry earlier this year carried out a survey of the cost of liability insurance for their members.  The results of the survey indicate that while liability costs in the market are still quite high they have stabilised somewhat in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of insurance is substantially <Col N="1025" /> dependent on the frequency and level of claims.  In recent years insurers have sustained substantial underwriting losses on liability business.  In both 1987 and 1988 insurers incurred underwriting losses of £18 million on their liability portfolios.Data available to date suggests that these underwriting losses are likely to have increased substantially in 1989.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the industry representative bodies I referred to, will continue to monitor the level of premium applying in the market. The Government is very much aware of the impact which the price of insurance can have on all sections of the community.Initiatives, such as the Courts Act, 1988, the abolition of the Three Counsel Rule and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1988, have been taken in an effort to improve the environment for insurance.</P>
    <P>In addition, proposals to facilitate the introduction of pre-trial procedures in the High Court are being considered by the Minister for Justice in the context of the Court and Court Officers' Bill.  Such procedures could facilitate the speedier and perhaps less costly settlement of claims in personal injury cases.</P>
    <P>While the possibility of further initiatives will continue to be explored, Government action alone is not enough &mdash; it is also important that insurance proposers improve their safety standards in order to reduce the risks which are to be insured.  Discussions with both insurers and those insured to monitor progress in this area will continue.</P>

      <P>A significant State investment in industrial property is being undertaken as part of the EC supported Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1989-1993.  In 1990 the IDA will spend £17 million on their building operations activities while a further £6 million will be spent by SFADCo in those areas coming within their remit. This represents in total an increase in expenditure over 1989 of £2.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between the two agencies there is almost three and a half million square feet of vacant space nationally.  In addition, private sector developers have agreed with the IDA to provide 500,000 square feet of space with a further 160,000 square feet under negotiation. While certain towns may not have an advance factory immediately available I cannot accept in the circumstances that there is a shortage of space nationally for new industry.  I might add that in order to encourage the provision of advance factories in areas which might be less attractive to commercial developers the 1990 Finance Act extends the availability of the business expansion scheme to the <Col N="1027" /> construction and leasing of advance factories by local community groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>Consequent on the decision by the Government in 1986 to disband the National Prices Commission, the Deputies will be particularly aware that, with the exception of certain petroleum products, detailed statutory price control is no longer operated.  I feel sure the Deputies will agree that statutory price control is not, for a variety of reasons, an ideal instrument for tackling problems which inherently emanate from the shortcomings, to one extent or another, of competition legislation.  The policy of the Government is to maintain the emphasis on creating and ensuring an improved competitive environment.  To this end, I intend to introduce a new competition Bill this year.  This Bill will bring about conditions which will enable market forces to promote greater efficiency and to pass on the benefits to the consumer. This legislation will give effect, in domestic law, to provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  Anti-competitive agreements, decisions or concerted practices between undertakings trading in the State and abuses of a dominant position in the market will be prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I continue to be concerned that the consumer should benefit from the increased purchasing power of the IR£. The House will be aware that I have already taken action where specific circumstances seemed to warrant this.  For example, the attention of distributors in the food sector was drawn to the apparent disparity between the selling price of their imported food products and the UK selling price.  Subsequently a range of price <Col N="1029" /> decreases were implemented by a variety of suppliers.</P>
    <P>Ongoing selective monitoring of prices by the Department has resulted in particular distributors being requested to supply appropriate data where downward price movements have not been apparent.In this regard, Deputies will be aware that the prices of imported UK magazines have come down significantly in the last month.</P>
    <P>The House has, I am sure, noted with satisfaction the latest official figures for the consumer price index indicating that the annual rate of inflation has fallen from 4.2 per cent in mid-February to 3.5 per cent in mid-May, maintaining the downward trend evident since early this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed the view which the Deputy has noted at the Conference on Regional Policies in the European Single Market held by the Commission of the European Community's Council of Ministers, at Dublin Castle on 11 June last.  A detailed elaboration of my views is set out in the address which I delivered at the official opening of the conference &mdash; a copy of which I am making available to the Deputy and placing in the Library of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the issue of the concentration of economic activities in the more developed parts of the Community in the context of the arguments I put forward <Col N="1030" /> to support the need for more comprehensive Community regional policies as an inherent part of the movement towards a European Single Market and beyond that towards, perhaps, Economic and Monetary Union.  I made the point, in particular, in relation to the need for the continued allocation of increased and substantial resources by the Community to regional policies beyond 1993 &mdash; the end-date to which increased Structural Fund allocations have so far been agreed.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my address that, in the absence of countervailing regional policies, the result of the forces for the geographical concentration of economic activities as opposed to the forces for diffusion in a more integrated Community market would be to increase regional disparities across the Community.Such an outcome would not be favourable for Ireland.  Community regional policies, which have recently been strengthened in the context of the Single European Act, are designed to prevent such an imbalance in regional development across the Community. Ireland is benefiting significantly from the additional resources being made available under these policies to support enterprises in areas such as industry and tourism and to provide the basic infrastructure required for developmental purposes in areas such as transport, research and technological developoment, education and training and so on.</P>
    <P>A further point I made in my address is that while the recent strengthening of Community regional policies is a positive step in the right direction this must be seen as a beginning and not an end.  There is a need for the further development of regional policies and their integration with other Community policies in areas such as competition, including State aids, research and development, training and transport regulation and deregulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement giving details of the countries both within and outside the EC with which Ireland has the largest trade deficit.  This table <Col N="1034" /> also shows, for each county, the deficit as a proportion of total trade.</P>
      <P>Within the EC, Ireland has unfavourable trade balances with only two countries &mdash; the UK and Portugal.</P>
      <P>In 1989 the deficit with the UK was £131 million but this figure represented only 1 per cent of a total trade of nearly £10 billion with what is still our largest trading partner.  Furthermore, the deficit has reduced from £815 million in 1985.</P>
      <P>Exporters to the UK have at their disposal the full range of CTT services.  For example, the UK is one of the countries targeted by CTT in its Source Ireland Programme.  This programme is designed to raise awareness among British industrial buyers of Ireland as a source of industrial products.  The electronics, engineering and processing sectors in particular are being targeted.  In addition, CTT continues to arrange successful buyer airlifts from the UK which bring key buyers and agents into contact with Irish exporters.  In 1990, an introductory programme for potential Irish suppliers to the UK Home Shopping Market, which is worth £6 billion, was launched. In 1989, Irish exports to the UK increased by 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>As regards Portugal, our trade deficit has been decreasing since 1985 when it was almost £20 million.  Last year, our trade with Portugal was almost in balance with a small deficit of only £5 million. Our trade with Portugal is small but growing with exports last year showing a significant increase of 36 per cent.  This figure indicates an increasing awareness among Irish exporters of Portugal as an export market.  Last year, 25 companies were assisted to enter the Portuguese market through CTT's trade correspondent in Lisbon.  An information stand was organised at Portugal's most important agricultural trade fair.  In addition, an inward buyer airlift and a trade mission of potential Irish exporters were also organised by CTT this year.</P>
      <P>Outside, the EC, the USA and Japan are the two countries with which we have the biggest trade imbalance.  Last year, our imbalance with the US was £817 million and with Japan was £402 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> The deficit with the US is largely attributable to the high imports of US raw materials and semi-finished goods by US subsidies in Ireland.  In the US market, where exports increased by 17 per cent last year, CTT has drafted a five year plan to enable Irish exports to increase by 15 per cent each year despite expected tougher marketing conditions. The main focus will be on subsectors within the engineering, electronics and consumer product, including food, areas and will be targeted at the North Eastern region of the US.</P>
    <P>The largest imports from Japan consist of cars and electronic products.  As regards efforts to reduce the trade imbalance with Japan, these are showing good results with Irish exports up 33 per cent last year.  The recent import liberalisation programme introduced by the Japanese Government should open new opportunities for Irish companies.  CTT will be arranging another general trade mission as well as group promotions for promising sectors for 1990.  Following the Taoiseach's visit to Japan in April 1989, a committee was established between my Department and the Ministry for International Trade and Industry in Japan to strengthen trade and economic links between the two countries and this committee meets on a regular basis to ensure that institutional or operational constraints on trade are kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Ireland's trade imbalances with Taiwan, China and Hong Kong arise because of consumer goods imports. Small trade imbalances also arise from Irish imports of raw materials and basic consumer goods from other countries. Examples are Polish and Colombian coal, Finnish paper, Brazilian animal feed and wool and clothing from Turkey.  Nevertheless, Irish exports to a number of these countries showed a strong performance and in 1989 our exports increased as follows, Brazil, up 74 per cent; Finland, up 20 per cent; Turkey, up 13 per cent; Poland, up 8 per cent and Hong Kong, up 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>In all countries where we have trade imbalances, CTT continues to promote <Col N="1036" /> Irish exports through its full range of exporter services e.g. targeted marketing consultancy, market information and research, design and product development, trade missions and group promotions.</P>
    <P>In overall trade terms, Ireland's performance in 1989 was very satisfactory. Exports by Irish companies reached £14.6 billion.  There was a trade surplus of £2.3 billion and this was achieved despite an increase of 20 per cent in imports.</P>

      <P>The whole thrust of my Presidency role in the Internal Market, Industry, Trade and Research Councils has been to seek to create the basis for sustained industrial development and job creation throughout the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my capacity as President of the <Col N="1037" /> Industry Council I have sought to promote policy initiatives particularly in relation to high technology industries as well as initiatives to help small and medium sized enterprises to participate more fully in Community programmes which support industrial development such as access to public procurement and R&amp;D.</P>
    <P>Industrial policies on a Community wide basis have already been developed and applied in areas such as coal and steel, textiles and shipbuilding.</P>
    <P>Many other Community policies also impact directly on jobs and industry. These include competition policy, macroeconomic policy, international trade policy, R&amp;D, and the Internal Market programme.</P>
    <P>All of these aspects are being brought together in a working paper on industrial policy prepared by the Commission which is designed to establish the principles and framework of future EC Industrial Policy.  Discussion by the member states on this document commenced recently and I would expect conclusions to be reached from it within a short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the competitive position of Irish industry in the international marketplace has not been better for many years and is continuing to improve.</P>
      <P>This improvement is reflected in our success on world markets where our exports have risen from £10.7 billion in 1987 to £14.6 billion in 1989.  This represents an increase of 36 per cent and is a magnificent performance by any standards.</P>
      <P>Our success in breaking out of the previously damaging spiral of rising costs and lost competitiveness is due in a large measure to the Government's resolute handling of the national finances and the co-operation of the social partners in implementing the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>The effect of these measures has been to create a new economic climate conducive to growth and export development.Inflation has been reduced to a point where, at 3.5 per cent, we are now below the EC average and well below the rate in the UK our biggest single trading partner.  Interest rates are also well below those in the UK and expected to moderate further.  Our unit wage costs have moderated significantly and the cost of public utilities such as electricity, telecommunications and post have either been held at 1987 levels or have been reduced.</P>
      <P>The combined impact of progress on all these fronts has been to restore a new level of competitiveness to Irish industry and industry has responded positively as our export figures illustrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, success in the international marketplace will not be achieved solely on the basis of cost efficiency.  The modern market requires quality products, efficient delivery and overall marketing professionalism.  Under the National Programme for Industrial <Col N="1039" /> Development 1989-1993, which is being supported by EC Structural Funds, the Government has put in place a comprehensive range of measures to support Irish industry in achieving new levels of performance in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>Given the Government's firm commitment to maintaining and building on the progress achieved to date, I have every confidence that Irish industry is now positioned to achieve even greater success in the international marketplace in the future.</P>

      <P>In the course of 1990, my Department have transferred in excess of 8,600 files, i.e. almost all of the remaining registered files for the period 1922-60 to the National Archives.  A further batch of registered files, numbering under 800 and also for the period 1922-60, remain to be examined.  It is expected that many of those files will be transferred to the National Archives before the end of this year.

      <P>There are some sections of the National Museum closed at present due to the refurbishment works in progress.  These include the Furniture, <Col N="1044" /> Chinese, Historical and Egyptian galleries.They will reopen when the refurbishment is completed.  The Ceramics Room, Music Room, Textile Room and 1916 Room have been refurbished and will reopen shortly when the additional attendants being recruited have taken up duty.  The upstairs sections of the Natural History Museum are temporarily closed due to staff shortages and rostering requirements, but these will be reopened shortly.  A selection from the Folk Life Collection, Clothes and Clothing, will be exhibited in the main gallery at Kildare Street in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>During the summer season, it is intended to have pottery demonstrations and music at weekends.  It is also hoped that the museum shop will become fully operational shortly.</P>
      <P>A number of special exhibitions are planned to mark Dublin's role as European City of Culture, 1991.  These include an exhibition of Irish Gold which will go on show in the principal exhibition area of the Kildare Street premises &mdash; the centre court.  In addition, a special Georgian-Victorian silver exhibition is being planned for the first floor gallery in Kildare Street.  An exhibition of late Georgian clothing and everyday life is being planned in conjunction with the ESB.  An exhibition from the Geology Collection will open at the Merrion Row premises.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is envisaged that the construction of additional museum accommodiation of approximately 100,000 sq. ft. as compared with 66,000 sq. ft. in Kildare Street will be undertaken at the Custom House Docks development.</P>

      <P>While only some 30 per cent of the overall amount of the Community's financial assistance provided under the Third Lomé Convention has so far been disbursed, the full amount of these resources will be disbursed over the next few years.  In fact expenditure of some 80 per cent of the funds has already been approved.</P>
      <P>Most of the Lomé resources are given in the form of programme and project aid.  This involves first of all the establishment, with the close co-operation of each ACP State, of an indicative programme for each country.  Subsequently programme aid is approved in stages. Individual projects are then identified and elaborated, and the appropriate aid committed.  Only as individual projects are implemented is the aid disbursed.  To a large extent, the slow rate of disbursement is due to the high priority accorded to rural development programmes under Lomé III.  These programmes involve a highly complex mix of agricultural, social and infrastructural developments which can only be implemented over a number of years.</P>
      <P>The pattern of approval, commitment and disbursement is generally similar to that under previous Lomé Conventions. The Community and the ACP States have, however, agreed to examine how this process could be speeded up.  An endeavour is being made under Lomé IV to get the programming process under way more speedily.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department have received any communication, in the past ten years, from the captain of any nuclear submarine whose intention it was to pass through Irish territorial waters by surface travel; if he has satisfied himself that the necessary regulation has been adhered to during this period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the provisions of international law all vessels have a right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of another State provided that, in the case of submarines, they travel on the surface and fly their flags for identification.Specific authorisation to exercise this right of innocent passage, or notification that it has been exercised, is not required.  Therefore, we have no record of any country notifying the Irish authorities of the innocent passage of nuclear submarines through Irish territorial waters.</P>
      <P>There is one incident on record in which an Irish Naval vessel in exercise of its normal surveillance activities on 14 April 1989, observed a submarine travelling on the surface while in Irish territorial waters.  The submarine was not flying its flag.  The Irish patrol vessel approached the submarine and asked that a flag be hoisted.  The request was complied with.  The vessel was a submarine of the United States Navy.  This incident was brought to the attention of the United States authorities who were reminded of their obligation to fly a flag while in territorial waters.  In response, the Government were assured that this incident was exceptional and that it is normal practice for United States submarines to comply with this requirement of international law regarding innocent passage.  The Government have no record of any other incidents of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very seriously concerned about the dangers that submarines pose to shipping and about the nuclear hazard in the event of an accident involving nuclear powered or armed submarines.  We avail of every opportunity in international fora, such as the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation, to focus attention on the specific problem. <Col N="1054" /> We will continue to raise specific incidents with the authorities of the countries concerned as the need arises.</P>

      <P>Ireland has, since becoming a party to the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling in 1985, taken a decidedly pro-conservation position within the International Whaling Commission.The commission administers the convention and is responsible for the international ban on whaling which has been in force since 1986.  The whaling ban is due to be discussed at the 42nd annual meeting of the commission to be held in Noordwijk, The Netherlands on 2-6 July. The Irish representative at that meeting will continue to follow the strong pro-conservation line to which we are committed.</P>
      <P>Our support within the commission for the international ban confirms our opposition to whaling and, in these circumstances, I would see no need to make bilateral representations on the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the National Archives Act, 1986, and Regulations made thereunder, departmental records which are more than 30 years old are due to be transferred to the National Archives by the end of this year.  My Department has commenced the transfer of such records to the National Archives and expects to have the process completed by December 1990.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for the withholding of records from public scrutiny in specific and limited circumstances where their disclosure would be contrary to the public interest, involve a breach of statutory duty or reveal information supplied in confidence, might cause distress or danger to living persons or might be likely to lead to an action for defamation.  The Act also allows records in regular use in Departments to be retained where their transfer would seriously interfere with the administration of that Department.</P>
      <P>The only records of my Department which are being withheld or likely to be withheld from the National Archives are those clearly falling within these categories.</P>
      <P>In the normal course of its business, my Department maintains clear and comprehensive records of its transactions to which, in time, the obligations imposed under the Act will apply.</P>

The Deputy would seem to be raising the question of whether the auctioneers should base his fees on the sale contract price including VAT or on the sale contract price excluding VAT.  Basing his fees on the VAT-inclusive price will add <Col N="1060" /> 1.15 per cent to the fees.  While this is essentially a matter to be settled between the auctioneer and the client I am arranging for the general position to be taken up with the relevant professional bodies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of secretarial assistance for Deputies and Senators is a non-statutory one and it has been my practice and that of my predecessors to restrict our involvement in its operation to determining at the start of each new Dáil the overall allocation of posts between political parties.  In so far as the distribution of work between individual secretarial staff is concerned, our approach has been that this is best determined by individual Members and parties in the light of their own priorities and work practices.  I should be most reluctant to embark on any exercise which would involve intrusion by any official or group into the circumstances of individual posts.</P>
      <P>There has been a well-established relationship between the pay of secretarial assistants and that of specific grades in the Civil Service, whose pay determination takes account of a wide range of outside comparisons, which has worked to the benefit of the secretarial staff and made for the orderly conduct of industrial relations.  I would be loath to disturb this arrangement by the establishment of a review body.  I have, however, indicated to the union which represents the staff in Leinster House that I would be prepared to have the generality of secretarial posts examined by a working group drawn from the union and my Department with a view to determining whether the developments affecting their members and the Civil Service grades with which they are linked would warrant any modification of the existing links.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the annual report of the Central Bank, <Col N="1062" /> published in May.  I fully concur with the Central Bank's views on the importance of competitiveness.  Improved competitiveness is a vital catalyst for increased growth and employment.  This is evident from the growth and employment performance during the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The annual growth rate of GNP over the life of the programme is expected to be 3½ per cent, and non-agricultural employment is expected to increase by 16,000 on average this year, following on an increase of 13,000 in 1989.  We can aspire to continue on this path of progress only if we remain competitive, especially in the challenging context of closer European integration.</P>
      <P>Pay moderation, in particular, is essential if the virtuous circle of improved competitiveness and increased growth, referred to in the Central Bank report, is to be sustained.  Realism in pay settlements has been a feature of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and must be central in any follow-on arrangement. As the record of the programme shows, pay moderation can be fully compatible with improvement in workers' living standards.The combination of moderate pay increases, low inflation, and the taxation relief which has been possible in the past two years and into 1990, means that the real take-home pay of workers with average industrial earnings will have increased by 4 per cent to 8½ per cent over the three years of the programme. This compares with a fall in purchasing power of 7 per cent to 11 per cent over the period 1980 to 1987, when money incomes grew far more rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation is on a downward trend since November of last year.  The benefits of our strong exchange rate, and the reductions in VAT and excise duties which I announced in the budget, were in evidence in the Consumer Price Index for Mid-May.  This showed a year-on-year increase of 3.5 per cent compared with an increase of 4.2 per cent for mid-February.The inflation rate should decline further in the remainder of the year.  It is expected that the year-on-year increase in prices will have fallen to around 2½ per cent by year-end.  As I <Col N="1063" /> stated in my budget speech, there must be unrelenting action to control inflation and costs of all kinds.  My views on this are consistent with those expressed in the Central Bank report.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an amended certificate of tax-free allowances for the current year, incorporating additional interest relief and life assurance relief, was issued to the taxpayer on 26 June 1990.  A review of the taxpayer's liability for the years 1988-89 and 1989-90 resulted in an overpayment of £3.29 and £185.66 respectively.  A cheque for the total amount <i>viz.</i> £188.95 will issue to the taxpayer within the next ten days.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the National Archives Act, 1986 provides for the transfer of departmental records to the National Archives when they are more than 30 years old.  However, it should be noted that the Department of the Marine was established in 1987 and consequently it is probable that many of the records that would qualify for transfer may have been transferred already or are in the process of being transferred by other Departments or Agencies.  Work is currently in progress at my Department in preparing the appropriate records for transfer, and the transfer of these records is expected to be completed, subject to resources being available, by 31 December 1990.  Authorisation has not been sought to date for the retention of any records.</P>

      <P>In this context, I have personally addressed seminars and symposia throughout the country, as indeed have my Ministers of State and senior officials. Certain of my officials have also contributed articles to journals in respect of the implications of 1992 for Irish farming and agri-business and they are, of course, invariably willing to reply to written, telephone or personal inquiries in this area.</P>
      <P>An official of my Department has been assigned specific responsibility for 1992 and under his supervision, five progress reports on the completion of the Internal Market were issued between August 1988 and February last.  A further issue is scheduled to appear later this summer. Finally, with the fullest co-operation of my officials, the EUROPEN Bureau commissioned and published a professional report entitled &ldquo;1992 and the Food and Drink Industry&rdquo; at the end of last year.</P>

Community legislation also provides that beef or packages of beef exported from one member state to another must bear a health mark.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a requirement laid down by the EC and binding on member states since the inception of the suckler cow premium scheme that an applicant may receive premium only on those suckler cows which he/she has on his/her holding at the date of application.  As payment of suckler cow premium can be made on reactor suckler cows removed after lodgement of applications but before the expiry of the six months retention period <Col N="1081" /> under the scheme, this EC rule of ten years' standing concerning reactors removed before application does not seem unfair to me.</P>
    <P>In the case of the County Sligo herdowner, the two cows mentioned were removed for slaughter from the herd five days before the person named completed his application.  While he could not therefore be paid the EC premium grants on them, he was nevertheless paid headage grants on the same two animals under the more flexible rules of the disadvantaged areas schemes.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the continuing decline in the number of small farmers, which is having a severe impact on rural population and on the social fabric of rural Ireland, with its effect on school and church attendances and on the viability of voluntary and sporting organisations, he will outline the steps he proposes to take, in consultation with the EC, to provide for an improved standard of living for these farmers.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has undoubtedly been a decline in the number of small farmers over the years in Ireland, as in every other developed country.  There has also been a growing trend towards part-time farming.  The EC Farm Structures Survey of 1985 estimated that the holder/manager of one-third of holdings had a gainful activity other than farming. The more recently published Household Budget Survey for 1987 also indicates that many farm households have income sources other than those derived from farming.  This survey showed that, on average, farming represented only 54 per cent of gross farm household income. For small farmers, the contribution of farming to total household income is considerably less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, measures which seek to stem migration from rural Ireland and protect the social fabric must have a broad focus, <Col N="1082" /> covering both agricultural and rural development policies.</P>
    <P>I have at all times, in Community negotiations, sought to ensure that the fundamental mechanisms of the CAP are kept fully in place in order to ensure that the basic supports necessary to underpin a successful agri-food industry are in place.  To maintain viable rural economics in certain areas there is, of course, a need to supplement traditional agriculture by certain income aids, non-traditional farming and indeed non-agricultural activities.  In this context I have sought through a number of measures to ensure that the sector can make a maximum contribution to rural employment.</P>
    <P>The Community Support Framework adopted under the expanded EC structural funds provides for assistance of close to £3 billion for Ireland over the period 1989-1993.  It contains a number of measures which will help to sustain employment levels in the agricultural and rural economy and provides additional resources for on-farm investment, an increase in headage payments, diversification of production and for investment in rural tourism.  The Government's proposal for the extension and reclassification of Ireland's disadvantaged areas will, when approved by the Community, be particularly helpful in this regard.  The abolition this year of the off farm income criterion under the disadvantaged area scheme is, of course, also extremely beneficial to many farm families in these areas.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for rural development, currently being submitted to Brussels includes a scheme of aid for alternative farm enterprises, a national agri tourism scheme and forestry measures, all of which will give an important boost to job creation in rural areas in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the experience gained from the operation of the Integrated Rural Development Pilot Programme, due to conclude in October 1990, will be built upon to launch initiatives on a wider scale which will assist in the provision of jobs and wealth creation in rural Ireland. <Col N="1083" /> I would hope that the recently signalled Community initiative on rural development will be helpful in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1980, was deliberately framed to give local authorities the power to regulate and control casual trading in their own functional areas.  Casual trading is not a national problem but a series of disparate local problems calling for solutions tailormade to suit local circumstances.  Local authorities are empowered under the Act of designated casual trading areas and, where such areas are designated, it is an offence for a casual trader to trade elsewhere in the functional area of that local authority.  By designating areas, local authorities can exercise control over caual traders in the location of the trading, in the number of permits they issue and through conditions attaching to the casual trading permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the onus is on local authorities to take the necessary steps to regulate casual trading in their own functional areas.  In this regard, the Act is generally working satisfactorily. However, in view of the fact that the legislation has been in force for a decade and that some difficulties have arisen in its implementation, it was indicated in a <Col N="1099" /> response to Questions Nos. 53 and 56 on 5 December 1989 (Official Report, volume 394, columns 63 and 64) that, a review of the Causal Trading Act, 1980, would be undertaken.  Any information which the Deputies may have on any particular difficulties being experienced by local authorities in relation to casual trading would be welcome in this regard and can be communicated to the Department of Industry and Commerce for consideration.</P>

      <P>The Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, provide for the granting of mineral prospecting licences which authorise the holders to enter upon the lands specified and there to carry out surveys or other <Col N="1104" /> investigations to ascertain whether mineral deposits of commercial interest exist there.</P>
      <P>A condition attached to all licences is that the licensees must obtain planning permission in advance under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963 and 1976 for any work contemplated under the licences which would require such permission.</P>
      <P>Prospecting licences holders are also required to carry out their operations in conformity with good prospecting practices and not to interfere unnecessarily with the amenities of the locality in which the licence area is situated.</P>
      <P>In cases where my Department is aware of an environmentally sensitive site e.g. an historic monument, detailed instructions are given to the licensee regarding their operations, otherwise they are required to consult the Office of Public Works or other relevant bodies.</P>
      <P>There are at present 53 prospecting licences granted to 12 companies (Appendix A).  The licences were issued for an initial term of two years subject to payment of the appropriate fee, and to the conditions generally applicable to the grant of prospecting licences.  They were subsequently renewed for further periods, my Department being satisfied that sufficient prospecting work had been carried out and that acceptable work programmes would be undertaken.</P>
      <P>There are several hundred townlands in the above licensed areas and the Deputy will appreciate that due to time constraints and staffing resources it is not possible to give a detailed list of the townlands in the reply.</P>
      <P>APPENDIX A</P>
      <P>Following is the information requested in relation to current valid prospecting licences in Co. Mayo.</P>
      <P>Name and address of Licensees:</P>
      <P>1.  Glencar Exploration plc., 26 Upper Mount Street, Dublin 2, in Joint Venture with Andaman Resources plc., 1 Green Hill, Little Thetford, Ely, Cambs. CB6 3HD, England.</P>

      <P>My Department consults with the National Archives on a regular basis and is complying with the legislative requirements to retain files unless their disposal has been authorised by that office.  Files relating to the various aspects of the administration of the Department are covered by those legislative requirments.</P>
      <P>To date, no departmental records have been transferred to the National Archives.</P>
      <P>Files which are more than 30 years old are at present being examined by the National Archives with a view to indentifying those which are of archival interest.  When this examination is complete arrangements will be made for the preparation and transfer of those files to the National Archives.  Where necessary, authorisations will be sought to retain files as provided for under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Archives have expressed a special interest in certain claim files which are no longer required for departmental purposes and which would otherwise be destroyed.  These relate, mainly, to claims for means-tested payments.  The files, the majority of which are not yet 30 years old, will, if required, be transferred to the National Archives at the appropriate time.  However, because of the sensitive and confidential nature of the information in those files, it may be necessary to withhold them from public <Col N="1113" /> inspection under section 8 (4) of the National Archives Act.</P>

      <P>My Department recognises Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, or ME as it is commonly known, as a certifiable incapacity.As ME is a very difficult condition <Col N="1116" /> to diagnose, it can take some time before a person is finally diagnosed as having ME.  In the intervening period, claimants are usually certified as being incapable of work from some other cause.  As a result of this, perhaps, and also due to the relatively low incidence of the condition, my Department sees very little certification that actually specifies the cause of incapacity as ME.</P>
      <P>All disability benefit and invalidity pension claims are subject to the normal medical evaluations provided by the Department's medical referees.  In arriving at a conclusion on any particular case the referee has regard to all relevant evidence provided and in particular to comments submitted by the claimant's own general practitioner.  In the instances in which a person is called before a medical referee his or her doctor is informed and invited to submit appropriate information in relation to the case.  It is important to get as much information as possible from a person's own doctor in all instances, but particularly so in diagnosing conditions such as ME where the person's doctor can provide information on the nature of his/her patient's complaint over time.</P>
      <P>I met representatives from the ME Association earlier this year.  Senior officials concerned with the administrative and medical certification work in this general area were present.  Arising from this meeting additional information on ME was distributed to the Department's doctors.  As part of the Department's policy in keeping up to date with current medical issues a number of my Department's medical personnel recently attended a special session given by the Irish College of Occupational Medicine on the topic of ME.  Also my Department's Medical Adviser attended the First World Symposium on ME held in Cambridge, UK, in April and a full report on these proceedings was issued to all medical referees.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has to function in relation to certification for the purposes of sickness payment schemes under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 29 January 1990 and his claim was authorised for payment at the weekly rate of £88.90 on the basis of a nil means assessment previously made in his case.  This rate is that appropriate in the case of a married person with two dependent children.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has four children, but failed to supply supporting evidence in respect of two of them to the employment exchange.  His entitlement is however now being revised from £88.90 to £108.90 per week for the period 29 January 1990 to 20 March 1990.  For the period from 21 March onwards, pending determination of an appeal against the current means assessment in his case, he is entitled to payment at the rate of £5 per week up to 26 May 1990, when he signed off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change in rate from 21 March 1990 <Col N="1118" /> arises from a means re-investigation in February 1990.  A deciding officer subsequently assessed his means at £103.90 per week from 21 March 1990 derived from his earnings from self-employment as a part-time fisherman.  This assessment was based on information about his earnings supplied by the claimant.  He has appealed against the means assessment and his case has been referred to an appeals officer for consideration.  When a decision is given, he will be informed of the outcome without delay.</P>

Under the new arrangements married women looking after an incapacitated pensioner will, for the first time, be able to claim the allowance.</P>
      <P>In cases where the spouse of the carer is working the standard method of assessing income will be applied.  The income of both the carer and spouse will be added together, and half of this assessed as the carer's means.

      <P>An appeals officer decided on <Col N="1119" /> 17 November 1989 that the person concerned was entitled to an old age non-contributory pension at the reduced rate of £22.50 per week from 19 May 1989 rising to £24 per week from 28 July 1989. He has been assessed with means derived from a holding.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has transferred his holding to a nephew who has been resident in Scotland for many years.  In these circumstances, the appeals officer has not accepted the transfer for old age pension purposes and the person concerned is still considered to be in beneficial occupation of the holding.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981, a person may not deprive himself of pay, income or property in order to qualify for old age non-contributory pension.  If it appears that a person has deprived himself or income or property in order to qualify for pension, the yearly value of that means or property is still taken to be part of the means of that person for the purposes of determining entitlement to old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Following representations from the pensioner's solicitors, the case was reviewed in April 1990.  As no new facts or fresh evidence were presented, the appeals officer's decision still stands.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or evidence.  If the circumstances of the person concerned have changed since April, he should advise my Department and his case will be reinvestigated.</P>

      <P>Assistance to students in third level education is provided mainly through the scheme of higher education grants administered by the Department of Education.  As far as my Department <Col N="1120" /> are concerned I am anxious to ensure that unemployed people and particularly the long-term unemployed, are given every opportunity to participate in education courses.  Opportunities for the long-term unemployed to avail of second level education courses without losing their unemployment payments are available through the vocational training opportunities scheme, originally the education opportunities scheme, which operates in 12 centres throughout the country and under which courses up to leaving certificate level are provided for long-term unemployed people over age 21.  At present 170 people are catered for in the scheme.  In addition I made regulations in 1989 under which long-term unemployed people can, under certain conditions, take up full-time second level educational courses while continuing to receive their unemployment payment.</P>
      <P>I am also considering how the long-term unemployed can be enabled to take up courses at third level and I am making arrangements for a pilot scheme in this area to operate from the start of the next academic year.</P>

      <P>There is no record in my Department of a recent dental benefit claim from the person concerned.  Neither is there a record of a complaint from him regarding a dentist refusing to provide treatment under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the social insurance dental benefit scheme a dentist, who is a member of my Department's dental panel, contracts to provide a certain range of dental treatment to qualified persons.  Treatments such as examination, scaling, mild <Col N="1121" /> gum treatments and basic fillings are provided free of charge to the patient and the dentist is paid a fixed fee for these treatments by my Department.  For certain other treatments, including root treatment and dentures, patients are required to pay a fixed amount to the dentists with the balance of the fee being met by my Department.</P>
    <P>As part of a campaign of opposition to the extension of dental benefit to dependent spouses of insured persons some dentists are imposing charges for extractions, dentures and root canal treatment, which are not in accordance with the terms of their agreement with the Department.  Discussions are taking place with the Irish Dental Association to find an agreed approach to the operation of the dental benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>Any qualified person who is asked to pay inappropriate charges for treatment covered under the scheme, should refuse to do so and report the matter to my Department.  However, there is no provision under the scheme whereby patients who proceed with treatment and pay such charges can be reimbursed.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the recent recall of a particular car model by one major distributor.  In accordance with long standing practice, my Department's vehicle registration unit facilitated this recall, in the interest of public safety, by furnishing the distributor with a list of the present owners of the model affected from the computerised national vehicle file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recall of motor vehicles with design or manufacturing faults is solely the legal responsibility of the manufacturers and distributors.  The Department have no function in relation to the <Col N="1131" /> terms of any recall notifications issued by manufacturers or distributors to owners of defective vehicles.</P>
    <P>Where a vehicle owner is notified that a vehicle is defective, the owner is responsible for ensuring that the vehicle is repaired prior to being used on a public road or, alternatively, is scrapped and the licensing authority notified.  The Garda Síochána is responsible for investigating a specific allegation that a defective vehicle is being used on a public road.</P>
    <P>The compulsory motor insurance regulations provide that an insurer cannot refuse to pay compensation to an injured third party on the grounds that an insured vehicle which caused personal injury or property damage was defective.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the accident referred to by the Deputies.  It would not be appropriate to speculate about the causes of the accident, or the lessons to be learned from it, pending the outcome of investigations and any legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> The licensing of double-decker buses or coaches for long distance operation in the State is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána under the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1967.</P>
    <P>The legal speed limit for a double-decker bus is 40 miles per hour.  Private double-decker buses using public roads must have compulsory third party motor insurance.  Buses owned by CIE, and its subsidiary companies, are exempt from compulsory insurance.  CIE pay compensation to injured third parties from their own financial resources.  Enforcement of the statutory requirements on speed limits and insurance is a function of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>The management and maintenance, including repairs, of their dwellings are matters for the local authority and do not require ministerial approval.  Such works would be funded by the authority from its own resources, which includes their rental income and the revenue portion, 40 per cent, of the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes.  Approved projects under the remedial works scheme, under which the housing authority may carry out major refurbishment of certain estates, come within the Public Capital Programme.  It is a matter for the authority to formulate such proposals and to indicate relative priorities, within their allocation, when <Col N="1138" /> proposals are being made to the Department.This year the sum of £450,000 has been allocated to the corporation under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222, 223, 224, 225 and 227 together. The dog control provisions of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, did not come into operation until 1 February 1987 and the available statistics relate to the period after that date.  Returns for the year 1989 are not yet available but are expected to be completed within a few weeks.  A copy will be sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Separate statistics are not available in relation to seizures, etc., of dogs under particular provisions of the Act and the statistics do not distinguish between seizures of dogs by dog wardens and by members of the Garda Síochána or, as respects their subsequent fate, between dogs seized and dogs surrendered by their owners.  Following is a statement, compiled from data furnished by local authorities, which sets out the numbers of dogs seized, surrendered, etc., in each local authority area in 1987, final 11 months, and in 1988:</P>

      <P>The issues in question principally relate to problems of dereliction in the area concerned and to the desirability of designating the area for urban renewal.</P>
      <P>The Derelict Sites Act, 1990 considerably strengthens the statutory powers available to deal with dereliction. Details were announced on 1 May 1990 of new areas to be designated for urban renewal in Dublin and elsewhere.  There is no proposal at present to designate further areas.</P>

      <P>This year a total of £10.6 million has been allocated to my Department from the national lottery.  The funds will be used to provide services for the mentally and physically handicapped, the elderly, child services, AIDS services, psychiatric services and community information services, including funding for the National Social Service Board and National Council for the Elderly.  The sum of £3 million was provided to assist with the implementation of the recommendations of the working party report &mdash;&ldquo;The Care of the Elderly &mdash; The Years Ahead&rdquo; and £2 million of these funds was provided for the hospital building programme.</P>

      <Col N="1156" /> While funding for national based programmes will continue to be a matter for the Department of Health, funding of local voluntary agencies will be undertaken in future from block allocation of funds which will be issued to the separate health boards.  I am currently in the process of discussing with the chief executive officers of the eight health boards the size of the block allocations to be made available to each health board and the guidelines which will be attached to the distribution of these amounts.  This process is nearing conclusion and I expect to be in a position to issue the block allocations in a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>There are two methods whereby professional disciplines are recognised by my Department.  The first method is the establishment, by statute, of a registration body &mdash; as applies in the case of doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists.  The second method involves the formal approval of qualifications by the Minister for Health under section 18 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>An important criterion for recognition is the employment of members of the profession concerned in the health services.Once that criterion is met, the most appropriate method for granting recognition can then be considered.</P>
      <P>However, as chiropractors are not employed in the health services and as there are no proposals to so employ them, the question of recognising them by either of the mechanisms outlined does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the monitoring of chiropractors, as they are not employed in the health services, my Department have no function in this regard and I do not propose to introduce any measures which would change this position &mdash; either in <Col N="1157" /> regard to chiropractors or other practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position of chiropractors generally, I am aware that a therapy of this nature, falling under the general heading of complementary and alternative medicine, can be employed by those with a conventional training in health care as well as by people without any such mainstream training.</P>
    <P>My Department maintain contact with a number of bodies representative of persons involved in complementary and alternative medicine and has suggested to them that an appropriate method of monitoring professional standards would be the development of systems of self-regulation.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive recoupment agreement has been concluded with the United Kingdom and under the terms of this agreement the net amounts paid by the United Kingdom to Ireland in the years 1986 to 1989 were as follows: 1986, £25,277,341; 1987, £27,985,551; 1988, £31,075,318; 1989, £41,677,702.</P>

      <P>There is no specific provision in the higher education grants scheme relating to either adult or mature students.  Also, there is no upper age limit in the scheme at present and it is, therefore, open to all students to sit the leaving certificate examination in the normal way for the purposes of qualifying for a grant on grounds of academic attainments and means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968 allows Local Authorities who administer the scheme to award grants only to persons whose parents' or guardians' means are within the prescribed <Col N="1169" /> limit.  There is no provision whereby adult students or students who may be independent of their parents may be means-tested without reference to their parents income.</P>

      <P>Out of a total of 1,034 candidates who took the subject in the 1989 leaving certificate examination, 20 were awarded Grade A. In conjunction with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, I am examining the whole question of the relative grades awarded as between different subjects.</P>
      <P>In the 1990 aural examination in music which took place in May, there was a minor error between information in question seven on the question paper and the corresponding piece of music on the tape. I am satisfied that this question, which related only to candidates taking the higher level paper, did not cause any undue problems for the candidates. However, it will be taken into account in the marking of the scripts of the candidates concerned.</P>

Given the variety of factors, economic and otherwise, which impact upon tourism, it is very difficult to quantify reliably the cost to this country in 1989 of tourism earnings which might have been lost as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>In the National Development Plan submitted to the EC Commission in March 1989 the Government stated that it would seek Community support for commercially viable air and sea shuttle services between Ireland and Continental Europe.  The Commission have agreed in the Community Support Framework that subject to the results of a feasibility study it would consider investment in such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This feasibility study, commissioned jointly by the Irish Government and the EC Commission, is presently being undertaken by SKC/CHL.  I am not yet in a position to say what its findings will be or to indicate whether the type of facilities the Deputy refers to will be recommended.  I have, however, made <Col N="1180" /> representations to the relevant EC Commissioners of the importance the Government attach to such shuttle services.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that at the EC Council of Ministers meeting on 18-19 June, the Council on my initiative adopted principles on the liberalisation of air freight.  When the opinion of the European Parliament has been received on these proposals formal adoption of the appropriate regulation will be considered by the Council.  This regulation when adopted should significantly improve prospects for air freight services to/from Ireland.</P>

      <P>As I informed the House in reply to recent parliamentary questions in this matter, an accounting investigation into the reported discrepancies at Aer Lingus Holidays Limited was carried out by a major chartered accountancy firm, Craig Gardner, who furnished their report both to me and to the Board of Aer Lingus.  As I have already indicated in my reply of 16 May last, that report has been referred to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for further investigation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, following receipt of the Craig Gardner report, I issued a number of instructions to the Board of Aer Lingus on 15 May, details of which were given in my reply of 16 May, and the chairman of the board has already confirmed to me that those instructions are being complied with.</P>
      <P>All the appropriate measures necessary to ensure that this matter is thoroughly investigated have already been taken by me.  Craig Gardner has fully investigated the matter; the report has been referred to the Garda and I have instructed the Board of Aer Lingus to take disciplinary and legal action where necessary.  It would be unnecessary duplication to have departmental officials carry out a further investigation.  I am satisfied that all the matters are therefore being fully investigated in the proper way.</P>
