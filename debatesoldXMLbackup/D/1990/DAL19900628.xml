    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 17, 18 and 19.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 9 p.m. and (2) the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Order of Business.  I oppose each of the two proposals individually and collectively because the Government still refuse to withdraw from this House the ludicrous and nonsensical Broadcasting Bill when every day brings more and more evidence of harm that will be done to RTE and to other interests in the country.  It is time the Government got the message and withdrew from the House the Bill that they clearly do not believe in, so that we can get on with constructive business, of which there is plenty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As Leader of the Labour Party, I would like to inform you that we are opposing the Order of Business this <Col N="1378" /> morning.  I would like to tell the Taoiseach that I am at a loss to understand the Government's haste in trying to get this Bill through before the summer recess.  There is a lot of other business which the Taoiseach, and indeed the Chief Whip, informed us some weeks ago they wanted to put through this House. The long and sometimes very fracious debate that took place in this House yesterday certainly was not good for Parliament, and it looks like that will continue if the Government persist with this ludicrous legislation.  I would ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the matter, to allow other business to be carried out between now and the summer recess and to see if we can deal with this matter in due course.  The present course of action is not satisfactory and we will be opposing it at all stages.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party are also opposing items 1 and 2.  We made it clear yesterday that there is other legislation which should be on the Order of Business, such as the Child Care Bill.  I would like to point out also that there is no provision for a break throughout the day either for Members or staff.  That is outrageous.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a technical point.  Would the Taoiseach consider a break, even of half an hour, for the staff? It might have been an oversight when drafting the initial proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, is the Taoiseach in a position to tell us when the Government propose that the House should go into summer recess?  I will stay here until hell freezes over but I should like to know if between now and whatever date the Government may have in mind we will have a full debate on the Estimates, properly go through the legislative programme which the Government seem to be leaking to the Press and have a proper debate on what is happening in the GATT negotiations, about which we are becoming more and more concerned, as well as a debate on the meagre outcome of the European Council which met earlier this week and which is a real reflection of the performance of this Presidency?  I wish to have an assurance that we will have provision for a proper Adjournment debate to conclude.</P>

      <P>Let me ask the Taoiseach, or perhaps the Minister for Finance, if they will make a statement on the announcement by the Central Bank yesterday in relation to a half per cent reduction in borrowing rates.  Given the fact that mortgage rates are almost four percentage points higher than they were this time last year, will the Minister for Finance outline whether he is going to have meetings with the building societies and the banks to ensure that proper reductions will be brought about as quickly as possible to bring relief to mortgage holders?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of The Workers' Party contains <Col N="1397" /> a very succinct and important proposition in the context of the legislation now before the House.  It proposes that the Act other than section 3, our proposed new section on the establishment of a commission on broadcasting, shall not come into effect until such time as the commission, established by that section, have published their report and a motion approving the report has been passed by each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1982 when the entire debate opened up on the future of broadcasting and the events which took place at that time, in particular, the refusal of the Minister of the day to respond to representations for an increase in the revenue base for RTE, The Workers' Party made the case that it was necessary to have a wide-sweeping investigation of the nature and, more importantly, the future of broadcasting in this country.  That proposition was made by Deputy De Rossa on behalf of The Workers' Party in September 1982.  This proposal was repeated more particularly during the debate on the future of broadcasting &mdash; as far as that went &mdash; when the Radio and Television Act, 1988, and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988 were being discussed.  The point was repeated many times by Deputy De Rossa who made the proposition and by other contributors to the debate that we had in fact proceeded with such haste to simply bring on stream the commercial so-called independent sector of the broadcasting network that we had given scant if any attention to some of the more basic and fundamental questions surrounding the ethos and future of broadcasting for the nation.  This Bill presents us with another opportunity to open up the debate on the same proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of this current legislation has altered radically since it was published by the Minister as recently as 31 May of this year, when the Broadcasting Bill, 1990, was circulated.  It should be said that in the course of preparation of the Government's legislative programme, the ships of the various groups in the House were supplied with a schedule of the legislative programme at the <Col N="1398" /> beginning of this session.  The Government had set out their legislative priorities in two stages: the first section indicated the legislation that was in the process of circulation or at various Stages in this House or that would definitely be introduced during this session.  In the second part of the schedule there was an indication of the legislation that &ldquo;may be&rdquo;&mdash; in the words of the Government &mdash; circulated in the coming sessions, in which a Bill entitled the Broadcasting (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1990, was included.  That was the state of play at the beginning of the present session of the Dáil.  The Government were in the course of the slow and often laborious process of drafting a Bill which they felt might reach the floor of the House during the present session and there were no more definite indications than that.  It was to be an omnibus miscellaneous provisions legislation which would tidy up the existing <i>corpus</i> of legislation dealing with broadcasting and would also tidy up the issues which had emerged in the wake of the 1988 broadcasting legislation.  The point I wish to make is that the legislation that was intended to be introduced, possibly in the session, was a Bill to address technical or drafting matters.  There is no doubt that a primary function of the Bill was the proposition &mdash; which was dealt with later in the Bill as currently circulated &mdash; that it was the entitlement of RTE to appoint their own auditors and deal with the problems emerging with regard to transmission deflectors as opposed to the MMDS system which the Minister so strongly believed in.</P>
    <P>Something radical then happened because the Minister in response to the acknowledged long-standing views of the print media and more particularly the almost hysterical special pleading of Century Radio that they were imminently facing closure, devised a further three sections, which I have no doubt were not originally contemplated in the Broadcasting (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which the Whips had advised us would be circulated.  Clearly certain sections of this Bill were designed in essence to rescue in a very direct way Century Radio <Col N="1399" /> from imminent closure.  We were not made aware whether any other independent radio stations were coming in behind the special case made by Century Radio for monetary aid.  The figures that emerged, where the £3 million that Century Radio would need to survive was matched by the Minister seeking to take £3 million from the licence fee, were too much of a coincidence other than to suggest that in the hastily drafted additions to the Broadcasting (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill he had in mind a direct rescue package for Century Radio.  There was a strong reaction to these proposals, however, if one looks at today's reports it seems that the information began to change and it appears that Century Radio will in fact ride out the storm and survive. It appears from reports in the national media that things are not as bad as Century Radio had believed in terms of capturing the market.  For whatever reasons &mdash; and it has not yet been explained fully to us in the Minister's contribution on Second Stage and elsewhere &mdash; there was a fundamental change in emphasis and direction.  The Minister by his own motion proposed to delete two of the more sweeping sections, sections 2 and 3, and he was also proposing very wide-ranging amendments to section 4. As I have said, there was a radical change in the nature of the legislation.  What is most important about the radical change is that the apparent need for urgency which was implicit if the Minister was going to stick with the direct transfer of funds through the Independent Radio and Television Commission to the independent stations, particularly those in trouble &mdash; I do not think it was ever contemplated that the IRTC would give money to the successful radio stations and it was clearly a rescue package &mdash; is no longer needed.  In all rescue packages time is of the essence but this device has now been abandoned by the Minister and consequently the case for the urgency of the legislation should be abandoned.  As a consequence, it is difficult to understand why the Minister and the Government are insisting that this legislation must be <Col N="1400" /> on the Statute Book before the completion of this session.  There is nothing in the latter proposals in the Bill that requires urgency in the way that the original sections 2 and 3 might have required urgency if they were to be a device &mdash; as I believe they were originally intended &mdash; on a direct rescue package for radio stations facing imminent closure or collapse. Why is there a need for urgency now?  Will the Minister take time to explain to the House why there is no longer any discussion at Whips level about the ordering of the business for the House?  Will he explain why the House is being asked to sit inordinate hours into the early hours of the morning to debate the Bill so as to ensure, as the Government have indicated &mdash; the Taoiseach certainly has &mdash; that it is disposed of before the Dáil rises?  I do not see the urgency for it and I am asking the Minister to contemplate taking a breather with regard to it; I suggest that he take an opportunity to reflect.  The amendment offers him that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would not suggest to the Minister that if he took this idea on board he would be climbing down or was making a U-turn, a concept we abandoned when firing issues at the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  Perhaps we will allow for the fact that it was a Charlton-like change of tactics as a means of achieving victory.  I urge the Minister to consider our suggestion carefully.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we obtain the report of a commission before we proceed any further in the debate on broadcasting.  In 1982 Deputy De Rossa, on behalf of our group, highlighted the need for such a commission as a prerequisite to the development in a fundamental way of broadcasting legislation.  In the course of a statement on 6 September 1982, issued on behalf of The Workers' Party, Deputy De Rossa Said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when RTE are facing the challenge of competition from four <Col N="1401" /> British television stations and numerous illegal radio stations, not to mention critical pressure from satellite, cable and video systems, it is deplorable that a small and already underfinanced broadcasting service should be further restricted in their development.</P>
    <P>However, any discussion on broadcasting in Ireland is surrounded by critical cynicism.  Instead of assisting RTE to face the challenge from all sides both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael seem anxious to connive with illegal and culturally illiterate merchandisers and promoters who seek the airwaves not for public good but for private gains.</P>
    <P>There is now a serious case to be made for Dáil Éireann to establish a commission on broadcasting with a brief to set out how best public service broadcasting might develop in the eighties and nineties.  Such a commission could not only ensure a stable future for our existing broadcasting organisation but also set standards for any local radio and television stations that may in the future receive broadcasting licences.</P>
    <P>The point must be made that the eighties, in terms of the progress that could have been made on some of the fundamental principles, were a disaster.  Unfortunately, it was a decade that stumbled from one debacle to another as far as addressing the fundamentals of broadcasting and its future development were concerned.</P>
    <P>We should not repeat the errors of the past decade.  We are following the campaign of a Minister who said of himself that he set a blistering pace in the right directions when tackling the pirates, the illegal operators and in introducing a new system of broadcasting and transmission. I urge the Minister, having taken one step forward, to consider taking two steps back and look at the need for a review of our broadcasting system.</P>
    <P>The Bill, and our amendment, offer the Minister that opportunity.  In the debate on the Sound Broadcasting Bill <Col N="1402" /> on 10 February 1988 Deputy De Rossa expanded on the importance of looking at our basic principles of broadcasting as a prerequisite to embarking on fundamental changes and developments.  I should like to put on record what he said because it needs repeating.  He said, as reported at column 1808 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>What is needed and which should have preceded this Bill (it should precede this Bill for all the same reasons) but which at the very least should be done in tandem with the Bill &mdash; I am talking specifically about the Sound Broadcasting Bill rather than the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill &mdash; is a commission on broadcasting with specific terms of reference which would put broadcasting policy, issues of culture and public policy at the head of their list and questions of cables, frequencies and licences at the bottom of their list.  It would be a commission on communications on which nobody would sit who did not have a distinguished track record on communications or on cultural work, for example, poets, artists, broadcasters, teachers, novelists, sculptors and men and women widely acknowledged to be public servants of proven merit in the field of cultural administration.  Their brief would be to decide public policy on broadcasting.  We do not have any such policy.  We have only a series of irrelevant reports describing how RTE do things and, indeed, how RTE ought to do things.  We need a report on the principles by which RTE and the kind of commercial stations which are being proposed in this Bill would operate, and how they might do things and by what ends and by what legal cultural and political means they would be regulated.  In the absence of such principles to talk of independent radio is a nonsense and simply a cover up for doling out the airwaves to commercial free enterprise in the hope that someone along the way will come up with some little nuggets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> He went on to say, as reported at column 1809 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>There is a lot more to be done than simply agreeing to the share out of the airwaves to the commercial interests. There is the task of defining what is the role of broadcasting in fostering Irish culture, of finding out what is contemporary Irish culture, of finding out how to reach our alieanated youth in the urban waste-lands where unemployment and crime conspire against them having any hope of a future of educating our people to the practice of pluralism, for instance, and of learning to live with other religious, cultural and political traditions.  That is an obligation which is implied in relation to RTE but which is not implied under the Broadcasting Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Since that debate concluded, and that Act was introduced into our law, those fundamental principles and obligations referred to by Deputy De Rossa have not been addressed by the House or debated at any length in the public arena.  Consequently, now is the opportunity to debate them.  We should use the debate on the Bill to do so, late though it is.  We should engage in such a review so that we can establish once and for all the fundamentals surrounding our policy and philosophy with regard to broadcasting. Unless we do so now the Minister will be compounding the mistakes of the previous Government in the last decade about which he was so caustic and critical, not just in this debate but in earlier debates with regard to the absence of any direction, policy or understanding of what is happening.  That is the first basis on which the Government and the Minister should accept a deferral of this legislation pending the report of the commission as suggested in our amendment.</P>
    <P>The second point is that not only is the Minister's ground changing rapidly since the introduction of the legislation on 31 May, it also appears that the conditions in the marketplace are changing daily. Therefore, the conditions need to be <Col N="1404" /> addressed.  In today's newspapers a report of a survey into the performances of the independent radio sector as opposed to the State broadcasting sector indicated that the independents are doing much better than people thought.  As recently as last week, representations made by people in response to the Minister's legislation acknowledged that perhaps Century were in trouble and that 2FM were stronger, particularly in the urban areas, than is the case.</P>
    <P>The joint national listenership research survey was carried out over a two month period by the Market Research Bureau of Ireland at the behest of RTE.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission, the main advertising agencies and major advertisers have indicated that Century Radio are performing more strongly in the general categories, and more particularly in the younger categories of people in the age group of 15-24 whom they latterly specifically sought to target.  The two Dublin commercial stations, Capital and 98FM, are drawing equally good audiences and 2FM is running behind them in the popularity stakes in the city.</P>
    <P>The conditions experienced by the independent broadcasting sector are changing almost on a daily basis and &mdash; I have no hesitation in acknowledging &mdash; are emerging in a way which many people did not believe possible recently and even since the legislation was published.  The question then is if we can ever settle at any one moment in time the basis or parameters of the playing pitch which has to be level, according to the Minister's efforts and devices in this legislation.  Is it not timely or opportune, given the stage of flux and the emerging changing factors developing on an ongoing basis, to go back to the fundamentals and involve ourselves in a wide sweeping review of the current state of play, the projected future state of play and our desires for the future of broadcasting before we take radical decisions and introduce major changes in the legislation in the way the Minister is seeking to do?</P>
    <P>Because of the changing, emerging and various circumstances, many of which are <Col N="1405" /> laying to rest some of the misconceptions with regard to the fragility of the independent sector, perhaps the Minister should avail of the opportunity to accept the amendment proposed by The Workers' Party and defer the implementation of the legislation until we have had some form of fundamental opportunity to review it.</P>
    <P>The third point in this context is that there is a need for a breathing space.  If the Minister persists with his proposals and wins the day in relation to capping advertising &mdash; and, as an indirect result, an outflow of resources from RTE &mdash; the concept of immediate implementation and impact of the proposals, even in the current year, means there should be an opportunity for RTE as a commercial enterprise to be allowed a breathing space to absorb the impact of the Minister's proposals.  RTE should also be allowed to plan the phased introduction of these economies, cutbacks and consequential loss of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister must tell us why the impact of these proposals must be visited on RTE immediately after the passing of the legislation.  The purpose of the legislation is a rescue package for Century and other ailing stations.  The other proposals would not suffer unduly if they were phased in or delayed for a period. The media in general have survived over the last decades in this climate, under these conditions of competition, and they could survive longer even if the Minister has his murky way at the end of the phased period.  The acceptance of our amendment would afford the opportunity for a phasing in proposition and allow RTE a breathing space to reorganise themselves, which is essential to afford a decent opportunity to redeploy their staff to the other sectors of the market.  It would be a decent and humane gesture by the Minister and the Government in response to the major impact on our national broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This point was made to the Minister and to other political groups by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, one of the national social partners and negotiators in regard to the economy.  In a letter <Col N="1406" /> dated 18 June to the leader of my party &mdash; which was, I presume, received by other parties &mdash; the general secretary, Mr. Cassells said:</P>
    <P>In the event of the Government deciding to proceed with section 4, ICTU considers that the proposals on advertising on RTE's services should be considerably amended.  In particular, we believe that:</P>
    <P>1.  A different formula should be used to limit the revenue from advertising than the proposed link to the licence fee.  For example, the amount of revenue raised by RTE from advertising in 1989 could be used as the ceiling with provision for increases linked to inflation in future years.  Also income from RTE's Commercial Enterprise Unit should not be included when the limit on revenue from advertising is being set;</P>
    <P>2.  The proposed maximum of 4 minutes 30 seconds of advertising in any one hour should be increased significantly or at the very least averaged over the day;</P>
    <P>3.  The proposed constraints should be phased in.  In particular, the Bill should be amended to provide that a commencement date will be set by Order for section 4.  We believe that this commencement order should not be made by the Minister until TV3 is ready to come on air.</P>
    <P>The concerns of Congress are rightly reflected there and can be accommodated in what we propose in our amendment, that of deferring the Bill <i>in toto</i> pending the outcome of the report of the commission and its adoption by this House. That would afford an opportunity for all persons concerned, in the broadcasting field, Congress and others, to make submissions to reflect on, review and research the overall broadcasting area, allowing us address, for the first time in a fundamental way, the basic principles on which we seek to develop in the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to that issue, in the course of <Col N="1407" /> his remarks on Second Stage the Minister attempted to address some of the basic principles or conditions of the market in this Bill.  I attempted last evening to demonstrate that there had been a radical departure on the part of the Minister, even within a period of two years, from some of the principles outlined in the debates of 1987 and 1988 in regard to the legislation then being considered in the House, demonstrating that the principle of the minimalist, non-regulatory, nonintervention approach to policing of the broadcasting airwaves clearly was being departed from under the provisions of this Bill, that if anything they constituted a movement backwards in that overall area.</P>
    <P>The issue of striking balances, about which the Minister spoke clearly, is being substantially upset under the provisions of this Bill.  I suppose that argument is dependent most strongly on from whichever side one tends to view it.  Certainly there is sufficient concern felt and argument advanced among all sectors of the broadcasting industry here to demonstrate the need to re-examine how that balance should be struck and be maintained. Most importantly, there was the plea on the part of the Minister that the concepts of workability, realism, practicality should be applied to any of the proposals emanating from whatever source in this debate.  Certainly those concepts do not appear to have been applied strictly or considered in the manner in which the Minister is advancing his proposals when one considers that, within weeks of the publication of a Bill of fundamental importance and concept, he changed his mind.  It does not appear to me that the principles of realism, practicality or workability are being applied.  If one looks at the proposals from that angle it begs the question: what could have changed within two weeks to alter them?</P>
    <P>As Congress have said, there is need for a phasing in of any proposals as radical as those the Minister advances.  I contend that our amendment affords that opportunity most importantly to the RTE <Col N="1408" /> Authority in dealing with their forward planning and the redeployment of personnel who will inevitably be shed from the industry.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the next point I want to make in support of this amendment. It is linked to the suggestion that as this debate progresses daily new factors emerge, new ideas are being floated, indeed the texture of the landscape is altering.  I make this point with direct reference to an interesting set of proposals launched yesterday at a press conference by the independent broadcasting programme-making sector, Film-makers (Ireland) Ltd. and others, who have entered into this debate &mdash; one might suggest at a late stage &mdash; but nonetheless with proposals and concepts deserving of careful consideration by the Minister and of being addressed by us in this House. Their campaign, entitled &ldquo;Campaign 25&rdquo;, advances the argument that the fundamental issue in this debate is not one of rescue packaging, of direct subvention of resources to beleagured independent broadcasters but rather has to do with the issue of redeployment of limited resources, the majority of which are at present controlled by the RTE Authority. They argue that there is an effective way in which we could seek to redistribute some of those resources, which they suggest would be in the better interest of RTE, of programme-making and of the market generally.  They contend that the determination of levels of programme-making at home or abroad, of advertising levels and all other quotas should be done within the Authority itself, in consultation with those with responsibility but that, once those quotas have been determined, in the area of programme-making 25 per cent should be commissioned by the broadcasting sector from independent programme-makers here.  Campaign 25 recommends that a 25 per cent quota of all domestic schedules be sourced, on commission, within the independent film-making sector here.</P>
    <P>They continue, in their press release and attendant documentation, to suggest that that would lead to an increase of from 180 hours at present employed by <Col N="1409" /> RTE to 750 hours out of an annual quota of programming hours of 7,500.  At a costing of £20,000 per hour they claim that would release to that sector a sum of £15 million.  They argue that that constitutes the manner in which resources should be deployed from RTE if that needs to be done, contending that the redeployment would then take place under a constructive rather than repressive regime, recognising that there is a role to be played by the independent television sector.  They boast that, with those opportunities or suggestions being taken on board, they could increase their employment from a current figure of 250 to 300 to 1,000 people.  I am not yet in a position to defend or argue those figures. I do contend that such increased employment would afford an opportunity so that any shedding of employment by RTE as a consequence of the shifting of resources in this manner could easily be taken up within the independent private sector in due course.  They contend that one sector will help the other, that resources that will be transferred from the public to the private sector will be retained here in order to build up a strong, vibrant, independent, private film-making sector which, in turn, will enhance our cultural capacities to produce and broadcast here.</P>
    <P>It is argued that this system operates very well in Britain because emerging out of the arena of the 25 per cent concept in Britain is a strong independent indigenous film making sector in that market.  They make the case that it is a concept that can be phased in over a three year period in consultation with RTE. Again they acknowledge this need for phasing in and they say that if and when TV3 is established it should be implemented there from the start.</P>
    <P>These proposals are new, launched as late as yesterday, but nevertheless constructive and useful and should be considered in the context of what we are now trying to do.  The idea should be evaluated and its impact looked at by the Minister and his Department and by a commission, as we propose, in the context of what is being done here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> If it is true, and I believe it is, that this debate is about the moving around of resources as opposed to the simple, crude device that was originally intended of a direct rescue package or ambulance operation on the part of the Minister for ailing participants in the broadcasting market, then what they are arguing for is legitimate but is not accommodated in any way in the Minister's current proposals. I therefore believe that any deferral of this legislation to allow a review of what they contend would be very welcome.  It is a scheme that is working well in Britain, a scheme that has been brought to its ultimate conclusion in the USA where since 1971 there has been a proposal on the stocks to the effect that the national broadcasting authorities should make no programmes but must commission all their programme making to the independent sector and that the only programmes NBC and those other national broadcasting authorities make are news programmes.  That has had an impact on the ethos and quality of broadcasting in America.  Without commenting on the quality, one can certainly recongnise the strength that has emerged in that sector when our national broadcasting service, and indeed many of the European ones, rely heavily on the private sector film making produce of America.</P>
    <P>My point is that there is potential in the proposals being put forward and there is not a rigid objection to them in this House from The Workers' Party in the brief time we have had to reflect on them. All we are saying is that the opportunity should be taken to defer the proposals in this legislation to see if these ideas can be accommodated and to see if, in fact, there is common ground to be struck between the Minister and those of us on the opposite side who have a major concern that what he is doing will not achieve this ultimate end and that there is another way.  That is why we are asking the Minister, in the context of this amendment, to defer, to reflect and to review it in the way we suggest.</P>
    <P>The EC Directive that I referred to earlier is one of the bases for the Minister's arguments about what he should <Col N="1411" /> be doing and why.  Deputy Higgins addressed him directly on this issue.  Article 18 sets overall levels and apportionments of time whereas the Minister says that Article 19 is his justification for what he is doing.  It cannot be as simple as picking a convenient article in the directive. Here I am borrowing from the Minister who scolded me for being selective in my quoting from the directive.  Equally I would trun back that argument to him and suggest that it is in appropriate for a Minister to be selective in promoting legislation by saying that one article of the directive makes his case and that consequently he will rely on it.</P>
    <P>One should say here that this fundamentally important directive has never been debated in this House or in the Upper House or in the only other vehicle available to us, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  At European level important developments which have been taking place since the introduction of the 1988 legislation have not been debated and their import has not been taken on board in any depth by this House in considering their impact on the future of broadcasting as a cultural concept here.</P>
    <P>There is another argument for staying our hand on this legislation and for reviewing what the Minister is proposing. We should look to see whether there is more wide ranging guidance in the directive than simply choosing one article to defeat the argument from the other side of the House.  In this whole area the future of Teilifís na Gaeltachta is brought into question because the national campaign, Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse, have argued strongly and cogently that the future of the broadcasting service in Irish here is now in doubt and that there is concern as to whether what is proposed in the Bill will facilitate the development of an independent Irish service transmission. In a letter dated 31 May 1990 from Donncha Ó hEallaithe, the public relations officer of Feachtas Náisiúnta <Col N="1412" /> Teilifíse this point is made very congently. I quote from the second paragraph of that letter:</P>
    <P>We note that the Minister's proposals with regard to FM2 are intended effectively to deprive that station of its younger audience and thus divert advertising revenue from RTE.  We fear that the Minister may intend to do something similar to Network 2 &mdash; impose on it the burden of providing two hours per night in Irish, at peak viewing times, thus depriving non-Irish language speakers of some of their favourite home made programmes and diverting lost advertising revenue to other stations, including UTV.  We are totally opposed to such a cynical solution.</P>
    <P>Providing 2 hours per night on Teilifís na Gaeltachta, as a separate channel, has been costed by Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley and was found to be cheaper than providing the same amount of programming on Network 2.  Further, enraging non-Irish speakers, by reducing substantially their choice of sport, minority interest and home produced programmes, would do more damage than good.</P>
    <P>This group make the claim that there are fundamental consequences emerging from the proposals in the legislation. They have not been addressed in the legislation or in anything the Minister has said in the debate so far.  We argue again that this is another dimension that should be reviewed before we pass on from this section of the legislation.  There should be a deferral of the implementation of these proposals until we consider all the factors, establish our priorities and, in particular, address whether or not there is a commitment by the Government to the establishment of an independent Teilifís na Gaeltacht and whether or not there is substance in the case being made by Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse that it is cheaper and more effective to establish through TV3 an independent channel for Teilifís na Gaeltacht as opposed to piggy-backing that service on the already intended restricted hours of Network 2. <Col N="1413" /> These issues are fundamental to the future quality and nature of broadcasting and must be reviewed.  As I have said, they are not being addressed at the important stage of development of broadcasting as represented by today's debate and by the proposals in this Bill for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Equally, the question of community radio broadcasting arises.  I am not at all taken by the coincidental announcement by the commission that they are looking for responses to the ideas that licences might be issued some time in the future. I do not understand that.  I suspect a certain amount of coincidental timing of that announcement to take the heat from the Minister in the course of this debate. It is all too convenient for the Minister to say there is an advertisement in the newspapers seeking a response to proposals, when I know, as does the Minister and every other Deputy, that people in the community area have been lobbying long and hard for some consideration of their needs.</P>
    <P>The community radio network that exists on the north side of the city and involves many of the Minister's constituents &mdash; many of his own party members and colleagues are subscribers, as am I, to that network &mdash; have been wondering why they are not being invited to take up licences as envisaged by this legislation.  Now that a major debate is looming in the House, they are told it is time for them to make responses to the commission, when we all well know the lie of the land, the play that is in existence and the fact that there is no need for further responses.</P>
    <P>This is an unusual development and one I regret.  As I have said, I believe there is more than mere coincidence in what is emerging in this area and it calls into question basic commitments, if any exist, for the development of the community radio sector.  This Bill should be deferred until that most crucial area of the original legislation is properly addressed.  The commission are being asked to move into an area of operation dealing with the original legislation in the midst of a climate of controversy that will <Col N="1414" /> undoubtedly over-shadow the good work they can do in promoting and assisting the establishment of community broadcasting operations throughout the country.  We should deal with everything in the original legislation in terms of the structure that exists before we begin to dismantle that structure, change the goal posts or redefine the playing pitch.</P>
    <P>Finally, one must consider the advertising industry and the impact on jobs in that sector.  There is no doubt that what is being proposed will have a fundamental impact on the capacity of that industry to maintain employment and compete against outside influences, be it on the television or elsewhere.  There is no doubt that a substantial amount of the funds that will be provided by the Minister under the new section in the Bill will flow out of the country to major competitors such as Sky.  We know Sky TV have purchased the machinery in Britain to enable them network into the television broadcasting stations here in Irish-orientated advertising.  They expect a huge increase in the market as a result of what the Minister is doing and they are up to the minute in their response.  It is inevitable that the moneys will flow not only to them but also to UTV and others.  That is why we urge the Minister, with all force we can, to consider a breathing space or a stay of hand so that there will be an opportunity to consider the major issues that have not been addressed in the course of this debate and, indeed, in previous debates.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider even factors that have emerged overnight, be they from surveys, from press conferences or from people who are coming into this debate understandable at a late stage because of the speed with which events have been pressed upon us by the Government.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and see if there is merit in what we are arguing for in regard to the establishment of a commission, the review that would emerge from it and all the opportunities that would be afforded for the State and the independent private sector.  The issues, principles and perhaps <Col N="1415" /> rearrangements necessary should be considered with a view to achieving a common end, a varied mix that respects the State broadcasting sector, protects our cultural interests and at the same time allows for vibrancy in the market. The amendment deserves support and I would urge it on the House.</P>

From the early eighties, when the pirates began to dominate the air waves, it was obvious that we would have a problem. It was also obvious that the longer the problem remained untackled, the greater it would become.  The person who occupied the position of Minister for Communications during the period when the problem should have been tackled was Deputy Jim Mitchell&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1987 when Deputy Burke became Minister for Communications the problem had grown to awesome, almost unmanageable, proportions and a solution had to be found immediately.  Deputy Burke attempted to solve the problem on an emergency basis, as Deputy McCartan said.  We are still in the process of perfecting and implementing the solution the Minister arrived at.  The solution was devised by human beings and human beings are not perfect.  The response of The Workers' Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party has been to deride and treat with contempt every potential solution put forward by the Government.  They have rejected and derided the direct transfer of the finance proposal, they have derided the licence fee proposals and they have spent the last ten days &mdash; sometimes until 1 o'clock in the morning &mdash; deriding the advertising proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After ten years of debate, discussion papers, articles being written and speeches being made on this subject, The Workers' Party's solution is to say: &ldquo;we have no answer, let us set up a commission and let them try to find the answer&rdquo;.  That is the answer from a party who have often put themselves forward &mdash; both inside and outside this House &mdash; as the sole repository of all wisdom and knowledge.  Their solution is to set up another commission &mdash; another quango &mdash; and delay the resolution of this problem for years.  I say &ldquo;years&rdquo; because I know that Deputy McCartan has written into the amendment a proposal that the proposed commission report within 12 months.  I take it from his contribution that he envisages that the commission will issue a report, and there will be time for reflection, discussion and debate on it.  The culmination of the discussion, debate, reflection and consideration will <Col N="1417" /> be sent to the parliamentary draftsman who will draft proposals to be brought before the Dáil.  The net effect of Deputy McCartan's proposal is to delay finding a solution to this problem for three or possibly four years.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that point. Deputy McCartan has stated on a number of occasions during this debate that the subscribes to the idea that the broadcasting monopoly which is enjoyed by the public sector at present should be brought to an end.  No doubt he also subscribes to the idea that we should not return to the bad old days of the pirates. The Deputy knows well that if the solution to the problem is postponed for the period suggested in his proposal, that is exactly what would happen.  Deputy McCartan, the Minister and I know &mdash; the Minister has taken advice from all the relevant authorities on this matter &mdash; that if this legislation is not implemented in the immediate future a large part of the commercial radio sector will go to the wall.  That has been admitted and acknowledged by all sides, both inside and outside the House.</P>

      <P>Admittedly, part of the commercial radio sector will survive, it will struggle on, but would this not be a funny atmosphere for that part of the commercial radio sector to operate when they do not know what the ultimate conclusion of this famous commission will be?  Will the structures which they have set up and which they are operating now be subsumed into a new structure as a result of the deliberations of this commission? That is a most unhealthy, <Col N="1418" /> insecure and unreliable atmosphere for those people to survive in.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan questioned why there was such an urgency about getting this legislation on the Statute Book.  It is well known and acknowledged &mdash; and the figures are there to prove it &mdash; that a large part of the commercial radio sector will go to the wall if this solution which the Minister has taken on board is not perfected and implemented.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan has spoken about the need for further deliberation, debate, reflection, etc.  We have had ten years of debate and deliberation on this subject.  If any subject has been debated <i>ad nauseam</i> and almost to the point of exhaustion, that subject is broadcasting and the broadcasting sector in Ireland.  I hope this is the culmination of all the discussion, debate, report and consideration that have taken place over the past decade on this subject.  If the Workers' Party have a solution &mdash; they say they want to solve the problem, they want an alternative source of news and current affairs, they do not want to go back to the old days of the pirates &mdash; I urge them not to hide their light under a bushel but to let us hear their solution.  They have rejected the various proposals put forward by the Government without putting anything else in their place other than the suggestion that we set up another commission, or quango as it is known in Britain, to consider, debate and reflect further on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The discussion is coming to an end and if the Deputies have a solution &mdash; the Minister will be flexible and <Col N="1419" /> I want to find a solution to the problem, as I am sure Deputy McCartan and his party do &mdash; please let us hear it now.</P>

      <P>What we have to decide is whether the Minister's proposals provide the solution to the problem. I urge the Deputies present to reflect on the matter.  I am strongly of the view that the Minister's latest set of proposals will compound the problem and is not the solution to the problem, as Deputy O'Dea suggests.  On 29 May in his contribution to a Fine Gael motion the Minister announced that he would introduce a Bill containing certain provisions by the end of that week.  When that Bill was published the provisions it contained were radically different from those announced a few days earlier.  Within three or four days the proposals were changed yet again.  Therefore three sets of proposals were put forward in the one week.  Nobody can contend that the Minister has given this matter due consideration. I would like to tell Deputy O'Dea and the other Members present that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making any of these proposals the Minister was requested to meet several interest groups, such as The Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland and the Association of Advertisers in Ireland but he refused to do so.  He has still not met them.  Both of those bodies have produced very significant evidence which shows that rather than being the solution, the Minister's set of proposals will make the problem worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, no. In 1987 the Minister introduced a Bill on sound broadcasting which he was forced to change within 24 hours.  Something similar is happening now in that the provisions of this Bill have been changed not once but twice.  Deputy O'Dea knows in his heart &mdash; I do not expect him to admit this in the House &mdash; that this matter has not been given due consideration.</P>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy McCartan indicated that Deputy De Rossa had suggested the establishment of a commission on broadcasting in September 1982.  On being appointed Minister for Communications, I considered the question of whether a commission should be established to consider the future of broadcasting. However the previous commission had reported only seven and a half years earlier whereas now it is 16 years since they reported.  In that time there has been a veritable revolution in the area of information and telecommunications technology.  Sixteen years ago there were no satellite stations and television stations did not have the technology they now have and which has revolutionised broadcasting.  We are now in the era of transnational broadcasting. A draft EC Directive was issued by the Council of Europe after prolonged consideration. This will have enormous implications for broadcasting in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea said that in establishing a commission we would be putting the problem on the long finger.  However, in the House on 29 May I suggested that a time limit of six months be imposed so that the matter would not be put on the long finger.  It should be possible within that time for all the interest groups, such as the newspapers, the advertisers, Actors' Equity.  The Performing Right Society, now under a new name, and other legitimate interests to make their <Col N="1422" /> point of view known.  It should also be possible for the Minister, the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission to make their submissions which could then be dispassionately considered.  That was an eminently reasonable and sensible suggestion.  The problem is that proposals have been made without research having been carried out by the Minister's Department.  The only reasearch which has been carried out is the research which was carried out by Touche Ross on behalf of the then local radio commission during my term as Minister for Communications.</P>

      <P>Here we are making proposals which could have a crucial impact on a number of groups apart from RTE.  The people in RTE may be seen to have a vested interest in defending their bastion.  We have to see whether the comments and criticisms of RTE personnel have any substance.  Whereas in the opinion of some there may have been over-reaction by RTE, there can be little doubt that the proposals before us will have a disastrous impact.  It is not just that they will lose £12 million per year. Such a reduction in one year would lead to chaos and certainly would not be contemplated in any private enterprise.  Following the enactment of this Bill there will be no reason for enterprise or endeavour within RTE.  If they are enterprising they will reach their income limit early in the year.  All enterprise will be stifled.  It is a recipe for stagnation in RTE which I invite Deputies opposite to consider.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dea will know how important it is to reward effort and to encourage enterprise.  If the result of enterprise is that the revenue is capped, this is by far the most adverse aspect of these proposals.  It is self-evident that the impact on RTE will be adverse, to put it mildly.  Other people have legitimate rights which ought to be <Col N="1425" /> listened to.  These include independent programme producers, advertisers, producers of advertisements, Actors' Equity and the Performers' Rights Society.</P>

      <P>It is possible that all the points they would make could not be accepted but it is very unfair and ill-advised to proceed with drastic proposals, changed twice in the course of one week, without affording all these interest groups the opportunity to make their case.  The Minister has refused to meet these groups.  Is that reasonable?

      <P>It was urgent because we were told that Century Radio was on the brink of collapse.  The staff were guaranteed their wages only until 31 May.  Even though the idea of a national alternative radio service and television service was the brian-child of the Minister and not of his advisers or his Department and despite the fact that any research available to us in office posed serious questions about the viability of such alternatives, we took the view that a national alternative having been created was a good thing, if we could reasonably retain it.  Competition is good for RTE and for the listener.  We felt there was a case for once-off help to Century to get over teething problems, some of which were of their own making and some of which were not.  The Minister rushed them on to the air against their better judgment and the Independent Radio and Television Commission, or perhaps the <Col N="1426" /> Department, awarded a mish-mash of wavelengths to Century.  The urgency was to save Century but the Bill as proposed to be amended has no prospect of helping Century and therefore all urgency is gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pertinent to the amendment.  I am arguing for a commission and against any rushed job.  All we are involved in now is saving the Minister's face; we are not involved in saving broadcasting.  If the Minister were to accept that the urgency had gone he might have to face a little ribbing but the reputation of politicians in this House for maturity would be enhanced.</P>
      <P>Therefore, even if the Minister is not prepared to accept The Workers' Party amendment in its present form or the similar amendment I have put down, I ask him to come in on Report Stage with his own amendment and maybe some reasonable compromise will be brought about and whatever immediate problems the Minister sees can be tackled pending a review.  In order to avoid the problems Deputy O'Dea feared, the Minister might wish to suggest a time limit along the lines suggested in the original Fine Gael motion.</P>
      <P>Why is the commission necessary? Deputy McCartan and Deputy Higgins quoted extensively yesterday from a draft EC Directive on the question of broadcasting. Countries in the rest of Europe which have more than one neighbour have a complex problem.  For instance, Belgium has Dutch, Luxembourg, German, British and French broadcasting media to cope with.  Our only neighbour is the UK, therefore in essence the issues raised by transnational broadcasting in our context effectively involve only the UK and ourselves.  There may be some exceptions in satellite stations but they are very rare and have very little impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor special to these two <Col N="1427" /> islands is that we speak the same language, whereas that is not so on the continent of Europe; most of the states have another language as well as their first language. We must acknowledge that most countries of Europe are more proficient in alternative languages, especially the languages of their neighbouring countries, than we are.  Nonetheless the use of the neighbouring language is not nearly as extensive as is our use of the English language.  Our broadcasting media and the British broadcasting media are all using the same language, not completely but virtually completely.</P>
    <P>In the studies of the Council of Europe and European Commission all sorts of issues have been addressed and especially the rights of transnational broadcasting including transnational broadcasting of advertising.  This has major implications for the funding of broadcasting in the future.  In our discussions so far on this legislation we have been talking about capping advertising, as if the Irish advertising pool were something with a precise boundary that could not spill over into the neighbouring, much bigger pool.  The reality is that our advertising pool is just a little inlet of the advertising pool based in London and with the development of technology and the rapid extension of transnational broadcasting we will have, throughout our State within the next couple of years, the availability of an extensive number of British based stations, both terrestrial and satellite and in the case of satellite both direct and indirect broadcasting satellites.  Many of these would be advertising based.  In the Council of Europe and EC documents it is specified that not only must there be uninhibited acceptance of broadcasts from other countries but where they are accepted there must be uninhibited access for advertising.  In other words, we could not take the programme and not have the advertising.</P>
    <P>In Britain a select committee of the House of Commons have considered the Peacock report and other reports and based on all these findings a White Paper on broadcasting has been produced.  They <Col N="1428" /> insist in their White Paper that, as a cardinal principle of British broadcasting policy, there must be an uninhibited flow of advertising across national boundaries. That has enormous implications for the advertising pool based in Dublin, therefore it has enormous implications not only for the future viability of RTE but for the future viability of any alternative broadcasting system.  Less centrally, the Irish newspapers have a problem but they are not or cannot potentially be as adversely affected in this respect as the electronic media here can be.  Nonetheless, newspapers have a very direct and legitimate interest because they too depend for their survival and prosperity largely on the same advertising pool.</P>
    <P>These are complex questions.  I said in my speech on the Fine Gael Private Members' motion which started off this debate four weeks ago that it was a rubic cube and if you moved one set of squares you upset all the others.  The Minister is turning the rubic cube to get one square in place and then when he goes to look at the other squares he will find them all out of place and there is more confusion than there was at the outset.  Therefore, I urge the Minister and those opposite very strongly to extricate themselves from the heat of this battle and consider some approach along the lines proposed in the amendments.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can confine the terms of reference of any such review body merely to broadcasting.  We have to take in the other questions, including those related to newspapers.  Undoubtedly our newspapers have a case because they are operating at a disadvantage.  Newspaper cover charge is at a rate of 10 per cent here.  It was 25 per cent and we reduced it to 10 per cent.  Advertising is charged at 23 per cent.  In the UK the cover charge of newspapers has a zero VAT rate and advertising has a VAT rate of 15 per cent. Regarding competition for RTE, some people in this debate have been talking about RTE as if the only competition was from Century or potentially from TV3, whereas RTE's main competition now and in the future will be British based stations, the BBC, ITV and whatever <Col N="1429" /> satellite stations there are.  Likewise, our newspapers not only have to compete with each other but also with British newspapers, who benefit from economies of scale and operate under a more beneficial VAT regime.</P>
    <P>Funding, while it is central to the future of broadcasting, is not the only question that should be considered by the commission. There are enormous implications for consumer rights: how can our consumer rights be enforced if consumers are misled by advertising carried on foreign based stations?  We have also to consider the issues of good taste, public order and the question of sex and violence on television.  The implications of different standards being permitted on transnational broadcasting stations than would be acceptable to public taste here have to be considered.  The question of copyright, performing rights and other issues have also to be considered.  There is a very strong case to be made for examining this whole area on calm reflection.</P>
    <P>This is not something I have been saying for the past few weeks.  I proposed this publicly in Cork on 12 February 1990, in essence the date on which this whole debate started.  Before I proposed an independent review body I had, over a number of months, consulted with the interest groups and the faculties of communications in our universities, all of whom felt it was an appropriate and timely proposal.  I made that proposal in a public speech in Cork on 12 February and I disclosed that the Minister intended to do something along the lines which he now proposes, but of course it was denied on that occasion.  It was denied again on 27 February 1990, in this House.  There is no harm to reflect on that background. The Minister may want to reflect on the record since 12 February when he inadvisedly denied what is now known to be true.  Let us forget about that for the moment and look ahead.  In two, three or four years' time I hope the debate in this House will not have proved to be futile but will have managed somehow to set the right parameters for a vibrant Irish broadcasting sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendments in question for a number of reasons.  In the first place, the amendment seeks the deferral of the legislation which we are currently debating.  The Government believe that this legislation is necessary and that it should be implemented at the earliest possible date. It is part of a logical and coherent process which commenced in 1987 when I, as Minister for Communications, took in hand the chaos which had been allowed to develop in the broadcasting sector &mdash; and which has been referred to so well by Deputy O'Dea in his contribution &mdash; under the preceding administration and restored order and control to the broadcasting environment.</P>
      <P>I put in place the necessary regulatory framework to enable the Irish public create their own multiplicity of choice. We did not, quite frankly, need a review group or commission to point out the mess broadcasting was in at that time and, indeed, we could not afford to waste any more time, as the previous Government had done for almost five years &mdash; as Deputy Mitchell has just admitted.</P>
      <P>Likewise, the pace of developments at international level required that early and firm action be taken at national level if we were to have any opportunity to build up a strong and vibrant Irish broadcasting industry which could compete effectively with the multitude of new external services, many with an international dimension, which were about to come on stream.</P>
      <P>If there was any merit at all in the notion of a review group, the early eighties was the time to establish it when it might have been able to make some contribution not alone to the national framework needed for broadcasting but also to the international framework. Even if the then Government could have done that much instead of wasting their time squabbling about ideological hang-ups, they might have been able to claim they had made some worthwhile contribution to the broadcasting landscape here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the national framework &mdash; thanks to the firm action of this Government &mdash;<Col N="1431" /> and the international framework for the development of broadcasting are now settled.  For example, among the issues which this amendment sees being addressed by the commission is the development of community broadcasting, but we have already set up, through the Radio and Television Act, 1988, and independent commission which will have responsibility under that Act for developing the community broadcasting sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Having inherited the mess left by Deputy Mitchell after his time in Government, I considered it was a time for action rather than for appointing a commission.  As I have said, there is already legislation in place to allow for the development of community broadcasting under the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  We have an independent commission which will have responsibility under that Act for developing the community broadcasting sector and they have already indicated their intention of doing so &mdash; irrespective of the calls for another commission here.</P>
      <P>The amendment also proposes an examination of the development of a Teilifís na Gaeltachta, but we have had two reports on this area in the recent past, &mdash; the May 1987 report of the Working Group on Irish Language Television Broadcasting and more recently the Údarás na Gaeltachta report on Teilifís na Gaeltachta and I cannot see anything being achieved by commissioning another study on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a time for action.  As I said, we are following a logical and rational line in our broadcasting policy.  We created the conditions to allow new entrants to come into the broadcasting sector in 1988 and having done so it is now incumbent upon us to create conditions in which participants can compete fairly and that is the fundamental objective of this legislation. The earlier that objective is <Col N="1432" /> achieved the better it will be for the future strength and vitality of the whole broadcasting sector.</P>

      <P>In one of his contributions during which he did not call for a quorum, Deputy Mitchell referred to the transnational problems and the need for standards in transnational broadcasting.  He also called for the setting up of a commission to examine these questions. Deputy Mitchell seems to be unaware &mdash; one would think that as a former Minister and spokesman on communications he would be aware of this &mdash; that we already have a Council of Europe Convention and European Community Directive directly relating to this area.  Article 22 of the European Community Directive states, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that television broadcasts by broadcasters under their jurisdiction do not include programmes which might seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular those that involve pornography or gratuitous violence. This provision shall extend to other programmes which are likely to impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, except where it is ensured, by selecting the time of the broadcast or by any technical measure, that minors in the area of transmission will not normally here or see such broadcasts.</P>
      <P>Member States shall also ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.</P>
      <P>Article 7 of Chapter II of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, which deals with the responsibilities of the broadcaster, states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1. All items of programme services, as concerns their presentation and content, shall respect the dignity of <Col N="1433" /> the human being and the fundamental rights of others.</P>
    <P>In particular, they shall not:</P>
    <P>(a)  be indecent and in particular contain pornography;</P>
    <P>(b)  give undue prominence to violence or be likely to incite to racial hatred.</P>
    <P>2.  All items of programme services which are likely to impair the physical, mental or moral development of children and adolescents shall not be scheduled when, because of the time of transmission and reception, they are likely to watch them.</P>
    <P>3.  The broadcaster shall ensure that news fairly presents facts and events and encourages the free formation of opinions.</P>
    <P>In calling for the setting up of a commission in this area Deputy Mitchell is calling for the wheel to be reinvented. That work is already being carried out.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the vitality of the broadcasting sector.  I have sat here for days and listened to Deputy Mitchell and others say that the independent operation was the brainchild of Burke, that it was never going to work and has been shown not to have worked.  Thankfully, we now have the results of the Joint National Listenership Research survey carried out recently over a two month period by the Market Research Bureau of Ireland, at the behest of RTE, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the main advertising agencies and the major advertisers.  The results of this survey have been leaked to the media so I feel at liberty to refer to sections of it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that on average weekday 87 per cent of the population, representing about 2.197 million people, listen to radio and that 75 per cent of those listen to an RTE station some time during the day while 40 per cent, or over 1 million people, listen at some time during the day to <Col N="1434" /> an independent station established under the 1988 Act.  These stations started to come on air last September, some of them came on air during the spring and a few more have still to come on air.  The success of the 1988 legislation, therefore, can be seen in this survey.  The survey shows a very interesting figure in the case of local station areas, whether it be Clare, Galway or Mayo.  Thirty-seven per cent of the population in those areas listen to their local station at some time during the day compared with 35 per cent who listen to Radio 2FM.  Of course, Radio 1 is by far the most successful radio station, with a 52 per cent male listenership and a 54 per cent female listenership, giving an average of a 53 per cent listenership. It is an excellent station which has served this country well and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note that while RTE, with over 60 years experience in the broadcasting business, have 75 per cent of the listenership at some time during the day, the independent stations, which have less than 9 months experience in this area, have a listenership of over 40 per cent or 1 million people.  This is a very heartening statistic from my point of view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the report, commissions <Col N="1435" /> and examinations and now is the time for progress.  The 1988 legislation, which has been seen to operate in an effective manner, was the first phase and we are following a rational and logical line in our broadcasting policy.  We created the conditions which allowed new entrants to come into the broadcasting sector.  They are now in and it is incumbent on us to create the conditions in which they can compete fairly.  That is the fundamental objective of this legislation.  The figures which have been released today &mdash; they are not mine nor the Government's &mdash; show that there is room in the market place but we need to ensure that the environment, both in terms of advertising and revenue, is such that the electronic and print media in the independent sector can thrive side by side with a strong and vibrant RTE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the fundamental objective of this legislation is to ensure that there is a vibrant commercial radio network but I suggest that this is the fourth objective. We first had the Bill of 29 May which proposed taking some of the licence fee and diverting it via the commission to the private sector.  We then had the curbing of the activities of Radio 2FM.  We are now down to the capping of advertising which the Minister has described at this stage as the fundamental objective of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the comments in last Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i> on what this debate is really about.  It was stated in an article in that paper that this debate was all about the control of communications, the MMDS system, which has yet to be developed, and power.  That is the real argument.  I respectfully suggest that some of points made were completely irrelevant and bear no resemblance whatsoever to the Minister's real intentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government believed this legislation was necessary but from the vibes around this House &mdash; gossip travels very quickly around here &mdash; it seems that not all members of the <Col N="1436" /> Government are happy about the Minister's proposals.  He said that this Bill would bring order into broadcasting. Despite the assurances that we would be given ample time to discuss these matters we have now been told that the guillotine will be applied to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to ideological hangups on the part of the Opposition. Is the Minister suggesting to the House that he does not have any ideological hang-ups?  Does he not regard this piece of chicanery now being foisted on us as part of an ideological gospel?  He referred to community broadcasting which was set up in 1988.  Two years have elapsed and nothing has been done and that begs the question, why?  When will action be taken?</P>
    <P>The Minister has yet to convince me, and many other people, about the need for the Bill.  I consider that his intentions are dubious.  I imagine that what we are talking about is control of communications. The Minister wants to ensure that there will not be an independent voice on the airwaves to properly represent the people of Ireland.  Instead, we will have a very influential clique taking control of communications.  It is important that the House is at all times vocal in its opposition to the measures presented by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment but only as a fall-back.  I do not have any difficulty about the suggestion that a commission should be established.  Such a move would be welcome but I respectfully suggest that the proper course to follow is to abandon the Bill, put it on the shelf, forget about it and let it gather dust.  I tabled amendments in an effort to minimise the damage that will be inflicted on public broadcasting if the Minister's measures are adopted.  In view of the development in communications worldwide, and the speed with which technology is developing, there is a need for a debate on the issue, not the type of argy-bargy we have had in the House in recent days.  It has been the most acrimonious debate I have witnessed in my nine years as a Member.  Ill feeling prevails due to the way the Government are <Col N="1437" /> dealing with the Bill.  The Workers' Party suggested in 1982 that a White Paper on broadcasting should be produced; the Labour Party made a similar request later and Deputy Mitchell in Private Members' Business some weeks ago suggested that a report on broadcasting be produced. That is the correct course to follow.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the Minister's position.  However, I admire him in that he is prepared to press on regardless, despite what is said in the House.  He has the ability to completely ignore the point being made by Members.  He reads his prepared script and stands by its contents. The Minister presents legislation on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  He responds to one crisis after another.  We have crisis management and today we are dealing with the crisis in private sector broadcasting. The events of the last month are a clear illustration of the Minister's intentions. The Bill was published on 28 May and following that there were amendments, and amendments to amendments, in the name of the Minister.  That indicates to me that the Minister is not paying any attention to what is going on, although he accepts that there is a problem to be tackled.  He has scant regard for the long-term requirements of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attack on Deputy Mitchell was to a degree unfair, bearing in mind that the document produced in 1988 had been, by and large, prepared by Deputy Mitchell.  The Labour Party opposed that document when it was produced by Deputy Mitchell when he was Minister.  It is worth mentioning the number of Acts dealing with broadcasting. We started in 1926 with the Wireless Telegraphy Act and we had a Broadcasting Authority Act in 1960, a Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act in 1976, a Local Radio Bill in 1985, a Broadcasting Wireless Telegraphy Bill in 1987, a Sound Broadcasting Bill in 1987, the Radio and Television Act, 1988, and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988.  In 1990 we have the Broadcasting Bill Mark II.  The Bill before us is different from the one circulated on 29 May.  It has been altered to such an extent that it is practically <Col N="1438" /> unrecognisable.  How can the Minister suggest that he has been consistent and has charted a course for the development of broadcasting?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea is a young Member who has made some very fine contributions in the House but the same cannot be said of his contribution today.  He has given as a reason for pushing through the legislation that if it is not passed we will revert back to the days of the pirates.  I do not think anything could be further from the truth.  Deputy O'Dea reminded us that in 1988 the Minister put through both Houses legislation to cope with this but I wonder why the Minister has so little faith in that Act.  The Bill should be dropped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very worried about the attitude that the Minister, and the Government, are taking to the Bill. The Minister has an entrenched view about how broadcasting should develop. When the first Broadcasting Bill was floated in 1988 the Minister held the view that he should be the person with the authority to give out franchises and to determine the quality and direction of broadcasting for the independent sector. At that stage he was willing and open enough to accept that he did not have the monopoly on wisdom.  He could see that the House had different views and he accepted many of those views.  However, on this occasion the Minister is adopting a completely different attitude.  He is seeking to hide behind the guillotine to push through the Bill before the House has an opportunity to debate many of the important amendments that have been tabled.  The Minister sees himself as something of a Horatio at the bridge fighting back the invading hordes but he is failing to look at who is ranked among the ranks of the Etruscans.  It is not only the Opposition who recognise in the Minister's proposals the most damaging blow ever inflicted on broadcasting.  If one looks at those who have led cultural movements here, who have been at the head of the literary, cultural and language exellence associated with broadcasting, one will see that they have come out <Col N="1439" /> clearly and resolutely against the Minister's proposals.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not standing at the bridge holding back the hordes.  He is like &mdash; to use the mixed metaphor &mdash; a person who has climbed out on the ledge and regards as an hysterical attack on him the actions of people who are trying to persuade him to climb back in and save himself.  The transformation in the Minister's view about broadcasting from hour to hour and day to day betrays a lack of any serious consideration about what broadcasting means and how we can achieve diversity in our broadcasting without damaging quality.  The Minister is here to achieve that.  The Minister started out with faith in the light touch, faith in advertising and saying that this was the means of competition and the way broadcasting would develop.  He told us that this was the way we would get good quality and diverse broadcasting.  The Opposition do not see it in those terms.  The Minister has said that advertising does not represent a way of competing as far as RTE and the other stations are concerned, and that RTE are not to have the opportunity to compete with the other stations.</P>
      <P>The result of this for RTE and for broadcasting will, as other speakers point out, be dreadful in the long term.  We have been particularly fortunate in having in RTE one of the very high quality broadcasting services in Europe, despite the small population into which they are selling their programmes.  If the Minister's proposals go ahead success in broadcasting by RTE will not be rewarded.  If they succeed in building up an audience for their home produced quality programmes to even 100 per cent they will not get one penny more in revenue to further develop and improve those programmes.  How can one possibly hope to run a business or any organisation on that basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of the remarks by the Minister and his colleagues in Government is that Ireland must develop competitively and build an economy where <Col N="1440" /> success is rewarded.  However, the Minister's formula for RTE, one of the success stories of the State sector, will mean that RTE will be capped, contained, reduced and eventually strangled in the interests of producing alternative stations which &mdash; he has taken on faith &mdash; will offer a selection and diversity of programmes in which we do not have any faith.  If the Minister gets his way, RTE's situation will be worse than that of any civil servant because they will be entirely beholden to the Minister in relation to what they do.  Effectively, under these proposals, RTE will be coming to the Minister with an estimate for their budget on a year by year basis.  They will not be able to spend more money unless they get the Minister's say so.  That feature is shared by other public servants in the ordinary Civil Service but, worse than that, RTE will be inextricably linked to an earmarked tax.  Which of us on this side of the House believes that our services for education, social welfare, housing or anything else would develop if they were linked to an unpopular user tax, based &mdash; not on ability to pay &mdash; but on a flat charge across the board to all those with television or radio receivers?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that RTE are doing a good job and that they need more resources.  If his proposals go through he will continually contain the RTE budget. Therefore, in real terms, RTE's spending power will be reduced continually over the coming years.  That is why this amendment is so important because we have never had a serious debate about where broadcasting should go.  In the modern world communications are cheap and we cannot keep out alternative stations; we must examine how we can develop an Irish sector which is both diverse and high in quality.</P>
    <P>The proposal of establishing a commission which would examine these issues is long overdue.  It should have preceded the original legislation but, thankfully, as a result of a very lengthy debate in this House on the 1988 Act, we succeeded &mdash; through a lot of work on both sides of the House &mdash; in getting a <Col N="1441" /> Bill which provided good quality choice in the independent sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude on this occasion is quite the opposite.  We will have this legislation rammed through without a proper debate by any sections &mdash; inside or outside the House &mdash; about its implications. All the indications are that the approach taken by the Minister will do irreparable damage to RTE's capacity to continue to produce quality programmes. They will be forced to change the type of broadcasting they produce to try to capture a mid-Atlantic or mid-European audience and to develop programmes for export in the hope that they can eke out their meagre resources.  We will see a dramatic change in the sort of programmes being offered.  Home produced drama will be particularly squeezed because it tends to be limited to Irish audiences.  The only hope is to build up a high audience rating to get a return in revenue to supplement what is available from the licence fee.  Under the formula dreamt up by the Minister, those sort of programmes will suffer most.</P>
    <P>The notion that we can have competition where one station will have a fixed budget while others are free to develop and expand their advertising revenue as the basis for new programmes is a new proposal from the Minister.  There cannot be a proper, balanced development of broadcasting under that proposal. If anything, the Minister's second thoughts on this issue are worse than the first because his first thoughts at least had the merit that the Minister would have had to come into the House annually and pose a capping formula to contain RTE's revenue.  We would have had the opportunity to debate the issue with him and to try to persuade him of the merits of a decent budget for RTE.  Under the new formula the budget will be set in legislation for all time.  Other Members sought indexation but this has also been denied.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take congnisance of the growing opposition from all sections to this issue.  I fear that it will jeopardise the further industrial and economic peace <Col N="1442" /> and sense of social cohesion about a programme for recovery.  It is this sort of boneheaded approach to an issue of this kind that puts people off the notion that a lot can be achieved through co-operation. The trade union movement must be looking very critically at what is going on here and it must seriously influence their attitude to the Government.  That is a dangerous development.  No one disputes that RTE perform excellently and have increased their home made programmes while reducing their costs, meeting competition from abroad and at home and beating it.  That jewel in the crown of the State sector is to be subjected to a formula which no Civil Service operation under the thumb of the Minister would accept.  The Minister must think again and the virtue of this amendment is that it offers him &mdash; without losing face &mdash; an opportunity to have a proper and detailed investigation into how we can achieve what the Minister is committed to, getting diversity into broadcasting without damaging quality.</P>
    <P>This proposal, with its balanced make-up of people from different walks of life with various skills, would provide us with a blueprint for broadcasting into the nineties which is so badly needed.  I hope the Minister will accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this amendment.  I want to refer to its justification in a very practical sense and to reply to some of the Minister's comments in his welcome sixth intervention to the Committee Stage debate.</P>
      <P>The idea of a commission is that it would make possible the generation of the principle of a broadcasting policy. The Minister, in replying to that argument, suggested that there would have been room for this concept in the eighties but that the case for it now was very different.  This argument is not sustainable. There was a case for it in the eighties and it is interesting that in 1982 The Workers' Party, for example, as Deputy McCartan pointed out, were pressing for a Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make no secret with regard to one of <Col N="1443" /> the points made, that was in relation to the Labour Party's approach towards it in the same period.  When we were faced with legislation in 1982 I recall very clearly that our first suggestion was that legislation in this complex area should be preceded by a White Paper.  I have very definite reasons for holding that view at that time.  Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, I and the late Frank Cluskey discussed this regularly in a sub-committee within the Labour Party.  We believed that the complexity of the broadcasting issues involved would benefit thereform.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on the part of one party there was a demand for a commission and, on the part of another, a demand for a White Paper.  In a totally unemotive way may I explain the difficulty to which the Minister referred in what he has just said, of my squabbling about ideological hang-ups.  It was no such thing; those were the Minister's words.  The last of the 14 points of the joint programme for Coalition between the Labour Party and Fine Gael did not constitute a defensive line.  It did not say at all there shall not be community broadcasting or independent broadcasting.  It said that community and independent broadcasting shall be developed within the spirit of public service broadcasting.  There was a very legitimate tension, for example, between people who wanted to proceed with the independent end of it and our emphasis on the community end of it, on retaining what was the great strength, legacy and contribution of public service broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister was somewhat negative in his latest contribution.  He is really saying: I came and brought order to and control out of chaos.  I do not want to go down that old road again, contending that, for example, one could make people obey the law by invoking the provisions of the 1962 Act.  That choice was not taken; it was decided that two further Bills were needed.  It was suggested that a commission would be a waste of time. I shall address that issue very clearly. Here is the answer to the contention that it would be a waste of time: the one <Col N="1444" /> directive referred to by Deputy McCartan and I yesterday is one with many implications in relation to Irish broadcasting. Surely it would be very valuable if the working out of that directive could ensure that its terms or provisions would come within the ambit of the commission? The Minister himself will be aware also &mdash; because he made reference to a separate Directive &mdash; the one on the content of broadcasting and broadcasting standards as they relate to pornography, racism and so on, within the terms of the Irish Presidency of the EC &mdash; that there are other directives in preparation by the Commission.  Would it not be very valuable to have a commission in place that could not only respond &mdash; as Deputy McCartan pointed out &mdash; to the implications of this Bill but could encompass the inheritance of other legislation in the broadcasting arena, which would be in position to discuss developments in Europe in regard to draft directives, Commission proposals and the continuing debate on European broadcasting?</P>
    <P>It is really not a party political matter. If you like it is an Irish citizen's matter &mdash; that is the best way I can describe it &mdash; with regard to the notion that a commission is a waste of time, that the time for such existed in the eighties only. That is an extraordinary view.  It would be similar to saying that the only time for a Constitution was in 1937 and, therefore, one should never review it for several centuries thereafter.  What is very important from a citizen's point of view is this: the issue with which this or any other Minister responsible for broadcasting has to deal, is that what we are witnessing in our time is the integration of the domestic communications system into an international marketplace for the cultural and media hardware.  There is a momentum in information technology that nobody can argue stopped in the eighties.  For example, there is a discussion continuing at present &mdash; by way of illustrating my point that this commission is relevant &mdash; about the very future of the European Broadcasting Union because of the impact of satellite <Col N="1445" /> on, say, the coverage of international sporting events.  The evidence is there already &mdash; referred to in a book entitled &ldquo;Media, Culture and Society&rdquo; published by Sage, London, 1989, in an article written by Professor Desmond Bell and Niall Meehan.  They discuss, in a footnote, the implications of the satellite bids for the coverage of the United States 1988 golf championships which meant that a number of stations could not compete.  If one has to compete with international satellite stations for coverage of one major event, then one does so at the cost of one's domestic budget.</P>
    <P>These are non-party points.  They hinge on the question of the relationship of Ireland, its citizens, an Irish communications policy, in an ever evolving, changing international communications context.  To say that the commission should not address the implications of satellite; to contend that they would not be able, for example, to review the changes of mind &mdash; and people are entitled to do so &mdash; in relation to MMDS; to argue that a commission would not have a contribution to make in the continuing arguments about cable; to contend that the commission does not have a contribution to make or to speak about the whole future of how we should use the new UHF channels available to us; for example, the balance between the lower frequencies needed for the telecommunications industry and the other frequencies more suitable for telebroadcasts and other purposes, is to raise real questions.</P>
    <P>In an effort to reply to two of the points the Minister made, I might say that the speed of information technology was not arrested in the eighties.  I would say more than that &mdash; that the momentum is, if anything, gaining.  What is at present being debated in Europe &mdash; in Italy, France and other countries &mdash; is that we are facing an age in information technology that is dominated by Japanese hardware and United States software. For example, North America produces 86 per cent of all the &ldquo;soap&rdquo; material watched in the whole of Europe.  The debate in Europe is about whether it is <Col N="1446" /> possible at all to have a European contribution. They then pose the interesting question of how we get into a programming position at European level to give us even the concept of a European broadcasting culture, beneath which is a related argument in relation to how different member states of the EC manage to create or, if they have it, retain a national broadcasting culture.  The way one goes about this is very interesting.  If one places inhibitions on those trying to manage either of the two latter projects I have mentioned, the national or European one, and if one says to them that their advertising budget will be capped, that they are thereby limiting their available budget, they then have the choice of watching other international systems compete with them.  In turn this means that, if they are to capture one significant international series, or one international coverage, let us say, of a sports event, they must do so at the cost of the components of their internal station programming.</P>
    <P>The first thing in the defensive posture situation will be to direct one's attention to those who are, perhaps, at the periphery of or external to core activities.  Hence the very correct emphasis on the danger to the people who are independents, who are supplying to their best customer. They are the people who are most in danger.  There are about 90 of them.  They hire between five and ten people each depending on their stage of evolution. The next people to go, because one has to shrink back to oneself, are the people in the formative stage of getting into film or broadcasting to whom one could give, for example, equipment on lease or free. Then one is back within the station and within the station itself one looks, for example, at the costly items of programming. Let us say one puts in a bid for an international event.  One will therefore have less money for other things, and the things that will go will, of course, be the minority interest things first and then things like cultural and drama programmes.  The relevance of this, therefore, in that dimension is very <Col N="1447" /> interesting if people wanted to try to put themselves in the position of a decision maker within a station which is effected by this legislation.  These are the things that will arise at the meetings that will be taking place every week and every month.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another interesting thing which has not been raised in this debate but which a commission should look at.  It is peculiarly appropriate that it should arise just as we leave the Irish Presidency.  I was in Athens two years ago at a conference on the implications of satellite television and one of the things that came out of that conference was very interesting.  The representative of the EBU said that if they were forced into competition with major satellite investors to provide things like international sports events and so forth, they will have to change the rate they charge Eastern Europe because what not many people know is that long before the changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe, the Eastern European countries got cheap linkups to the Eurovision Song contest and a whole series of other things like that.  In other words, they did not have to pay the market-place rate and there was a system whereby it was regarded that by simple membership of the EBU and the Link Treaty, with its equivalent in Eastern Europe, one's lack of resources would not ever stop one participating in a major international broadcasting event. The proof of what I am saying about the implications of satellite is very interesting. It is that the board of the EBU have again and again said that they cannot go on with this kind of ethical solidarity among international broadcasters if they are forced into the international marketplace by developments within satellite.</P>
    <P>One can take that argument back down from the question of the international broadcasting arena, through the European broadcasting arena I mentioned and bring it into the international arena. These are the issues.  May be the Minister may have people who will tell him that I am wrong on one or all of these points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> The great value of having a commission is that at least these points will be replied to.  Maybe there are different opinions but I believe that this is the orderly way to do it.  There are many other things that the commission can do.</P>
    <P>There are other things that are interesting. In the amendment it says that the commission shall publish a report, it shall seek approval from both Houses of the Oireachtas and then that the sections of the Bill and so forth may or may not, by decision of the Minister of the day, come into effect.  What that is doing is replying to a criticism that is frequently made by people who are in favour of public service broadcasting.  It is giving accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas; it is saying that on the issues of broadcasting the legislation is there and we have decided to take up all the items that have been raised in the debate, that we have listened to the interest groups, to the independent film makers, the broadcasters, the advertisers, the people who purchase advertising space and we believe these would be the implications. It seems there is an unanswerable case for having such a reasoned approach because what it is doing is simply saying we will consider the implications in all the sectors. I cannot see how there can be such a logical case.  The Minister's response is that he brought order and control to a condition of chaos and that a commission would be a waste of time and that the pace of change requires firm action now. Yes, we need firm action; but we need firm action based on policy.  We need policy based on debate, and we need that debate to be informed and informed of all the possibilities that are there for us, whatever party we belong to, as people, as members of Europe and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the eighties was the time for the review group, in other words, that all the reflection should have been done before the man of action took over.  It is a very foolish person who goes barging forward without the basis of a broadcasting policy and if I am wrong in that, Sir, why was it right a few weeks ago to seek to balance the revenue, the licence fee and advertising in RTE by <Col N="1449" /> approaching the matter in the context of the licence fee plus FM2 and then going on to advertising, and then certainly a few weeks later it was not right?  Perhaps the pace of change in the Department is very fast.  It is certainly very considered.</P>
    <P>There are other issues in relation to community broadcasting.  I will not go down that road but I will simply say, in addition to what my colleague, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan has said, that there was always a problem with the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in the title.  We spent a long time on the title last night and I intervened to say that there were other matters that we should push on to.  There is a genuine debate as to what is independent radio, commercial radio and community radio and there is no point in fudging these interests.  There was a genuine concern that the people who are investing funds in radio were coming to the top of the queue and that it was quite far down that one had the people looking for community radio licences.  I was approached by a group of people once about the Broadcasting Bill and how they could apply for a licence.  That was over two years ago, and they had a very good case and they could be viable.  If it were all to be balanced there would have been some independent applications granted and then some community ones and so on.  It is rather extraordinary to accept that the major commercial independent ones would be granted and that all the community ones would be batched together and then released suddenly as if one were lifting a dam.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to amendment No. 2 made reference to Teilifís na Gaeltachta. He asked why there should be any bother about this and had there not been a report by Údarás na Gaeltachta and a report within the Department of Communications.  There is a long saga attached to this and it is a very simple one.  The terms of reference of the commission are clearly specified in amendment No. 3; they relate to the question of culture.  It is a broadcasting issue to decide which road one is to take in relation to communications affecting the Irish language.  There is an old lobby that <Col N="1450" /> argued, for example, that one should have more hours on the national television network.  I believe there are floating around proposals to dump two hours into Network 2 where the advantage, by the way, if one was a market oriented person, of making it unattractive for two hours to those people who did not want to watch Irish programmes, would be to boost the ratings for people over in TV3. Thank you very much, if one is in TV3. There could be other things.  The other option which was argued by people involved in the sociology of communications in many other areas is in regard to the Gaeltacht.  There are different Gaeltachts.  There are people in this House who understand what is happening. What is happening is that people are listening to an aural medium which is Raidio na Gaeltachta.  It is in competition with the visual media.  What is happening is that people have stayed there and are struggling to teach their children Irish. It is these people who are the genuine bilingualists because many of them have had to learn English to emigrate.  At the same time there are people who have learned Irish in other ways and think they are bilingual by speaking that kind of Irish as well as English.  The real bilingualists are the people in the Gaeltacht who have managed to learn English.</P>
    <P>Why should the commission not have the right to judge these options for the Irish language?  My part, and, I think, The Workers' Party and other groups support Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  Ba cheart go mbeadh ceannáras na Seirbhíse seo lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht, go mbeadh sé ar fáil ar leibhéal náisiúnta, agus go mbeadh na cláir bunaithe ar ábhair a bhaineann le cúrsaí na Gaeltachta féin ach, chomh maith leis sin, le cúrsaí ginearálta.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that there would be a visual medium that would enable the full discourse of communicative line to be available to people who live in the Gaeltacht areas.  When a small group of people came up with these proposals &mdash; the history of it is interesting&mdash;people said they are just looking for something that can never be given to them.  Their proposals <Col N="1451" /> were then examined by RTE who said this could be done.  A series of questions were put to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Communications in this House.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht said the proposals were with the Department of Communications and they were awaiting a report.  The Minister for Communications said they provided a report for Roinn na Gaeltachta, but that the ultimate decision was not theirs, and that there were many complicated technical and cost factors involved.  In a spirit of constructiveness, because we have to make as much progress as we can now in the time we are allowed, I do not intend to go into detail on the long saga. Let me just say that during election time the people of the Gaeltacht in Donegal were told by the present Taoiseach, who is now Aire na Gaeltachta, that they would have Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  Then people were wondering would it be Teilifís Gaeilge or Teilifís na Gaeltachta and it gradually slipped away.</P>
    <P>There is a broadcasting issue, an issue of community culture and a national issue involved.  The suggestion that there is nothing for the commission to do is a monstrous one.  If there is confusion about these options it is because of the absence of collective responsibility by the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Communications.  We are entitled to a decision on this issue and the people are entitled not to be misled or confused about it.</P>
    <P>This has led to further confusion &mdash; and I am willing to accept correction in this matter.  The Minister wrote an article in an Irish newspaper recently purporting to correct an article from Donncha Ó hÉalaithe in relation to the allocation of UHF capacity.  He suggested that even if TV3 got UHF capacity there would still be a possibility for Teilifís na Gaeltachta. These issues have to be resolved.  When someone is ill he likes the doctor to tell him if the illness is terminal, and the same is the case in relation to the Irish language.  Many people who have a pseudo affiliation to its usage in one form <Col N="1452" /> or other, will, if the broadcasting possibilities of providing Teilifís na Gaeltachta are lost, be the people who would not give it one last chance, the chance Mrs. Thatcher gave Scots Gaelic and the chance that was given to Welsh and Breton, all the Celtic languages in Europe.</P>
    <P>The original proposals regarding the licence fee were very interesting.  We were going to give, out of the taxpayers' money, more money to the private commercial sector in radio than would be required to get the service in the Gaeltacht up and running.  The people in the Gaeltacht areas were not entitled to a plurality of choice.  The so-called macho independent people took their chances. They knew what they were getting into, and if they got it wrong I would be sympathetic to giving them once-off assistance, but the people in the Gaeltacht could make the same argument.  It would be honest to say we no longer have a commitment to the language, Hindley is right in his recent work and so on.</P>
    <P>I have reared my family in all-Irish schools.  Two of my children are at present in Cill Ciaráin.  I have a commitment to the language, but I am not interested in being interviewed as if I was some dinosaur who has survived to the modern age.  I know I can do something about this matter.  One of the things we can do is insist in the legislation on a broadcasting strategy for Teilifís na Gaeltachta. Not only will we not get that, because it does not arise in the legislation, but we will not even get a commission to which, for example, people who hold views like mine, be they right or wrong, could simply make a submission in favour of the philosophical and practical points we are making.  It is not sufficient to say: &ldquo;The time for thinking stopped when I came in.  Action is required.  I am the man of action.  I am going ahead, and there will be no more squabbling.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to our amendment the Minister said, &ldquo;It is necessary now to create conditions in which the participants can compete fairly.  I wish he had used the correct phrase &ldquo;in which potential participants can compete fairly.&rdquo; Those people are not there.  If you were to <Col N="1453" /> advertise tomatoes on TV3, they would be well rotten by the time you found the participants.  These are potential participants. If you were an advertiser you would be asking, how many people watch these advertisements, at what times, which products are suitable in relation to targeted populations and so on.  To talk about the participants is misleading in many cases.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage the Minister has spoken regularly of monopoly, regulation and deregulation.  It is rather tedious to say that there are just two groups of people in the argument, firstly, those who are defending public service broadcasting and, secondly, those who are in favour of market-led options in relation to broadcasting.  This is not a real situation. The so-called public service broadcasting is financed by a combination of licence fees and advertising.  What we are witnessing is not the State's non-intervention in the marketplace but State-regulated forms of competition.  The State is not pulling back from the marketplace.  If you want a dramatic example of State-regulated competition, how can you say you are going to limit advertising?  We witnessed a kind of Sartrian combination earlier when people said you must regulate to deregulate, which is rather like one of Lamb's poems, &ldquo;I Watching You, Watching Me, Watching You.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was not only a proposal to cap advertising through a State mechanism but part of the licence fee was going to be taken by State interference.  This provision is still unamended in the Bill. There was also to be State interference in the matter of programming content on 2FM.  The notion that the pure market-place prevails in broadcasting as an option to pure public service broadcasting is a lot of nonsense.  People are really arguing about the mixed system that exists and the management of that system in such a way as to achieve certain results, results whereby you would not be totally swamped, in relation to content, by the international sources I mentioned earlier.  You also want to create employment opportunities within its alternative; <Col N="1454" /> in a creative sense that involves programme makers, film makers and so on. So far as it is a mixed system you want to be able to retain its creative employment content in two directions &mdash; what is within the making of the station and the commissioned adjunct to it, rather like the branch of a tree.</P>
    <P>You also want to be able to retain the employment content of what is bought and sold in relation to adverstising.  The tragedy is that in 1982 over 80 per cent of the creative work for advertising in Ireland on the television medium was done outside the State.  By 1990, 82 per cent is being done within the State.  The people who are working in that branch of the tree of advertising are Irish designers, Irish vision mixers and the people who were selling the material and so forth.  It is rather like someone saying: &ldquo;I am taking a hatchet and I am going to have a big swing at this tree and knock off a good number of its branches.  If it survives well and good, but as the other bits fall, there are a few seedlings around the place which may or may not grow into bushes&rdquo;, and so on.  I do not want to be provocative, I want to be as constructive as I can in making the case for the commission proposed in The Workers' Party amendment.</P>
    <P>There is another point which is very important in relation to this matter.  To summarise, therefore, the commission gives us accountability.  The commission gives us an opportunity of entering into dialogue with different groups who may be affected.  The commission would give an opportunity for a real participant to be there.  Let TV3 emerge.  Why should we do that?  The Minister said there would be more opportunities.  In his reply to the independent film makers he said: &ldquo;When I create more clients there will be more people to whom to sell your products.&rdquo; How do we know that?  Where is TV3's commitment to the independent film makers?  Would it not be nice to see them buy films from Alan Gilson and all the other young film makers &mdash; we would be dealing with the real rather than the hypothetical.  It is hard, therefore, to think other than that the legislative intent <Col N="1455" /> is punitive rather than constructive. There is something else that the proposed commission would do.  The internal problems in this legislation are vast, it is not perfect.  I do not criticise any Minister for that.  It might be a good idea if many more sections were dropped regularly from legislation but it is not arguable that it was perfect legislation designed on policy &mdash; two of its sections are to be removed.</P>
    <P>It would be an opportunity to see this thing which had to have an operation soon after birth &mdash; retained in hospital &mdash; and which had to have a major surgery. When the relatives looked at it they did not like the shape of the baby.  The fact is that the commission could not look only at the implications of this legislation but at all the <i>corpus</i> of legislation from 1926 onwards, which is referred to in the Title of the Bill.  I have said that the commission would give us an opportunity of looking at the directive.  I emphasise that point.  The point I emphasised was that there is other commission thinking. This is very interesting and I want to emphasise this from the point of view of people who are buying programmes.</P>
    <P>In a curious way the Teilifís na Gaeltachta argument is only a small part of a much bigger argument about national identity.  For the longest period I have been in this House one of my spokesmanships has been foreign affairs.  I remember an international organisation been split down the middle on the issue of communications.  It was on the occasion when the United States and other countries refused to continue their funding of UNESCO because the McBride report on communications had been published. It referred to the domination of the planet by all the hardware from cable satellite and other things.  The softwear was in the north and the south was the part without any capacity for communications.  The discussion among the Latin people I knew was always the same.  They used to say the issue in the end is about the right to tell our own story.  They would say that what was happening in Latin America or Africa had to be transmitted through an <Col N="1456" /> international news network, the ownership of which sets up a form of control. The rest of the world cannot know what we are saying because we do not have the capacity to tell our own story.  At that time a division broke out in UNESCO, the Secretary-General was driven from office and we got back to the business of Japanese hardware dominating the international communications world, American software dominating it and a gradual erosion in the north of the planet in relation to the capacity for own programming and a complete refusal and blank out of the people of the southern part of the planet.  These are broadcasting issues.  This is a broadcasting debate.</P>
    <P>The debate about Teilifís na Gaeltachta is one about the right, now and in the future, of the people who are there at any age to tell their own story, using all the different media available, be it print, aural or in terms of visual.  The gradual slipping away into an uncritical market-led ideology for the future of broadcasting is the integration of the domestic communications order into an international structure, dominated by capital, which control both media products and media capacity.  The debate is vast.  Many people have come in here and discussed broadcasting who may have found it technical or complex previously. Why not have the commission?  Why not come back and say, as it happens the Minister has had good news in relation to the private sector in relation to broadcasting and in relation to listenership?  I will not question that because it would be tedious.  In fact, one cannot go from the survey of MRBI to population figures. The MRBI method of carrying out the survey does not allow one to do that; in other words, one cannot go from 40 per cent of the sample to 40 per cent of the population.  It is a very old thing and only a pedant would go into it; we can work out the details again.  The Minister has had good news in relation to that issue.  How does he know other things will not change in relation to broadcasting in the next year?  Perhaps, we are all wrong but unfortunately I believe we are not all wrong.  I think there will be a <Col N="1457" /> migration of advertising money and, therefore, related jobs will go out of the State altogether.</P>
    <P>The capping of advertising will have an inevitable effect in relation to destroying peripheral contracts and employment and the internal shrinkage within the station will set it up into competition.  The principal victims are people for whom I have a very old interest, they are the long-serving members of Equity and others who are in the station.  They are threatened, as are the people who are involved in the cultural and educational work.  Perhaps we are wrong about that. Would it not be very interesting for the commission to test the water in relation to the strength of these arguments?  There are other issues that have yet to be decided.  This is not stand-alone legislation. There are implications not only in relation to radio and television, there are knock-on effects in relation to the future of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The next regulatory broadcasting conference will discuss the meshing of the telecommunications order in the commercial sector with the broadcasting sector.  Could the commission not examine that area?  The Minister made reference to the directive on the content of the media and spoke about the reference to pornography, racism and so on.  With the greatest respect, there are references in his own legislation to the question of dignity.  In regard to the legislation before the House, no television maker in Ireland could ever make a programme like &ldquo;Spitting Image&rdquo;.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to figures disclosed in the booklet, Low Pay-the Irish Experience, published jointly by the Combat Poverty Agency and the ICTU, which showed that more than 250,000 workers are in low paid jobs and that almost half of the female workforce is in low paid work; if in light of these figures, he intends to take any initiative to improve the position of low paid workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The booklet to which the Deputy refers contains papers presented at a conference on low pay organised by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, held on 13 December 1989.  These papers show that there are many aspects to the problem of low pay and that it tends to be associated with particular categories of workers such as women, school leavers, part-time workers and older workers.  Low paid workers are to be found predominantly in unskilled and part-time work for which low educational qualifications are required, where there is quick labour turnover and where there is little or no prospect of promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in the paper which I delivered at the conference, and which is included in the booklet, it is my view that action to tackle low pay must cover a broad range of policy areas including employment creation, education, training, welfare benefits and taxation.  It also involves policies in relation to specific categories of workers such as women, school leavers and part-time workers. The Government have been active in taking measures to address all of these areas and I am satisfied that this approach offers the best prospect of making real <Col N="1459" /> progress towards improving the position of the low paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that to refer to the problem highlighted in this booklet as one of low pay is to engage in the euphemism of the year, at a time when a quarter of the workforce are living on wages of less than £130 a week, when it has reached the proportions of a national scandal?  Would the Minister be more specific about his response, for example, to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who intend tackling the problem of low pay next year in the hope that legislation setting down legal minimum standards will be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of issues.  First, the problem was described by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as one of low pay.  I could get involved in an argument over the exact figures but I think Mr. John Blackwell and Mr. Brian Nolan have done a very good job while the conference, which the Combat Poverty Agency and the ICTU helped to organise, highlighted the need to tackle the problem of low pay.  Early school leavers can be assisted by organising education programmes and providing them with training and work experience in disadvantaged areas.  FÁS, CERT and community workshop training programmes could also be organised.  We also need to consider how we may broaden the opportunities for women to improve their position in the labour market.  In relation to older unemployed people, numerous programmes have been organised to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have pointed out at several trade union annual conferences this year we have to consider the categories of workers who are on low pay, such as unskilled manual workers, check-out workers, shelf-fillers and clerical staff in low grades.  Other major factors are a person's age, length of service and work experience.  As the Deputy is aware, various programmes have been organised <Col N="1460" /> within the Civil Service, the public service and the private sector to try to assist those people.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's final question is whether a statutory minimum wage provides the solution to the problem but, as the Deputy is aware, I am of the view that restructured and expanded joint labour committees offer a better solution.  The workshop at this conference came to the conclusion that if we wish to eliminate low pay we need to increase productivity and market share.  They also came to the conclusion, as I had done, that if we were to try to introduce a statutory minimum wage we would put people in employment under great stress and difficulty, with the result that rather than creating well paid jobs we would eliminate employment instead.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me repeat something I have said several times, that the questions of taxation, social welfare and social services are equally important.  In granting exemptions in the taxation area and taking the other initiatives announced in the budget, including the one on family income supplement, the Government have done a great deal in trying to assist those on low pay.  As the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget Statement that only marked the beginning.</P>

      <P>The average gross earnings for female industrial workers, manufacturing industry, as a percentage of the average for all workers in manufacturing industry in 1984 was 69 per cent and in 1989 it was 72 per cent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the information which the Deputy requires for EC countries, the latest and most comprehensive figures available to me at present are in respect of average hourly earnings of manual industrial female workers as a percentage of the average hourly earnings of manual industrial workers for April 1988.</P>
      <P>Such information as is contained in Eurostat is reproduced in a table which I propose to circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the significant difference in earnings between men and women result from a wide range of factors.  My solution to the unacceptable differential lies partly in the improvements I propose to make to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, but more particularly in improving access for women to a wider range of jobs and to better jobs, including the highest technical and managerial positions.  To that extent I place the highest emphasis on positive action whether in the public or the private sector or in training programmes.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the statistics outlined by the Minister, would the Minister not agree that some years after the implementation of the 1976 legislation on equal treatment some very positive action is needed?  In relation to Question No. 1, would the Minister not agree that one of the ways we can raise women's income quickly is by laying down a statutory minimum wage as has been done in other countries?  In an effort to allow women greater access to what traditionally are male jobs we should seriously consider the introduction of a quota system, as has been done in other countries, until some sort of balance is achieved.</P>

Faced with the volume and complexity of the extensive programme of legislation contemplated in the action programme, I secured the agreement of the Commissioner and the forthcoming Italian and Luxembourg Presidencies to a timetable covering several Presidency periods with a view to facilitating the achievement of the 1992 target, as I have already stated.  I am pleased that this timetable has been welcomed by the European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Commissioner instituted a new process of consultation with the social partners and had extensive discussion on the thinking underlying her priority proposals for instruments on atypical work and the adaptation of working time.  While some may express concern at what they see as slow progress by the Commission in sending proposals to <Col N="1466" /> the Council, I believe that the process of consulatation will help to achieve balance in the texts.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the one package of draft legal instruments which the Commission recently sent to the Council &mdash; those on part-time and temporary workers &mdash; I arranged that discussion of them would commence in the relevant Council working party last week.</P>

The very futuristic document issued by the Commission at the end of the French Presidency has become a fully fledged document with a programme for the next two years agreed by the Commission and the next two Presidencies, who will implement it.  We also got negotiating rights for the ETUC which they sought.  Any instrument to be prepared by the Council will be given first to them two months in advance.  They now have an involvement, as the Irish social partners have, in all the directives. They are very pleased with that and with the Irish Presidency.  They are in Dublin today.</P>

      <P>The job training scheme, which was agreed between my Department, FÁS, ICTU, FIE and CII was launched by me on 1 June.  The scheme is aimed at persons on the live register whose job prospects need to be enhanced by a period of work experience and training and who are referred to employers by FÁS.</P>
      <P>FÁS will encourage employers to select participants from the longer-term unemployed on the live register, but the final decision will rest with the employers. I would ask employers to make worthwhile opportunities for the unemployed available under the scheme so as to ensure its success.</P>
      <P>Operation of the scheme will be monitored on an ongoing basis and changes made as appropriate.  In addition, a review will be carried out at the end of the pilot period before any decision is taken on the future of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the number of places that will be offered in this programme? Does it remain at 1,000?  Does the Minister acknowledge that in the context of long-term unemployed forming such a disproportionate share of the unemployed in this country compared with our European partners there is an urgent necessity to devise additional programmes that target the long-term unemployed with a view to giving them some hope of getting back into economic activity if and when conditions improve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's support for the scheme.  The initial 1,000 was really my decision because I wanted us to get it right.  The work experience scheme, which Deputies in the House <Col N="1471" /> will remember, had a number of abouses, so we are endeavouring to get this scheme right.  I would say the figure could be expanded to 5,000 with no great difficulty but as soon as we get the pilot scheme completed we will look at this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>If this scheme turns out to be satisfactory and is expanded, the employment of women in the home might be integrated into such a scheme.  At the moment, as the Minister knows, such women are not registered as unemployed or ready for employment and are excluded totally from such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is fair to say that in the pilot scheme that is not envisaged.  The pilot scheme hopes to achieve as its first priority the overcoming of this difficulty in the labour market primarily for young people or not so young people who are long-term unemployed who answer advertisements for jobs and are told they have not got the appropriate experience.  The reason they have not the appropriate experience is that they never had a job.  The intention is primarily to get over that obstacle and put them into a job where there is a model for training so they have an opportunity to get some work experience or training in companies that are likely to be taking on additional workers.  They are not going in just for work experience or training. There is a likelihood that the company they are being placed in will take on staff.  It is somewhat like a probation period.  If they are suitable and adequate and can fit the employer's demands they will have an opportunity of getting a job. It is geared more to that than to other people.</P>
      <P>I am not ruling out seeking to extend the scheme.  I am just giving the pilot aspect.  I will consider the point made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring mainly to the guidelines on safety statements, safety consultation and safety representatives which were launched on 23 May 1990 by the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element of the new occupational safety and health system introduced under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is that each employer must prepare a written safety statement. This must identify the hazards and assess the risks at each workplace and must also specify the arrangements for safeguarding the safety and health of employees.  Employers must bring the safety statement to the attention of their employees.  In turn, the employees have rights of consultation with their employer on occupational safety and health issues <Col N="1474" /> and can choose a safety representative to act on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The launch of these guidelines is an important element of the preventive strategy which the new Authority have adopted in relation to safety and health at work.  In their promotional activities, the Authority will be aiming for full compliance with the safety statement and safety consultation aspects of the new system.  I expect that in the future the Authority will be developing a series of codes of practice or guidelines on a range of occupational safety and health issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, against the background every year of 45,000 workers injured at work, that there is a satisfactory legal obligation now on employers to prevent, in so far as is possible, this extraordinary and alarming rate of accidents?  For example, does he agree that 3,500 nurses and attendant staff in the hospital services alone are injured each year?  I think that figure would be very surprising to the public. Does the Minister consider his Department are in a position to enforce adequately the new measures as advised in the new standards published on 23 May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the figures are correct as I do not have them in front of me.  I have spoken at length at one of the European conferences when the international health inspectorate were here about two months ago. I gave the official figures for 1989 and the loss in health and insurance claims and particularly the great difficulties of cost to the families through both fatalities and injuries.  The legislation we passed here last year I believe will be of major help. It puts obligations on employers, it gives rights to workers which they never had previously and, above all, some of the categories the Deputy mentioned, like the hospital staff, are for the first time covered under the legislation.  The safety statement and the safety guidlines which were issued on 23 May set out for workers how they should go about setting up <Col N="1475" /> those.  The health and safety Authority booklets are excellent and they are widely circulated and available from the Authority. They clearly show what the workforce should do to set up safety representative committees and have safety officers to ensure that the legislation is complied with in their workplace. I should also say that these booklets are available to any Member of this House, if required.</P>

      <P>Could I respectfully suggest to the Minister that with the cutbacks in the public service and the restrictions on recruitment, the service is not operating adequately at present?  Under the proposed new guidelines, has the Minister any parallel proposals to increase the inspectorate and administrative staff of this unit to ensure that even the existing regulations and the proposed new regulations are adequately policed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Authority has only been set up since November and staffing is one of the issues still being discussed. However, I am honestly convinced that, no matter what regulations are in force or what is in the legislation, the issue of guidelines &mdash; which Deputy Sherlock has referred to &mdash; is the road to take.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock and other Members who previously tabled questions on the need for these guidelines and this is the road we should follow.  It is impossible to put a safety inspector on the back of every tractor or muck-spreader and in every garage and factory in the country, and it will never happen. This is not done in any country.  If the employers and workforce are not prepared to acknowledge that they have a responsibility for their own health and safety we will go nowhere.  I think Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan would remember that he argued stringently during the passage of this legislation that we should issue comprehensive and extensive guidelines at the earliest possible date so that people would know what we are talking about. We have now done that and people should follow the advice in the guidelines.</P>

      <P>The Government decided earlier this year to increase the number of participants on the social employment scheme by 5,000 by the end of this year.  I am pleased that present figures indicate an upward trend in recruitment.  I have no plans to expand the scheme further at this stage.</P>

      <P>Despite the Government's decision to expand the number of participants on the social employment scheme by 5,000, the scheme, in effect, is contracting in that some of the local authorities are now reluctant to take on board participants in social employment schemes.  In fact the workforce in various local authorities are objecting to social employment schemes because they see the schemes as replacing full-time jobs and they feel that their positions are under threat.  Has the Minister any comment to make on these recent developments?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, this has been a difficulty from the start and some local authorities never participated in the scheme for that reason.  I know that one local authority, in which Deputy O'Sullivan would have a major interest, are presently having difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are constantly trying to improve the scheme; we have reviewed the scheme and we have had discussions with the trade union movement on it.  At the beginning of this year we introduced a child allowance scheme to improve it and we have proposals for further amendments to the scheme.  I am not saying that there is no more room for improvement, but the scheme is costing £60 million per <Col N="1477" /> year and if there were more money available we could introduce further improvements.</P>
    <P>The issue that is causing disruption at present is that the trade union movement in some local authority areas feel that participation in the scheme should also be linked to further recruitment by the local authorities, but I am afraid this aspect is outside my control.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent statistics which show that only 117 out of 12,000 full-time apprentices are women; if, in the light of these figures, he intends to take an initiative to increase the number of female apprentices, especially in traditionally male dominated industries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests <Col N="1478" /> with employers, with FÁS and the educational system providing the off the job element of training.  FÁS is implementing, in relation to female apprentices, a positive action programme in favour of women, one of whose objectives is to increase significantly the rate of female participation in apprenticeships over the three year period 1990-93.  The action programme has been developed in such a manner as to encourage and help more and more women to participate in sectors that have been traditionally dominated by men and in the growth sectors of the economy.  However, such initiatives cannot be successful without the active support and commitment of employers and I would urge employers to sponsor female apprentices.  In order to provide an additional incentive to companies and potential female apprentices, FÁS will sponsor ten bursaries in 1990 for new female apprentices to assist with apprenticeship support costs during the off the job training period.</P>
      <P>The general question of equality and equity in relation to apprentice recruitment will be addressed in the current review of apprenticeships being undertaken by FÁS at present.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that against the backdrop of 117 out of 12,000 full-time apprentices being women, it is absurd and a waste of breath to exhort employers to encourage the participation of more women in apprenticeship schemes?  Does the Minister further accept that it is necessary now for the Government to take positive action to intervene in this area; otherwise we are merely paying lip service to greater equality in the workforce?  Would he agree that one cannot have a greater participation in the workforce of a greater number of women if there are only 117 female apprentices out of a total of 12,000 in a given year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is right.  Successive Governments did nothing about this issue and it is only that I went to the trouble of compiling the figures and issuing them recently <Col N="1479" /> that Deputy Rabbitte has the information. Only 0.9 per cent of the total apprenticeship population are female but this year we have achieved an increase of 52, which was hard to achieve.  We have set-out a programme of how we can bring the number up to 400 by 1992.  This has to be done almost directly by FÁS using their influence because they control the apprenticeship register and they also control the FÁS-sponsored apprenticeships and the apprenticeships sponsored by companies in conjunction with FÁS, but they cannot directly change some other apprenticeships.  FÁS have also been in touch with State bodies and the local authorities and are trying to increase the intake of women into companies.</P>
      <P>I would also like to tell Deputies that each FÁS region is developing a strategy for an increase in the number of female apprentices (a) by promoting a recruitment drive aimed at females, setting up mainline courses and also the schools and VPT courses; (b) through the bursaries I have already mentioned; (c) through the promotion campaign in industry by the services division of FÁS; and (d) an induction programme for females into apprenticeships because in the absence of that many females were turned off by the whole idea of apprenticeships &mdash; and this is borne out in surveys &mdash; because they did not understand them and they did not get much encouragement either.  The induction programme will give them the opportunity of seeing precisely what they will be involved in. If all of these measures work, and I am determined they will work, I hope we will get up to 400 female apprentices within a two year period and I think that will be a major achievement.  It will not be easy to achieve because there is very little support from employers for this type of programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the initiative could be expanded on two other levels?  I am sure the Minister is aware of the pressure and sense of isolation one or two female apprentices can feel among a large group of male apprentices and how this can force the few who go in to leave.  Perhaps funding could be made for a network of support for female apprentices.  Female apprentices on low wages cannot afford to travel and so are not in a position to stay together and support one another. Would the Minister consider making funds available for such a network?  While I welcome the other initiatives which have been taken, I regard the training and re-training of programme managers, the interview board and the course tutors as most important because their attitude can be as negative as anything else that can happen to female apprentices.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for her support.  As I said on 6 June, our objective is to increase significantly the rate of female participation in apprenticeships and to bring to the notice of the public the figures which have shocked Deputy Rabbitte and, I think, everybody <Col N="1481" /> else.  The important part of this objective is to get employers to participate.  Since the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights got me to take an interest in this issue I have found out that it is extremely difficult to get employers to participate.  If employers visited the FÁS centre in Jervis Street they would see that the female apprentices who were taken into the Custom House development have almost proved to be as good as the men.  As I have found out over the past three months, it is hard to convince them of this.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that discrimination against women, young or old, did not begin with him; it has been there since the foundation of the State. As a founder member of AnCO and FÁS, I have seen at first hand the situation in relation to female apprentices.  Is the Minister aware that nearly all of the FÁS centres will take on apprentices only if they are sponsored by employers and that they will not nominate young women in preference to young men?  Does he not agree that the fundamental selection process for young women in FÁS courses is not changed we will be wasting our time in this respect?</P>

The figure <Col N="1482" /> of 117 female apprentices out of a total of 12,000 full-time apprentices does not seem to be in keeping with the proportion of female apprentices in other sections of industry.  Does the Minister have figures on the numbers of apprentices in traditional areas such as hairdressing and work of that nature?</P>

      <P>As I announced on 6 June, a number of apprenticeships in each of the crafts will be allocated for each region over the three year period 1990-93 and a certain number of the apprentices will have to be female.  That is the position in relation to FÁS.  As Deputy Bell pointed out, there will be higher numbers on the employers' side, which is a separate exercise.  We are hoping to increase the number of female apprentices on the FÁS side from 28 to 400, which would be a substantial improvement.  We have set this target out in the programme and we will give it further profile.  If we can achieve this target we will have done a major day's work.</P>

The new programme on equality, launched in conjunction with the Irish Personnel Managers, proposed such an award scheme. I have announced the details of the award system in the Employment Equality Agency and the work of organisations and people involved in positive discrimination in favour of women will be highlighted and documented.  Such an award scheme is not unrelated to this issue and I will give consideration to it. An award scheme for employers would be better than criticising them as criticism does not necessarily work.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister <Col N="1484" /> if he is familiar with the recent research on this issue by Roisín Callender which shows that after 20 years we have managed to progress from women being on 50 per cent of average male earnings to 60 per cent or from 58 per cent to 68 per cent of the hourly earnings?  Does he not agree, against that rate of performance of 10 per cent over 20 years, that there is an urgent necessity to take legislative measures in this area?  May I specifically ask him if the legislation he has promised contains proposals to tackle one of the main obstacles identified, that is, the necessity to have a male comparator so that we can establish an equal pay case? Because low pay problems tend to be concentrated in all female employment one has not, by definition, got a male comparator.  There is the specific recommendation that it ought to be replaced by what the hypothetical man would be earning in that situation.  Will the Minister include that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the points raised by the Deputy into account.  There are two aspects to this, one is legislation and the other relates to opportunities. What we have failed to do in the last 13 years in my view, and, more important, in the considered opinion of many specialists in this area, is to get sufficient women into the higher echelons of their profession, whether it is clothing or engineering. Predominantly they are in the lower grades of those jobs.  Legislation will not get rid of that but something can be done under it.  The advice to the Department of Labour comes from the Employment Equality Agency.  I should like to remind the House of the conference held during the Irish Presidency on the difficulties that face females in the labour market following the passing of the Single European Act.  Members will recall that at that well-published conference many suggestions were put forward. The points referred to by the Deputy will be looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that one of the main problems in achieving equality between men and women is that <Col N="1485" /> it takes such a long time to measure equality in the workplace?  Will the Minister agree that it is a question of the exploitation of women and that employers deliberately find ways and means of keeping women on low pay?</P>

All parties should support the initiation of positive action to ensure that women participate fully in the workforce.  I appeal to the unions in regard to that.</P>

      <P>DÍON, the advisory committee on emigrant welfare services, which is chaired by the Labour Attache at the Irish Embassy in London and whose membership is almost entirely British-based, advises me on matters affecting the welfare of Irish emigrants to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now DÍON have concentrated on developing and improving the services provided by voluntary organisations for Irish emigrants in Britain, mainly through (i) provision of assistance to non-statutory bodies, operating front-line emergency services for Irish emigrants, for the employment of professional workers; (ii) initiatives and ventures for developing closer links between voluntary bodies and local and statutory authorities with responsibility for community welfare, especially homeless people, and the provision of accommodation to meet local <Col N="1486" /> needs; and (iii) information projects and surveys for identifying the specific needs of particularly disadvantaged categories of emigrants.</P>
    <P>In recent years, DÍON have emphasised their concern to concentrate on improving the effectiveness of voluntary organisations in Britain.  Towards that end they have identified and published their priority objectives for grant-aid purposes.</P>
    <P>I understand that DÍON consider their remit to be sufficiently broad and flexible to enable them to address the priority needs of emigrant welfare bodies in the United Kingdom effectively and efficiently on the basis of the level of State funding made available for that purpose. As the question of extending their remit has not arisen I see no need to alter their terms of reference as of now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, apart from the limited remit of DÍON, the amount of finance available to them to discharge their duties is hopelessly inadequate in the context of the problem?  I accept that the amount of money made available last year was double the allocation for the previous year.  When one considers that £500,000 is being allocated for advice centres only and that little if anything is provided for hostel accommodation, safe start centres or overnight accommodation, one will realise the need to increase the amount of money available to DÍON and to extend their remit to include the provision of basic accommodation to give people a safe start in what is essentially an alien environment.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that the Deputy has acknowledged that the allocation has been increased.  It has risen from £130,000 to £500,000 over three years.  That money is for grants to social workers and voluntary workers in front line services to help Irish emigrants with advice.  DÍON, and more importantly the local community organisations based in the UK, do not want to see the Irish Government involved in capital grant projects.  One group that I am aware of <Col N="1487" /> have requested money of a capital nature but the others want to use our money to provide a welfare system.  A number of local authorities fund the capital aspects of local projects.  If we got involved in the capital funding of such projects we would be giving local authorities a reason not to fund those projects.  I have been asked on a number of occasions not to go down that road.  I have no doubt that if I had more than £500,000 available to me many organisations would be applying for funds.  I am not saying that £500,000 will be the end of the funding but it was as much as we could get in the budget.  It would be a mistake for the Irish Government to fund capital needs in hostels.</P>

Will the Minister accept that the remit of DÍON should be broadened to include a joint pilot project between FÁS and their counterparts in the UK, the youth training service, to introduce a youth training scheme?  Young Irish people who are unable to get into the job market in the UK because of a lack of a skill could avail of such a project.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the important advance made in respect of the public service on this matter under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It has been agreed that childcare facilities will be provided on the basis of the State providing the physical space and the staff paying the running costs.  Details of timing and implementation have yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>As regards the private sector I note that the role of employers in the provision of workplace creches has been limited in most EC countries and that where it exists, it is usually in response to a strong demand for such provision among a substantial number of parents employed by an employer or employers in an area.  I believe that workplace provision can make a useful contribution to encouraging the participation of women in the labour market and that arrangements for the provision of such facilities would be an appropriate matter for negotiation between the social partners.  I also believe that there is a need to create the conditions for the building up of a network of services by employers in the private sector, and I have set up a working group to advise me on possible further practical initiatives which I can take in that sphere.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that this goes to the heart of inequality in the Irish workforce?  The Minister has expressed the view that legislation alone will not get rid of inequality but will he accept that we are proceeding at a snail's pace towards equality notwithstanding the framework agreed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i> I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the report submitted to the Minister for Labour in 1983 on the provision of child minding and creche facilities.  Will the Minister accept that the absence of them is one of the major obstacles to female participation in the workforce and that it will require more than the framework set down in the <i>Programme for National <Col N="1489" /> Recovery</i> to change the attitude of employers at job level?</P>

Many of them are covered in the Child Care Bill which is before the House.  After years of talking about the matter the central review committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are considering this. There has been a move in that direction recently in local authorities, Dublin Corporation and a number of Government Departments and the discussions under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> can make progress.  The review will determine the numbers and the space which needs to be provided for facilities for those who badly need them and cannot pay the exorbitant costs in the private market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 20 together.  To date the statute of limitations has not applied <Col N="1492" /> in relation to claims under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  There are, however, provisions in the 1984 Act which impose time-limits and these must be applied.</P>
      <P>As I explained in my reply to the Deputy on 23 May 1990, following detailed examination of the matter, I have concluded that it would not be feasible to make regulations to extend the scope of the 1984 Act to so-called &ldquo;informal insolvencies&rdquo;.  There are a number of issues involved which could give rise to difficulties.  The main reason, however, for my decision is that I have received legal advice to the effect that it would not be feasible by regulation to extend and implement any defination of employer's insolvency beyond those categories set out in section 1 (3) of the 1984 Act.  Primary legislation would be necessary for that purpose and I have no proposals for such legislation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to a provision in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, which enables the payment of a lump sum from the Social Insurance Fund direct to a qualified employee where the employer has failed or refused to pay.  I must point out that there are significant differences between the functions of the two Acts and in the way in which they were drafted.  The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, was designed to protect certain employee entitlements solely in cases of the insolvency of the employer.  The provision referred to in the Redundancy Payments Act was designed to cover all cases of failure to pay the statutory entitlement regardless of the reason for the failure. As I have stated earlier, it is not feasible to incorporate into the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, provision for making payments in any cases other than in cases where the employer is insolvent as defined in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which enables me to institute and maintain proceedings on behalf of employees who receive favourable awards from the Employment Appeals <Col N="1493" /> Tribunal and many successful cases have been instituted.  There are cases, however, where it is clear from the legal advice that there is no prospect of recovery on behalf of the employee.  I must be guided by the legal advice in any particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The two questions are set down under separate headings because they cover two separate sets of legislation and it is virtually impossible to straddle them with one question.  Has the Minister any indication &mdash; from the records of his Department or from officials &mdash; as to the amount of moneys outstanding to unfortunate workers who have lost out substantially under the redundancy and minimum notice legislation?  Is there any way in which outstanding moneys can be paid to these unfortunate workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We had the figures for such cases in relation to a previous question. I do not have them with me but I will send the information to the Deputy.  When the Act was going through, the previous Minister for Labour hoped that in section 4 (2) a way could be found of tackling the fly-by-night operators.  Unfortunately, it is not just a matter of the law in relation to labour or the Social Insurance Fund because it also involves the laws on bankruptcy and winding up and their implications for the individuals and companies involved.  It includes a whole range of complex issues and procedures and the Attorney General's advice is that, even by amending the regulations, we cannot achieve what was hoped for when the matter was discussed in 1984.  The State does not have the power to intervene under the powers in relation to the legislation on social welfare and in budget financial resolutions but, even if they had, if they paid some of the debts which arise in insolvency cases they might be lumbered with the lot.  It has been the view of successive Attorneys General that this would be the case, so I am not just talking about money under the employers' insolvency fund. We would be getting into the issue of bankruptcies, and the courts would not <Col N="1494" /> be able to distinguish between them.  This was the advice in 1984.  It has been raised a number of times since but it is still the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the main problem is that, in the majority of these cases, even if the employee who is declared redundant or loses through minimum notice were to establish a case against an employer, in the vast number of cases there is no money to meet the payment?  In many of these cases, some employers, particularly in the building trade, have set up businesses in London, Manchester or other cities.  They are operating and making substantial profits but, because they are outside the jurisdiction, these unfortunate people cannot claim against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bell is right; that is why I answered the two questions together.  With regard to the issue of minimum notice highlighted in the Deputy's question, I would say that is precisely what happens in informal insolvency cases.  I took the policy decision that whenever somebody does not pay up under the provisions of the 1973 Act the Department takes such a person to court.  I know that perhaps not all Ministers for Labour took such action; nonetheless I felt an obligation on me to endeavour to do so.  In the case of informal insolvencies it has been my experience that one can never extract a penny from the people involved, that all one does is pursue legal action, that if one can even trace the people to bring them to court one is doing well.  Unfortunately while the provision of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 covered a lot &mdash; and constituted extremely good legislation initiated by the previous Government &mdash; on this particular aspect it cannot have the desired effect without incurring all kinds of other extensive costs.  We have been endeavouring for the best part of six years now to find a solution, which would appear to be an impossibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree <Col N="1495" /> that perhaps this could be dealt with by way of a second stage tribunal whereby such tribunal could examine the implications of cases awarded previously so that provision could be made within existing legislation for such tribunal, comprised of employers and trade union representatives, to make an award? Would the Minister agree that this would mean that, under existing legislation, regulations could be enacted in order to effect payment from the Social Insurance Fund?</P>

      <P>When I effected amendments some years ago I undertook to have the matter re-examined even though the matter had come to a close at that stage.  I am prepared to examine any suggestions.  It is a highly complex matter, invoking bankruptcy and company law legislation far beyond what was envisaged at that time of the passage of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Involvency) Act, 1984.  I will ask the Attorney General to examine the points the Deputy has raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period 1984-1988, the most recent five year period for which figures are available, the participation rate of women in economic activity increased from 30.9 per cent in 1984 to 31.1 per cent in 1988.  From and including 1984 the figures were 30.9 per cent, 30.5 per cent, 30.9 per cent, 31.9 per cent and 31.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approximate stability in the aggregate participation rate conceals major shifts in the composition of female participation. The most significant feature has been the participation rate of married <Col N="1496" /> women, which increased from 19.5 per cent in 1984 to 23.6 per cent in 1988. Other points to note were: the growth of women's participation in part-time work and a sharp decline in activity rates among women, and men, aged 15-19. This reflects a rise in participation rates in education.</P>
    <P>These changes in the labour market provide the context for several initiatives which I have taken recently, including the Presidency seminar to assess the impact of the Internal Market on women's employment, the FÁS positive action plan to address issues of sex-segregation in the labour market, the review of the employment equality legislation, the preparation of legislation on employment protection of part-time workers, and the study of the measures that can be adopted to enable women to accommodate child care and career opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that much of this ground will be covered in further questions, would the Minister agree that there should be a direct resource investment in new agencies or programmes initiated for the reintegration of women into the workforce?  I understood the Minister to say that the relevant figure had risen from 30.9 per cent to 31.1 per cent over a five-year period, representing a very small percentage. Bearing in mind that Ireland has the lowest participation of married women in the workforce, would he agree that direct, positive action is needed for the retraining and reintegration of married women into the workforce while bearing in mind those who still so willingly forego so much career opportunity and economic independence in order to work in the home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now covering ground already covered.  I can say that the return to work courses have shown that there is great demand for them, that women who wish to return to work are very anxious to participate in that programme. Most women who participate in that course are aged 35 or over; I am now talking about applicants, not necessarily <Col N="1497" /> successful participants.  That would tend to suggest that perhaps we could extend that programme which has proved to be so successful both from the point of view of FÁS and its participants.  People who have participated in that course have had nothing but the highest of praise for it. As I said earlier, we have endeavoured to raise the number of places available to 1,000.  I will ascertain whether there is anything further we can do to expand its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the figures in relation to married women do no more than indicate the obligation placed on them &mdash; in the context of current unemployment rates, especially in certain socio-economic groupings &mdash; to go out to work in order to maintain some kind of income into the household?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be partly the case.  As the Deputy will know from some statistics produced, it would be eminently desirable that we balance it in such a way that would suit the socio-economic groups, which is not always what happens or is possible.  For example, the analysis undertaken of women returning to the workforce would not always find that those who pick up jobs are necessarily those most in need of them.  I am not going to get into that argument; I thought we had concluded that 20 years ago.  I am primarily concerned with endeavouring to provide courses for people who want to participate in them regardless of whichever group they may represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point.  It is, or should be, the right of every woman &mdash; and every support resource possible should be made available &mdash; to have the same freedom as men to choose her career inside or outside the home.  Has the Minister or FÁS taken into consideration many of the programmes of retraining that would help women, such as the future office business studies programmes on computerisation and VDU training and processing which are at present closed to a great many of <Col N="1498" /> the women we want reintroduced into the workforce because they are not registered and because one has to be unemployed to be available for such courses, which constitutes a huge obstacle in their way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have.  The return to work programme is successful in that regard but some of the others are not, such as, for example, the clerical procedures courses.  It presents a financial argument also because there is no saving to the Exchequer on the Social Welfare Vote and no grant aid forthcoming from the European Social Fund for that purpose. Therefore, the costs in respect of people not on the register are much more substantial than those particpating in other programmes.  As I said earlier, I will re-examine the return to work course, ascertaining what we can do to augment places available on it, and what restrictions we can remove which obtain at present.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time I had been setting out the framework or case for amendment No. 2 in the names of Deputies De Rossa and McCartan in relation to the functions of the commission.  My appeal to Members on all sides of the House was to tease out what might be construed to be broadcasting policy.  I might say that these are not my views alone.  Previously, I referred to a chapter &ldquo;Cable, Satellite and the emergence of Private TV in Ireland; from public service to managed monopoly&rdquo;.  That is the title given by Professor Desmond Bell and Niall Meehan in their contribution to <i>Media Culture and Society</i> published by Sage in 1989.  The curious side of it is that they make direct reference to the issues that we have been discussing and which are appropriate for consideration as to what a commission might in fact establish.  For example, in relation to page 108 of that book, the title of which I have referred to, there is a comment which quotes Mr. Vincent Finn, the Director General of RTE.  They are quoting from an interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 May 1987.  Mr. Finn has this to say &mdash; and they are his words and not mine, not the words of the Opposition.  It is interesting that it was in 1987, before the 1988 legislation, that he said that:</P>
      <P>Broadcasters like ourselves who are funded by a combination of advertising and licence income will be forced to seek either direct state intervention or an increase in licence fees in order to maintain our level of service.  The alternative is to curtail the service and to concentrate on commercial programming to the exclusion of those elements of our output which are designed to achieve cultural, educational and social goals.  I think we would be the poorer as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Finn said that in 1987 before this legislation, before the original proposal <Col N="1522" /> that would have taken part of the licence fee from them, before the original proposal that would have changed the nature of 2FM, now particularly, because of what we are left with, as I understand it, should we get as far as the amendment in the name of the Minister.  He said it before his advertising was capped.  This is not therefore a suggestion by just an Opposition TD; it is, very interestingly, the comment of the Director General of the national television service before the last legislation.  It is interesting in that regard.</P>
    <P>I said earlier, I felt that among the technical matters that a commission might review would be the Minister's relationship to the use of MMDS as a piece of technology.  I was in this House and the Minister and I had some courteous and informative exchanges about broadcasting policy over the last several years.  I was here when he promised a paper on MMDS and how it would work out.  His thinking has changed since then. Was it that there was a policy change or was it that there was a shift in estimation? It is not of no consequence, Sir, because it did affect the bidding for the TV 3 franchise.  Some people bid for it when they thought it was an MMDS system. Now the terms of the contract have entirely changed.  There are people saying they would like to come back in and bid again because the goal posts have shifted.  The same authors that I have referred say something very interesting in the same text to which I referred but this time at page 110:</P>
    <P>The Minister plans to distribute the new service (and up to ten other non-Irish channels) through Multi-point Microwave Distribution Systems (MMDS) to those without cable.</P>
    <P>The cable companies will have a &ldquo;must carry&rdquo; provision forced on them by the Government in relation to the new &ldquo;Third&rdquo; channel.  RTE, however, will not have guaranteed access.  MMDS equipment will have to possess dual ports permitting switching to a conventional television aerial for off-air reception of RTE.  While MMDS has been used in <Col N="1523" /> parts of rural Canada the Irish version will be the first national MMDS delivery system.</P>
    <P>Taking up the Minister's point that there were no issues to be resolved after 1980, is not a unique use of MMDS for the first time as a national system an issue that arose, and could not the commission, for example, discuss MMDS in combination with other forms of technological broadcasting and so forth?  They continued:</P>
    <P>The development of the MMDS-delivered third television channel, like that of the cabled satellite channels and DBS plans, seems to be the product less of any identifiable consumer demand than of private enterprise seeking a guaranteed profitable return through state patronage and `managed monopoly'.</P>
    <P>I used the phrase &ldquo;managed monopoly&rdquo; before Question Time and I said that the choice was not simply, for those people who are involved in this broadcasting debate for some time now, between some kind of old fashioned defence of public service broadcasting versus the market. That is in fact what the Minister is doing. He is using the mechanism of the State, through legislation like this, to create conditions of managed monopoly.  He is interfering with the market place.  Let those people who are on the right who feel there is something intrinsically wonderful about the market place and so on know that they are not talking about the market defining anything.  One of the Minister's remarks was, I presume, a reference to people like me and many others who are very proud to say that we have ideological views.  Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan made the very good point back to him to say that he hoped the Minister did not think or suggest that his own views were non-ideological.</P>
    <P>The Minister's pursuit, for example, of a set of options to deliver a plurality, as he says, of competition, in which the competitor does not exist yet, that takes the form of attacking a State funded service, is a profoundly ideological position. <Col N="1524" /> Let us put it like this.  What ideology is, in any sense, is a set of interconnected views and values systematically generated by the socially historical circumstances of time.  I happen to be a socialist.  Many of us over here are.  We have a particular ideology.  There are other people who say that we are wrong to regard the economy as an instrument for the attainment of some human purposes, that the economy must be in a stand alone relationship and so on.  That is an ideological position.  There is nothing wrong with having an ideological position.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise one point, because I will not stray from the amendment, I guarantee you, Sir, so as to make progress. It is that the Minister's position in his sixth intervention is not a neutral position and there is no point in going down that bogus road of suggesting that because one is going to use the State and its legislative process to assist the market place through a set of interventions that this is somehow or another a superior non-ideological position to those who have the courage to say that the modes of production that exist in any system at any particular time in any society determine and produce different views of the world and come through a philosophy in politics and make their way into broadcasting. These are just facts.</P>
    <P>There are just a few points more I want to make in relation to why I think the commission is important in many senses. If I were involved in one of the radio stations that are in difficulties I would feel the commission could and should go into the very interesting reasons. Remember that I had before Question Time set up the argument and said that the whole world communications order, the European communications order and this national communications order is one that is involved in a crucial choice. We are, I think at the end of broadcasting as we have known it since the 1920s.  I, for example, am not taking the position that we should have the model of broadcasting that we had in the 1920s in its straight public service broadcasting role, given its tremendous contribution.  What <Col N="1525" /> we are saying is that we need a redefinition of public broadcasting in a mixed system.  If it is to be mixed, the problem has not been at the adaptable public broadcasting end of it; the problem has been on the private side.  Surely the commission would be entitled to review why it is that the private side has had difficulties. The truth of it is &mdash; and I go back to my original assertion &mdash; that there are two quite different ethoses from which people come into the new alternatives, as they are called, to RTE.  One is an ethos of capital investment and speculation and the other is an ethos of broadcasting.  One can have all the money in the world and one can fire it at the public through the aural and visual media, but if one has not an ethos of broadcasting one is not in fact able to secure the people who listen to it and sell advertisements.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has given us new figures this afternoon.  Although I would quibble with some of them, they are interesting.  It would also be interesting to know who would watch the new station. It is a very good question for those of us who are not broadcasters but who are in here as elected representatives.  It would be very fascinating if Deputies from all sides of this House were to stand up during this Committee Stage debate and say what people at their clinics told them they want TV3.  I wonder how many backbenchers have seen people clamouring into their clinics saying they desperately need a third commercial television channel.  Have they said their children are not able to sleep at night worrying about commercial radio? People come to elected representatives and speak about community radio and the importance of choice.  They say they want a pluralism of choice, but they want it within an adapted model of public service broadcasting that will be able to accommodate, if necessary, competitors in the marketplace.  This again raises the question of the commission.  These are the issues the commission could deal with.</P>
    <P>There are other problems which are very real, and there is no point thinking <Col N="1526" /> they do not exist.  Suggestions have been made about the migration of advertising revenue.  One side said the capping of advertising will release capacity for the print media and will release capacity which will be more or less held in wait for an alternative to the visual media.  I have said there is not a scintilla of evidence that this will happen.  Equally, it has been said from this side that there will be migration, in the short term, of advertising revenue, with a knock-on effect on employment; but it has been said on that side that that is not so.  A commission, as proposed in this very reasonable amendment, would be able to evaluate the strength or weakness of both sets of assertions.  The benefit would be good broadcasting strategy, jobs would be made secure and arguments answered. Why then the haste?  Why not answer these questions?</P>
    <P>The present hiatus in relation to Teilifís na Gaeltachta is one of assertion and counter-assertion.  A report from Údarás na Gaeltachta gave a set of figures and said it would be possible to set up such a station.  I presume the Minister for Communications has been in contact with the Minister for the Gaeltacht and said that some questions arise here.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht has probably said they cannot make a decision on the matter. This issue must be resolved.  There is no point leaving it in the realm of rumour, assertion and counter-assertion.  The case I have made already in relation to Teilifís na Gaeltachta is the view not only of myself, as spokesperson on the Irish language, but also that of the Labour Party, a view which was indicated very clearly from the beginning.  When I was a member of Comhcoiste na Gaeilge, the committee dealing with the Irish language, counter cases were put forward.</P>
    <P>There is another issue that could be considered by the commission, that is the consequences of changing the slots for advertising and the effect on employment. For example, if advertising time is reduced from seven and a half minutes to four and a half minutes, is it true, as the advertising industry had said, that the effect will be that air time will be more <Col N="1527" /> expensive and fewer commercials will be shown?  Was I right yesterday in saying there will be a positive disincentive to the making of commercials in relation to the Irish language?  Would it be possible, in the atmosphere I described before Question Time, in allowing a 10 per cent discount for advertisements with a portion of Irish and over 30 per cent discount for advertisements that are almost completely in Irish, to stay in business and sustain your position under the new conditions of competition, with capped advertising revenue and more limited time?  Again, these are issues that can be considered in terms of the progress we make.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the big difference between the beginning of the eighties and the nineties and the capturing, as it were, of the process of making advertisements. A question we could reflect on with good purpose is the one of expensively made commercials which are foreign made.  As the advertisment is shortened, the live actor is eliminated from the longer slot and as a result the dice is loaded in favour of the animated advertisement, which is dominated by the multinationals.  Therefore there would be a net job loss.  There is also the question of low cost commercials, the question of time and the question of short-life commercials.  It will be very difficult to find air time for those commercials.  Quite frankly, many companies will not be able to afford the new rates.  There are other matters such as the small facility companies, which will also experience difficulties.</P>
    <P>Having developed an expertise in the last eight years, the customer has been battered and therefore we are really talking about the migration of the newly developed skills.  That brings me to a point on which there could have been a submission to the commission.  It is important to be very frank about this and to say that in relation to the commercial employment impact of this legislation there is no evidence that the Industrial Development Authority had been consulted. Yet the Industrial Development Authority were in direct consultation <Col N="1528" /> with many former employees of RTE in setting up &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; projects and also in the development of a new technical services division within RTE.  It would be very valuable to have their opinion and see what strength there is to the different arguments.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I wish to make, which I summarised before Question Time.  I listed the issues the commission could and should review.  An interesting point for any Minister holding the portfolio of Minister for Communications is that what is needed is flexible legislation.  In every parliament in Europe the speed of the technological revolution is far outstripping the capacity for legislative response.  For example, it is written in the Commission documents of the European Community that there is great difficulty in drafting directives dealing with new technology, which is moving so fast.  This commission would not have the effect of delaying matters but they would be able to generate a framework of legislation and would have the capacity to respond quickly to changes that are taking place, both internationally and at European level.  They would also, within whatever legislation would emerge, be able to quickly adapt and initiate adaptations in the context of European directives.  They would be able to prepare us for the two forthcoming international conferences, one on radio and one on television, and we would be able to define a policy in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting point which that commission could bear in mind in the context of the position in which RTE now find themselves.  RTE were given a gift of a concept called market contestability. That is the concept outlined in the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report on RTE.  The ethos at the time liked it.  Stokes Kennedy Crowley are part of Peat Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co., a company which examined the BBC and came up with a concept for British broadcasting of market contestability. As RTE have shown that they could contest in the market place, why use State legislation to defeat Stokes Kennedy Crowley's market contestability? Deputy Mitchell is not here <Col N="1529" /> but I made reference earlier that when Ireland had the capacity in relation to the direct broadcasting satellite in the late serventies it was sold to Atlantic Satellite, who within six months had sold it on to Hughes Corporation, who own 30 per cent of the direct satellite capacity for Japan.  The people who are operating the international Hughes communications empire said that their interest was in declining state's communications systems all over the world and that they were interested in linkages to make money out of international communications networks. That argument is for another day. As sure as night follows day, I expect in the lifetime of this Dáil that proposals will come forward for the privatisation of Bord Telecom and the whole issue will fall neatly into place.</P>
    <P>It is important to describe what is taking place.  It is the same as it was in 1982.  We are speaking of the integration of the national domestic communications sector into an international marketplace for culture and for media hardware and software.  If we damage the stations' capacity to develop a national broadcasting station, to sustain, change and innovate a national broadcasting ethos, we will have done a great deal of damage. The commission could review those later sections in the Bill that speak of standards.</P>
    <P>In relation to dignity, reputation and so on, it is important to have the rights updated so that the citizen should be able to defend his or her name.  I am not sure if the concepts used &mdash; perhaps the Minister will tell me &mdash; exist in any other European legislation.  They are so restrictive as to be bordering on setting up an atmosphere of self-censorship on the makers of programmes.  I made the assertion before Question Time that I doubt, if this legislation were passed in this way, that programmes such as, for example, &ldquo;Spitting Image&rdquo; could be made on television or that a satirical radio programme could be made without people looking over their shoulder.  If this is wrong it would have been very interesting to see the working through of <Col N="1530" /> the sections that deal with standards and to review how they worked out.</P>
    <P>There are a few small points that are important in relation to what it is all about. If the commission were established it would be able to take up a debate that is going on in every other country in Europe and all over the world.  I made reference earlier to the McBride report &mdash; the full title is the Report of the International Commission for the Study of Communications Problems, published in 1980 by UNESCO.  At the beginning of that report there is a statement which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>with the coming of a new world communication order, each people must be able to learn from the others, while at the same time conveying to them its own understanding of its own condition and its own view of world affairs.  Mankind will then have made a decisive step forward on the path to freedom, democracy and fellowship.</P>
    <P>That report made 82 recommendations. It was for the building of an extended form of participatory democracy through radio.  How can they induce the State to diminish public sector broadcasting and at the same time reach into the marketplace to distort the conditions of the marketplace so that the competitor does not have to stand alone?  How can that be seen as a progressive broadcasting policy?  The great advantage, in relation to what is proposed in this amendment, is that we would be able to assess this legislation's contribution to the issues that have to be involved.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>This is a short amendment and speaks about reporting to this House.  I was a Member of the Seanad in 1973.  I remember the 1974 Broadcasting Bill being introduced by someone who was then a colleague, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, and we had a debate on broadcasting. While I have been a Member of this House one issue I have never heard debated &mdash; which is very interesting &mdash; is the print media, reference to which had been made regularly in the Minister's six <Col N="1531" /> interventions.  It would be very interesting if the Minister told me if he shared my concerns about the existence of monopoly in that media.  I happen to be one of those citizens who has looked with deep regret at the conditions of near monopoly that exist in relation to the print media in Ireland and who knows that control in that media is exercised by somebody who does not live in Ireland regularly but who visits here occasionally. Perhaps that is what the people mean by plurality of choice.  I know that in the newspaper group to which I referred &mdash; this is in relation to the Minister's plurality &mdash; on the occasion of the visit of President Reagan a note was pinned up in the office saying: &ldquo;Nothing negative while the President is here&rdquo;.  Which President, one might say?  The owner, the president of Heinz?</P>
    <P>In relation to conditions of plurality of choice, what we have in relation to the print media is far from satisfactory and we are beyond time in discussing this here.  I would like to see legislation that would set up a commission which would review the market conditions and the plurality of choice that exist in relation to the print media.  It is perfectly reasonable to say on legislation such as this that there would be a commission that would prepare a report setting out options, assessing the alleged implications, the real consequences, the choice down the road, the context of new decisions that had to be made on the European level and so forth.  There is no point in saying that to do this is to think and that thinking involves review groups, commissions and so on and to say that all thought is finished, that the time for action has come.</P>
    <P>It has regularly been pointed out in this House that Deputy O'Sullivan and I were the people who had ideological hangups in 1982.  I was present at those talks. There were discussions about broadcasting options.  I repeat what I said &mdash; and it is the only part I have repeated &mdash; that when the last of the 14 points went into the Programme for Government, which was agreed by the Labour and Fine <Col N="1532" /> Gael parties, it was not a defensive proposal about public service; it was about the orderly development of community radio, using the existing institutional structure we had through public service broadcasting.  One party in that Coalition decided to go ahead with what could be seen as an independent commercial partnership and we were simply honouring the principles that had been agreed between our two parties.  A great deal of thought has gone into broadcasting in the Labour Party.  We were among the first parties in this House to publish a policy document.  We would welcome the opportunity to participate in a debate on these options.</P>
    <P>I have not made a single personal reference to the Minister.  I speak about the Minister of the day in saying that these are options that face a Minister &mdash; whoever that Minister may be &mdash; at any particular time.  I disagree with him in relation to his last intervention &mdash; it can hardly be sustained &mdash; that there might have been a time for all this at the beginning of the eighties &ldquo;but I am now going to act and nothing can stop me&rdquo;.  It is rather like the old rural Ireland do not hold me back argument.  There is a host of implications and there is a whole range of areas and issues, ranging from questions of ownership and control to editorial functions, to access to public responsibility and accountability, the evolution of technology, the relationship between the different parts of the system and so on, that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been published on the question of how a mixed broadcasting system should be financed.  In the absence of a strategy or policy on the financing of a mixed system of broadcasting, the first option is go for a licence fee but if this is dropped the next option would be to rely on advertising alone.  I want to be as constructive as possible in this debate but to say that by redirecting the attack from the licence fee and 2FM towards advertising, when the effects would be obscured, the Bill has been made palatable is like saying take the market away from a company and it will not be too <Col N="1533" /> obvious to the public that jobs are being shed.</P>
    <P>Getting the Minister to go from draft one to draft two was not an achievement. I suspect that this was motivated more by the initial public reaction than by a desire to have a thought-out broadcasting policy.  The truth is that the second form of this legislation, when thought out in terms of its implications for RTE, is far worse, given its capacity to deal with programming and new communications technology and sustain employment, and much more important, given its capacity to handle creativity and innovation.</P>
    <P>Two elements always need to be considered when it comes to drawing up a national broadcasting policy.  First, there is the question of ownership &mdash; be it a State model, a private commercial model or a mixed model.  Broadcasting is about creativity mixed with a capacity to be critical.  It is about people being able to look at themselves critically and take control of change rather than be the victims of change as they are in pure market-led commercial broadcasting.  What creativity requires is space for the new programme maker, film maker and the person who wishes to make a documentary and so on.</P>
    <P>If anyone doubts what I have to say he should look at the literature on American broadcasting which indicates that the time available for news coverage is shortening, that the structure of current affairs on the North American Continent is changing and the way in which it compares with the European model.  Equally they may also look at the status of the documentary in both systems.  If they do, what they will find is that the greater the commercial pressure the more instant the news has to be and the more controlled the coverage of current affairs has to be, with the result that the documentary occupies less time.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts.  With respect, I do not accept that these issues have been thought out or that thinking has been exhausted.  Our argument and that of The Workers' Party in 1982 was in favour of the establishment of a commission.  When we tried to resolve the difficulties <Col N="1534" /> between the partners in Government at that time we argued, in order to get the legislation right, that a White Paper on broadcasting setting out all the options should be published.  The point I am making to the Minister is there would be nothing undignified about accepting the amendment given that all it seeks to do is allow the legislation, the arguments which have been brought forward and the defences made to be reviewed and looked at.</P>
    <P>There are many issues on which there are no divisions between the parties, such as whether the national communications system can be retained within the control of the citizens.  The Minister in rejecting the amendment is in effect saying that he has got the legislation so right there is nothing left for him to look at and that he must go ahead.  However, the fact is that the Bill, Mark I, is not the same as the Bill Mark II.  If the Minister wishes to drop the two sections which attack the licence fee and 2FM, why will he not accept the suggestion from the Opposition that the legislation should be held off until such time as we have an opportunity to examine the implications of the Bill?  I suspect reservations would be expressed and positive contributions made on the Government side of the House should the Minister agree to adopt that strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third amendment to come up for consideration since the debate began yesterday morning. When we consider that the debate on the Constitution Bill in 1937 lasted only three days it does not say much for our succinctness that we have only reached the third amendment.  Perhaps the reason for this is that the Opposition are trying to filibuster the debate and whether this is good or bad is a matter of opinion.  The amendment before us states that the Bill should not come into effect until such time as the commission have published their report and a motion approving the report has been passed by each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Subsection (2) of amendment No. 3 sets out the matters the report of the commission should refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> On 29 May, in his contribution to the debate on a Private Members' motion, Deputy Mitchell suggested that an independent review group be set up to report within six months, whose terms of reference should include the future funding of RTE and alternative national, local and community radio and television services and the effect on the print media. Since the debate began Deputy Mitchell has been at pains to remind us that the Department was a hive of activity during 1982-87 when he was the Minister for Communications. He also stated that substantial research and preparatory work was carried out on the forerunner of the 1988 Broadcasting Bill.  He also remarked that it would be better to do nothing about the blatant flouting of the law at that time.  Quite frankly, I find it hard to understand how a former Minister for Communications, who on his own admission initiated research and preparatory work on legislation to deal with that fiasco, should now come forward with the proposal that an independent review groups should be set up at this stage to report within six months.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have failed to say in this debate what their policy is.  At present we are discussing the merits and demerits of the Government's policy.  At least that much is up for discussion in this debate.  My interjections have been for the sole purpose of finding out precisely what is Fine Gael policy.  Deputy Mitchell, their spokesman on Communications, in his contribution to this latest phase of the debate has been making all the right sounds and saying all the right things in terms of support for the independent broadcasting sector, but he has failed to grasp the nettle of how it is to be funded.  The position of Deputy Higgins, as I understand it, is that one should not speak about competition on the basis that in relation to television we do not yet have a competitor in the market.  He speaks about potential competitors and says that one should not interfere with the present State broadcasting service, which is a mixed service funded by licence fee and advertising, <Col N="1536" /> until the competitor is in the field and we are in a better position to gauge what aid, if any, is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins, by reason of his presence and contributions on Committee Stage, has enabled us to get away from the vitriolic rhetoric which we heard from the Leader of the Labour Party during the Second Stage debate, of which I have been very critical in terms of its tone and content.  It foists up a couple of scenarios which perhaps Members opposite will be able to clear up.  It is not my intention to introduce acrimony to this debate, which has been fairly gentlemanly up to now. Deputy Spring used unfortunate language and indicated that this Government and this party are corrupt &mdash; that word was used by Deputy Spring &mdash; in terms of money being in people's back pockets, in terms of the unwritten and hidden agenda of this party looking after their wealthy friends.  I do not know how many wealthy friends Deputy Spring has.  I suggest they are as many as I know.  Whether they are wealthy or impoverished, one should be very careful when one goes down that road.  It has added nothing to the debate and I would contend that the idea behind its introduction was to make whatever political capital he could.  There could be no other reason.  It is not the language which has been used by Deputy Higgins and Deputy O'Sullivan in putting forward the policy of the Labour Party in relation to broadcasting, which is a completely different matter.</P>
    <P>I say this because Deputy Mitchell in his contribution has stated that in his opinion an independent national radio station is not viable.  He was in the Department of Communications for five years and that is his considered opinion. I am trying to square that statement with the idea of setting up a regime for the introduction of franchises and licences for the independent radio broadcasting sector, which involves open inquiries and examinations, the submission of tenders and the taking of decisions by the Independent Radio and Television Commission, the independence of which I hope I established in my contribution last night.  How does that square with the <Col N="1537" /> assertion made by the Labour Leader about looking after wealthy friends when according to the spokesman for Fine Gael it is a non-viable operation from the start?</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is not a licence to print money and that there is a very competitive position between the State sector and the commercial sector.  It is clear that RTE have met the challenge more than adequately and I fail to understand why that sort of language was used without there being an ulterior motive which has nothing to do with the discussion of broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the Broadcasting Bill as something like a Rubik Cube &mdash; when it is turned one way something goes out of place the other way.  He stared at that Rubik Cube from 1982 to 1987 in the hope that it would become a crystal ball and that he might be able to gauge where to go from there.  He obviously did not figure it out.  There certainly was a mess and a regulatory framework had to be introduced.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that we cannot have deregulation in the absolute sense in terms of broadcasting policy because the dominance of broadcasting in disseminating information throughout society is so powerful that the idea of having no regulation as to content and standards would be a negation of responsibility in any parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>If one agrees with having an independent commercial sector, as Fine Gael say they do, and if one accepts, as Deputy Mitchell does, that there are difficulties in establishing the viability of an independent broadcasting sector, one must tackle the question of how to establish that viability.  There is a difference of opinion as to whether one should have an independent broadcasting sector, and at least one can understand the argument coming from the left of the House in regard to broadcasting policy.  If, however, one accepts the idea and recognises the difficulty in relation to viability, one must decide how to fund that sector. Given the dominant position of RTE, a position they have worked hard to attain in face of competition from outside the <Col N="1538" /> jurisdiction, and given that an independent broadcasting sector should be in existence, one must get them to the field before one can level it and establish their viability in a fair and equitable way so that there is access to the source of funds.</P>
    <P>The two sources of funding for the State broadcasting sector are the licence fee and advertising revenue.  These constitute 95 per cent of their funding arrangements.  The licence fee has been the sole preserve of RTE as the only broadcasting station in this jurisdiction. It was sought from the taxpayer and provided for the broadcasting station on the basis that in order to fulfil its public service obligations imposed on it by parliamentarians under statute such funding arrangements were necessary.  I agree such funding arrangements were necessary.</P>
    <P>Now we have more participants in the broadcasting sector, again established under statute by parliamentarians in this House.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the idea that seems to prevail still that the licence fee should remain the preserve of RTE who, as part of the broadcasting scene, are no longer the only player in the broadcasting sector. Why in principle should there be some objection, if one is interested in establishing the viability of an independent broadcasting sector, to the consideration of even a small proportion of that licence fee being available to people in the broadcasting sector?  If we have an Independent Radio and Television Commission and an independent broadcasting sector which, to comply with the statute which set up those stations, must have a percentage of their programmes devoted to public service broadcasting, why should there not be for public service broadcasting a proportion of the funding which is available totally to RTE at the moment?  Is there not a case to be considered that a small diversion of that fee should be available for the purpose of funding public service requirements of the independent broadcasting sector? Why is that anathema?</P>
    <P>I believe people are prepared to tolerate an independent broadcasting <Col N="1539" /> sector, if we are to have one at all, which would be funded from its own resources and would have to meet public service obligations for which it could expect no support whatever, thus having this plurality of choice people are talking about within our own jurisdiction.  Since we have no qualms about plurality of choice coming from outside the jurisdiction, what is the problem with having plurality of choice inside the jurisdiction? That could meet the argument put against the advertising option that there is leakage in the revenues available under the advertising option in terms of people from outside the jurisdiction getting part of that funding.  At least there is a case to be put that, if part of the licence fee were diverted, it would all go into the independent broadcasting sector in this jurisdiction.  That was not acceptable either.</P>
    <P>Now we have the capping of advertising revenue solely to allow the independent broadcasting sector access to the same sources of funding as the present dominant, formerly exclusive member of the Irish broadcasting club had.  When one looks at the support that can be got for local stations that are run and managed properly, one fails to see why the viability of those stations should not be welcomed by all sides of the House. Behind the debate at the end of the day is an attempt in legitimate and political terms to create a public political controversy, to give to people, parties and Governments motivation which suits a certain political purpose in terms of garnering political support or increasing it where they feel they have fair support at the moment.  That is legitimate in political terms, but it does not answer the questions involved in this broadcasting legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell, former Minister for Communications, who has done all the research, commissioned all the reports and knows substantially about all the ins and outs of this problem, is in favour of an independent broadcasting sector. How are you going to fund it?  That simple question remains unanswered.  Since he <Col N="1540" /> has hop-trotted around that question on every occasion on which he has stood up, we come back to the independent review group and the need to look at this again. Whatever we do, let us not make a decision.  That seems to be the attitude. Let us get so-called independent people because they will know what to do.  It is the classic definition of the abdication of political responsibility &mdash; give it to someone else to look at.</P>
    <P>It is like the arguments about what we should do about the Irish language.  We will commission a report.  I recall Liam Ó Murchú on an Irish programme putting up all the reports on the Irish language and I think the pile stood four feet tall and fewer and fewer people were speaking the language.  The commissioning of reports does not necessarily indicate the prospect of bringing about a successful policy in whatever area you are discussing. Jim Hacker, Minister for Administrative Affairs, said: &ldquo;Let us circulate the paper again and see what comes out of it&rdquo;.  Regardless of what legislation is decided in this House on this or any other issue, there will be a continuing debate on this area, as there is in regard to economic policy, fiscal policy, agricultural policy or anything else.  Nothing is carved in stone, but this legislation proposes that we get on with it and proceed with the proper funding of an independent broadcasting sector to allow them to get into the field and compete properly and meet their obligations under the statute imposed by the people in this House.</P>
    <P>This amendment is another excuse for inaction, which the former Minister for Communications, in his capacity as Fine Gael spokesperson on this issue, has been seeking to justify ever since the debate began.  He said it was better to do nothing because to do anything would be to do harm.  That is not the most positive attitude I have heard from an eminent member of the political community in my political lifetime.  We will do nothing because to do anything means there is a prospect that we will do harm.  However, that is not the real issue.  We will do <Col N="1541" /> nothing because if we do something we will offend someone.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to the argument and there are different ways of going about this; but you have to pick your horse and get up on the horse.  You cannot be leading him around the parade ring and picking up the next fellow when you come to the far side of the parade ring.  You have a look at him and change the colours with everyone shouting at you &ldquo;Which horse is going to win, Jim?  Which one are we on?&rdquo; The spokesman for Communications is looking towards these benches and telling us what we know in our hearts.  He said &ldquo;I know what ye feel in your hearts about this&rdquo;.  I often wonder whether his own backbenchers know what they feel in their own hearts.  Do they know what their broadcasting policy is?  Have no hard decisions yet been taken on it?  As Deputy O'Sullivan rightly pointed out, the reason we had no broadcasting decision between 1982 and 1987 was that we had a Coalition Government within which there were very fundamental differences as to how to go about it.  Fine Gael have been on their own for the last three years and are finding that out to their considerable disadvantage. They are on their own and they can make up their minds without being worried about what others say but they will need the courage of their convictions to come out and say it.</P>

I look forward with glee to the next amendment, if we have time to deal with it, and what a &ldquo;beaut&rdquo; it is.  Deputy Mitchell is anxious to set up an independent review group which will look into all aspects of the broadcasting policy.  I do not care who you put on the commission, nobody would be able to come up with the amendment which is to be discussed next, whereby we would involve the President of Ireland, after consultation with the Council of State, in choosing the broadcasting authority.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 (2) (e) expects the Commission to report on &ldquo;the maintenance and improvement of broadcasting standards&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However tenuous the connection, which I will try to strengthen, the amendment which involves the President, after consultation with the Council of State, appointing the members to the Authority is presumably an attempt to ensure the maintenance and improvement of broadcasting standards in Irish broadcasting policy.  I do not know whether this may be an indication from the Fine Gael Party or a forerunner of the new extended broad role the Presidency will have when that party can find a candidate to go forward for that esteemed office, but it seems to me to indicate that the politburo <Col N="1543" /> method of decision-making has run rampant in the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party and does not exhibit the wisdom that sometimes emanates from individual members of the Front Bench of the Party. The idea that the President would be involved in the appointments to a board, even one as august as the RTE Authority, would possibly involve him in day-to-day political controversies of the magnitude we have here before us, which would not reflect too highly on the dignity of his office.  Taken together with the fact that the President derives his functions under the Constitution, which are set out quite clearly in the Constitution, there is a possibility he can be censored by 30 Members of the Oireachtas, so perhaps we could have a situation where the President, having appointed an authority, 30 Members of the Oireachtas could bring forward a charge against him because he happened to have the unfortunate distinction of being next or near the RTE Authority as set up under Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  I do not believe the President should be involved in any way with any quango of whatever description or distinction.</P>

      <P>The debates which have taken place in this House and the comment on this subject in the media have shown the clear need for much more information on advertising.  This should be a function of the commission.  There has been total confusion so far as the comments of the Minister on advertising are concerned and the comments of other <Col N="1545" /> experts in the field &mdash; advertising agencies and so on.  The Minister requires much more information on advertising before he makes a decision on how much should go to the print media, how much will go abroad to UTV, Sky, the BBC, etc.  This element of confusion has existed right throughout the debate.  I think we saw yesterday how sloppily the Bill has been drafted and how it needs to be tightened up from a legal point of view if it is to hold water.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not done his homework and neither he nor Deputy Cowen know what will happen when the Bill is implemented.  It is like kicking a long ball and hoping it will end up in the net.  This is all right when there are people up front but unfortunately this will not be the position in this case.  This is why we need a commission who can inform the House and the Minister about the effects of his proposals.</P>
      <P>Many of the people who have spoken about public service broadcasting do not know what it means.  They do not know the extent to which a private commercial station will be involved in public sector broadcasting or community broadcasting. Therefore, we need a commission to advise us on such matters as funding, etc.  One of the elements such a commission should be discussing is seirbhís Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  That has not been considered by the Minister or the Government.  I am not blaming the Minister entirely because he is doing a job given to him by the Taoiseach.  It appears that the Government, and the Minister, gave no consideration to the question of seirbhís Teilifís na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois tá feachtas ar siúl ar feadh i bhfad chun Teilifís na Gaeltachta a chur ar bun.  Chomh luath agus thosaigh Raidió na Gaeltachta bhí an feachtas sin ar siúl.  Ní raibh daoine cinnte <Col N="1546" /> go dtí cúpla bliain ó shin, déarfainn, cad é go díreach a bhí a gceist acu. Bhí cuid acu ag caint faoí Theilifís na Gaeltachta, dála Raidió na Gaeltachta i gcomhair na nGaeltachtaí.  Ceapann chuile dhuine anois, áfach, nach mbeadh sé sin sásúil, nach féidir leat é sin a dhéanamh. Tá Raidió na Gaeltachta ag déanamh an-jab ar fad sna Gaeltachtaí ach níl mórán maitheasa ansin maidir le lucht labhartha na Gaeilge lasmuigh de na Gaeltachtaí, go mórmhór, abair, sna cathracha mar Bhaile Átha Cliath, Chorcaigh, Luimneach, Ghaillimh, Phort Lairge, Bhéal Feirste.  Ní fheileann sé seo do mhuintir na gcathracha.</P>
    <P>Tuigtear anois nach leor Teilifís na Gaeltachta i gcomhair na nGaeltachtaí amháin agus bheadh daoine sásta le teilifís náisiúnta na Gaeltachta nó na Gaeilge, is é sin go mbunófaí bealach teilifís a d'fhreastalódh ar phobal na Gaeltachta agus ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge sa tír ar fad.  Sin an sórt ruda atá ag teastáil agus sin an sórt a bhíi gceist ag an Taoiseach, sílim, cúpla bliain ó shin, mí na Samhna, 1988, nuair a d'iarr sé ar Údarás na Gaeltachta tuarascáil a ullmhú ar an gceist seo, ceist na teilifíse, chun a fháil amach an bhféadfaí bealach teilifíse a bhúnú, cén chaoi ab fhearr tabhairt faoina bhunú agus cén costas a bheadh ar a leithéid de sheirbhís.  Rinne Údarás na Gaeltachta é sin, le cabhair theicniúil ó RTÉ, agus chuir siad an tuarascáil os comhair an Rialtais, nó thug siad don Taoiseach é, pé scéal é.  B'fhéidir nach bhfaca éinne eile é, ach fuair seisean an tuarascáil.  Molann tuarascáil an Údaráis go mbunófaí córas teilifíse trí Ghaeilge, agus leagadh amach cén áit a mbunófaí na stiúdeonna, i nGaoth Dobhair, Conamara, Corca Dhuibhne. Chosnódh sé £1.5 mhilliún don chóras craolacháin, £2.5 mhilliún do na stiúideonna agus £1 mhilliún eile chun iad a cheangail le chéile &mdash; sin £5 mhílliún ar fad chun an córas iomlán a chur ar bun.  Mhol siad go mbeifí ag craoladh ar feadh dhá uair sa lá, 14 uair a chloig in aghaidh na seachtaine, agus dúirt siad sa tuarascáil go gcosnódh sé £9.5 mhilliún san iomlán in aghaidh na bliana.</P>

Is é an rud atá mé ag iarraidh a rá ná go gceapaim ón mBille seo go bhfuil sé seo caite i leataobh ag an Rialtas, nach bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas ar chor ar bith go mbeadh córas Teilifíse i nGaeilge i gcomhair na Gaeltachta curtha ar bun go deo.  Sin an fáth go bhfuilim ag caint faoi na costais.  Cá has a dtiocfaidh an t-airgead seo, an £9 milliún seo sa bhliain chun an bealach teilifíse i nGaeilge do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus lucht labhartha na Gaeilge a chur ar bun?

    <P>Má tá sé leis an airgead seo a aimsiú, níl ach cúpla slí ann ina bhféadfaí an t-airgead a fháil.  B'fhéidir go bhfaigheadh sé ó tháillí cheadúnas RTÉ nó b'fhéidir ó ioncam fógraíochta RTÉ.  Níl aon rud sa Bhille seo a thaispeánann conas is féidir le córas teilifíse i nGaeilge ioncam fógraíochta a aimsiú.  Ba chóir don Aire a fhiafraí den Taoiseach cá háit a bhfaighidh Teilifís na Gaeltachta an t-airgead. An féidir rud éigin a chur sa Bhille seo sula gcuirtear tríd an Dáil amárach é, mar atá beartaithe ag an Aire.  Cad is féidir linn a dhéanamh leis an mBille chun £10 milliún sa bhliain a aimsiú.  Deir Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhféadfaí an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil ar níos lú airgid, b'fhéidir £5 mhilliún.  Pé scéal é, beidh an t-airgead seo ag teastáil má tá rún ag an Taoiseach a leithéid a chur ar bun.  Mar sin, cá bhfaighidh sé an t-airgead?  Sílim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeimis ag caint <Col N="1548" /> faoi seo anois agus go mbeadh rud éigin le rá ag an Aire faoi.</P>
    <P>It seems from the Bill that the Minister or the Taoiseach decided that we can forget about Teilifís na Gaeltachta, a television station in Irish for Irish speakers and for the Gaeltacht, because the income available to RTE and TV3 will now be split between them and neither will be able to run a decent television programme.  Their standards will be reduced to a lower level than those of any other television station in Western Europe.  However, we will have the two of them and they will have to do the best they can with the money available.  It is obvious that nothing will be available for Teilifís na Gaeltachta or any Irish television service unless RTE's income is reduced or the advertising revenue divided to ensure that they get £10 million per year to run 14 hours per week.  It is a tiny service, but that is what it will cost.  It will be of immense value to the Gaeltacht and to the Irish language.  The Minister should not allow this Bill to be pushed through without making an effort to have money available to service the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers.  It would cost roughtly £5 million to establish and £9.5 million per year to run a small service with limited output.  My remarks are relevant to the section and the need for a commission to look into so many things that the Minister, the Government or the Taoiseach have not considered.</P>
    <P>The Government commissioned a report from Údarás na Gaeltachta 18 months ago, they tossed it aside and produced this Bill, which does not even mention the possibility of such a station ever being established.  They grabbed all the money and divided it between RTE and TV3, etc, totally ignoring the need for the station, even though the Minister has the name of asking for a report on it.  I do not blame the Minister, he did not seek such a report and probably does not envisage that such a station will ever be set up.  The Taoiseach, who is Minister for the Gaeltacht, must have given some consideration to this and have some idea of how it will be financed.  Will it be financed from the national lottery, which <Col N="1549" /> finances everything?  It now finances the local authority parks departments and will soon be financing half the health service at the rate it is going.  The Minister's thinking seems to be that we will allocate a lottery grant, but that sort of thinking is not sufficient as far as an Irish language television station is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister should leave a loophole in the Bill whereby Teilifís na Gaeltachta can get some of the cream from advertising to run the station without reducing RTE's income even further.  The advertising revenue has been split almost in two.  Will the Minister further reduce it or will he devise a method for skimming something off TV3 to assist in the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeltachta?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier today in my contribution I endeavoured to make a case for establishing a commission.  There is another aspect to this amendment: that the Bill when enacted will not come into effect until such time as the commission have reported.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the points made by Deputy Cowen, who missed the central point in the Bill.  What right has an individual, or individuals, to have access to the State sector funds?  This has not been clarified to my satisfaction by the Minister or by anyone in his party.  It is unusual, to say the least, to get funds in this manner; indeed, it is immoral. Deputy Cowen asked how we could establish the viability of a station.  One way to do it is by giving a massive subvention from State funds as proposed in the Bill.  How do you deal with competition? It is very easy to deal with it if you have State back-up.  We have not addressed this matter.  We mentioned the methods by which the money would be taken from RTE but we will have to ask why we are doing this.  Has anybody the right to do it?  I do not think that we have any such right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also asked why RTE should have exclusive rights to the licence fee.  The reason is that RTE since their foundation have been the recipient of this form of <Col N="1550" /> support.  It is the only station which has an obligation to the ordinary people and for that reason the State is duty bound to ensure that the station runs smoothly. I referred to the orchestras, repertory companies and the various RTE singers and groups who work in RTE.  They have provided a very good service to the State down through the years.  The monopoly was not of RTE's choosing; it was determined on the floor of the House.  As a result, we are obliged to ensure that they survive.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for people on this side of the House to determine Government policy in view of the fact that it changed three times in the last month.  When we have established the policy of the Government or the Minister, maybe we will then be able to advance the debate a little further.  A case has not been made for any individual, or individuals, having the right to £10 million or £12 million from the State's coffers.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this debate but, as I listened over the last two days to the contributions from the various speakers, I realised I would not be serving my constitutents or the nation if I continued to listen to it on the monitor and did not express an opinion here.  I want to comment on the Workers' Party amendment before us.  I would be quite amazed, as would be many others, including perhaps Fianna Fáil backbenchers, if at the conclusion of this debate the Minister does not take on board some of the well argued, well thought-out points presented from this side of the House.  At this stage the Minister will be aware of the feelings of his backbenchers, many of whom are now expressing not just among themselves, but certainly to members of The Workers' Party, including myself, their reservations about the Bill in its present form.  It would be my hope that those reservations will pursuade the Minister to decide that the format of this Bill can be improved substantially by accepting our amendment which would allow him time to look at the overall position afresh, <Col N="1551" /> allowing him and his Cabinet colleagues time over the summer recess to re-assess what has been said, equally allowing the commission time to publish their report, which is of such importance to this debate.</P>
      <P>In speaking on amendment No. 2 it is important to acknowledge the need for the establishment of a commission on broadcasting in order to review in what direction sound and visual broadcasting and community broadcasts are going. Our amendment calls on the Minister to step back from the brink so that the commission can study the various conflicting demands and opinions being expressed, not just by Members of this House but by the media in general.  In fact, men and women on the street are talking about the attack this Bill represents on RTE; and there are opinions being expressed by the various interest groups, not least of whom are workers in RTE, whose employment will be terminated if this Bill is passed in its present unamended form.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be aware of the expressed opinions of workers who demonstrated outside this House.  When I talked to them I discovered, to my amazement, that, far from their representing Leftie militants, I was speaking to female contract workers accompanied by their children, to independent film-makers, in fact it appeared to me that the majority were not pensionable employees of RTE but people in various walks of life, with various skills, in many different types of employment who were dependent on work emanating through the RTE network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members will remember a service provided by RTE &mdash; in the main unrecognised &mdash; when all of us had our photographs taken in Buswells Hotel, when two photographers and a lady make-up artist spent in the region of two weeks photographing our faces so that as part of their public service they could use those images on their television screens.  It would be interesting to see what would happen if ever this obligation were to be placed on the shoulders of commercial <Col N="1552" /> companies engaged in television broadcasting, through I am sure the answer is that very definitely this obligation would not be placed on them.  When one looks at the cost of engaging professional photographers and make-up artists, working long hours in Buswells Hotel, then one can appreciate in a strange sort of way one of the least publicised aspects of public service broadcasting.  They laid on this service for us politicians so that our images could be projected in a complimentary manner on RTE screens.</P>
    <P>When we speak about the commission we should remember we are talking about all of the many forces, not merely RTE workers but the various interest groups and advertising organisations, who fully realise the implications of this Bill being passed in its present form because it will result in higher advertising rates, which in turn will lead to higher prices to the consumer in respect of the goods advertised. Is it not ironic that in the so-called interests of creating a level playing pitch the Minister's Bill, if passed, would not merely put people out of work and lower the standards of broadcasting on radio and television but would also lead to a spiralling of the prices of the goods being advertised?</P>
    <P>It will have become quite clear to the Minister that the case has been well made that such displaced advertising will not necessarily be re-absorbed by the print media or the Irish business classes.  The case has been well made that much of the advertising that would have gone through RTE henceforth will find its way into the coffers of, say, Sky, UTV, ITV or the other broadcasting organisations.  The commission should and would take on board the opinions of advertising organisations. It is the opinion of these advertising agencies, who are now aware, because of the advertising time limiting provisions of this Bill, that such advertising slots will be taken up mainly by the huge corporations with colossal budgets at their disposal, when smaller business companies endeavouring to sell their products on the Irish market will not get a look in.</P>
    <P>Here we have a republican party, one <Col N="1553" /> well known for its nationalism, who keep singing the praises of the small businessman, with campaigns such as the Ógra Fhianna Fáil &ldquo;be Irish, Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign; yet if the Minister will not accept our amendment and this Bill is enacted in its present form, it will be ironic that the very people Fianna Fáil claim to represent most will be the net losers in this battle.  So much for Fianna Fáil support of the small businesmen and women when henceforth on the national broadcasting stations they will be unable to compete for advertisement slots with large companies on two grounds &mdash; first, because of cost, because the cost of advertisement slots will spiral; and, second, because of the time limitations on advertisements in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Our amendment would allow the commission to examine the overall question of broadcasting and funding and the type of broadcasting systems we, as a small island nation, should have and which we can afford.  We contend that the commission should be allowed time in which to publish their report before this Bill is passed.  We are only on amendment No.2 and to my amazement I heard on a news bulletin &mdash; I do not know if it was announced here in the House &mdash; that the Minister intends yet again to stymie debate on the Broadcasting Bill, having once achieved this through trickery and conniving with his party colleagues.</P>

      <P>The commission chairman should be allowed to get on with the job of assessing, analysing, debating and taking on board the opinions of the various forces that are at play in the communications area and the advertisers and all those with adverse points of view would be listened to.  The commission would then produce their report which would be brought before the House before the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>A very important role for this commission would be to deal with the question of competing broadcasting agencies, both public and commercial.  They would clearly have to look at the question of funding, which is a key issue, along with the duties of the station as regards their obligations to provide a balanced range of programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has coined the term &ldquo;level playing pitch&rdquo; and other people have spoken about that and about how <Col N="1555" /> the Minister has been changing the goalposts. I would like to address the question of whether or not there can ever be a level playing pitch.  What is this so-called playing pitch to be?  It is in fact desirable? Is this level playing pitch as advertised by the Minister and written up in this Bill what the public are demanding?  Is it what they want?  Does the Minister believe there is a popular demand on the part of the public for this Minister to bring in such a disastrous Bill?  Is it just a way to fulfil in a vindictive way threats to the staff of RTE who, it is felt, should not hassle the Minister or, for that matter, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan?</P>
    <P>In looking at the so-called playing pitch it is important to try to figure out what the Minister has in mind and why the urgency to rush it through the House and have his fellow speakers, like Deputy Callely, sit down in order to stymie debate.  What is going on in the mind of the Minister?  Various people have expressed their opinion of what is the intent of the Minister and I have reminded the Minister that it is my belief that the Minister is acting in a vindictive way against what he perceives to be political or other forces at large in Irish society and what he will, once and for all, bring them to task.  Could it be that the Minister is motivated by some sort of Workers' Party phobia of the sort which seems to be afflicting the leading article writer of <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> judging by leading articles in that paper in the recent past.  People with phobias need their heads examined and should never be placed in positions of power as leader writers for otherwise reputable newspapers.  This Bill has all the hallmarks of a determination to please, to honour political debts, to remind RTE and Cathal Mac Coille that it is remembered that an awkward question was asked of the Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who victimised Aer Lingus by giving Ryanair exclusive rights to Stansted, Liverpool and Munich last year. The simple question that was asked of Minister Brennan then was if Fianna Fáil <Col N="1556" /> had received any financial contribution from Guinness Peat Aviation, and the Minister forced RTE to apologise.</P>

      <P>With respect to the civil servants who have to work alongside the Minister, I have to say that this was not a well-worked out Bill produced by professional civil servants.  It seems to have more of a boot boy flavour about it, an attempt at coming to terms with RTE and making sure that those in the commercial radio and television areas are looked after and that political favours are returned.</P>
      <P>We want the Minister to accept the amendment before us so that the commission will have time to produce a report in a fair and objective way looking at all the various aspects of broadcasting, including the technical means of transmitting, the pros and cons of the MMDS, reflector, satellite and piped television systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to go back to the question of the level playing pitch and pose the question again as to what type of level playing pitch it is?  Is that what is being demanded by the public?  According to the tremendously high ratings of RTE, the public are very happy with RTE, with three-quarters of the listenership in the country listening to RTE programmes. They have a full complement in their symphony orchestra; they have a chamber orchestra, choirs, actors and various <Col N="1557" /> very expensive agencies to carry.  May I ask the Minister if the commercial stations will be obliged to provide these cultural activities?  The symphony orchestra is the backbone of the National Concert Hall where they regularly perform. If these orchestras were to suffer as a result of capping the advertisements of RTE, an aspect of the cultural life of the city and indeed the country would suffer. Have the Minister and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers considered the threat posed in the legislation for worthwhile activities such as these?  I am sure the Minister is aware of how much it costs RTE to fund their orchestras.  There is the Concert Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra, the Chamber Orchestra and the famous RTE Players.  Would commercial radio or television be obliged to engage such a wide range of talent? Quite clearly the answer is no.  Would commercial radio or television be obliged to provide programmes for minority groups?  Again, the answer is no.  The advertisers would not be interested in investing money at times when programmes for minority groups are being broadcast.</P>
    <P>As has been stated today, to a large degree the State carries the burden of broadcasting for the minority.  I think it is true that there is not a high listenership to programmes broadcast in Irish.  What will become of RTE with the squeezing of their funding?  Will these programmes geared for the minority be the first to suffer?  The answer is yes.  The commercial sector, being interested in making money, will not try to service the needs of the minority.  Is a level playing pitch desirable?  Should it be our ambition to weaken the strong, successful public broadcasting companies in order to strengthen private companies whose commitment is not to broadcasting but to profit?  Will we reduce broadcasting to mundane, cheap radio and television broadcasting?  The point has been made very clearly in the last couple of days that the curtailments proposed in this Bill, including the proposals for licence fees and the capping of advertisements, will <Col N="1558" /> result in a reduction in the quality of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I would make a comparison at this point with the so-called level playing pitch in the United States of America, of which the Minister is well aware.  Anyone who has been to that country will tell you that broadcasting, both on radio and television, is a disaster and a joke.  It is amazing the number of people who, only after visiting that country, appreciate the high quality of broadcasting in Ireland. The irony is that the public broadcasting corporations in America, both radio and television, buy the best quality programmes from England, mainly the BBC, and occasionally from Ireland. Anyone who visits America is immediately conscious of the very poor quality of radio and television broadcasting there.  Is this where we are heading?  Is this the level of so-called entertainment we are going to provide for the nation if this Bill is passed?</P>
    <P>There is no popular demand for this gross interference in RTE's operations.  I would ask the Minister where is the popular demand for the Bill.  Needless to say, the Minister will be reminded that the 1.25 million people who are watching the excellent coverage of the World Cup are not demanding this Bill.  I imagine about 1.5 million people will watch the game on RTE Network 2 next Saturday.  They are extremely happy with the performance of RTE and are not demanding this Bill.  Today's newspapers report on yesterday's comments by the Minister on RTE's coverage of the World Cup.  Those comments give an incredible insight into the Minister's mind.  On the one hand he attempted to praise RTE for their coverage of the World Cup while on the other hand he had the audacity to say he feels that the Bord Gáis logo is being used too much.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister so burning in his distaste for RTE that he cannot sit back and enjoy the incredible spectacle on RTE of the Republic of Ireland team lifting the spirit of the nation by performing so well on the football pitch?  Imagine the Minister, as he must have been, with a stop watch taking the time of the Bord Gáis logo. <Col N="1559" /> He then comes into the House with this useless information.  That gives a great insight into the Minister's mind.  He could not be as human as the rest of the country and sit back, appreciate and admire the excellence of the coverage of the World Cup by RTE but rather spent his time with a stop watch counting the seconds the Bord Gáis logo is on the screen.  That makes the Minister unique in this House.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there is a lot more that can be said on this matter.  I would ask Deputies on all sides of the House, particularly the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, to seriously consider The Workers' Party amendment.  They should recognise there is no popular demand for this Bill.  There is quite a strong reaction to the attempts by the Minister to bring in this Bill that will damage to such an extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With reference to this section and having regard to the desirability or otherwise of setting up a commission, I see the amendment as being constructive and reasonable.  Setting up this commission can do no harm and in fact can do much good.  Despite the fact that a number of reports have been commissioned from time to time in relation to various issues, ranging from the Irish language to transport and so on, it is true that many of those reports have gathered dust and a great deal of work has not been done on them afterwards.  Nonetheless, in this case the report of a commission or an on-going supervisory body could be of considerable benefit.  A couple of years ago if one were to listen to the pundits one would have imagined that broadcasting in the private sector was a bed of roses and that it was only a matter of time before somebody tapped a crock of gold.  For the life of me I cannot understand where all that euphoria has <Col N="1560" /> gone.  For that reason a commission that would be able to evaluate the thrust and direction of broadcasting and its requirements over a period would be a useful exercise to pursue at present.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct, if I may, one or two remarks that were made by the speakers opposite and also an interjection by the Minister on the day on which the Second Stage of the Bill collapsed. The Minister in response to Deputy Byrne indicated that there were no speakers on the Opposition side of the House.  In actual fact there were speakers on this side of the House.  As in many other cases in relation to many other Bills, the majority of the speakers are provided by the Opposition in this House.  On that day a speaker on behalf of Fine Gael was making a contribution and at the same time Deputy Michael D. Higgins approached a person &mdash; Deputy Callely &mdash; on the opposite side who indicated that he intended to speak for some 20 minutes or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the record prior to the sos was a remark from the Minister indicating a contradictory statement to what I have just said.  The record needs to be set straight.  I accept that everybody has a right to speak and that one must speak to the Bill and to the section in the Bill, which I am attempting to do. I honestly believe, however, that if the Minister or other speakers wander and make references such as that, one should have the right to reply.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general thrust of this amendment, I see many good reasons why the commission should be established. For example, they could advise the Minister and the rest of us as to how we could proceed in the future and could identify the strengths and weaknesses of broadcasting.  What do we want in terms of broadcasting in Ireland?  Do we want a national radio and television network; or, as enunicated in the policies of the Progressive Democrats, perhaps we want to divest ourselves of that and go for something different?  The commission could tell us something about that.  From past experience and from what we have heard of the policies of the Progressive Democrats, it would appear that they would be in favour of privatisation to a far greater extent than most other parties in this House.  Perhaps their intention would be to proceed alone the road of privatisation in respect of our television and radio network; then it may be anticipated that we would not have a national network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commission would be useful to determine exactly how we should proceed and who and what interests wish to proceed in a particular fashion.  We could compare ourselves with countries such as that across the water where there is a multi-channel land, as we have on the east coast of Ireland, and where there are national broadcasting services and independent broadcasting services.  It can be argued, and rightly so, that the merits in favour of competition are obvious, <Col N="1562" /> having regard to the large population and a big market.  Obviously, a population of that size can command and demand a greater and finer degree of service.  From the service provided, which is of a very high quality, it would appear to me, as a casual television viewer, that they have arrived at a very good mix of public and private broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting is a very sensitive area. Because of its sensitivity the need to have a reasonable blend of public and private broadcasting should be obvious.  The next question we should ask ourselves is: to what extent do we have the second system &mdash; in other words, the private system?  Is it to be at a cost to the public system &mdash; RTE &mdash; which operates?  It would appear to us that that will be the case.  I would add that, before the sos, we were ridiculed on this side of the House by Deputy Cowen, on the basis that, in regard to previous broadcasting legislation introduced during the term of office of a previous Government, there did not appear to be agreement between the coalition parties.  I would say this: at least we appeared in the House at the same time.  Those of us who were around then and thankfully are still around, can testify to that.  It is a pity the same cannot be said for the people opposite where they could all come in and justify together exactly what their ambitions and targets were in relation to the future of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the other aspects of the Bill.  Reference has already been made to the impact of advertising and so on.  If we are to have a dual service surely a commission would be useful in determining in a totally dispassionate way the extent to which one will be superseded or eroded by the other, and giving some indication as to the structures and guidelines within which the two systems would operate.  They should also be in a position to give some indication of the structures or guidelines within which the two systems, if we are to have two systems, should operate.  I have no doubt that such an independent commission would be invaluable in that they would be able to <Col N="1563" /> inform this House and the general public on the correct route to take.</P>
    <P>What is very worrying, and I say this with no personal animosity towards any member of the Government, is that the Government very unwisely arbitrarily decided to introduce legislation.  We are now discussing section 2 of what is very controversial legislation which seeks to change the broadcasting system.  There has been a long discussion on the amendment which seeks to prevent a decision to further change the broadcasting system being taken in future.  It goes without saying that our national television and radio service has done the nation proud and there is no reason to believe that this will not continue to be the case.  Admittedly, with the passage of time and as the service evolves, changes will be called for and the Government may encourage the service to change their structure but we feel we are being forced to examine the operation of the national broadcasting service and bring about changes which ultimately may have such a detrimental effect on that service that it becomes non-viable. That would not be desirable and for this reason it would be very useful to have a commission to advise us on whether we were taking the right road.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in personalities but it could be said that much would depend on who would appoint the members of the commission and on what basis they would be appointed.  However I would have to accept that professional people, once appointed to do a job, would carry it out to the best of their ability.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider accepting this amendment.  He has not indicated, as far as I am aware, whether or not he is going to accept it but I ask him to do so on the basis that it would be of as much use to him and the Government as it would to Members on this side of the House and the general public.</P>
    <P>Up to now in the broadcasting sector one company has had a monopoly.  The service has been paid for by way of the licence fee and so on.  It has become more efficient and has begun to make profits. <Col N="1564" /> They should be encouraged to do so.  We should not respond by saying that the time has come to clip their revenue and to allow further systems to develop.  I am quite sure that anyone in politics would readily accept that competition is the life of trade.  It is very important that there be competition as it keeps everybody on their toes.  It is probable, in the broadcasting sector, that competition between the public and private sectors would be of benefit to both but this does not tie in with the theory which was rampant a few years ago and to which I have referred, that there are vast amounts of money to be made in private broadcasting.  It would now appear that no such resources exist. It has been stated that the pirate stations were allowed to operate at will while Members on the other side of the House also criticised the Government of 1982-87 for failing to take action against the pirate stations but I would have to point out that the pirate stations were in existence long before we came into office, that promises had been made but no action had been taken.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves in the position we are in because decisions were taken on foot of wrong information.  This highlights the need for the establishment of a commission.  If we had the benefit of this information a few years ago we would have been able to point out to somebody somewhere that we should proceed more slowly, that perhaps there was no crock of gold as some people had anticipated and that we should examine the case more fully.  That aspect needs to be considered, given that the industry will evolve and the Government will need a body to give them an unbiased view on the developments taking place and on what may be required in the future.</P>
    <P>While no one encouraged the setting up of pirate stations, their number increased to fill a need which was not being met.  It can be argued that their overheads were low and they did not employ as many people as the national broadcasting service, and that is true in most cases but not all.  It is also true that some of these stations provided a useful service and built up a large listenership. <Col N="1565" /> When it was announced that they were to be put off the air a considerable amount of pressure was brought to bear upon us and we were lobbied by a large number of people who suggested that they be allowed remain on the air.  This would seem to indicate that they had found a niche for themselves in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>We brought in legislation which allowed for a more sophisticated system and the introduction of a legalised private broadcasting service, but we did not have sufficient information and sufficient research had not been carried out into what was likely to happen in the light of developments taking place.  That applied a couple of years ago and will certainly apply in a few years' time.  Some kind of body, such as the commission suggested in this amendment, would provide useful information to legislators and if retained on an on-going basis the commission would be in a position to alert the legislators as to the requirements of the industry in the future.</P>
    <P>Broadcasting, like any business, obviously has to change with the times and modern technology has changed it dramatically.  The reason we saw the growth of the so-called pirate stations was that technology made it simple and easy for any group at relatively low cost to become involved in the business.  The same is likely to happen in the future, particularly in the area of television. What is regarded now as an extremely expensive and tedious operation will, within a few years, have been streamlined through the use of technology to the extent that it will be within the reach of people with a much smaller budget.  What will happen then?  Do we diversify through the existing national broadcasting system or by way of a mix of public and private broadcasting?  Do we decide to go public altogether or to go private altogether?  A national network system is essential, having regard to experience in other countries.  We should not do anything to undermine broadcasting or to restrict the future development of such a service by attempting to erode its fund raising or commercial <Col N="1566" /> capacity or by legislating.  We must look to the future on the basis that in five or six years' time, given present and projected developments, it is likely there will be within the reach of those on a reasonably low budget the means of providing services which were heretofore felt to be outside the budget of small working groups.</P>
    <P>Given these developments, this question will arise again.  There may be legislators here in a few years' time discussing these issues.  The proposal contained in the amendment is useful and worthwhile and could save the legislators a great deal of trouble.  It could certainly save the industry both trouble and money and enable us to approach the industry with some kind of <i>rationale.</i></P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider the inclusion of this amendment and clear the path for all of us in determining exactly where the broadcasting service should go in the future.  It would also give us an insight into the health of the industry and the likely obstacles in the future.  This would alert the industry to possible changes long before having to take dramatic action.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason for the introduction of the Bill in the first place. If a report from the commission referred to here had been available to the Minister, we would not be in this position. When a controversial Bill such as this is brought before the House we should not allow the debate on any Stage to degenerate to the extent that this has done.  Good relations are important for everybody in this House.  A bit of one upmanship is quite all right in non-controversial legislation but when one upmanship is used in the area of controversy it leaves things open for use by everybody in the future. If one side win today, another side in the House will win tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I take the opportunity to respond to some of the remarks made from the Government side regarding The Workers' Party amendment moved this morning.  While there have been a large number of very useful and constructive statements in support from the Opposition side, there have been three interventions from the Government side and I wish to address the points made in the hope that perhaps we are not entirely working at nought and that there is the prospect that the Minister may reflect on the amendment and seize the opportunity to show an enlightened response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea was the first to intervene and made some suggestion at the outset that he had no interest in delaying the Bill, suggesting quite clearly that this was the objective of those of us who were attempting to address the serious issues in the Bill and to pursue serious amendments. It is a poor reflection and it was repeated by Deputy Cowen in his opening remarks when he suggested that we <Col N="1568" /> were engaged in a filibuster.  I suppose it is to his credit to be the first Deputy in the House in the course of this Committee Stage debate to use the word that no doubt some people on the Government side are thinking of.  I regret any suggestion that those of us who are trying to address the issues and propose and pursue amendments in this House are engaged in filibuster.  We are not engaged in obstructionism or trying to deny serious debate on important and fundamental issues of legislative proposal on the part of the Government.  Regrettably, it was a view repeated by the Government Chief Whip in interview outside this House, and it is proper on the first opportunity available to me as the proposer of the amendment we are debating to categorically reject that suggestion.</P>
    <P>In passing I want to refer to the sketch drafted in <i>The Irish Times</i> today of the debate that went on in this House yesterday.  It is a slight on Members of all sides in this Chamber, from Government to all Opposition groups who stayed here to the late hour ordered by this House to debate the issues, to suggest that the incentive for them to stay here might well have been the availability of beverages in the Members' bar which was concurrently open.  That should not have been said.  It was also suggested that Members who participated in the debate were given to nods of sleep and snoring.  I want to put on the record that throughout the time I was here, which was all during the day, I did not notice any Member of this House either snoring or sleeping, but noticed the author of the piece in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> himself slipping into sleep.</P>

      <P>In relation to the point of order raised by the Minister, while we are not interested in naming individuals, let me say that, as somebody who was here all last evening, who has read the piece Deputy McCartan referred to and participated in the debate, Deputy McCartan speaks for me and, I believe, for every Member of this House who is unfairly reflected on in the piece of reporting in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my point and I thank Deputy Higgins for his support but I am quite surprised to hear the Minister's refutation and his coming to the aid of the journalist's profession, particularly when we consider the experience of journalists in RTE at his own and other governmental hands.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate my refutation of any point made by Deputy O'Dea or Deputy Cowen that we are seeking to delay this Bill or engage in some parliamentary tactic seeking to deny to this debate any opportunity of full completion.  That is the second point I wish to make in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the previous amendment I had put a number of questions to the Minister in regard to some issues and points I believed had not been answered, and I took the point from him in his last intervention on that amendment that he would answer those outstanding queries when we arrived at section 5 dealing with the substantive issue of advertising.  I accepted that in good faith at the time, I was a fool to have done so because we have been advised today in the schedule of business circulated from the Whips' meeting that the Government propose to impose a Whips' guillotine on the debate at 4 o'clock tomorrow evening on all the remaining amendments on Committee Stage other than those of the Minister. Consequently, the very substantial number of amendments that will remain unaddressed will include those issues that the Minister promised he would address in the course of the debate.  It is not the <Col N="1570" /> first time promises in regard to the debate on this Bill have been broken by Government. We were promised we would have a full debate on Second Stage.  That was not afforded us.  We were promised on Committee Stage a degree of latitude so that those deprived of a Second Stage contribution could at least expand on ideas on Committee Stage.  We have been told today that will not happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea's second point was that the only response of Opposition to the fact that the Minister has tackled a mess and had done something about the morass that had been there was simply to object and block and be obstructive.  I regret he made that remark because clearly it indicates that he had not listened to some of the points I made in my contribution on the amendment.  I recognised fully the progress made by this Minister in the early stages in his attempt to address an unfortunate saga at the conclusion of the eighties with regard to broadcasting and its proper development here.  I went on to acknowledge the progress that had been made but to express regret that all of that was now to be kicked out, rendered at nought, and the Minister was heading off in a disastrous direction that reflected in no good way on what had gone before in his term of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea went on to say that unless the Minister's Bill was allowed into law and not arrested further, &ldquo;a large part of the commercial transmission area will collapse&rdquo;.  I find that statement remarkable in this context.  We on this side of the House have been attempting to quantify in some way the extent of the problems the Minister is seeking to address in this legislation.  It is acknowledged that in the latter stages of the Bill there are some sections that deal with matters outstanding which should be addressed, such as dealing with transmission reflectors and the MMDS system on the one hand and the appointment of an auditor internal to RTE's purposes on the other, but we cannot understand how three sections of the Bill were drafted and placed before us at the end of May and within days two of them could be <Col N="1571" /> abandoned in response to pressures from whatever quarter.  If there is this imminent collapse of a large part of the commercial transmission sector as Deputy O'Dea claims, how can a Minister vacillate so dramatically on his proposals to address that impending problem?  Deputy O'Dea produced no evidence to support his wild allegations that a large part of the commercial transmission area is under threat and there are companies of high profile who have specific difficulties.  There has been no attempt to address those difficulties or analyse why they are there, and there is constant harking back to the notion that there is an unlevel playing pitch to be dealt with and that competition must be made fairer.  I ask for evidence from Deputy O'Dea or the Minister to justify the wide and sweeping statement that a large part of commercial transmission will collapse.</P>
    <P>Finally, he exhorted us on the Opposition side not to hide our light under a bushel, to come forward if we had ideas. I tell him to address his Minister and ask him to lift the guillotine on this debate and let us progress with the development of ideas and the expansion of the discussion, and good ideas will emerge.</P>
    <P>As I indicated this morning, one good idea which has emerged from this debate so far is the proposals advocated and presented yesterday by &ldquo;Campaign 25&rdquo; on behalf of the independent film makers in this country.  They had proposed a workable formula which will meet the Minister's target of the redistribution of resources.  On the other hand, if they are fully investigated they can save and secure those jobs in the public sector that will inevitably be displaced, distributed or destroyed by what has been suggested. Therefore, if they are looking for suggestions we believe they are there, but the real issues that need to be discussed at the moment and need to be investigated are not short-term ambulance operations. They are far more fundamental propositions.  The Minister recognised that they were not addressed during the eighties but, as I have already stated, <Col N="1572" /> they should have been.  The Minister said that that was the time to have debated these issues.  I agree that it would have been the better time to have debated them but in making that point the Minister proves my case that there are basic issues of principle which have not been addressed by successive Governments and which were left unexplored and not defined.  That being so, the Minister should not simply say the time is not now opportune to discuss these issues.  We will never again have the opportunity to take them up.  The Minister, in recognising that there has been a lacuna in the debate, should accept the amendment proposed by The Workers' Party and defer the implementation of the legislation, hotchpotched as it is, and look at these fundamental issues again.  In the light of the emerging facts, experiences, representations and analyses, he should formulate new legislation which will not be open to criticism by us in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister should deal specifically with the idea of a commission at this stage.  I believe he is completely confused about what he is attempting to do in this legislation.  The Minister has shifted ground constantly on the fundamental principle of the Bill.  In his response he stated that his fundamental and first principle, if I noted his remarks correctly, was to give participants in the broadcasting area an opportunity to compete fairly.  That is not in keeping with what the Minister said in his Second Stage speech in this House.  He said the need for broadcasting legislation was not simply to address the problem of creating a structure for local radio, it was in equal measure a response to the emerging international broadcasting environment. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Other important elements of the Government's broadcasting policy are: to ensure that Irish broadcasting becomes a growth industry in line with the growth of broadcasting seen in all other countries; ensuring as far as possible that Irish broadcasting remains the mainstream Irish viewers' and <Col N="1573" /> listeners' choice; bringing new investment and higher productivity into Irish broadcasting, and creating new secure employment in the sector ...</P>
    <P>Further on in his speech he referred to the need to establish a fair competitive environment.  He said:</P>
    <P>A logical corollary to the process of opening up the broadcasting sector is the need to establish a fair competitive environment in it.</P>
    <P>Throughout his speech the Minister referred, in order of priority, to the need for a fair competitive environment.  Yet in replying to The Workers' Party amendment he abandoned the basic elements of the Government's broadcasting policy and the two fundamental tasks of his Department &mdash; the need to secure a fair and developing broadcasting ethos for local radio and respond to international developments &mdash; and said that the first principle was the establishment of a fair competitive environment for participants.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confused and is shifting ground on these important issues.  This makes my case for the need for the Minister to go back to the basic first principle and review what exactly is going on in the field.  Our amendment proposes to give the Minister the opportunity to do this by deferring the enactment of the legislation until he receives the report of the commission proposed in amendment No. 3.  This report could be debated fully in both Houses of the Oireachtas in advance of any further steps which might be taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the results of the joint national listnership research study which were published today in the media.  He quoted extensively from the survey in order to show that there has been a remarkable burgeoning in the independent broadcasting sector.  I do not think anybody doubted this success.  Reservations were expressed earlier about the extent to which they were succeeding but no-one would in any way deny that good fortune to those in the independent sector who know how to run their business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> I want to ask the Minister a simple question.  Given the results of the survey, what is the urgency in introducing this Bill?  Why does he feel it necessary to ram through this legislation?  I do not believe the Minister has attempted to explain to the House his reasons for doing this.  Even though the Minister does not accept our amendment he should at least show us the basic courtesy of imparting information and tell us why and for what purpose he is ramming through the legislation. As I have said, the reasons he put forward in his Second Stage speech for doing this have been abandoned.  The facts which have emerged during this debate should impact fundamentally on the perceived urgency of the Minister's activities.  Given the healthy picture which is emerging, the Minister should tell us why he feels it is necessary to ram this legislation through both Houses with such speed and vigour.  What are the problems and why are we being asked to deal with this legislation so peremptorily?</P>
    <P>The final argument the Minister put forward for this legislation was that, having created the conditions to allow the independents into the field, he now wanted to allow them to compete fairly. Is the Minister prepared to tell us in the short moments left in this debate tonight the position in regard to Alsamero Limited, who were asked to compete and entered the competition at a stage when the goalposts were clearly fixed at a certain position on the playing field?  Even though the contract has been awarded but not yet signed the Minister proposes in this Bill to fundamentally alter the goalposts from their original position in two very fundamental ways.  First, the Minister is now proposing to allow the third television channel to use their own transmission service and not have to be linked exclusively into the MMDS system.  Alsamero Limited in their submission to the commission said that that was a fundamental problem, they did not see the MMDS system as satisfying their needs entirely and they had reservations about its workability.  They argued that the only basic hope a third television channel had of surviving was by putting <Col N="1575" /> a cap on advertising.  Even though the Minister indicated at that time that he had no intention of capping advertising he has put forward such a proposal in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Alsamero Limited have said that they would be prepared to tender again in a changed environment.  However, the Minister has created unfair competition in the independent sector.  If he is as strongly motivated as he says he is to achieving fair competition I should like him to tell us if steps will now be taken to direct the commission to reopen the issue of the contract for the third channel. These are important matters which have been advanced by the Minister in an attempt to deny the validity of the arguments put forward by the Opposition in support of what I suggest is an important and opportune amendment to the Bill and I invite his response.  I hope we will hear a response to these specific queries and that I will not experience a repeat of what happened in regard to the promises I had that the issues I raised in regard to advertising would be answered, but clearly they never will be in the current debate.</P>

      <P>I wish to support this amendment requesting the Minister to put the Bill on the long finger and not bring it forward until some time in the future.  This is very good advice and I <Col N="1576" /> hope that it will be listened to at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>I very much regret the nature of this debate.  I have watched and listened from inside this House and I have also listened to comment outside the House about what we have been doing since we started to discuss the Broadcasting Bill, 1990.  It grieves me deeply because in almost ten years in the Dáil I have never seen this Chamber descend to such a circus &mdash; and I regret that I have to use that word &mdash; as I have seen here.  There is something seriously wrong when this happens. Admittedly, the Chair is under pressure, but the speakers have been involved in what is a distorted debate.  We did not have a Second Stage debate, which was sadly missed, and individuals are trying to make Second Stage speeches during the Committee Stage.  I think the best advice is to withdraw this legislation, because it is contentious.  I regret that the House has descended to this level of ineffective discussion on very important legislation.  This is not the way to deal with legislation and it does not make for effective or lasting statutes.  I am really surprised that a Minister of the experience and skill of the Minister opposite has let such a situation develop and I am sure it must be a ministerial nightmare to have to wake up every day to this.  I suggest it is not too late to bring reason to bear and postpone the legislation, which would be the most sensible and appropriate thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question who is advising the Minister on this issue.  I wonder if the Minister has talked to men and women on the street, because he must know the outrage that his proposals have caused out there on the streets.  I do not exaggerate when I say that it would be difficult to get anyone who understands, let alone agrees, with this Bill.  I wonder if the Minister has consulted &mdash; I suspect he has &mdash; those who will be deeply affected by this legislation; but, unfortunately, the Minister believes he has the wisdom and understanding to go it alone.  However, I assure the Minister that the best advice would be to withdraw the Bill now, let the matter settle down during the <Col N="1577" /> summer and, having then consulted with the interest groups, to come back with fresh proposals based on what the Minister has heard so far.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should give in to the interest groups &mdash; of course, I am not &mdash; but he must listen to them and reflect on their views.  After such a process the legislation will contain what the Minister wants and &mdash; what is important &mdash; he will have listened to the contributions and objections from all sides.</P>
    <P>There is great anger and concern about the Bill.  People are genuinely concerned about jobs.  Every single minute the Bill is in this House it is building on and exaggerating that fear.  I hope this will not be seen as a case of fighting it out to the last, because I have to say that is a form of macho politics which upsets me since we should be bringing our best intelligence to bear on this Bill.  This is not happening and is so far removed from it that it is very distressing.</P>
    <P>We all have an interest in the broadcasting service.  I have to say, as I probably will not speak again on the Bill, that RTE have a wonderful reputation and provide a broadcasting service second to none no matter where you go in the world.  They are doing a wonderful job and we all want to see them grow and develop.  We want to see public service broadcasting strengthened and consolidated, but we would also like to see private sector broadcasting developed and protected.  Let the Minister not be afraid of losing face.  It would be a case of putting the public interest before all the shenanigans and party political point scoring we have had.</P>
    <P>I support this amendment.  It is eminently sensible.  I would love to think that we could come back when we are much cooler and look at this legislation after we have all had a break.  What is happening is regrettable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fennell referred to the public interest.  It is very difficult for Members, with their collective wisdom, to know where the public interest lies, even with the best will in the world.  The Minister for Communications, like his predecessors, has tried to define public interest and act accordingly.  All Ministers have tried to act in the best interest of the public; and Deputy Mitchell will be aware that he got singed, if not by the public, at least by the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his amendment Deputy Mitchell <Col N="1579" /> suggests that the President, following consultation with the Council of State, should nominate members of the Authority of the IRTC.  The Deputy will be aware of how difficult it was for him to nominate the members when he was Minister.  The Minister is answerable to the Dáil and the President is not.  The Deputy's amendment is ludicrous and I do not see the point in debating it further.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the amendment tabled by the Workers' Party.  If one looks at that amendment one will see that their list of nominees for membership of their proposed commission does not include a broadcaster.</P>

      <P>On the question of the amendment and the commission, it is the most sensible way of approaching future broadcasting.  The way this issue has developed and changed makes it impossible for the Minister to do anything except to stick rigidly to what has apparently been agreed as Government policy.  The decision could not be considered a well judged one and it could have adverse effects for the future of broadcasting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

      <P>There can have been few more foolish debates in the House in the history of Dáil Éireann than the one we <Col N="1584" /> have endured for the last two days.  There can be no more foolish suggestion than the one that after ten or 12 years we should now consider the appointment of a commission.  That suggestion would have had great merit if it had been made, for example, when Deputy Mitchell was Minister.  Earlier on he suggested that things had changed very dramatically in radio, communications and information technology in the last three years.  With all due respects to Deputy Mitchell, that is simply not true.  MMDS was a probability in broadcasting three, four and five years ago and satellite broadcasting had been discussed throughout Europe for the last decade.  The biggest reality in broadcasting in Ireland for the last 15 years was that, for ten of them, a piracy illegality reigned supreme.  If there was a time for a commission, a White Paper or a discussion document, that was the time for it, not now.  There is nothing wrong with engaging in a filibuster here &mdash; it is a parliamentary tradition &mdash; but the Members who engaged in it should not try to dress up their efforts as if they were a contribution to democracy.  All that they have done is to achieve a situation where we have discussed several lines of important legislation in two days of continuous debate.  If that is the way they wish to waste time, that is fine, but let them not decry the fact that the Minister and the Government have decided we will make some progress on the issue. There are still some days left to debate this matter and we should get on with it rather than having continuous arguments and the reiteration of points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make a brief point.  The suggestion that a commission should be appointed at this stage is not just foolish, it reflects little credit on the people who put this amendment together.  If those people were even remotely interested in communications they would have come forward with positive suggestions.  The Minister has indicated, and proved, that he is prepared to be flexible.  We will be discussing other amendments which the Minister will introduce which will indicate his flexibility and I will be indicating my views on them when the time comes. <Col N="1585" /> The amendment we are now discussing is patently foolish and has nothing to recommend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the proposer of the amendment, I obviously cannot let the remarks of the previous speaker, Deputy Roche, pass.  I spent time on Committee Stage of this Bill in the House listening to anyone who wished to contribute. Deputies have repeated remarks along the way, but no doubt every Deputy who makes a point which has been made before genuinely believes that he or she can make a better contribution.  I did not have any difficulty in listening to the same argument being made in a different way. I do not consider the experience of listening to a debate in this House as an endurance and I resent the suggestion that that is what it is.  In regard to the suggestion that the amendment is foolish, will Deputy Roche explain his remark?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the debate but I indicated very clearly that the time for discussion documents and for teasing out the issue is well over. Deputy Mitchell certainly reached an historic level as an ex-Minister when he said today in the House that, as a Minister, he decided the best thing he could do was nothing.  That is probably the most truthful thing he said in a long time.</P>

What can be more eloquent than the remarks regarding the need to tease out not merely the Minister's changes but the Deputy's convolutions in trying to ingratiate himself with his own Front Bench colleagues?</P>

      <P>It would appear that we are coming to the end of the debate on this amendment.  As the debate progressed throughout the day I felt my contribution became increasingly relevant. Indeed it became quite clear that the view I held at the time that this amendment merely seeks the deferral of the Bill rather than deals with the substance of any commission is correct and since the time for such a commission has long since expired I remain opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1) There shall be established a Commission on Broadcasting.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Commission shall examine and report on all aspects of radio and television broadcasting, including the following matters&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the development of public service broadcasting.</P>
      <P>(b) the development of community broadcasting,</P>

      <P>(e) the maintenance and improvement of broadcasting standards,</P>
      <P>(f) the development of an export market in Irish produced radio and television programmes or services,</P>
      <P>and shall publish its report within 12 months.</P>
      <P>(3)  The membership of the Commission shall consist of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a nominee of the Minister for Communications,</P>
      <P>(b) a nominee of the RTE Authority,</P>
      <P>(c) a nominee of the Independent Radio and Television Commission,</P>
      <P>(d) a nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions,</P>
      <P>(e) a nominee of the Arts Council,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> (f) a nominee of Údarás na Gaeltachta,</P>
    <P>(g) a nominee of Film Makers Ireland, and</P>
    <P>(h) a nominee of the National Association of Community Broadcasting.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(4)  At the first meeting of the Commission, which shall be convened by the Minister, the Members shall elect a Chairperson from among their members.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment I hope at least that I can nail the first lie of the Minister when he sought to reject the previous amendment when in his all too familiar peremptory manner he advised us that the more he listened to the debate on the need for a commission the more he was convinced that it was a device to defer the implementation of this legislation. Amendment No. 2 has been defeated by a vote in this House.  The establishment of a commission will not now have any impact on the date on which the legislation will be introduced.  For that reason any suggestion that this is a device to effect deferral of the implementation of the Bill and its proposals cannot now be made.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I hope, in the short time I will take to propose and support this amendment, to illustrate to the Minister my enthusiasm for and my belief in the need to establish a commission which is in no way diminished because we have passed on from amendment No. 2.  While the legislation will not now be arrested in any way and will become operative from the day it passes through the Dáil and the Seanad, its effects will be immediate, as is apparent from a reading of the Bill, upon the viability and commerciality of RTE.  The need to look at the issue of a commission to address fundamental issues affecting broadcasting is just as urgent.  Once this legislation is in place and begins to operate in the way that <Col N="1591" /> it inevitably will, in the way we have described in the last number of days in debate on Committee and Second Stages, I believe the need for a committee to investigate basic principles and the ground rules for broadcasting, both public and private, and its future development here will become all the more urgent and necessary.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the name of The Workers' Party proposes, at this stage, that a commission on broadcasting be established and that it shall examine and report on all aspects of radio and television broadcasting, including the matters mentioned in the amendment.  We have set them out in order of importance. The first area which needs urgent review is that of the development of public service broadcasting.  The second matter that we believe the commission should be charged with is the development of community broadcasting.  The third most important area to be considered, because its future is entirely questioned by what the Minister is now proposing, is the development of Teilifís na Gaeltachta. The fourth is the funding of broadcasting at national and local level, which is obviously a central issue to be investigated and debated.  Where will the funding come from?  At what levels will it be made available and what controls and distribution mechanisms will be applied to its spending?</P>
    <P>The next issue we propose is the maintenance and improvement of broadcasting standards.  In this miscellaneous and hotch-potch legislation the Minister is giving himself further powers.  There is merely consultation with the RTE Authority in regard to the formulation of standards for the future.  That represents a radical departure in the regime with regard to control and policing of RTE and consequently begs the need for a commission to investigate this whole area and report on it.</P>
    <P>Finally, we propose consideration of the whole area of expansion of Irish broadcasting, recognising the important role it plays internationally and that it is one of the most successful European <Col N="1592" /> broadcasting networks, despite the size of the country and the lack of resources available to it in comparison with its competitors in the European area.  Nonetheless, it has the potential of tapping into the export market and realising some of the aspirations the Minister talked about on Second Stage of expanding on the market, increasing productivity and creating greater and more secure employment in the broadcasting sector.  These matters could be seriously addressed, based upon fully detailed analysis and report.</P>
    <P>However, the amendment sets a time schedule and argues that the report should be available by then, as we believe it can be.  As has been pointed out by Deputies on the Opposition side who have held the position of Minister &mdash; indeed the Minister also recognises this &mdash; a lot of the analysis and investigation has taken place but it has not been drawn together in a coherent and workable fashion by the establishment of a commission, which the Minister admitted should have taken place in the eighties. For that reason we argue that the commission should be set up and the report, once compiled, would be made available to the Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months of the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>The next point in the amendment is one that perhaps would not have needed great comment were it not for the intervention of Deputy Fitzpatrick earlier in the debate.  In joining in the cacophonous chorus of derision that has been visited on our efforts as parliamentarians by the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, and to some degree contributed to if not emulated by the peremptory attitude of the Minister in attempting to deal with some of the arguments we raised, Deputy Fitzpatrick tried to illustrate that our attempts at drafting amendments are not of a serious nature.  That other luminary in the Chamber, Deputy Roche, has been foolish in suggesting that in our proposal for the commission we did not include one broadcaster.  Therefore, I will take some time to explain who we envisage should be on the commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> Our first choice would be a person nominated by the Minister for Communications. If Deputy Fitzpatrick or anyone else on the Government side believes there is a case to be made for a broadcaster, no doubt he will bring his representations to bear on the Minister, who would accept such an enlightened suggestion, and it would be open to him to nominate one of the many broadcasters available and willing to act on his behalf.  Our second choice would be a nominee of the RTE Authority.  I cannot see how one could describe such a nominee as other than a broadcaster.  Our third choice would be a nominee from the Independent Radio and Television Commission, whose sole responsibility under the establishing legislation was to work towards the introduction of the independent sector of broadcasting, both radio and television.  To suggest that their nominee would not represent a broadcasting body or organisation would be defying logic in its entirety.  Our next choice would be a person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, whose membership has a vast range of broadcasting experience.</P>
    <P>We would have no difficulty, therefore, in meeting the views of Deputy Fitzpatrick if he believes that organisation should appoint a broadcaster.  The same can be said of our next choice of nominating body, the Arts Council, and also of Údarás na Gaeltachta, a broadcasting authority.  To suggest that the nominee of the authority who broadcast Raidió na Gaeltachta would not be a broadcaster would again be defying logic.  Our next choice of organisation is a body who have contributed substantially to the future of broadcasting, that is, the Film Makers Ireland organisation, who have been lobbying strongly for the re-establishment of the independent film-making sector since the abolition of the Film Board.  They are, in essence, a film-making and broadcasting organisation.  Finally, we would suggest a nominee of the National Association of Community Broadcasting, who are also a voluntary national organisation working towards the promotion of the forgotten area of the 1988 <Col N="1594" /> legislation &mdash; the establishment of community radio outlets throughout the country.  The commission, once assembled, would at their first meeting, as suggested in the amendment, nominate their chairperson.</P>
    <P>I hope that in outlining the membership of this commission in such detail it will be appreciated in the House that we have attempted to embrace the widest possible range of organisations and bodies actively involved, and certainly interested, in the future of broadcasting in this country.  If the Minister accepts this amendment he will have little or no difficulty in finding from among the suggested nominees a range of experience and depth of view that has never before been assembled to consider the future development of broadcasting.  The fact that our previous amendment has been defeated in no way takes from the urgency of the matter.  Once the legislation begins to take effect on the very fabric and future existence of RTE as a broadcasting authority, we must urgently look at the way things are going.  If we do not take stock of what is happening and try to redress some of the damage that will be done to RTE as a result of this legislation, if we do not have the vehicle in place to do that job then the effectiveness of RTE, as a national broadcasting organisation, in all the ramifications of that concept, will be seriously threatened.  I accept that we are not talking about the demise in its entirety of RTE as a broadcasting authority.  I have no doubt that they will devise a means and will survive in the market but it will be a limited survival and it will be in the context of an authority that will be inevitably forced to abandon many of their public service cultural and community contributions which they currently provide.  I say that because of the extraordinary punitive provisions contained in the Minister's proposals and which we are not now likely to be able to debate because of the unwarranted guillotine to this debate which will be proposed tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In the event of RTE exercising any form of commercial muscle, of being <Col N="1595" /> inventive or creative in that area, and if they earn an income in excess of the licence revenue yield, they will be automatically penalised in the subsequent year.  That represents such a restriction on the future development of RTE that their impact will be profound to the extent that it will of necessity involve a major restructuring and redefinition of the function, role and capacity of RTE to act as a public sector broadcasting authority providing all the cultural, social and community services which are expected of them and which they currently provide.  That is the first and important issue that will, of necessity, become even more urgent when one looks at the operation of this legislation when enacted.</P>
    <P>We will put at the top of the agenda of this commission's work the need for a review and report of the development of public service broadcasting.  Despite the platitudes of the Minister in the course of the debate in this House that he recognises the contribution made by RTE in all areas of public service &mdash; he said in his contribution on Second Stage that he wished to reiterate the central role that RTE will continue to play in the whole arena of broadcasting as the primary public sector broadcaster &mdash; he is not acting in a manner which will safeguard or enhance that position.</P>
    <P>While the Minister talks of advancing, maintaining and developing the role of RTE as a public sector community broadcaster in the primary role, his proposals in the Bill will do the opposite.  It is remarkable that this provision should be introduced.  A company which the Progressive Democrats side of Government argue should be a progressive organisation is to be penalised whenever they show initiative and capacity to move forward. Consequently there will be a spiral of downward depression.  A consequence of that downward spiral and depression in the role and function of RTE will be a shedding of the resources, a loss of revenue, because advertising will inevitably slip away from a depressed RTE television in particular and radio to a lesser degree and will go to the jazzier, more <Col N="1596" /> up-to-the-minute, more financially endowed and formidable competition that RTE currently have and will have to a greater degree as Sky Television, the other satellite TVs, the BBC and UTV enhance and prey upon the market.  As the revenue decreases there will be a knock-on effect.  I have no doubt that the revenue from licences will be reduced and that there will be a reversal of the role and function of RTE because they cannot be maintained as a genuine public service broadcasting outlet unless they are given the opportunity to raise revenue in a serious way or to act in a truly commercial way as advocated by some sections of the Government.</P>
    <P>The development of community broadcasting relates directly to the role of RTE in the future.  It is an important issue, one that will rank second in importance to that of the development of public service broadcasting.  In some respects they are intrinsically linked and one would be dependent on the other.</P>
    <P>The area of community radio broadcasting, as has been suggested in the 1988 legislation, has not been given the attention or the priority it deserves.  That is a matter the Minister should take time to explain beyond simply saying that the advertisement has appeared in the national media from the independent commission, suggesting that there is movement in this matter as to why the agenda was set for the commission, that they would look to the interests of the private sector to the virtual exclusion of the independent community area.  That is an area that must be looked at.  I have referred to that earlier and I do not intend going back over that ground again.</P>
    <P>The matter of seirbhís Teilifís na Gaeltachta has been dealt with by Deputy Higgins and Deputy Mac Giolla.  It is remarkable to hear &mdash; if I recall directly &mdash; the Minister and one of his aides on the backbenches suggesting that there is no basis for concern or that there is no basis for linking the future televising of Irish language programmes to this debate.  It is intrinsically linked to what we are debating here and what is being proposed. Consequently because there is <Col N="1597" /> utter and total ambivalence on the part of Government regarding their commitment to seirbhís Teilifís na Gaeltachta, it is essential that a commission, once established, would have the opportunity to investigate the whole area and to report and set down in clear and unambigious terms what needs to be done, what should be done, how it should be done and how soon it should be done. Then we would not have the prevarication that exists in this important area.</P>
    <P>Funding is the next issue that must be addressed.  It is incredible, as I suggested in the debate on the previous amendment, that the proposals in this legislation were last minute thoughts on the part of the Minister in response to a panic situation presented to him by one of the national independent broadcasting stations. Having proposed one method of alteration of funding in the public sector, the Minister, in a facile fashion, altered his attack on this whole area, took out the first two sections of the Bill and enhanced the power of the Minister to deal with the alternative of capping of advertising. In his Second Stage speech he said that one is as acceptable as the other.</P>
    <P>He indicated that the notion of taking away a portion of the licence fee is as simple and straightforward as the idea of capping their advertising revenue.  He believes that it is much easier to live with a slippage of revenue out of the country to their competitors abroad than with the so-called unlevel playing pitch but, as we have pointed out, a majority of broadcasters have not complained about this since receiving their licences.</P>
    <P>Earlier I asked Deputy O'Dea, who has just come into the House, to outline for us the evidence which leads him to believe that a massive portion of the commercial broadcasting sector will collapse if the Minister does not get his way on this issue.  I invite him again to take up that challenge, if he so desires, and to enlighten us on what information he has been fed by the Minister, who in his contributions to this debate has expressed differing views.  As well as this, I think he is wrong to take the view that one <Col N="1598" /> notion is as simple and straightforward as the other.  The Government are also being inconsistent, which is best illustrated by the way in which they can move in and shift out their amendments on the question of funding.  I indicated earlier that we now have available to us from independent film makers a set of proposals on the question of funding and the redistribution of resources within the broadcasting sector and again this highlights the need to take a fresh look at the question of funding.</P>
    <P>In relation to the maintenance and improvement of broadcasting standards, the position is changing on an almost daily basis.  The directives referred to by the Minister, Deputy Higgins and I are clear evidence of this.  At present the European Commission is compiling more directives and this would seem to indicate that this is an area where major changes are taking place, and one which needs to be impressively addressed by a commission in evaluating the principles emerging from Europe as laid down in the document of 3 October 1989 which, as I said, has not been debated by the Oireachtas and which highlights the need to continually review this matter and report on it.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to Article 4 which says that once the directive has been put in place there should be a European dimension to the work of broadcasters, while Article 5 emphasises the need to produce films and programmes for transmission.  Article 4 states, at paragraph 3, that as and from 3 October 1991 the member states should provide the Commission every two years with a report on the application of Article 4 and Article 5.  In an effort to meet that request why do we not agree to put in place a commission to report on this matter?  Paragraph 4 of the same Article states that the council will review the implementation of the Article on the basis of a report from the Commission accompanied by any proposals for revision that it may deem appropriate no later than the end of the fifth year from the adoption of the directive.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is quite clear that the <Col N="1599" /> Commission will continually review the implementation of the Directives and review the working of Article 4 at the five year mark.  To this end, the Article states that the report shall, on the basis of the information provided by member states under paragraph 3, take account in particular of developments in the Community market and of the international context.  The carrying out of a review on the implementation of the directives on broadcasting is central to the work of the Commission and our domestic commission, once established, could have an input into this.  As I said, one of its main tasks is to ensure that standards are maintained. This should also be one of the main tasks of the commission proposed in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The need to maintain standards in the advertising sector is dealt with in section 5 which I have no doubt we will not reach, given that the Government propose to guillotine the discussion tomorrow. Under section 5 the Minister will be given a free hand in drafting codes of practice for the advertising sector in relation to sponsorship, commercial promotions and so on.  While he will be under an obligation to consult the authority, he has not indicated to what extent he is prepared to be bound by this.  If the practices of other members of the Government are anything to go by, the concept of consultation is very thin and flimsy and offers us no hope.  This highlights the need to look again at this matter and to include the maintenance and improvement of broadcasting standards as one of the matters to be referred to by the commission on broadcasting in their report.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that his primary goals are the securing of employment, an expansion of the market and an improvement in productivity.  It should be borne in mind that RTE have achieved each of these aims and have responded positively to any suggestions made by the Ministers or in reports of independent assessors during the past five years.  It is important that these standards are applied in the independent sector and, <Col N="1600" /> more importantly, the most vulnerable areas in the broadcasting sector must not be forgotten in developing an export market in Irish produced radio and television programmes.  Quite frankly, the Minister has not considered this.  This morning I drew his attention to the proposals of Campaign 25 which I have no doubt he has examined very carefully and evaluated.  Unfortunately, he made no reference to these in any of his contributions to this debate.  It would appear therefore that, given his silence, he is bereft of any ideas or suggestions as to how the State sector as well as the independent and private sector can be encouraged to expand.  He has failed to respond to any of the worthwhile proposals made. Having regard to the fact that the Minister and his colleagues in Government seem to be bereft of ideas, it is clearly necessary for a commission to refer to this matter in the way suggested.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I commend to the House the suggestion that there is always a time to review broadcasting and its standards.  It is all the more urgent and necessary now in view of the radical departures encapsulated in the proposals of the Minister.  These depart from the fundamental principles as laid down in the debates on the 1988 legislation and in the Minister's Second Stage speech, which are not adhered to in his proposed amendments or in his arguments against our amendments.</P>
    <P>I hope I will hear a little more than an offhand, single line or double sentence dismissal of arguments from this side of the House.  The Minister's view that what we are engaged in is nothing more than an attempt to defer the legislation for the sake of deferral has been put to rest.  The issue of deferral is gone due to the defeat of the previous amendment.  I am convinced that the amendment I am now proposing is relevant and all the more urgent in view of the fact that the proposals of the Minister will have immediate effect on being passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing a matter we have debated all day, namely the establishment of a commission.  The <Col N="1601" /> amendment sets out to establish the form of commission that should be set up, when it should report and the items which should be discussed and examined by the commission.  It is basically the same issue on which we voted earlier when the House decided not to proceed with the establishment of the commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan paints a picture in which there is only one broadcaster, RTE.  In my view RTE will remain the premier broadcaster but not the only broadcaster in this country.  I will refer later to the survey published today relating to listening habits and the plurality of choice.</P>
      <P>The effect of this legislation will be merely to return RTE to their approximate level of income in 1988.  Nobody is suggesting that the 1988 level of income resulted in bad programming or the lowering of standards.  On the contrary, I believe that RTE in 1988 had excellent programming and did an excellent job. All we are talking about is returning them to the 1988 figure.  It is not a question of wiping RTE out, as suggested by Deputy McCartan.  We have a population of 3.5 million people and the national broadcaster will have roughly £100 million to spend per annum on broadcasting services as a result of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned the survey carried out into listenership.  The survey is based on the months of April and May and covers all adults.  It shows that 87 per cent of the population listen to the radio on any day.  Of that figure, RTE had 75 per cent.  Interestingly, the independent sector, which is only on the air since last September as a result of legislation brought forward in both Houses in 1988, has 40 per cent of the listenership.  Much of the independent sector has only been coming on air during the spring and is building up its listenership.  There is an obvious need and a desire among the general public to have plurality and alternatives. We want to create an environment which will allow the development of choice.  The people have decided to go with RTE and the independents.  Deputy Higgins questioned the numbers I gave earlier, but the figures printed in the <Col N="1602" /> survey show that over 1,090,000 people are listening to independent radio at some time during the day every day.  This is quite a staggering figure and reflects the success of what we are doing in providing people with choice under the 1988 Act. We want to build further on that choice and ensure we have a strong base, while at the same time retaining the premier position of RTE with its income of approximately £100 million to serve the needs of 3.5 million people.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan spoke about film production.  I note what he said about the proposals from the film-makers.  I made it clear in 1988 that one of the motivations for the third television channel, apart from considerations of choice and plurality, was to create a stimulus for the Irish audio-visual production sector, for which there is great scope for expansion and development.  We clearly have the talent and expertise, as best manifested by the recent success of Noel Pearson and Jim Sheridan with their film &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;.  We also operate in the main in the English language, which is probably the most commercial language for the export of films and television programmes.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance of this sector, I imposed specific obligations under the 1988 Act on the independent television company in relation to commissioning from the independent production sector.  While I would not necessarily be opposed to the idea of imposing a similar obligation on RTE, it is not necessary to do so because of the obligations laid down in the EC Directive which I read into the record yesterday and which provides that 10 per cent of either transmission time or programme budgets must go to the independent production sector.  I am very conscious of the role of the independent production sector.  I think 10 per cent is the appropriate level to start with.  The UK may be proposing a 25 per cent independent quota for their services, but their audio-visual production sector is much more developed than ours and has had the benefit of some ten years of Channel 4, which <Col N="1603" /> has been a major catalyst for the development of the independent sector there.  I want our independent television channel to become the equivalent of the Channel 4-type operation in calling on the services of the independent production sector.  As a result of this legislation and the 1988 Act I see a very healthy future for the independent film production sector.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's proposal for a commission is something that could and should have been looked at in the early eighties when a previous administration were in power, but they did not look at it.  They decided not to do so.  They sat on it.  We heard Deputy Mitchell say his decision to do nothing was the best decision of the lot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins spoke about the 14th point in their 14 point agreement with the Fine Gael Party for the 1982 Government being the development of community radio and alternative radio to that of the pirates.  However, while they talked about it &mdash; and they want another talking shop, a commission, here &mdash; nothing happened and the pirates continued on the air while they sat and discussed and talked.  Deputy Higgins and Deputy O'Sullivan at certain stages in this debate made the point that they could have acted to take the pirates off the air by going back to the 1926 legislation.  The fine under the 1926 legislation for piracy on the air was £50.  The legislation I passed in this House imposed a fine of £20,000 or two years in jail on indictment for those who broadcast without a licence from the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>In the development of the electronic media sector there is no need at this stage for the commission as outlined by Deputy McCartan, and I have just given my reasons for saying that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to speak at any length on this amendment. As with the previous amendment, I support it and I am sorry the Minister does not see his way to accepting it.  It is the most constructive way to proceed.  To <Col N="1604" /> correct any wrong impression the Minister has tried repeatedly to give, let me say I decided to do all I could about broadcasting in keeping with what I thought was proper and correct for the future of broadcasting.  I refused to do anything I felt would jeopardise the future of broadcasting.  I fear very much the Minister's proposals before the House will not help the future of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I agree substantially with the Minister about choice.  I fought valiantly to provide a choice and I refused to proceed along lines which would deprive the listener and viewer of choice. I want that choice to be established.  To that extent I agree absolutely with the Minister.  I disagree with the Minister proceeding in a way that is based on hunch, on a passion for activity and confusing that with action.  I fear that is where he is making a mistake.</P>
      <P>The Minister has come into the House today to report on the listenership survey. He gains some satisfaction from the fact that the new independent broadcasters have gained a significant listening audience. I am delighted at that and it comes as no surprise to me.  The problem is that some of those broadcasters have run up large debts because of certain mistakes made in the early days, teething problems and unanticipated problems of a larger scale than were allowed for.  Undoubtedly some of those problems were of their own making, but some were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the Minister's passion for activity, it is no secret that Century Radio were pushed on to the air earlier than they wanted to go on the air, and that was a costly mistake.  Because they went on sooner than they planned to do they had to proceed on the basis of not being very well geared or not having their plans thoroughly thought out, and they had to settle for a combination of wavelengths on the frequency spectrum that made it impossible for them to market their product across the nation.  Those two areas might be taken on board by the State as a mistake on the part of the State.  For those two reasons I felt that the situation warranted once-off assistance to <Col N="1605" /> help them over their teething problems, of course on the basis that once those teething problems were over there was a viable future for them.  We are a long way from proving that there is a viable future for alternative national radio and even more so for alternative national television. That should not prevent us from aspiring to national alternatives for both radio and television.  Competition is good for the country, for viewers, for listeners and for RTE.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said, many interest groups have a legitimate interest in being protected and they ought to be listened to.  There should be some forum from which they can put forward their views and know they are going to be put into the balance and weighed up carefully and fairly.  That has not happened.  Many people very deeply involved in different aspects of producing programmes have not been given the opportunity of presenting their case and having it heard. That is why I think there is merit in the amendment now before the House in the name of The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>The previous amendment, which was defeated by the House, sought to defer the rest of the provisions of the Bill until such a commission reported.  That was defeated, so it would appear that the Minister's proposals are going to become law.  Not only that, the Minister himself is going to have no choice especially if this new section 4 is inserted unamended. He will not have discretion.  He may wish to reflect between now and Report Stage on whether it is wise, even if he deprives himself of discretion, to be able to pull back later if a mistake has been made in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Let us anticipate that the provisions at present proposed or ultimately proposed by the Minister on this Stage and Report Stage are carried.  It seems it would be reasonable for the Minister to say that that is his decision for now and it is a good idea to have a dispassionate overview of the situation.  That is why I say to the Minister that he should reflect on whether he can accept the amendment before the House.  This amendment in no <Col N="1606" /> way militates against the other provisions he plans for ultimate addition to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is only nine months since the independent broadcasters got on the air and it is good to hear that they have gained a significant audience.  We must hope the audience they have gained ensure for them sufficient income to enable them to continue to provide a vibrant and interesting service and to grow in future.  That is important, but to consider plurality as the Minister calls it &mdash; competition &mdash; purely in the context of the boundaries of this State makes no sense in terms of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the future of broadcasting not only in the national context but in the international context.  RTE, as the Minister has said, will remain the pre-eminent broadcasting service but they have to battle in news, sports and other programmes with broadcasting institutions in Britain which have enormously greater resources.  Yet, with their flair, enterprise and dexterity, I think we would all agree they have provided a service which compares reasonably well with the British services which, as the Minister said, are reckoned to be the best in the world.  If they are, the Irish television services run them a very close second and are certainly superior to anything I have seen in North America or Europe.  This will not continue if all possibilities of enterprise are stifled in RTE. That is the worst aspect of the Minister's proposals, as I said earlier.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bill Cotter gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the closure of a mushroom processing plant in County Monaghan with the loss of some 150 jobs.  Deputy Cotter has some ten minutes to present his case <Col N="1607" /> and the Minister of State has some five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my sincere thanks to you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to discuss this matter this evening.  I believe that the Chair has rightly assessed the situation in the mushroom industry to be very serious indeed. I hope this debate will spur the Minister and the Government into action, which I hope will happen now rather than later.</P>
      <P>We are having debate on this issue this evening because a mushroom processing plant will close tomorrow evening with a loss of jobs.  I hope the closure will be temporary rather than permanent.  We had a debate on a similar issue on 14 March 1990 and during the course of that debate I sought to highlight the problems facing the industry at that point in time. In the aftermath, the Minister paid more attention to the industry; but, in my view, his efforts were entirely advisory and motivational and were not what the situation demanded.  Indeed, I believe the Minister's assessment of the situation at that time was incorrect and today's stark announcement is proof enough of that.</P>
      <P>It is quite revealing to look back on what was said in the course of the debate on 14 March 1990.  My analysis of the problem in the industry at that stage indicated there were short-term and long-term problems to be faced, although I have to admit that what I saw as longer term problems have turned out to be problems in the short term.</P>
      <P>I referred to the problems we had with the rate of exchange and the relative value of sterling to the Irish punt.  That was a very severe problem in March because the value of sterling had dropped and the punt had risen from a value of 84p sterling to 97p sterling, which was an enormous difference especially when you consider that most of our mushrooms went to the English market.  I felt, and indeed the Minister also felt, that we were extremely vulnerable because of that difference in the exchange rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there were other problems and I referred to the difficulties we had <Col N="1608" /> in producing both tonnage and quality product and I will quote a few lines here and there from my speech on that night to illustrate the analysis I had made.  I suggested: &ldquo;There is a grave need to overhaul and revamp the industry&rdquo;.  I also referred to the lack of technology and that in the circumstances most growers could not afford to instal the required technology themselves.  I also said that 93 per cent of growers did not have the basic cooling systems and that many of the older houses needed to be upgraded because many of them were over ten years old.  I said that in order to produce better crops with greater efficiency we had to have equipment to monitor environmental changes.</P>
    <P>At that stage I asked what we needed to do and I stated that we had to introduce forthwith a system of grants to enable growers to bring old housing stock up to standard with grant aid to cover the introduction of essential new technology. In retrospect I feel the latter part of my suggestion was more important.  I also suggested that we needed to control the development of the industry because the pace of growth more or less outstripped itself.  The Minister in reply agreed with much of what I had said, but his emphasis was quite different.  He spent most of the time dealing with the exchange rate and I agree that this was a very serious problem at that time.  However, the Minister did not advert to or mention, except in passing, the longer term problems I had outlined.  I will quote from the Minister's reply:</P>
    <P>A resolution of the current problems will only come about by the concerted action of all parties and that includes the various State agencies.</P>
    <P>I agreed with that at that time and I assumed that the State agencies would make a meaningful input, but I have to report that the input was more motivational and certainly had no real impact on the situation.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The present difficulties facing the Irish mushroom industry have largely arisen from the very rapid depreciation <Col N="1609" /> of sterling over the past number of months and in particular since October 1989.</P>
    <P>I agreed with that assessment, but that problem has eased somewhat now. However, the Minister spent very little time discussing the fundamental problems facing the industry.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Whilst the currency exchange rates are outside their control I impressed on them the need to tackle issues which are under their control, i.e., their own costs and greater efficiency.</P>
    <P>He paid no further attention to that.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to assure the House that I will continue to keep the situation under review.  We shall examine all areas of the industry to see where savings can be made and improvements in efficiency can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I have to say that this has not been carried out to the letter.  While the Minister has certainly been close to the industry since then &mdash; I have to admit that &mdash; improvements in efficiency have not been achieved and no effort has been made to improve matters at the level of growers, where, in my view, all the problems are. The Minister further said:</P>
    <P>To this end I can indicate that my Department, Bord Glas, the IDA, Córas Tráchtála and the industry are in the process of undertaking a long-term strategic analysis of the whole industry...</P>
    <P>I hope this has been done and I hope the Minister will offer something more than what he offered the last time.  His previous speech was rather bland and was a useless input into the whole debate.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister what plans he has to save this processing plant which is due to close tomorrow evening.  I want him to give me a specific reply to this issue, a reply which will give me the confidence that he knows what is happening and convince those in the company that certain moves will be taken which will strengthen the industry in the future.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the need not to say or do anything at this stage which would have a damaging effect on one of our most successful enterprises. Monaghan Mushrooms has been one of the most striking successes in agriculture over the past decade and I am happy to have been associated with it when it was being set up initially.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a principal in the factory today and he told me that 24 workers in the processing plant will be laid off tomorrow night.  I have been assured that this is a short term measure and has been caused by the large volume of produce coming onto the market.  This company have experienced small hiccups before but they are very resilient and will overcome their problems.  I am not critical of the Department because they have been very helpful.  I know they are examining many aspects of this industry at present. I suggested that they should carry out an in-depth study of the industry.  There has been such a massive growth in this industry that there had to be some hiccups.  I hope the Minister and his officials will carry out an in-depth study with the processers and growers in order to ensure the continuance of this very important industry which employs so many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this issue in its proper context by giving some background information to the growth of our mushroom industry, which in many ways has been quite spectacular.</P>
      <P>This industry has expanded rapidly over the past decade from a base of 6,800 tonnes, valued at £6.3 million in 1980, to 31,000 tonnes in 1989, valued at £35 million.  Of this production approximately 18,000 tonnes were exported to the UK.  These exports accounted for over 12 per cent of the UK market.  A further 4,000 tonnes were exported in processed form to the Netherlands and Germany.  The balance of production was consumed on the domestic market.  By any standards this is significant progress.</P>
      <P>There are five major compost companies and four major export companies in the country.  These companies have undertaken major investments in collection, storage, packaging and distribution systems.  This has allowed them to compete at the top end of the UK market and to meet the exacting standards of the supermarkets.  There are 540 growers in the country and the vast majority of them market their produce through one or other of these exporting companies.  It is this totally integrated system and the professionalism of the exporting companies which has allowed us to expand the industry in highly competitive markets over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year the Irish mushroom industry has experienced difficulties largely due to the very rapid depreciation of sterling.  For the first nine months of 1989 the trade weighted exchange rate was 84p sterling to the Irish pound and then increased to over 97p. Currency fluctuations are a normal feature of international trade.  This situation has improved over the past month or so with the strengthening of sterling and the industry has come through the eye of the storm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growers also experienced drops in yields during the summer of 1989 due to the exceptionally warm weather.  They have responded this year by cutting back <Col N="1612" /> on compost in their houses and altering their cropping programme.  Therefore, the reality is that while the mushroom sector has achieved spectacular results it is going through a difficult phase.</P>
    <P>Now is certainly not the time to undermine confidence in an industry which has proved itself over the past decade.  Monaghan Mushrooms have been one of the success stories of the mushroom sector and of the horticulture industry in general. The company directly employs over 300 staff and indirectly provide employment for a similar number in the growing of the crop.  The decision of the management to temporarily close the processing plant for a period of six to eight weeks must not be seen as a crisis for the company or the industry in general.  The decision has been taken in the light of certain marketing difficulties for processed mushrooms on the Continent and the relative scarcity of mushrooms suitable for processing within the company. This is a commercial decision taken by the company in response to the current prevailing market situation.  The decision will affect 30 of the company's staff and will not affect growers at all.</P>
    <P>I have absolute confidence in the ability and determination of Monaghan Mushrooms to overcome this temporary problem. The company have proven themselves over the past decade and have provided a major impetus to the prosperity of the Cavan and Monaghan region.  The Government have shown their commitment to the growth of the mushroom industry, especially through IDA support.  I can assure the House that this support both for Monaghan Mushrooms and the industry in general will continue.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, is present in the House for the debate.  I want first to impress on the Minister the alarm, dismay and frustration felt by the staff of the schools, the parents of the children and the members of the Mental Handicap Association on learning that a letter had arrived from FÁS on 9 June 1990 stating that the continuation of the Teamwork scheme as operated in these centres is about to be concluded.  The letter stated, and I quote:</P>
      <P>It seems certain now that FÁS will not be in a position to approve any extension to existing projects or indeed consider new projects.</P>
      <P>This news is regrettable for many projects but for Scoil Cormac, Scoil Aonghusa and the day care centre in Cashel, all of which cater for mentally handicapped children of varying degrees, it is absolutely devastating.  After waging a long war last year in trying to ensure that this scheme would be continued in the schools in Cashel, it is regrettable to find that instead of winning the battle we have lost it yet again.  I wonder if this will be an annual war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scoil Cormac caters for 128 mildly mentally handicapped children all with learning difficulties.  Many come from disadvantaged homes, some have behavioural and emotional problems and all experience difficulties with language, speech and articulation.  Scoil Aonghusa caters for 44 pupils with moderate mental <Col N="1614" /> handicap but the majority are severely disturbed and are very difficult to manage.  The day care centre caters for 22 children with severe and profound mental and physical handicap.  None of these children can walk and every morning the children have to be carried by the staff from the bus &mdash; I might add that this is not provided by the State &mdash; to the centre. They also have to be carried around the centre during the day.  Every need of the children, physical or emotional, must be catered for by the staff at the centre.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to give full details of the work done by the Teamwork people. Each school enjoys the services of six Teamwork people and, according to the letter from FÁS, 18 valuable staff members will be removed from the three schools.  It is almost impossible to state the value of Teamwork to those centres. They are a vital and necessary element in the successful and smooth running of those schools.  They provide valuable back-up to the teaching staff and the result is that teachers are, for example, able to bring a child to the bathroom happy in the knowledge that a person is in the class to supervise the other pupils. It is important to realise that the children are very demanding and constantly look for individual attention.  Particularly in the day care centre, they share the tremendous physical burden in the day-to-day running of it.  The Teamwork people provide continuity and allow those employed to establish a valuable and lasting relationship with the young children, something they need.</P>
    <P>Last year we had difficulty ensuring the continuation of the scheme.  The school had to reduce the number of children and the day care centre was forced to close three days per week.  That had an appalling impact on the children who only progress when living in a stable environment. The day care centre was the only relief the parents got from the tremendous burden on them but now they are bearing the enormous burden of caring for their handicapped children.  What happened last year will occur again this year if the FÁS proposals are adopted.  The contribution of Teamwork to the mentally <Col N="1615" /> handicapped in south Tipperary is irreplaceable.</P>
    <P>The letter went on to state that as an alternative the schools may consider the social employment scheme.  That is no solution and would not be a substitute for the Teamwork scheme.  Those employed under the social employment scheme must be over 25 years and must be on unemployment assistance.  Through experience it has been found that people in that category are not willing or anxious to work in centres such as those in Cashel. They are not prepared to take on the responsibility for the amount of money offered to them.  We tried to work under that scheme but failed and we know from experience that it will not replace Teamwork.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme is also unsuitable in that it operates on a week-on week-off basis.  The children need continuity and constant contact with those whose care they are in, in order to build up a good and secure relationship with them.  Staff employed on a week-on week-off basis would not help.  In fact, they would cause a major disturbance and would lead to feelings of fear and insecurity among the children.  The children need to integrate with youth.  They respond better and more enthusiastically to young people.  The Teamwork scheme was ideal in every way and helped to deal with the needs of the children.</P>
    <P>The proposal is to take a very valuable asset from children who are among the most disadvantaged in our society.  The proposal is to cut back in our schools that serve the needs of the disadvantaged. Those schools constantly cry out for help in regard to speech therapy, home liaison officers, physiotherapy and other services. Those schools are being abandoned because they are the responsibility of three Departments.  The teachers in those schools carry a tremendous physical and emotional strain trying to cope with the demands of the children and the stress of their parents.  We are dealing with parents who are at breaking point for the want of relief from caring for their mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> Teamwork helped the schools in Cashel to continue and they enabled the staff in the schools to provide the backup for the parents and security for the children.  I should like to plead with the Minister to provide the necessary funding for FÁS so that Teamwork can continue the good work.  He should remember that the social employment scheme will not work.  The Minister should make an exception where the Teamwork people operate in centres such as those in Cashel. I speak with emotion on this subject because I feel strongly about it.  The Minister should give urgent consideration to my plea.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for allowing us to raise the issue on the Adjournment and I am grateful to Deputy Ahearn for giving me some of her time.  I have been concerned about the schools in Cashel and in the south-east region.  The difficulties in them came to my notice following representation I made three weeks ago to the Minister seeking approval for the continuation of the Killenaule community project.  I received a letter from FÁS to the effect that they had been in contact with the FÁS south-east region and had been advised that they had received no Teamwork budget for 1990 and, accordingly, could not recruit for Teamwork schemes. That has been the position since 1 January last for all five counties.  FÁS went on to suggest the social employment scheme as an alternative but, as Deputy Ahearn pointed out, it is not suitable because of the many regulations laid down by the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare for participants to qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received confirmation today from the County Tipperary Association for Mentally Handicapped Children of the concerns of parents in Scoil Aonghusa, Scoil Chormaic, the day care centre, the Nagle Centre where three teams of five people and a supervisor work, St. Ann's in Roscrea, and other schools for the handicapped in Munster.  Mr. John Murphy, chairman of the association for mentally handicapped people in Munster, gave me details of the problems being <Col N="1617" /> faced.  The Cashel and Emly youth service depends on assistance from the ingenious Teamwork scheme.  It is not possible to operate the social employment scheme when catering for mentally handicapped children.  We are concerned at the announcement by the Department of Health that they do not intend to provide funds for the health services and so on for those children.  It appears that they have abandoned their responsibility and left the matter to the Minister for Labour. On the last occasion Oireachtas Members for the area visited Cashel we were able to promise that we would sort out the problems of the local centres and expressed our determination that they would not recur.  There is no doubt that damage was done to the procedures used for caring for the children.  I appeal to the Minister to allocate sufficient funds to take account of the needs of the south-east region.  We have been progressive in our work but we are being penalised while other areas are permitted to continue. I should like to ask the Minister to use his good offices to sort out this problem.  I know Deputy Davern will support our call.</P>

The school under discussion is 21 years old and it has progressed from a very simple beginning.  The demands on the school grow each year.  I should like to thank the Minister, and the Ministers for Health and Education, for their help over the years.  In view of the tremendous problems being faced in the school I should like to make a special appeal to the Minister to provide adequate funds to help those involved.  I suggest that the Minister take money from other subheads in his vote to make money available for this exceptional case.  I have raised this issue with the Minister in recent weeks and I am confident that we will find the funds to help the mentally handicapped children.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies Ahearn, Davern and Ferris for raising this issue. I appreciate and have noted their concern for the children and parents, and I will take the details outlined into consideration.</P>
      <P>Teamwork is a community managed scheme designed to provide temporary community-based employment for young people through voluntary organisations for the mutual benefit of the young people and their communities.  The scheme which is operated by FÁS is targeted at young people who have completed second level education and who have not succeeded in obtaining permanent employment.  The duration of projects funded by Teamwork can vary from a minimum of 24 weeks to a maximum of 52 weeks.  The scheme was never intended to provide services which are required on a continuing permanent basis.  It was a temporary scheme.</P>
      <P>The impression seems to have been created that Teamwork is being terminated. This is not the case.  Up to and including 1989 Teamwork was eligible for assistance from the European Social Fund but regrettably this is no longer the case following a decision in Brussels.  However, I secured additional Exchequer resources this year, £4.6 million compared with £2.3 million last year, to ensure the continuation of the scheme in 1990 at its 1989 level of 1,150 man years, giving employment to around 1,900 young people during the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FAS now operate on a regional basis with each region having its own budget to cover the provision of training and employment schemes in the region.  This ensures a more equitable distribution of FÁS operations throughout the country, resulting in some cases in requests for projects under the various schemes in parts of the country where a demand did not exist prior to regionalisation.  This may mean that the same number of projects may not be renewed in certain areas in order to allow projects to start in new areas.  In the case of the project specifically mentioned by Deputy Ahearn, I <Col N="1619" /> understand that assistance under Teamwork will continue up to end November next.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the scheme is of major benefit to local communities and voluntary bodies and the young people who participate in Teamwork projects scattered around the country.  However, it is necessary to emphasise that the scheme was introduced to help the young people.  As such, projects which have a need for staff on a continuing and permanent basis must ensure staff through means other than Teamwork.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that the Government have decided to expand the social employment scheme to cater for 15,000 participants by the end of this year.  Sponsors of local projects might consider the possibility of obtaining workers through the SES for their ventures and thereby give the long-term unemployed in their communities an opportunity to regain a foothold in the labour market.</P>
    <P>For many years in the Dublin region we did not use the social employment scheme for local authority works while other regions used the Teamwork scheme.  We used the social employment scheme to help the blind, the deaf and the physically handicapped.  However, I accept the view that that scheme is not very flexible, but I do not accept that it is not possible to make use of it because I have been involved in a number of projects that made use of the scheme. Where we have people working week-on week-off the numbers are doubled and that is how the difficulty is overcome.  I <Col N="1620" /> accept that our young people are more interested in and very flexible in regard to this work.</P>
    <P>Teamwork is designed to help young people in their search for secure, permanent employment.  It was never intended that the scheme would provide staffing on a continuing permanent basis for local projects no matter how deserving the cause.  This year I succeeded in having the fund doubled.  When the ESF funding was withdrawn I had to seek funds from the Exchequer.  I have argued that projects such as those outlined by the Deputies should be continued but I cannot give any guarantee that organisations can retain the same staff.  That in effect would mean that other areas would be deprived of benefits under the scheme. I must deal with each application on its merits.</P>
    <P>However, because of the good work being undertaken under the scheme, and the benefit to young people of participation in it, FÁS at my request will carry out an urgent review of expenditure with a view to endeavouring to make some additional funds available for Teamwork this year.  In that regard I will bear in mind the requests by the Deputies.  However, it is important to stress that this cannot be seen as permanent funding for organisations.  I have the greatest respect for the commitment of those involved in those organisations but in my view they should look for long-term funding.  I will do what I can to deal with the problem raised by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989, S.I. No. 34 of 1989, which give effect to Council Directive 83/477/EEC of 19 September, 1983, provide for the protection of workers who are or may be exposed in their place of work to dust arising from asbestos and/or materials containing asbestos.  This would include workers who are engaged in the storage or disposal of asbestos.  However, in accordance with the Directive the Regulations do not apply to sea transport or air transport.</P>
      <P>I understand that the regulation of the shipment of asbestos and asbestos waste comes within the ambit of the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment respectively and that, while the relevant regulations do not relate directly to workers' safety and health, nevertheless, they have some general protective implications.</P>

      <P>The agreements on pay negotiated in conjunction with the <i>Programme for <Col N="1502" /> National Recovery</i> provided that in October 1988 discussions would take place at national level between the Government, FIE, the CIF and the ICTU on a general framework to allow for the implementation of a one hour per week reduction in working hours over the three year period of the programme in cases where the normal working week is at or above 40 hours.</P>
      <P>The discussions resulted in the successful conclusion of an agreement.  The agreement provides a framework within which employers and unions may negotiate a reduction of one hour per week which would come into effect not later than the end of 1990.  These negotiations are to be carried on at the level at which basic pay and conditions of employment are normally negotiated.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been taking place in this context and have resulted in the conclusion to date of over 200 agreements in the private sector.  In the public service, agreement has been reached to implement the one hour reduction with effect from 1 July or 1 September 1990.</P>
      <P>I have also initiated a review of conditions of employment legislation which specifies statutory maximum permissible working hours for employees in industrial and retail employment.  I am at present in consultation with the FIE and ICTU in the matter.  It would not be my intention to reduce maximum hours of work under this legislation below negotiated norms.</P>

      <P>Training and help in relation to combining training, work and family responsibilities are the two arms of my policy to enable women to re-enter the <Col N="1503" /> workforce after some years of working in the home.  One of the important features of the recent FÁS positive action programme was an increase of almost 50 per cent in return to work courses this year compared to last year; the courses themselves are also to be improved.  Moreover FÁS is improving access to training for women by making entry requirements more flexible, by providing pre-entry training, and by examining the barriers which prevent women with family ties from participating in training courses.  I have asked FÁS to provide to the Deputy an indication of the level of resources involved.</P>
      <P>Apart from the measures which were agreed in the context of the CRC review of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> I have asked a small group to advise me on the potential for early practical action as regards child care services and, indeed, the other measures which employers could adopt to help workers continue family responsibilities and career.</P>

      <P>Information is not maintained by FÁS which would show a direct link between the employment secured following participation on the scheme and the work on which participants were engaged.

      <P>Under the Trade Union Act, 1975, all trade union merger proposals must be approved in a secret ballot of the union members involved.  The decision of the Irish Print Union (IPU) to pursue a transfer of engagements to the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) was approved by a ballot of IPU members.  A further ballot of IPU members to approve the instrument of transfer would have to be carried out under the 1975 Act before the merger could be finalised.</P>
      <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies, who operates in an independent capacity, has decided that the proposed transfer of engagements from the IPU to the NUJ cannot proceed under the Trade Union Act, 1975.  This decision is at present the subject of judicial review in the High Court and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>As I <Col N="1511" /> informed the Deputy in response to his question of 19 June 1990, the costs associated with Border security are not separately compiled.  Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the likely reduction in expenditure, in so far as the Votes administered by my Department are concerned, if Border security was not necessary.  However, if the Deputy is seeking information regarding the estimated additional overall costs which arise in the Votes for which my Department has responsibility as a general consequence of the troubles in the North, I would refer him to my reply on 27 June 1990 to a question by Deputy Barry on this subject.</P>

      <P>The agreement establishes that permanent lay teachers may be redeployed to full-time teaching posts within a 30 mile radius, where the number of teachers who may be paid incremental salary is required to be reduced in accordance with the regulations in force, or in the event of a school being closed.</P>
      <P>The scheme is managed by an administrator, appointed jointly by the management authorities and the ASTI.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, the agreement also allows for teachers who are not over quota in their schools to apply to the administrator of the scheme for inclusion on the panel for redeployment, in exceptional circumstances.  The person referred to by the Deputy falls into this category.  The scheme stipulates that the inclusion of such a person on the panel shall be at the discretion of the administrator and I have no function in this matter.</P>

      <P>The final report of the Iarnród Éireann board of inquiry into the derailment near Claremorris, County <Col N="1520" /> Mayo, on 24 September, 1989 was submitted to my Department last November. The report was examined to determine the need for any follow-up action or remedial measures.  In the light of that examination, I have concluded that all relevant information relating to the circumstances of this accident is contained in the report and that no useful purpose would be served in carrying out any further inquiry or formal investigation.</P>
      <P>The Board of CIE have advised me that a copy of the report has been furnished on request to the legal representatives of one of the parties involved.  The question of making the report available to other such parties is a matter for Iarnród Éireann, acting on legal advice.</P>
