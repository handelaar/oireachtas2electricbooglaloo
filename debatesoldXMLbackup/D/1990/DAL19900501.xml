      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1989 I accepted, on behalf of the nation, the first instalment of Sir Sydney Nolan's generous gift of his paintings.  This comprised six paintings on the theme of the Wild Geese and they will be displayed at the new Irish Museum of Modern Art at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham which will be opened early next year.  Sir Sydney Nolan has indicated to me his intention to give further instalments of the gift over a period for the Museum of Modern Art.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the House will join with me in expressing our thanks and appreciation for this splendid gift to the Irish people from one of the world's foremost artists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Taoiseach for his reply which is, to my knowledge, the first official confirmation that this is the situation.  This matter has been going on for some time.  Could the Taoiseach assure the House that in relation to any future bequests Sir Sidney Nolan might wish to make to this nation we will not lose the opportunity in a manner similar to what happened in the case of the Sir Hugh Lane collection and <Col N="4" /> that there will be proper accommodation for such bequests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are much better equipped now than we were in Sir Hugh Lane's day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I, on behalf of my party, also join in welcoming this very generous bequest by Sir Sidney Nolan.  In discussions with the artist, would the Taoiseach consider the possibility that at some stage the paintings might be displayed in the artist's ancestral county of Clare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an excellent suggestion, but would the Deputy not regard the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham as being near enough?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the suggestion in all seriousness.  It is widely accepted that we should decentralise the arts as much as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the person involved when Sir Sidney Nolan made the bequest, let me also express my appreciation of this magnificent bequest to the nation. Does the Taoiseach think the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, is a particularly suitable place for the exhibition of these paintings in view of the very large size of the canvasses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, that question was thoroughly looked into and a decision finally taken that Kilmainham Hospital is the best place available.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Quinn</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, having regard to the fact that the restoration of the Custom House, Dublin 1 is nearly completed, he has reconsidered the proposal to transfer the National Museum to the Custom House, thereby consolidating the area as a major cultural and tourist centre in the city while at the same time providing essential additional space to the Houses of the Oireachtas within the immediate environs of Leinster House; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with the substance of this question on 21 June and 13 December 1988.  I would like to reiterate my belief, for the reasons then set out at length by me, that the Deputy's proposal does not commend itself on architectural or cost grounds.</P>
      <P>The premises of the National Museum at Kildare Street, which were expressly and splendidly designed for museum purposes, and at Merrion Street have been refurbished considerably over the past three years at a total cost in excess of £2 million and further structural improvements, costing an estimated £850,000 in 1990, are in hands.  In addition, planning is proceeding for a museum to house the Decorative Arts collection at the Custom House Docks.</P>
      <P>As regards additional accommodation for the Houses of the Oireachtas, the former UCD engineering building at the rear of the College of Science, with a total floor area of 10,921 square feet, will be available for use as Deputies' offices before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a number of questions arising out of this.  First, in relation to the last point concerning the former engineering school, could the Taoiseach arrange to make available either to the Whips or to the Joint Services Committee details of the amount of floor space that will become available so that effective and constructive use can be made of that very welcome additional space?  Second, in relation to the magnificent restoration carried out on the Custom House &mdash; which cost a great deal of taxpayers' money &mdash; of which the entire nation can be proud, particularly the people of Dublin, is it the Government's intention that it remains closed to the public and continues to be used as public offices of a substandard kind internally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="6" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different question. The Deputy talked about transferring the museum to the Custom House.  Whatever about using it for some other purpose eventually, I do not think it would be appropriate to transfer the museum.  I agree with the Deputy's remarks about the splendid job that has been carried out on the cleaning and redecoration of the facade of the Custom House.</P>
      <P>On the question of the accommodation available in the former UCD engineering building, we will be providing reasonably good accommodation for approximately 40 Deputies which, I think, will finally take the pressure off the accommodation problems here.  I will be glad to arrange to have the plans shown to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a final supplementary question on the Custom House.  Are the Government aware of the fact that the office accommodation in the Custom House is substandard in terms of our labour legislation and that in order to bring it up to standard an enormous amount of money would have to be spent on work which would distort the inside of the building?  In consultation with the Minister for Finance, would the Taoiseach reconsider alternative uses for the building now that the exterior has been so splendidly restored?</P>

      <Col N="11" /> ICTU expressed concern at speculation relating to the possible sale of a number of State companies and outlined their position in relation to the matter as contained in their policy statement on privatisation: <i>Public Enterprise and Economic Development.</i></P>
    <P>My colleagues and I assured the deputation of the Government's commitment to an efficient semi-State sector and our concern that it should contribute to the faster growth of the economy and employment.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that a working group, under the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, would undertake a speedy review of the role and contribution of semi-State companies in economic development and in job creation.  The working group will examine the various possibilities that exist to improve the performance of State companies including the possibilities for developing large scale indigenous companies capable of exploiting the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>Copies of the joint Government-ICTU statement which issued after the meeting are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the terms of reference of the Central Statistics Office.  A five year strategy for the office covering the years 1988 to 1992 was drawn up by the National Statistics Board established by my predecessor in February 1986.  The board's essential function consists of guiding the strategic direction of the Central Statistics Office with a mandate from Government to establish priorities in responding to the demand for official statistics.  Their strategy report, which was accepted in full by the Government in 1988, was published in May 1988 and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I see no reason to depart from the recommendations of the board which is composed of persons with special knowledge and expertise both in the compilation and analysis of statistics and in the various needs for statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is misinterpreting the position.  Top Level Appointments Committee do their job conscientiously and properly and recommend for appointment those the committee consider in their opinion to be the right type of people.  Unfortunately, the situation about which the Deputy is complaining, and rightly so, arises from the fact that throughout the Civil Service, particularly at the higher echelons, there <Col N="19" /> are not enough women members in line for appointment by Top Level Appointments Committee.  That is unfortunately the fault of the system, not of the operation of Top Level Appointments Committee. The Minister for Finance, in the reply to which the Deputy refers, did indicate that two women had been appointed to posts at assistant secretary level.  Presumably, if we wait long enough, the Deputy will see that the situation will rectify itself.</P>

      <P>I would be concerned and I would ask the Taoiseach to look into this matter because in the reply I attempted to quote it was suggested that women at principal officer level were not putting themselves forward for appointment.

Two women were appointed to the position of assistant secretary.

Would he not agree that for some at least the <Col N="20" /> present situation is seen as a vicious circle in that as long as it is an all-male committee women, it is felt, will not be promoted, and not being promoted they will never be eligible to be members of the committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> I presume the Deputy is referring to the completion of the Internal Market. The Commission's programme for the completion of the Internal Market does not currently include any proposal specifically related to free movement of works of art.</P>
    <P>The effect of the completion of the Internal Market and the abolition of frontier controls on the movement of cultural goods is, however, under consideration by the Council of Ministers responsible for cultural affairs.  Those discussions may enable the Commission to decide whether or not it wishes to make a proposal on the relationship between the Single Market and the protection of national, historical, artistic or archaeological treasures.</P>
    <P>While the question is very complex, it should be noted that Article 34 of the Treaty of Rome provides that, in spite of the elimination of barriers to trade within the Community, prohibition or restrictions on imports and exports can be justified on grounds of the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value.  This will still apply after 1992.</P>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions, as have Deputies in this House, adverted to the possible constitutional difficulties of drafting legislation to control the export of works of art privately owned.  These difficulties are still being examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is impossible to control the trans-frontier movement of works of art without maintaining controls at frontiers? Would he agree further that, in large measure, the purpose of the Single European Act and the associated 1992 programme is the removal of those very frontier controls?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered giving public support at European level for the indexation of major works of art and the identification in a central location of such works so as to ensure there is an early warning system in operation in all member states to prevent, by mutually enforceable law, any attempt to sell works of art that may have been illegally exported from one member state to another or, more particularly, stolen in one member state in order to be sold in another?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>That exhibition includes material loaned from both our National Museum and National Gallery and there has been full co-operation with the Ulster Museum from the outset in arranging this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possibility of mounting the exhibition in Dublin under National Museum auspices was jointly examined with the Ulster Museum.  It was fully accepted, however, that the very heavy costs involved would not be justified.  A <Col N="26" /> factor in this was the fact that the necessary space, with security and climatic control, in the National Museum was already reserved for an exhibition on Celtic metalwork which has been organised in conjunction with the British Museum.  This exhibition opens next week and will run until September.</P>
    <P>No site closer than Dublin to the Boyne would have the capacity or the secure facilities, to receive such a major exhibition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say first that I welcome the fact that the National Museum has co-operated with the Ulster Museum in mounting this exhibition, but would the Taoiseach accept that there will be considerable disappointment that this exhibition, which is contemporary and topical and of great interest and on which it would appear some public funds from this side of the Border have been spent indirectly, will not be put on display anywhere in this jurisdiction?  Would he agree that, while we would all wish people to travel to Belfast to see the exhibition for themselves, it would make a great deal of sense if it could be displayed on this side of the Border as well?  Will he consider having another look at the alleged heavy cost and the other difficulties that have been raised to see if at least some of the exhibition might be capable of being exhibited here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible that the Taoiseach will be able to consider an exhibition at a lesser cost of at least some of the material?  Will he agree that the effort of assembling all this material for <Col N="27" /> one exhibition is the one opportunity there will be to display it, that once it is dispersed again to its original home it will not exist again and it will cost even more to bring it together at that stage?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned at the cost and the impact on clinical practice of the growing trend towards litigation arising from medical treatment.  I am considering, as a matter of urgency, the steps which might be taken to deal with this problem. I am not satisfied at present that, having regard to the legal issues involved, the establishment of a medical review panel would be appropriate.  However, I am considering all aspects of the procedures which apply to the determination of liability and the award of damages with a view to identifying appropriate policy measures.  In this regard, I am consulting with my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice and Industry and Commerce, and the Attorney General, who have an involvement in important aspects of this issue, before consulting with the medical profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in some states in America they have set up medical review panels, made up of two medical personnel and one legal representative, which have examined the cases of medical negligence and that the insurance companies now, as a matter of practice, have accepted the verdicts of those panels and avoided very costly litigation? If such panels were set up here as an alternative to the legal process they would result in a substantial saving and a better way, on behalf of the medical profession and patients, of dealing with such cases.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in the State of Louisiana there is such a medical panel but I am also informed that while they came down in favour of the medical profession in 85 per cent of cases, 60 per cent of those who felt aggrieved continued with the litigation in the courts. Certainly, we will be looking at all aspects to find some arrangement that will suit Ireland.</P>

As I pointed out to the Deputy, I am consulting with my colleagues about this because it is not primarily a matter for the Department of Health.  My colleagues, the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will have an input and then we will enter into discussions with the medical profession to try to get the most suitable arrangement for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 27, 32, 59, 60, 64, 72, 179, 180, 184, 190 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed new scheme would benefit persons with limited eligibility who have a regular and continuous requirement for prescription medication due to a long-term medical condition.  Such persons would pay the normal retail cost of their prescribed medication up to a maximum of £28 per month.  The pharmacist would recoup the balance of the cost from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies in their questions have made reference to asthma and asthmatics.  I would expect that the drug cost subsidisation scheme would be most beneficial to all persons who suffer from long-term illness, including asthma, and I had hoped that the new scheme could have been introduced some time ago.</P>
      <P>However, negotiations with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on the terms of their involvement in the proposed scheme were more protracted than had initially been anticipated.  The first meeting with the union on the terms in relation to pharmacists' involvement in the new drug cost subsidisation scheme was held on 10 March 1989.  A further 15 meetings have taken place in this respect at which both representatives of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and my Department have participated.  The present position is that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is in the process of balloting its members on the proposals for an agreement in relation to the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  I expect an early result from the ballot and pending the outcome it would not be appropriate for me to make any further statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the <Col N="34" /> reduction in drug costs is that an interdepartmental committee, representative of the Departments of Health, Finance and Industry and Commerce have recently submitted a report to me on future options in relation to containing the State's total drug bill.  The report will be considered shortly by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall promising in this House in February 1989 that he would introduce a drug subsidy scheme in August 1989?  Does he recall that subsequently, in response to a Dáil question, he said the scheme would be introduced late in 1989?  Does he recall saying later that it would be introduced imminently, that is, early in 1990?  Many people suffering from long-term illnesses are disappointed with the delay and I should like to ask the Minister to give the House a date for the introduction of the new scheme.  Those people are suffering hardship due to the Minister's abolition of the VHI drug refund scheme.</P>

The purchase of drugs at the very best possible cost to taxpayers is under discussion.</P>

      <P>Members of the House have been very patient in relation to this matter.  They gave the Minister the benefit of the doubt when he told them last December that the situation was intolerable, to use his own words.  He told us that he had instituted a course of action that would resolve the matter.  Many months have passed and pressure on places for the mentally handicapped have increased.  There are hundreds of people throughout the country seeking residential care places while the finest facility in the country has 60 vacancies.  The patience of Members has been worn thin on this issue and I should like to ask the Minister to state clearly what he intends doing to resolve this unacceptable situation as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, the problem is that the Eastern Health Board, who are now responsible for funding Cheeverstown, have been unhappy with the manner in which it was operated. There was a difficulty between the Eastern Health Board and Cheeverstown.  I established a group, representative of Cheeverstown and the Eastern Health Board, with an independent chairman <Col N="37" /> who tried to resolve the situation without success.  Subsequently I wrote to the Attorney General for his advice because of the massive investment of State funds involved and, following that, a group from the voluntary organisations, who provide services for mental handicap, became involved in trying to resolve the situation.  In the interests of the mentally handicapped &mdash; children and adults &mdash; it is best to settle this in an amicable manner and I am hopeful that there will be a solution as a result of the ongoing discussions.</P>

      <P>Quite a sizeable sum of money is involved &mdash; over £2 million a year &mdash; and the Eastern Health Board, who have overall responsibility for the delivery of services for persons suffering from mental handicap, have been unhappy with the manner in which Cheeverstown is operating.  I am not prepared &mdash; it is not in the question &mdash; to go into the details of why the Eastern Health Board are unhappy because discussions are going on which will obviously involve them and Cheeverstown.  It would not be appropriate to go into details at present.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that, as part of their recovery programme, the VHI Board reached agreement with public and private hospitals on an 18 month freeze on cost increases. <Col N="38" /> This expires at the end of June 1990, and some increase in VHI's claim costs will then be inevitable.</P>
      <P>The VHI Board have applied for a modest premium increase.  This is being considered in the context of the latest information on VHI's financial position and the expected trend in claims costs. An announcement on the amount and timing of any increase will be made at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>I have not been asked to approve any changes in the benefits available to members.  Deputies will, however, be aware that the VHI Board are at present in negotiation with the medical profession with a view to providing full indemnity for professional fees which would, of course, be of significant benefit to members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to establish a central locum agency for hospital consultants, I do not consider that such an agency would be any more effective in securing locums than the existing practice which, in accordance with present contractual arrangements, involves the active participation of consultants in each specialty and sub-specialty in the selection of locums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the Minister's reply.  Is he aware that one of the problems &mdash; leaving aside the difficulty of hospital beds in regard to waiting lists &mdash; is the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement for locums at present and, from time to time, the non-availability of consultants? In terms of dealing with the backlog of cases and indeed for the benefit of consultants, does the Minister not consider it more sensible for health boards and hospitals to have access to a central locum agency from which they could hire locum facilities of different specialities to ensure that there would not be a stop-go on certain appointments?  This is the case abroad and I should like the Minister to have this matter fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that locums should be recruited, where necessary, to maintain services.  Of <Col N="40" /> course it is a matter for the chief executive officer of the health board or the management of each hospital to decide when they want to recruit a locum or to make a new appointment.  Where permanent appointments are involved, I understand that all agencies set in motion a procedure to make a new appointment well in advance of the termination of office of the incumbent, provided they have sufficient notice.</P>
      <P>On the question of locums generally, the chief executive officer has the right to decide on such appointments and having decided that &mdash; this is important &mdash; the consultant is then involved in the selection process.  It is obviously important that the consultant is involved in the selection of a locum who would in effect be looking after his patients.  The Gleeson Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector are examining the remuneration and conditions of service of consultant medical staff and it could be expected that current practices regarding the securing of locums will form a part of this examination.  I hope we will have that report fairly soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards do not keep comparable waiting lists for orthondontic services.  In some health boards the lists are comprised of those who are awaiting assessment while in others, those who have been assessed and are awaiting treatment.  My Department are currently taking steps to ensure <Col N="41" /> that all waiting lists are assembled on the same basis.  I will be writing to the Deputy further on this matter when realistic figures are available.</P>
      <P>What is clear is that the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment are too long. However, the Government made a special allocation of £300,000 available to the health boards late in 1989 to bring about an improvement in orthodontic services, while a further allocation from the 1990 budget provision of £3 million for dental services brings to about £1 million the additional amount provided for orthodontic services in recent months.  These allocations demonstrate the Government's commitment to tackling the problems which have arisen.  As I stated in the Dáil recently, these measures are the beginning of a continuous programme of action to boost services in these areas designed to eliminate the problems which have arisen, as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to state when treatment will be provided for children now joining the waiting list because arrangements for the delivery of orthodontic services are under review.  The five vacant posts of consultant orthodontist in the health board dental service will be advertised again shortly with improved conditions of service.  If these posts were filled it is anticipated that there would be a considerable improvement in the waiting times for orthodontic services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that this £1 million will not provide for a fraction of the waiting lists, which in the Eastern Health Board alone runs to 7,000 people?  Does he not further agree that this old hoary chestnut of filling posts is one we have been hearing about for several years and there is no greater prospect now of these posts being filled in the way he suggests than there was several years ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  The problem with the orthodontic waiting lists has existed for a number of years and we have done our utmost to tackle this problem.  On <Col N="42" /> the direction of the Minister, the health boards and the Department are trying to establish if it is possible to involve the private sector and to have much more flexibility attached to employing people from the private sector to ensure that services can be improved.  If we can get agreement on this I think we will be able to improve the services.  The fact that we have provided £1 million extra for orthodontic services this year shows how committed we are to reducing the lists and providing the best service possible as quickly as we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important section of this Bill is section 9 which exempts local authorities from paying income tax on investment income.  Because this measure could save local authorities millions of pounds, particularly for the period 1974 to 1983, ratepayers and residents in each local authority area could also save substantial amounts of money. Until 1983 many local authorities had substantial sums of money in capital accounts.  This money was lodged in investment accounts because it could only be used for very specific purposes outlined by the Minister for the Environment. The interest earned on those accounts at that time would have been quite substantial.  I am aware, for instance, that relatively small local authorities in various parts of the country had been served with income tax assessments and threats of court action in respect of sums running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.  If this section had not been included in the Bill and if local authorities had to meet these demands there would be a huge increase in rates on commercial properties or service charges or a combination of both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for including this section in the Bill because I have been conscious of this problem for a number of years and have made representations on the matter.  I approached the Minister's predecessor about this matter and referred to it in a debate on a previous Finance Bill.  I am pleased that my representations have borne fruit.  I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for seeing the logic of the argument that the system as it existed penalised thrifty local authorities <Col N="162" /> and acted as a discouragement to proper investment by them.  It was also ludicrous that the Department of the Environment on the one hand were paying money to local authorities in the form of block grants, road grants and various other grants while another arm of the State was taking it back in this manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move because it is an indication of the influence backbench Deputies can have on Government policy.  By and large the work they do, particularly the work of a Government backbencher, is ignored.  However, the inclusion of this section in the Finance Bill underlines the fact that any Member of this House can and does influence the shape of legislation.  The tax amnesty of a few years ago was also suggested by a backbench Member.</P>
    <P>Having thanked the Minister, let me push my luck and suggest that the exemption should be extended to cover the DIRT.  This is specifically excluded under section 9.  While I realise this would have revenue implications, the same principle applies to both income tax and the DIRT, one arm of the State gives money out to a local authority while another takes it from them.  In the case of the DIRT, the local authorities would be happy to have this apply from 1990 with no retrospection, unlike this provision which is back-dated.  This would be a most welcome move and would encourage better investment by local authorities.</P>
    <P>During a debate on the Finance Bill our minds are focused on the specific measures being introduced, changes in taxation and the general changes in the method of collecting and assessing taxes but we do not tend to look at the revenue collection system and the role of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is only fair to give credit where it is due.  Therefore let me say that changes have been made during the past few years which have improved our system of tax collection, but the general feeling among practitioners, tax officials and the general public is that the system simply does not work well.  We can collect and are collecting taxes from compliant taxpayers <Col N="163" /> but we do not seem to have a system which gets at the black economy.</P>
    <P>Of all the amnesties introduced in the past, only one has really worked and that was the last one which realised a total of abour £700 million; the Revenue Commissioners estimated that it would only raise about £30 million.  We all know what happened and now it is being hailed as a great move.  Some estimates indicate that only about 5 per cent of that £700 million came from the black economy, the rest coming from taxpayers who had fallen behind and who had been charged larger sums in interest.  If that figure of 5 per cent is correct, and it has been quoted to me by a number of sources, it is a very small amount and shows just how far we have to go before we have a proper system of tax collection and targeting of those who avoid and evade paying tax.</P>
    <P>The perception many people have is that the morale in tax offices is not very high and personnel feel they do not have enough manpower or the necessary resources or leadership to do the job well. A certain amount of this is rhetoric.  I do not know any Government Department or semi-State organisation who will say they have too many personnel.  Therefore, we have to take some of that with a grain of salt but there is evidence of dissatisfaction and low morale.  An indication of this is the number of high quality staff leaving the tax area to set up in private practice or to return to private business.  Given this problem &mdash; some may call it a crisis of morale within the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I ask the Minister to consider recommending the appointment of a Minister or Minister of State with sole responsibility for revenue and taxation.  If a Minister were appointed in this area, it would give the taxation and revenue area a voice at the Cabinet table.  It would raise the status and morale of tax officers and those working in the tax system and would give direction and leadership to many of the fine people we have working there.  In addition, it would give the Revenue authorities a much tighter department and the <Col N="164" /> commissioners would have tighter control and better liaision with the various sectors under their control.  I cite particularly Customs and Excise and the areas of stamp duty and capital taxes.  There seems to be little or no cross-reference between the Customs and Excise service and the income tax people.  In the area of capital taxes not everyone who purchases a property has to account for where he or she got the money.  That applies particularly to sales of property valued at under £50,000.  It strikes me as strange that that stipulation about making returns would not apply to property under £50,000.</P>
    <P>A revenue department with sole responsibility for collecting taxes would be better able to organise itself, offer incentives to staff or recruit more staff if necessary to meet specific targets set by the revenue annually.  It is no longer justifiable to have an embargo in this area of the public service.  Would it not be more productive all around if they were in a position to bargain for more staff in exchange for greater productivity?  That way everybody would gain.</P>
    <P>Finally on this point, it is fair to say that among practitioners there is a feeling that although the Revenue Commissioners have improved administration considerably there are still serious administrative difficulties which cause delays, foul ups, evasions and avoidance.  There is a simple one which affects the taxpayer seriously at the moment.  That is the large backlog of income tax repayments due for the year 1988-89.  The Revenue Commissioners have acknowledged this and are trying to tackle it and it has arisen basically as a result of the change over to the self assessment system.  I accept what the Revenue Commissioners say in relation to the difficulties that this has caused but surely this should have been anticipated before they introduced the system.  We all know the audit programme for self assessment has been very slow to get off the ground and that the number of audits carried out was as low as 85 in the first year.  That again is an area that could and should be tackled.  If the revenue were to be reorganised in <Col N="165" /> the manner I am suggesting, or even if the administrative structure remains the same, there are several improvements that could be made.  For example, in New Zealand, they have a tax education office with a manager, technical and secretarial staff and a board, all of whom are drawn from the private sector.  This tax education office publishes newsletters, organises seminars, disseminates tax information and gives general advice to tax payers on their tax affairs.  Alternatively, instead of setting up such an office local taxation units could be set up to concentrate on dealing with people who may find themselves in difficulties meeting tax requirements.  I believe that such a move, either one, would prevent another build up to a tax amnesty situation which, I believe, is growing again with huge backlogs to be cleared.</P>
    <P>A second suggestion I would make in this area is that the Revenue Commissioners should publish details of all the non-statutory practices and procedures they have.  Everybody knows that there are various practices of a non-statutory nature that have grown up over a period.  If these were all published everyone would know the approach being adopted and this would cut out a lot of unnecessary paperwork, correspondence and investigation by accountants and so on to elicit information and it would expedite things.</P>
    <P>A third area we should consider is setting targets for the revenue each year. Again this would be desirable, particularly in years when new systems are introduced like the one this year in the Finance Bill, the change to current year tax proposals.  Targets should be set for the collection of revenue from this particular system in the year and should be published so that we will be able to judge the performance in relation to the objectives that were set.  A lot of the red tape could also be cut out if rulings were issued in advance of proposed business transactions by the Revenue Commissioners. In New Zealand and Canada it is the practice to make such rulings but they are not necessarily binding.  They do, however, give business people an idea of <Col N="166" /> what tax régime they will be under and cuts out a lot of unnecessary paperwork later.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the question of the sub-contractors' authorisation.  This is contained in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970.  I mentioned on a previous Finance Bill that it has become increasingly difficult to obtain a certificate of authorisation while the scope of what is termed construction operations has widened. Anyone who has not got a fixed place of business, like an office or a workshop, will not be given the certificate. Somebody who operates from a house-cum-office, and many smaller contractors do this, must at least own the house before he will be granted a certificate.  If he is renting the house there must be a formal lease for inspection by the Revenue. An example that I came across was of an individual who was carrying out a lot of plumbing for the county council. He needed an employee and had to meet a wage bill every week.  He had his own van, his own equipment.  He was single and lived at home.  When he went looking for the certificate it was refused on the basis that he had not got a fixed place of business.  After a lot of hassle they agreed to issue the certificate provided a formal lease was drawn up between himself and his father for the use of part of the house. If that individual had not obtained the certificate he could not have carried on his business and could not have maintained employment for the employee because his cash flow would not have allowed it with the deductions that are made.  In cases where a large amount of materials has to be supplied by a sub-contractor a certificate is vital and that was so in this case.  Even if a person is passed on this fixed place of business rule the legislation states that his tax affairs must be in order for the three year period prior to his application.</P>
    <P>Another case I came across was where a taxpayer was refused a certificate on the grounds that everything was not up to date during the entire three year period in question.  That means that if everybody in the CIF adopts this attitude anybody who is even one day late in a three year <Col N="167" /> period in lodging any type of tax form could be refused a certificate.</P>
    <P>A further point on this aspect of the legislation is that it allows no right of appeal in the event of a refusal.  I believe this is wrong and unconstitutional and I cannot understand why it has not been challenged.  It is certainly against the spirit of the charter of rights issued by the Revenue Commissioners in the past few months which states that a taxpayer has a right to object to a charge to tax or duty if he thinks the law has been applied incorrectly and to ask for the case to be reviewed.  If the matter cannot be resolved by the Revenue officials to the satisfaction of the taxpayer, he should have the right in law to an independent review.  This is not the case.</P>
    <P>I will cite another anomaly in the taxation systen.  The rate of tax applicable to deductions on non-registered sub-contractors is 35 per cent, but this was introduced when the standard rate of tax was 35 per cent and I think this should now be reduced in line with the recent reductions in the standard rate of withholding tax on professional fees and the DIRT.  I cannot understand why the rate of tax in this case has not been reduced. It seems to be extremely harsh to be deducting tax at the rate of 35 per cent from the VAT inclusive figure billed by the sub-contractor.  This contrasts with the deduction of withholding tax, which is deducted from the professional fees paid by Government Departments, where the rate of tax deducted is calculated on the amount before VAT is added.  If we do a bit of arithmetic, we see that on a bill of £10,000, there is a difference of £1,375 between the amount paid to a sub-contractor and that paid to an accountant or solicitor.  I do not think it is fair that sub-contractors, who are expected to pay VAT on their overheads, have to wait a long time for the repayment of 35 per cent tax.  I know this is causing severe cashflow problems.  I am confident that the Minister will do something about this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal very briefly with the matter of the taxation of elderly <Col N="168" /> people.  As I have said before when speaking on social welfare Bills, I am a great believer in making life as easy as possible for our senior citizens, as indeed is everybody else in this House.  I believe that our tax system could show a little more regard for them, particularly those who have given life-long service to the State in either the public or the private sector.  I have noticed that, because of the substantial increases in social welfare over the past number of years, those in receipt of a private pension in addition to a State pension are now in receipt of a much smaller tax-free allowance because their social welfare pension has been taken into account.  While the income exemption limits are very substantial for a married couple over 75 years of age, I think they could be increased a little more for the single widowed person and I would particularly like to see the exemption limits increased for the old aged single person.</P>
    <P>There has been quite an amount of discussion of the Government's measures to tackle poverty in the Finance Bill and assertions that the budget did nothing to tackle poverty.  The Conference of Major Religious Superiors outlined their three major criticisms of the budget: first, despite appearances social welfare was not given the priority it deserved in the budget; second, there was no commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare; third, the budget was anti-family.  I have heard those criticisms repeated in this House by members of the Opposition.  I cannot let that go unchallenged.  I am very surprised that a body as responsible as the Conference of Major Religious Superiors could lend their weight to such inaccurate and misleading views.  I am not happy with them.  This Government, more so than most, have accorded the highest priority to social welfare, as can be seen from the substantial increases in the levels of payments as compared with those obtaining in 1986.  Long-term unemployment assistance has increased by 42 per cent; the long-term rates for married persons with children have increased by 30 per cent.  The cost of the <Col N="169" /> increases implemented over the past few years has been in excess of £175 million.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could claim that they are the actions of a Government which do not give a high priority to social welfare and to the poor.  In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance devoted 12 pages to social welfare, the elderly, the disadvantaged, which comprised 20 per cent of his budget speech.  I dare say that is a record in this House and shows the Government's commitment in this area.  It is possible to misuse statistics to show that the proportion of the total budget allocated to social welfare has declined in 1990, but it is ludicrous to suggest that this indicates that the Government are not committed to improving the lot of the poorer sections in the community.  The truth is that the Government have made great strides in reducing unemployment and improving the delivery of social welfare, which have freed resources which now have been used to give substantial additional benefits to social welfare recipients without imposing additional burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Conference of Major Religious Superiors' second point, the Government have made substantial progress in implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  In addition to improving benefit levels within the scope afforded by the Government's finances, many changes and improvements have been made to the social welfare system as recommended by the commission.  These include improvements in the basic level of payments, improved child income support, broadening the insurance base, improvement in the delivery of the service.  In this Finance Bill, the introduction of a carer's allowance and the setting up of a new appeals system are in line with the commission's recommendations.  The criticism is ill-informed when one considers that the commission's report states quite clearly that their recommendations on the priorities should be implemented over time.  The Conference of Major Religious Superiors stated there was no <Col N="170" /> commitment to implementing the recommendations in the Commission on Social Welfare's report but I would ask if they have read the report, when they make a statement like that?  There are 65 recommendations and four areas of priority listed in the report and I do not think anybody could argue but that the four priority areas are being followed by the Government at this point in time.  In addition 40 of the 65 recommendations have been already fully or partially introduced by the Government, indeed many of them can be introduced only on a gradual basis.  Among the recommendations which have not been implemented as yet are the phasing out of the living alone and age allowances, the taxation of short-term benefits, the removal of the ceiling on PRSI contributions and the abolition of the PRSI-tax allowance.  I would ask the Conference of Major Religious Superiors if they are advocating that these changes should take place immediately?</P>
    <P>Their third criticism was that the budget was anti-family but I can list the increase in the child dependant payments, which have increased substantially over the last three years; child benefit has increased, a new carer's allowance has been introduced and a clothing allowance will be introduced in September.  There have been increases for adult dependants and the age limit for child dependants in full-time education has been increased.  The free fuel scheme and the free travel scheme have been extended.  There have been substantial income tax changes and major improvements in the family income supplement. If that is anti-family, I think many people would be asking for more.  As I said, the criticism is unjustified and very unfair.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of poverty and wealth I would suggest that the introduction of a charitable donations covenant might be a good method of using the tax system to redistribute wealth.  This could operate in the same manner as the present education covenant scheme, in other words, a firm or individual could make a formal covenant with a charitable organisation and could claim tax relief on <Col N="171" /> that.  We are one of a few countries in Europe that does not have such a system in operation.  Such a scheme would have advantages for the taxpayer but it would also benefit many charitable organisations and the people for whom they work.  At a time when many charities complain that the national lottery, which is basically a State organisation, is affecting their fund raising efforts, the introduction of such a scheme would be of enormous advantage.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill furthers the economic policies of this and the previous Government, which have proved so successful since 1987.  In his speech the Minister referred to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the benefit that has accrued from it.  To have a consensus approach has been of enormous benefit. The role of unions and employers should be recognised and praised.  The Government have definitely kept their side of the bargain in relation to tax and pay. They have tackled the national debt and they have looked after the less well off through the social welfare system.  The workers have also kept their side of the bargain, sticking by the moderate pay agreement that was reached at that time, but I am not 100 per cent convinced about the employers.  They probably have kept the letter of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> but I am not sure about the spirit.  Their profits have increased more substantially than the employment they are giving and I would like to see an improvement in employment in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our spokesman on Finance, Deputy Noonan, has dealt extremely well and trenchantly with the major national issues of the Finance Bill and the budget.  I agree with his major thesis that the Finance Bill and the budget were a disappointment, an opportunity lost which unfortunately may not be repeated in the immediate future.  The country had come through the various tough preliminary rounds and a difficult campaign which was greatly facilitated by co-operation from this side of the House. <Col N="172" /> Now that we have moved into what could have been the final stages of recovery, I feel we have not carried it through, not because of lack of co-operation but because of the failure of the Minister to come through with imaginative proposals which we expected on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I propose to confine my remarks to matters of particular concern to my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  The first concern there, and indeed all over the west, is the future of farming as we now know it, that is, if there is a future for the small farmers in the west.  I am delighted that sitting in the Minister's chair is the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, who comes from south-west Cork an area not totally dissimilar to my own but with certain advantages that we do not have. One of these is having a Minister of State to look after their needs, as was very evident when the distribution of the eight million gallons surplus milk levy was being considered.  That was very good for them but very bad for us.</P>
      <P>The present position and the outlook, both medium and long-term for the small farmer are disastrous.  Dairy farmers in my area are facing a cut of 10p to 15p a gallon, even taking account of any relief that might result from the Brussels price round.  That kind of cut might be sustainable in the short-term by the big producer but in the west, we are not talking about big producers.  The average quota in the north Connacht area, where there is a very big co-op, is under 10,000 gallons and for many suppliers it is under 5,000 gallons.  What would the average industrial worker, with considerably more in his wage packet than the farmer, think if asked to take a 10 or 15 per cent cut in wages?  That is what the dairy farmers in the west have to endure this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just the dairy farmer who is involved; the small farmer who is not in dairying is even worse hit.  As the Minister of State very well knows, it has been a disastrous year as far as cattle prices are concerned.  Generally speaking, farmers lost money on the average animal and that left them in a very vulnerable position.  Unless something dramatic is <Col N="173" /> done, the small farmer is on the way to being wiped out, and that is even before we start talking in terms of GATT and what it may bring.  In the interests of everyone, a major debate should be opened up very soon.  The dangers lurking in the GATT round can be colossal not just for small farmers but for all farmers.  I am sure this is something the Department of Agriculture and Food and the other Ministers involved are very much concerned with.  I have no doubt, indeed I have the utmost confidence, that they will fight their case in the interests of the farmers to the very end.</P>
    <P>At present what farmers are getting from the Government are no more than platitudes.  We are getting waffle about rural developments, about the new era of agri-tourism and what this can do, but as far as the majority of farmers are concerned, even in a beautiful area like Sligo with its slogan: &ldquo;Land of Heart's Desire&rdquo;, in Leitrim and south-west Cork, which is a great tourist area, agri-tourism and the crock of gold that is supposed to come with it, has as much substance as the talk about the leprechaun at the end of the rainbow.  There is nothing for the ordinary small farmers.  The people involved in tourism, the planners in Brussels and the people dealing with rural development seem to envisage hoards of visitors moving across the meadows bringing piles of money with them, be it dollars, ECUs or whatever, to the farmers but that is a myth.  The small farmer will not gain from that tourism because he cannot cash in on it.  I cannot see that being the answer.  If these tourists come they will be visiting something like a national park, with guides to tell them about farming patterns.  That may seem to be an exaggeration.  I am not blaming the Government for this, it is a confluence of circumstances that is making matters extremely difficult for all farmers.  Never have I seen a period where all elements in farming at the same time are under attack.  In the past, dairying could be doing well while beef or cereals or some other area was doing badly, but at the moment all areas of farming are under attack because of <Col N="174" /> world circumstances, of EC circumstances or cutbacks of one kind or another.  I am aware that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State are in there defending us but in world terms our farmers are experiencing difficulties, particularly small farmers.</P>
    <P>I am appealing for practical help for these farmers to get out of their immediate difficulties.  A start can be made in that respect in one very simple way, and this is only fulfilling an obligation, by paying out the remainder of the headage money immediately.  My phone did not stop ringing any day last week with farmers asking when their headage money would be paid.  This is headage money which was supposed to be paid before Christmas.  I have no doubt but that the story is the same in all constituencies and for all Deputies.  The fact that the inquiries are coming through in such volume also indicates that the headage money is very late.  Unfortunately, as I understand it, those concerned may have to wait another month or two unless the Minister goes back and says we must do something about it.  This is a further indication of the dire straits in which these farmers find themselves so far as cash is concerned.  They need money at this time for inputs of one kind or another and may have been relying on these headage payments.</P>
    <P>The same applies in respect of payments under the farm improvements grant scheme and the various other construction and anti-pollution schemes.  It is absolutely essential that money should be paid out as quickly as possible.  This is money to which the people concerned are entitled; we are not asking for anything extra in that respect.  What I am talking about is a stop gap situation.  I am sure the Minister of State would like to see the matter cleared up and that he will take whatever steps are necessary in that respect.</P>
    <P>The only immediate way I see of helping the small farmers is through the headage grant vehicle &mdash; if you like to call it that &mdash; where 70 per cent or 75 per cent is recoverable from the EC.  I am talking <Col N="175" /> about a disadvantaged area where headage is now applicable.  If it is extended to other disadvantaged areas good luck to them but there should be an immediate doubling of the present headage payment. This scheme was designed as a family farm income supplement.  It was not designed to create greater production, which the EC wants to see phased out at present.  If the Government deliver on this they will only be delivering on a promise made from all the platforms at the last election that they would double the headage payment.  That was the promise for last year.  I would like to hear some evidence from the Minister for Finance in his reply to this debate that he realises the difficulties that exist for small farmers.  I hope also that he will outline his present intentions in regard to helping them.</P>
    <P>During the last few weeks the ICMSA have run a very vigorous campaign for farmers to get the same personal allowance as PAYE taxpayers. The original justification for the difference, which dates from the 1980 budget, was to take account of the fact that the self employed generally had the advantage of paying tax on the previous year's income.  That has evaporated to payment on the current year's income. Now that the farmers are moving up on to that position the justification for the difference has evaporated.  That case has been built up clearly and logically and I hope it will be taken on board by the Minister.  I understand that our own spokesman, Deputy Noonan, will be putting down various amendments in this category and I hope that the Government and the Minister for Finance will find it possible to react to them.</P>
    <P>Several of my Dáil colleagues including, I am very glad to say, a number of backbenchers on the Government side have discussed during the course of this debate the threatened closure of sub-post offices and the implications that would have for rural Ireland.  My information is that the postal authorities have identified some 800 sub-post offices, put them on a hit list, as it were, for closure and are <Col N="176" /> expecting to effect about 700 closures. There are in the region of 120 to 130 sub-post offices in counties Sligo and Leitrim. Because of the nature of these at least half of them would go on the basis of what is proposed.  This mass attack on the sub-post office network will devastate many areas, particularly in Counties Sligo and Leitrim where we have a very high dependency rate and where, because of the demographic situation, there is a large number of old age pensioners, many of whom are living on their own.  In many cases they are on their own because of current emigration levels.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is well aware, the families of these people are in such places as America, New York and Australia.  Also because of the economic situation we have more than the usual proportion of people depending on social welfare. Because of the topography of both Countries Sligo and Leitrim, with their mountains and lakes, we have many areas that are isolated.  That is another reason that closing sub-post offices in these areas would have a detrimental effect as far as convenience is concerned.</P>
    <P>An Post is a common carrier with an obligation to provide a standard service in all parts of the country.  What will happen to the old age pensioners I have been talking about?  Will they move along four or five miles to the next sub-post office to collect their money?  What happens if they do not have transport to do that?  What happens if they do not have readily available the money to pay for transport to take them to the nearest sub-post office.  I can envisage that in parts of County Sligo and of County Mayo, for example, in the Ox mountains, it could cost a person, a £1 or £2 to have a letter posted, considering the cost of the journey and of the stamp if the sub-post office network is decimated or virtually liquidated as we understand the proposals.</P>
    <P>The approach of An Post in seeking these closures is a defeatist attitude. When An Post were established one of their proud boasts was that they had a massive network of sub-post offices which were very useful and had great <Col N="177" /> potential for generating wealth.  Unfortunately, they failed to make use of these in an imaginative way, so now they have said that they will close them down.  It is a very defeatist attitude.  In their present difficulties they have picked on the softest target available to them.  Mind you, I do not think there is very much money to be saved in that respect.  They could employ them as a useful vehicle of revenue generation for themselves, but where are all the massive new ideas as far as electronic transmission and so on are concerned, which could bring the remotest post office in the country in direct contact with headquarters by just the push of a button or pressing a switch?</P>
    <P>Much more is involved overall here than just the commercial aspect, even though losses may be incurred, but I understand that is not where the real economies can be made.  The real economies can be made elsewhere, without specifying.  I understand it is only minor economies, considering the basic wage paid to the postmasters.  Despite the fact that there are sub-post offices all over the country, there is no such thing as a sub-postmaster. Despite the fact that you are in charge of a sub-post office you are technically a postmaster.  That is the phraseology I have been using in that respect, but the sub-post offices are part of the total social fabric of the rural communities along with the church and the schools and we cannot say they are losing money, £1 million or £2 million or £3 million, and we must wipe them out.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, having listened to the Government backbenchers who have spoken here and a number of people who have not yet spoken but who have discussed the matter with me, that this is something the Government parties will take on board and nothing will happen in that area without very serious deliberation and consultation, taking in everything, the commercial aspect and the effect the closure of these would have on the rural communities which are under attack anyhow.  If we add this further dimension we will be accountable for it. If you have the knocking down of an old building of historic value you rightly have <Col N="178" /> a protest.  If you have the ruination of part of our heritage anywhere, for instance, any vandalism in the various discoveries in the Ballycastle area, you will have major protests, rightly so.  Also part of our history, part of our heritage is the post office in the rural area, having played a part down the years in our emigration, our communication with the people who have gone abroad and in the service of providing and delivering pensions which were the only substantial incomes coming in in hard cash at one stage in these areas.  We must look to that before we say &ldquo;gone&rdquo; in the interest of progress.  If it was a question of the survival of An Post and we had to close down these post offices that would be one thing, but I understand it is only a minute part of the whole problem and that the answer is elsewhere if the Government would go to tackle it elsewhere.  It is much more difficult to tackle it there, so they have picked on a soft target.</P>
    <P>I accept there are good things in the Finance Bill and the budget, but the Minister for the Environment in particular and the Government broadly have failed very badly as far as housing is concerned, or rather the lack of local authority housing in recent times.  Since 1987 in the Sligo Corporation area we have built only one unit with six apartments and nothing else, despite the fact that before the Fine Gael Government left office the tenders were out and the builder appointed for 101 local authority houses which were badly needed in Maugheraboy area.  Nothing has happened since.  This year some finance has been made available for the first time but only to permit the building of 28 of these houses.  The result is chaos.  They will now have to go to tender again for a new builder, creating a further delay, despite the fact that we have a housing list of 250 or 300 and growing.  With the abolition of the £5,000 surrender grant nothing is coming on stream and there is no mobility as far as houses are concerned. In Sligo at the moment we must await these 28 houses.  The situation is chronic and needs urgent action.  All Sligo County Council have got permission for on this occasion is to build 50 houses. <Col N="179" /> Since 1987 they have built virtually nothing except a few very nice old person's homes &mdash; I congratulate the county council on the design and location of these &mdash; and a few SI rural cottages or houses, nothing else.  This time all they are getting is for 15 houses of whatever type and it will be totally taken up in SI rural houses.</P>
    <P>I put on record that that is not the total scene in the west.  There are some bright spots and the bright spot from us is directly across the border in Mayo where a total of £1.636 million, obviously not enough for Mayo, has been given to Mayo County Council.  On top of that, Castlebar, Ballina and Westport have got over £800,000.  All those three urban areas would fit neatly into some suburban and a little bit of the centre of Sligo, but those three urban areas have got the same amount as or a little more than the entire allocation for houses for Sligo County Council and Sligo Corporation.  That is not to speak of the fact that Mayo County Council have got £1.636 million.  I am not suggesting that the Minister for the Environment would have any personal interest or that he would treat County Mayo any better than he would treat the other counties for any reason, but I am just giving the facts of this year's housing grants, and I am allowing the facts to speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Calleary, from Ballina &mdash; the headquarters is now in his town of Ballina and good for them &mdash; might suggest to the Government that because of the very severe weather we had up to now they might consider extending for a month or two months the 31 May limit on construction work and handing in the papers for the old house improvement grant scheme.  For much of the early part of this year, as the Minister of State, who is a civil engineer, will know very well, it was virtually impossible to do any outside construction work.  Therefore, I suggest that just for a mopping up arrangement and to help out a number of people who are badly caught now and may find it difficult to get a builder.</P>
      <P>We have heard a great deal in the recent past about how the country was emerging from its difficulties and the great new future that lay before it, but around my constituency I see no evidence of that on the ground.  This is particularly true in regard to jobs and emigration.  We had figures last year of maybe 40,000 or 60,000 leaving the country, but I believe the present level of emigration this year is greater than that of the previous year. I accept that you do not hear as much talk about it.  It is no longer a topic of discussion.  Previously it was very much, &ldquo;Who has gone away?  Where have they gone?  Is it the USA, Australia, Great Britain or the Continent?&rdquo; Now it is rather the contrary.  The wonder is that he or she has not gone away.  What is keeping them at home?  The whole thing has become routine and we have gone back to the type of thinking that existed in western areas at the time of mass emigration in the fifties &mdash; it has gone back there with a vengeance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government had a great opportunity in the Finance Bill to create jobs and, consequently, to stem emigration. <Col N="181" /> They missed that opportunity.  We put forward a number of suggestions that would have generated many jobs.  The economic climate was such, and the finances of the country had been brought to such a degree of balance that that could have been done.  It is regrettable that it was not done.  We will try to make amends by introducing a variety of amendments to the Bill.  While there were some good features in the budget overall, it was a good opportunity lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable respect for Deputy Nealon as a Member, a spokesman for his party and in his former career as a television presenter. However, listening to his contribution I wondered if we were living on the same continent, let alone in the same country. I am as active in my constituency as Deputy Nealon, or any Member, and the feedback I get is of an economy on the mend, of an improvement taking place and of the economic and commercial life of the country improving tangibly. Deputy Nealon presented a rather lurid picture which would be more appropriate to the slums of Calcutta than the plains of Sligo.</P>
      <P>It was amusing to hear him chiding, admittedly doing so gently, the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, for allegedly distributing largess in his own constituency. I recall a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme immediately preceding the 1987 general election during which Deputy Nealon was congratulated on securing his foothold in Sligo by virtue of the fact that he had twisted the arm of the then Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, to provide an extra hospital wing for Sligo.  As I recall that had not been provided for in the Estimates prepared by his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be excessively moralistic about this but one thing that brings this House into disrepute is Members who, when they cross the Floor of the House, with moral indignation, speak about alleged activities on the part of the Ministers which they, as Ministers, <Col N="182" /> pursued in the full glare of national publicity.</P>
    <P>This is the eighth Finance Bill on which I have had the privilege to contribute either on Second Stage or Committee Stage.  Before I was elected to the House I had occasion to study the annual Finance Bill in another context and I can say with absolute conviction that in terms of what Finance Bills should be about, the 1990 Bill is the best I have read.  It imports a large degree of equity, logic, consistency and modern thinking into our tax laws. It closes a number of obvious loopholes which in turn creates tax equity by distributing the burden of taxation more equally throughout the community.  It applies concepts like stamp duty to activities, such as activities in the financial services sector that were undreamt of in 1891 when the basic legislation was passed. The Bill introduces concepts to impose taxation on modern financial structures which have arisen because of our entry into the European Community and developments in commercial life.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there have been so many changes and improvements to the income tax system, and so many new concepts have evolved since the basic income tax legislation was introduced in 1967, that the time for consolidating the income tax laws is now upon us.  There is a benefit to be gained from consolidation, apart from the obvious one, and it is one that might not be obvious to the outside observer. If the task of consolidation was given over to a special committee of the House, income tax legislation would have to be considered in some depth.</P>
    <P>Each year I have decried the way the House debates the Finance Bill.  I am not accusing any party of failing to do the right thing.  All parties who sat on Opposition benches are guilty.  We have spent all our time on Committee Stage debating the first ten or 12 sections of the Bill and, as a result, 90 per cent of what are usually the most important provisions go undebated. People constantly decry the fact that accountants, tax avoiders, lawyers and others find loopholes in income tax legislation, but is it any wonder that they can do so when the House does not allow <Col N="183" /> itself time to consider the technical details of that legislation on Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate whether there is any constitutional, legal or other prohibition to passing consideration of the Finance Bill to a special committee of the House, as happened in the case of the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the Child Care Bill.  If we do not set up a special committee to consider the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill we will have to extend the time for consideration of Committee Stage so that we can reach the complex provisions.  Last year I argued that some of the general tax avoidance sections in the 1989 Finance Bill are and will prove to be unworkable and I have not changed my mind.  It was not the Minister's intention to introduce unworkable legislation but we could have removed the anomalies if we had had an opportunity to consider them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his record in the Department of Finance in the last two years.  He has been a reforming Minister as far as taxation is concerned.  He has modernised and reformed tax law.  When people refer to reforming taxation what they mean is reducing taxation and that is a different matter to reforming it.  The Minister's record in regard to reducing taxation has been outstanding.  Since he was appointed Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds has reduced the standard rate of income tax by 14 per cent and reduced the top rate by more than 9 per cent. Simultaneously, he has increased the bands of income on which people pay the standard rate by more than 14 per cent. The result of this programme of tax reduction is that the percentage of taxpayers paying tax at the standard rate &mdash; we should remember that it is 14 per cent lower than when he took office &mdash; which was 56 per cent of all taxpayers in the tax year 1987-88 has been reduced to 63 per cent in 1989-90.  That position is maintained by the budget and the provisions in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>People will argue that the Minister was <Col N="184" /> only doing what was necessary in the sense that the basic rates of income tax here were too high, but if one examines the economic and social backdrop against which the Minister managed this reform, one can set his achievement in context. The Minister has brought about this tax reduction against the background of unemployment which has remained stubbornly high.  He has brought it about against the background of a country whose demographic structure, as Deputy Nealon mentioned, implies a high level of dependency on the people who are working and paying tax.  The Minister has done so against the background of a national debt the interest on which is consuming 27 per cent of Government expenditure or, to take another statistic, is consuming more than 80 per cent of the Government's main source of income, income tax.  Against that background the achievements of the Minister for Finance and the Government in reducing taxation are nothing less than monumental.</P>
    <P>A few technical difficulties in relation to the Finance Bill were mentioned by members of the Opposition.  Deputy Nealon referred to the £800 allowance.  I also had representations in regard to this, not just from the small farming community, but also from the self-employed. People paying tax under the PAYE system have an extra allowance of £800 which is not available to people paying tax under other systems.  I am talking mostly about the self-employed, which includes farmers.  That special allowance &mdash; I think about £400 &mdash; was introduced in 1980 and the Minister for Finance at the time said in the Official Report, Volume 318, column 73, that the justification for the special allowance for PAYE workers was &ldquo;to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally have at present the advantage of paying tax on a previous year basis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The argument now runs that, as self-employed people are being brought on to a current basis of taxation, that justification no longer applies and, of course, that argument is correct. However, the people advocating this approach and advancing this argument <Col N="185" /> would do well to bear in mind that while their argument is based on morality and the Constitution &mdash; because I seriously question the constitutionality of the position as it stands &mdash; there are more ways than one in which the Minister can solve the problem.  For example, he could solve it by simply abolishing the special £800 PAYE allowance or by reducing it to £400 and giving a £400 special allowance to the self-employed.  It is doubtful whether he will solve it in that manner, but I am simply making the point.</P>
    <P>As the self-employed section of the community are now on a current year basis of taxation, there seems to be no justification for distinguishing between them and the PAYE sector from the point of view of allowances.  The same argument applies to the £286 PRSI allowance which was given to the PAYE sector to compensate to some extent &mdash; of course it does not compensate entirely &mdash; for the fact that they were paying pay-related social insurance which was not paid by the self-employed.  That situation has now changed although admittedly the self-employed in the current and next tax year will be on a lower rate of pay-related social insurance.  However, they are also subject to certain levies which bring them up to the top rate of social insurance which is 7.75 per cent on the first £17,000, or thereabouts, of income.  Consequently, there seems to be no justification for distinguishing between PAYE taxpayers and the self-employed from the point of view of the £286 special PRSI allowance.  If the problem became a constitutional issue it could be solved in the negative way I mentioned but one hopes that that will not be the case.</P>
    <P>One or two minor anomalies remain under the heading of allowances.  I notice, for instance, looking through the list of personal allowances that a widow or widower with children are given the same allowances as a single person with children, whereas a widow or a widower without children is given something like £400 more per annum than a single person who does not have children. There is no obvious reason for that.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the <Col N="186" /> Minister should take this special allowance from widows, I am simply saying that, from the point of view of allowances, there is a distinction for which there is no obvious justification.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which put self-employed people and certain categories of unearned income on a current year basis of taxation.  That is a logical extension of the self-assessment system.  When that system was first mooted by our predecessors in Government between 1982 and 1987, there was a view that there would be a huge drop in revenue.  However, that was a mistaken view and it is full steam ahead with self-assessment. The provisions in the Bill to put self-employed taxpayers on a current year basis of taxation is a logical and necessary extension of that system and it is achieving genuine self-assessment.</P>
    <P>A number of changes for the better will be introduced to the income tax code which will enable people in receipt of income from two sources &mdash; PAYE and Schedule D &mdash; to use one return of income instead of two as heretofore.  In so far as interest is concerned it will eliminate the anomaly which at present exists between income which is subject to deposit interest retention tax &mdash; or DIRT &mdash; and another interest which is subject to DIRT and which is, of course, taxable on a current year basis whereas other interest is not.  It will also harmonise the position between one form of unearned income &mdash; namely interest &mdash; and another form of unearned income &mdash; rent.  From that point of view it is welcome, logical and necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill brings about this change and it will become known in the profession as the 100 per cent rule.  Under the new rules a person who is in receipt of income from an unearned income source or who is self-employed will pay income tax in a year which runs from April to April, on 30 November of that year.  If that person is unable to assess what his profits will be for that year a difficulty will arise because when the person is paying preliminary tax on 30 November it will have to be equal to 90 per cent of his ultimate agreed liability, <Col N="187" /> otherwise he will be subject to penalties. Naturally a difficulty will arise when the person on 30 November is unable, for various reasons, to calculate his total income between the preceding 5 April and the current 5 April.  To get over that difficulty the parliamentary draftsman is saying that the person has an option: if he cannot work out his income he simply pays 100 per cent of the tax he paid in the preceding tax year to avoid the 90 per cent rule.  On the face of it that looks like a concession but it will, in practice, give rise to difficulties.  It is based on a mistaken assumption that the profit from a self-employed source of income is a constantly rising graph.</P>
    <P>If the person in that situation cannot calculate his income for the current tax year &mdash; and if his profits have fallen dramatically compared to the preceding year &mdash; it will not be a consolation to tell him that if he cannot calculate his total tax in the current year he will avoid penalties by paying all the tax as a preliminary payment which he paid in the preceding year.  This is especially true in relation to a person who has cash flow difficulties, and in the example I used the person will, more often than not, have cash flow difficulties.  I ask the Minister to look at that and perhaps he will consider replacing the 100 per cent rule with an 80 per cent or 75 per cent rule or something else that would meet that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in stamp duty which are quite extensive.  The present system in relation to stamp duties which operates is complex and &mdash; to the lay man &mdash; extremely difficult.  This stems from the fact that the basic provisions on stamp duties are to be found in the Stamp Act, 1891.  In 1891, activities which are now described as financial services activities were not only unknown but were undreamt of.  This Bill contains provisions to apply stamp duty to those types of activities.  This is necessary and overdue.</P>
    <P>There are 14 different rates of stamp duty at present, ten of those rates apply to transactions where the value of the property passing is £10,000 or less.  This is illogical in this day and age.  This Bill <Col N="188" /> replaces those 14 rates with six new rates of stamp duty which will simplify and clarify the system.  This change is not only necessary and desirable but has been long overdue.  Indeed, I would argue that further simplification is needed in the stamp duty code.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to section 100 of the Bill which contains an anti-avoidance measure to catch transactions where a house is being built to order.  At present solicitors transfer a site by way of a separate transaction and then draw up a building agreement.  The Revenue Commissioners have a rule whereby they agree that the value of the site for stamp duty purposes will be one quarter of the value of the total product, in other words, it will be one quarter of the value of the site when the house is built on it.  Section 100 contains provisions to counter that anti-avoidance device.</P>
    <P>In case we do not debate this issue on Committee Stage, I want to put a question to the Minister now.  Section 100 (3) (b) provides that when a site is being transferred and it is impossible to ascertain accurately the value of the completed house, the Revenue Commissioners can put a multiple of ten on the site as being the value of the completed house on which the person ultimately has to pay stamp duty.  However, it also provides that if a taxpayer can provide the Revenue Commissioners with information that the house when ultimately built on the site will not be ten times the value of the site, the Revenue Commissioners have the option of applying a lower multiple to the value of the site, but it will not be less than five.  I want to ask the Minister if the Revenue Commissioners have the power under section 100 (3) (b) to insist on a multiple of ten regardless of what they are told.  From my reading of the section it seems this will be at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners. If, for example, I build a house on the top of a mountain and I can prove incontrovertibly to the Revenue Commissioners that the final multiple will only be four, can the Revenue Commissioners still insist on a multiple of ten? I can see a certain logic in enabling them <Col N="189" /> to do so because if the completed property ultimately turns out to be more valuable than they had originally anticipated, then they will have to bear the loss of any revenue foregone once the deed is stamped and lodged for registration.  I should like the Minister to advert briefly to this question.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in Part V in relation to residential property tax.  The child allowance relief for the purposes of residential property tax was abolished by the Government in 1986 at the same time as the abolition of income tax child relief. The abolition of both those reliefs seemed to have a spurious uniformity but one form of taxation related to income while the other related to capital and, as such, they have nothing to do with each other.  The abolition of that relief was not significant at that time because property prices were low in 1986.  However, property prices have soared since then and the reintroduction of this child relief for residential property tax purposes is to be welcomed and will have effect in practice.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a query of a technical nature with the Minister.  Section 112 (b) gives a new definition of the word &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  Obviously it refers to a natural child, an adopted child and, as I read the section, an illegitimate child.  However, on a broad reading of the section, it seems to refer to a person who is not a child or who is not in any way related to the taxpayer.  I wonder if this was the Minister's intention.  If it was not his intention to include such a person in the category of child in respect of residential property tax, perhaps he will ask the parliamentary draftsman to have another look at this section.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in the top rate of capital gains tax, which applies to transactions which occur within 12 months, from 60 to 50 per cent.  This is in line with the reduction in the top rates of income tax.  Experience has shown us that it is preferable to have some degree of uniformity between the top rates of capital gains tax and the top rates of income tax.  This will avoid a great deal of time and unproductive effort by accountants, tax advisers and others in <Col N="190" /> trying to bring income into the category of capital or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is necessary and desirable to have some broad uniformity between the top and bottom rates of those forms of taxation.  Section 72 reduces the top rate of development land tax from 60 to 50 per cent.  Is there any separate justification for doing this?</P>
    <P>I welcome, section 92 which increases the flat rate of value-added tax repayable to farmers to 2.3 per cent.  This will, in effect, compensate unregistered farmers for not being able to claim value-added tax on the VAT inputs which they purchase for the purpose of carrying on farming.  I welcome the provisions in section 96 (c) which takes certain periodicals out of the 23 per cent rate of VAT and puts them into the 10 per cent rate.  Why is the definition confined to &ldquo;fortnightly&rdquo; publications?  I know of a number of excellent publications which will be excluded from the provisions of this section because of the fortnightly provision. The section provides that if the quantity of printed matter is of a certain type the publication will qualify for the lower rate of VAT.  If a publication or periodical contains mainly pictorial material and illustratious but only a few pages of printed matter, will it be automatically brought into the lower 10 per cent rate?</P>
    <P>The Minister has reduced the standard rate of VAT from 25 to 23 per cent. Despite all the talk about the need for quicker harmonisation of our VAT rate with those of the rest of the EC, this will be a costly process.  Even a 2 per cent reduction in the 25 per cent rate of VAT will cost the Exchequer £125 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in relation to corporation tax.  The yield from corporation tax in 1989 was £303 million, which was low by European standards. However, it must be said that the continued phasing out of accelerated capital allowances will increase the yield from corporation tax.  The emphasis now is on reducing the top rate of corporation tax from 43 to 40 per cent.  This will also benefit capital-intensive industry. However, the tax incentive is being <Col N="191" /> shifted more away from the capital-intensive industries and will apply equally to both types of activities.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax applicable to manufacturing. I hope we discuss this issue on Committee Stage because the number of industries excluded from the definition of manufacturing is too great.  I hope to demonstrate this in more detail on Committee Stage.  If interpreted literally probably it will exclude certain forms of manufacturing activity with which I will not deal here but which I know the Minister does not intend to exclude.</P>
    <P>With those few suggestions which I know the Minister will take in the spirit intended I have no hesitation in heartily commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the Finance Bill gives legislative effect to the budgetary proposals.  The intervening period between the introduction of the budget, the vote on its proposals and the publication of the Finance Bill and its debate usually is one in which any Government, in particular any Minister for Finance, affords himself an opportunity to listen to the views expressed by various groups having analysed the implications of the budgetary proposals on any one sector of the community.  It will be realised that there are anomalies in this Bill as there usually are in Finance Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We gave the budgetary provisions a cautious welcome in that we could see immediately that further anomalies were being created by way of tax exemptions, limits and their implications, welcome though they may be.  Indeed this was confirmed by the previous speaker on the Government side of the House when he identified certain areas as being inconsistent. He went so far as to say that probably they were unconstitutional as they have developed.  The chairman of the Labour Party and our spokesperson, Deputy Taylor, went so far as to say that the Bill itself is flawed, that it is a dangerous document.  He went on to elaborate his reasons for so saying.  If one <Col N="192" /> analyses the implications of the provisions of this Bill for different sectors &mdash; the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;&mdash; one must then ask what its provisions mean to the ordinary man in the street.  The nationwide consensus view was summed up this morning by the leader of our party, Deputy Spring, when he addressed the gathering at the grave of James Connolly at Arbour Hill and said:</P>
    <P>In this new era life is going to be very good indeed &mdash; for some people. It will be good for people in highly-paid employment; it will be good for the financial services sector; it will be good for multinational enterprises.  But it will not be good for others.  This new era in our development will have damaging consequences for people with a mental handicap, who have already been forced to march the streets of Dublin in search of rights that are being steadily eroded.  It will be bad for young people who cannot afford to buy a home of their own, as local authority housing stocks become steadily depleted and less habitable.</P>
    <P>It will be a bad time for people who do not have the means to buy health care as our health services become more and more run down.  It will be a bad time for all of us who believe that education breeds equality, as our education system gears itself more and more to prepare people for emigration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring went on to say that after five years of Tory Government in Britain one of its supporters, Lord Young, said:</P>
    <P>... the next five years will be very good indeed &mdash; for those of us who are in work.</P>
    <P>The pattern being followed by this Government in this Finance Bill is that which has been followed in Britain throughout the ten years of Mrs. Thatcher's rule.  It is ironic that what is taking place here is what is beginning to die even now in the United Kingdom.  People have begun to realise that, whether at Government or any other level, people cannot continue to look selfishly at their economy, at their lack of concern for those in <Col N="193" /> need, that is those of us with a social conscience about the needs and rights of the under-privileged, those who have been marginalised in our society, who look to Government for sustenance in times of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is a good time for the financial institutions.  Their profits and those of the banks have been referred to by many speakers already &mdash; in the region of £470 million to £480 million in accordance with the most recent figures disclosed by them.  At the same time it must be remembered that loan repayments of mortgagors &mdash; people who try to acquire a home of their own which is everybody's aspiration &mdash; have escalated three or four times within the past 12 months alone under the nose of the Minister, rendering it increasingly difficult for them to maintain their repayments or eliminate the risk of eviction by local authorities which has happened in my council area and others throughout the country.  These are evictions of people who had begun to be independent, to be in a position to borrow and repay mortgages in the hope that this Government somehow had addressed the problem of our foreign debt so that loan repayments would be kept at a certain level.  This Government have failed to do so because over the past 12 months alone such mortgage repayments have escalated beyond anybody's expectations or wildest fears.</P>
    <P>In addition to ignoring that fact this Government now propose reducing the income tax relief applicable to life assurance premiums to 50 per cent of the amount paid in 1990-91 and subsequent assessment years.  Such life assurance policies are taken out by people in order to insure against various family risks, be they mortgage repayments or whatever. Such people taking on that responsibility are now to be penalised.  That concept will damage the general life assurance industry which plays a major role in financial institutions but also in the lives of individuals and their responsibilities to their families.  The least such people should expect is to be able to claim income tax relief on life assurance premiums paid in respect of such policies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> It has been contended in the course of this debate that Government policy has been good for the building industry. There was a debate in this House on the crisis pertaining to local authority housing when the Minister refuted any accusation that the Government had been remiss in the area of house building and/or provision.  Twice on that occasion the Minister mentioned local authority dwellings.  He dealt with all the houses being provided by the private sector, by speculative builders, by various developers, by those involved in section 4 planning applications.  While we have witnessed all these improvements in the building industry, with regard to those people unable to provide their own homes &mdash; all local authorities being dependent on the Minister for the Environment who, in turn, is dependent on the Minister for Finance to provide sufficient moneys in the <i>Public Capital Programme</i>&mdash; a lesser amount is now being allocated to local authorities for the provision of that very important social need, that of local authority housing.  Within the past hour some Members have identified towns and counties where one or two houses will be built by local authorities this year, whereas a few years ago they were building between 50 and 100 houses. This is true in the case of Tipperary County Council, Tipperary Urban District Council and Clonmel Corporation, all progressive housing authorities who in the past had records second to none, of which we were all proud, but now they are being constrained by Government policy.  It seems the provision of local authority housing is no longer a priority of the Government.  If we take the failure to carry out repairs, rent increases and the anomalies in the differential rents scheme together, we can see that ordinary working people and indeed the unemployed are now paying more for inferior housing and that young married couples have no hope of being housed by the local authority within a reasonable period.  The allocation to Tipperary County Council is only about 10 per cent of the sum required to meet the housing needs of that county.  Thirty houses will <Col N="195" /> be built this year in the county whereas 300 are needed.  Therefore, how can the Government say they have turned the economy around given the lack of commitment to those in need of State assistance?</P>
    <P>They also need a proper health service but no attempt is made in this Bill, apart from the provision of a minimal allocation &mdash; the Minister has not yet decided how this will be spent &mdash; to address the problem identified by Deputy Spring in the area of mental handicap.  Neither is any attempt being made to reduce waiting lists or address the scandal of the closure of sub-acute and district hospitals throughout the south-east region.  Let me give a few examples of waiting lists throughout the south-eastern region.</P>
    <P>The out-patient waiting list at Waterford Regional Hospital rose from 2,797 at the end of 1988 to 3,672 at the end of 1989.  The waiting list at St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, rose from 363 in 1988 to 671 in 1989.  We can also see that the waiting list at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, the county medical and gynaecological hospital, rose to 191 at the end of last year with the out-patient waiting list remaining at the same level of approximately 200.  Likewise, at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, upwards of 200 people are awaiting admission to acute surgical beds and acute gynaecological beds.  In Kilkenny, up to 1,200 people are awaiting admission for orthopaedic operations while 300 people are awaiting hip replacement operations.</P>
    <P>These lists were not published by the Labour Party or any political gurus in back rooms but rather by the South-Eastern Health Board in January of this year at almost the same time as the Minister was presenting his budget in which he outlined what was going to be done in the area of health.  As highlighted in the debate on the health service, there is still a major problem in the health area which is not being addressed by the Government in this Bill.  While improvements have been made in the social welfare area they only represent a tinkering with the system.  The carer's allowance has been <Col N="196" /> increased but the people whom we wish to see receive this allowance will not get it.  A start has been made but we still have much to do given the need to care for people in their own homes and to compensate those who provide such care.</P>
    <P>No attempt is being made to help those who find themselves in the poverty trap. All of the professionals now admit that many people find themselves caught in this trap.  While we can speak about the good things contained in the Bill there is also a responsibility on us to point out that there are anomalies.  The tax thresholds are being increased.  Single or widowed people with incomes of up to £3,250, an increase of £250 and married couples with an income of up to £6,500, an increase of £500, will be exempt from paying income tax.  These increases are welcome.  Once people's earnings go above these thresholds they will pay tax at the normal rates, taking into account the PAYE allowance they will be entitled to receive.</P>
    <P>These tax thresholds should be linked to those exemption limits below which people would be exempt from paying tax and above which they would pay tax.  If the Minister fails to address this anomaly, in the case of the PRSI exemption on incomes of £60 a week or less, people will find themselves locked at £60 a week in the employer's mind, while in the case of the allowance for adult dependants, the increase in the threshold from £50 to £55 represents a disincentive for a spouse to earn more as they would cease to be an adult dependant.  I can see problems arising if no attempt is made to link exemption thresholds with tax-free allowances.  If we fail to do so, families on low incomes will immediately face problems.</P>
    <P>In talking about anomalies in the tax system it is only appropriate that we should point out that Members on the Government side of the House have admitted that a particular anomaly exists which has been identified by the ICMSA in their document <i>Justice for the Farm Family</i> a copy of which has issued to each of us.  This is a good document which is based on fact.  It points out that there <Col N="197" /> is no reason why farmers and the self-employed should not receive the £800 allowance given to PAYE taxpayers. This document concerns itself with farm families and it must be our responsibility to ensure that family farms stay intact. Deputy O'Dea suggests that this is a constitutional anomaly.  We would ask the Minister to address this problem and we will assist him in every way possible.  We will assist by way of appropriate amendments which may not be the right way to do it; I would certainly prefer if the Minister responded positively to this anomaly that we have highlighted in the light of the Irish Commissioners attitude to the whole concept of rural development.</P>
    <P>In this regard I want to address the concern of a Member of this House who was today totally confused about whether the Government had applied to Brussels for an extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Last week the Tánaiste said that the application had gone.  Today there was silence and the Minister responsible was smiling.  Smiles do not appear on the record of the House but negative actions do.  It is time to come clean with people living in disadvantaged areas.  These people are happy to live there but if we do not do something to keep them there they will come down to the villages and towns looking for jobs that are not available and creating further problems for those who are already on the scrap heap of the unemployed.  One way to help these people to stay where they are is to avail of the incentives in the EC so that income will flow from this source to the poorer farmers in disadvantaged areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has realised that the business expansion scheme has been abused by the private sector and I am glad that he is addressing the problem.  Nobody will shed any tears about a procedure which was set up to be a benefit to people and was suddenly abused by various sectors at the expense of the taxpayers.  The Government must have as a priority the welfare of the less well off and there are people, in the health area, in the local authority area, in the social welfare area <Col N="198" /> for whom more needs to be done.  Needless to say that will mean spending more money and money can be got by broadening the tax net so that more people pay their fair share.  There are many ways to make people conscious of their responsibilities. In other countries people who make donations to charities get tax relief for them.  That is a concept we should promote because there are entrepreneurs who want to do that but they just need an incentive.  One area where help is needed is in the hospice movement. Those of us who have been touched by the trauma of death will realise the importance of providing specialised nursing or specialised units such as hospices for the dying.  Would the Minister not consider that money donated by people who have a conscience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is an opportunity to address these areas but it <Col N="199" /> has failed to do so.  That is a view that is shared by many.  It is one of the few instruments available to the Minister for Finance, who controls all the other Departments, to improve health, social welfare and farming incomes and to introduce improved indexation for PAYE taxpayers so that there is fair play for all.  These are all intrinsically linked to the finances of this State.  It is appropriate that on May Day when we commemorate those who founded this State our party Leader identified some of those areas of need and the people who will not benefit from the improvements predicted by many speakers, not only on the Government side but on other sides and by economists in the media and elsewhere.  They have identified some of the courageous steps that have been taken by the Government from time to time which have been taken at no small cost but at the expense of people who were not in a position to speak for themselves because they had relatively little political muscle. When it was pointed out that there were people still in the poverty trap here there was resentment by the Government and by Ministers of all Departments who depend for their total allocation on the Minister for Finance.  That is to be regretted. All of us would like to see in this Finance Bill a stimulus for employment to stop the drain of our highly educated young people from our shores at a rate of 30,000 to 40,000 a year.  What is in the Finance Bill for the unemployed?  Even those who have jobs are losing them. Throughout my constituency in Waterford, Cork and Clonmel people are on the streets fighting for their right to jobs. I see nothing in this Finance Bill that will give them any hope that this Government are serious about job creation.  Every day I hear the Government coaxing the trade union movement towards another programme of financial recovery without which many of the things that have been achieved could not have been achieved. Without the spirit of co-operation from the working trade union movement here the Government could achieve nothing. Here was an opportunity to advance a <Col N="200" /> reason that the trade union movement should enter into another programme for continuing recovery.  Ministers have said there are jobs, that there are 15,000 social employment jobs or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Initially we gave the Finance Bill a cautious welcome, but I expressed our concerns about anomalies in it.  I suggested that we would assist the Minister by tabling amendments on Committee Stage which would improve the Bill.  We have done that and we will continue to act in a constructive manner.  I hope the Minister will respond constructively and positively to our suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was intrigued by the contributions of the Opposition speakers to the Finance Bill.  It must be clearly understood that the Finance Bill alone cannot solve all the ills of the country.  It is time the problem of job creation was tackled head on.  The Fine Gael spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said the Bill was unimaginative and did nothing for job creation and Deputy Ferris said more or less the same. They appear to have a strange double-think towards employment creation.</P>
      <P>From time to time people call on the Government to create jobs.  We hear the Opposition spokespersons bemoaning the lack of jobs, the large numbers unemployed and how the Finance Bill is unimaginative and does not respond in any serious way to these very important matters. At the same time &mdash; and I have witnessed this in Cork, Galway and Limerick, centres to which Deputy Ferris referred &mdash; Labour and Fine Gael politicians are objecting to economic development.  People have objected to fish farming, hotel projects and the building of houses in areas which are zoned for housing, and there appears to be a double-think on the question of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No Fianna Fáil politicians were objecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The people objecting to the location of a chemical industry at Ringaskiddy are the very same people <Col N="201" /> who are objecting to the lack of jobs and are calling on the Government to do something about it.  It is my view that we should have a forum, along the lines of the New Ireland Forum, to consider employment creation.  I do not honestly believe there is a collective will in the community to deal with job creation.  I have witnessed politicians on the other side objecting to substantial investment projects in Cork city in order to satisfy a sector of the electorate in their own bailiwick.  If we are genuinely concerned that employment creation should be the number one priority in the community, then all the other matters which we put before job creation should be put to one side.  I would ask the Government to consider having an economic forum on the model of the New Ireland Forum to try to generate a consensus among the community at large on employment creation.  Various sectors of society would make submissions to the forum on employment creation and on the environment versus job creation.  When canvassing during general elections politicians witness how many people are without jobs and hear of the numbers of young people who have emigrated, yet they tend to go back to the local authorities or other spheres of influence and object to job creation projects.</P>
      <P>Once the necessary environmental protection measures are in place, there should be no genuine reasons for objecting to the creation of employment.  In the chemical industry alone 12,000 people are employed yet some people are saying there should be a moratorium on the chemical industry.  These same people come into this House and say the Finance Bill is making no effort to generate employment.  I believe an economic forum could help us to arrive at a consensus. We could order priorities and agree on the parameters within which we could proceed towards job creation.  We could also establish guidelines to which we would adhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view Bord Fáilte and various tourist organisations are objecting to certain fish farming on what are spurious grounds while the Department of the <Col N="202" /> Marine are issuing licences for fish farming on the other hand.  That is an appalling conflict between State agencies and it should not be happening.  I think that a lot of objections are based on spurious grounds and ill informed lobbyists do not know the full facts pertaining to the industry, yet they readily object to the first thing that moves in relation to job creation.</P>
    <P>In this Finance Bill, the Minister has continued along the path that the 1987 Fianna Fáil Government took in regard to taxation measures.  We have seen major improvements in the area of income tax with a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 56 per cent to 53 per cent and the 32 per cent rate was reduced to 30 per cent.  It looks likely that we will achieve the tax rate of 25 per cent by 1993.  The reduction of the standard rate of corporation tax to 40 per cent will help job creation in the services sector.  This is particularly welcome.  I believe that the services sector will require more attention to the taxation front in future years because in the world major economies, such as America and Japan, the services sector provides large numbers of jobs.  In North America, 74 per cent of jobs are in the services sector. While our industrial policy has tended towards providing tax relief for the manufacturing industries with a view to export, we will have to have a major review of industrial policy with a view to creating major tax reliefs in the services sector because that is where the jobs will be in the future.  I believe the Minister is going down that road.</P>
    <P>The extension of the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing industry to the year 2010 is another welcome step because that will allow investors certain securities in the longer term and should help them when making vital decisions on their investments.  This Bill also confirms the extension of the urban renewal package until 1993 with all the incentives that entails for various rural and urban centres. Today, the Minister for the Environment announced the details of the extension of that programme.  I welcome the designation of the extra 27 acres in <Col N="203" /> Cork city as a designated area.  This will attract major projects to those areas within the next three years and I am very confident that we will see major developments as a result of the Minister's announcement today.  That gives the lie to the Opposition's claim that the Bill is not directed towards job creation, because it most certainly is.</P>
    <P>The designated areas scheme has proved to be a very useful tool for releasing investment in rundown inner city areas which have been neglected and which have lain derelict for many years. We have seen very attractive, environmentally and architecturally sensitive projects in the inner cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway under this scheme.  As a result of today's announcement we will see even greater benefits in future years.</P>
    <P>The Minister is attempting to curb a number of abuses in the business expansion scheme.  While this is welcome, I would like to place on record that the business expansion scheme has provided a useful mechanism for releasing much investment into the economy.  Many people who would have considered such investment marginal prior to the introduction of the scheme are now prepared to invest in projects.  The extension of the scheme to the tourism area in the past number of years has been very successful, despite a number of abuses.  The thrust of the scheme is to release investment in certain areas which investors hitherto considered marginal.  This results in increased numbers of job being created and an increase in economic activity. That is to be welcomed.  I urge the Minister to keep the scheme going at all costs.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to local authority housing and the failure to provide adequate finance for it.  We need to take a much more analytical approach to the question than Deputy Ferris's knee-jerk reaction of &ldquo;give us more money to build more local authority housing&rdquo;.  The 1987 tenant purchase scheme resulted in a considerable number of local authority houses being sold.  In Cork city alone 1,500 houses have been sold.  We have to <Col N="204" /> question the wisdom of the Department of the Environment and the local authorities building new local authority houses and selling them two years later at literally half the price it cost to build them.</P>
    <P>If we are committed to the owner occupier concept, in other words if our objective on the housing front is to have as many people as possible owning their own houses, the Minister, as well as the Minister for the Environment, should give consideration to bringing in a scheme which would basically place people in an owner occupier status at the commencement of their taking over a house or a tenancy.  There is very little point in allocating a house to someone and selling it to them two or three years later for half the price.  That does not make financial or economic sense.  The Government will have to give serious consideration to initiating housing policy which would bring about the desired position of having owner occupiers almost from the very beginning.  The Minister has indicated that that is the approach he is anxious to adopt.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed that a number of community groups who organise sheltered housing projects for the elderly in particular and also for the homeless are still subject to VAT on construction costs and on the overall expenditure on a housing project.  The Minister should consider in future Finance Bills giving total VAT relief to any community group involved in a construction programme for sheltered housing.  After all, these community groups are in many ways doing the work of the State in providing badly needed housing for the disadvantaged and for people who for one reason or another are living in sheltered accommodation or living on the streets and so on.  These groups are providing a good service and the Minister should help them by making the necessary amendments to the Bill to allow them VAT relief on the construction of housing. That would be of great benefit to them. The representations these people have made to the Minister in that respect should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> I would like to refer to the whole question of, as Deputy Ferris called them the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; in society. We have adopted for far too long a simplistic approach to this question.  I would like someone to give me the definition of &ldquo;the ordinary man in the street&rdquo;, as Deputy Ferris would have him described. I do not think there is any such person. The question of class differences and segregation of classes is much more complex than many speakers would have us believe.  The complexity of our taxation and social welfare systems makes it difficult to come forward with the type of simplistic notions we have heard from the Left wing of the House on this Bill.  There is a clear need for a more enlightened approach to the matter, for more clearheaded thinking on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the lack of educational opportunity today and said the Finance Bill does nothing to improve that position.  We must give credit where credit is due and point out that nearly 95 per cent of all students attending third level VEC colleges are in receipt of grant aid from a combination of national and EC funds.  That is an outstanding achievement. It is utterly ridiculous to have to listen in this House to the nonsense that there is a lack of opportunity in education. That is not the case.  I would concede that improvements could be made in certain university sectors.  The Minister for Finance should give consideration to perhaps giving tax relief to PAYE workers whose offspring attend university, particularly where two students in a family are attending university and where they are not in receipt of a grant.</P>
    <P>Tax relief for university students should be introduced.  That is something on which I will continue to lobby the Minister.  It would not cost very much and it would go a long way towards ensuring a greater degree of equity in the whole grant system.  There is a perception abroad that the PAYE sector are losing out in the whole area of education grants in that the self-employed and the farming community have greater control over their returns to the Department.  I am aware that this area has been tightened <Col N="206" /> up considerably in recent years.  The Departments of Finance and Education know quite clearly what a person on PAYE is earning so their case is very often clear cut.  A tax relief scheme would help alleviate the sense of grievance of the PAYE sector on that front.</P>
    <P>One of the more significant measures in the Finance Bill is the reduction in the standard rate of VAT which has already taken effect and is helping to reduce inflation considerably.  The Government have been very conscious of keeping the rate of inflation down.  The reduction in VAT will have almost 0.75 per cent impact on the inflation figures and that is to be welcomed.  It will also give a modest boost to consumer spending which will increase activity in the retail sector and help to maintain jobs in the services sector.  It is a beginning.  As Deputy O'Dea pointed out, a 2 per cent reduction in the VAT rate, from 25 to 23 per cent, was quite extensive and indicates the gradual approach that must be adopted if we are to maintain the progress we have made on the financial front.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill represents further confirmation of the success of the Minister and of previous Ministers for Finance in reducing the level of Government borrowing and reducing the current budget deficit to the extent that in two years' time it will be eliminated.  If we cast our minds back and reflect on the despair and gloom over the public finances a short two or three years ago, we will realise that the recovery has been somewhat miraculous.  The Minister deserves credit for this.  He is quite right in insisting that there can be no slippage on the public finances front.  Despite Deputy Ferris and other speakers wanting us to throw money at everything, at schemes which are inefficient and so on, that obviously is not the way to proceed. The overall thrust of the Bill is correct. It is aimed at lower taxation levels and lower VAT rates and creates incentives in the various sectoral areas for job creation which is what we want to release further investment for the country as a whole.  I <Col N="207" /> would asked your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to share the rest of my time with Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank my colleague, Deputy Martin, for sharing his time with me and secondly I thank Deputy Kenny, my colleague on the British-Irish Parliamentary Association, for being so co-operative and courteous.</P>
      <P>The first point that strikes me about this year's Finance Bill is its sheer size. At 130 pages it is the longest Bill that I, or indeed any of my colleagues to whom I have spoken, can remember.  Closer examination of the Bill shows that its size is not in any way misleading as to the range of issues addressed by the Bill.  In fact, since the Bill's publication I have canvassed the views of a range of tax specialists in both legal and accounting circles and every single one of them has been unstinting in his or her praise for the sheer volume of work which has gone into the drafting of the Bill.  Unusually complex matters have been addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has long had a reputation for being a man who did not let the grass grow under his feet.  The manner in which issues such as the change in basis of assessment, thought by many specialists to be too complex a matter to tackle &mdash; a view which the UK authorities have shared for many years &mdash; is a classic example of the willingness of both the Minister for Finance and this Government as a whole to tackle issues which were previously considered too intractable to handle.  Other than well paid advisers, the system of taxation which has applied in this country for the self-employed <Col N="208" /> was understood by few, given its different rules for taxing different types of income and granting allowances, some by reference to income or allowances of the current year, others by reference to the previous year.  This meant that virtually no one knew his tax liability. It could not be computed without reference to at least two income tax returns. I have always thought it outrageous that individual business people should have such great difficulty in determining their actual tax liability.  In addition, compliance costs have escalated considerably, imposing an unfair burden on businesses.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already presided over the introduction of self-assessment for individuals.  Companies are now included under this heading.  This reform is dramatic in terms of the administration of the tax system.  The further progress which is encompassed in this year's Bill, with its dramatic changes regarding the basis of an assessment for individuals, represents more than a sweeping away of the cobwebs attaching to our ramshackle tax system.  To my mind, it suggests that a lot of the old walls on which the cobwebs were comfortably nesting are now being dismantled.</P>
    <P>I am convined that the steely determination to radically alter our tax system and to make it more equitable, as witnessed by the changes in personal taxation and the improvements in social welfare benefits announced in the budget speech, can and will be translated into further reforming measures.</P>
    <P>The skill and difficulty of the tasks currently being tackled can be assessed to some extent, by comparing our position with that of the UK.  For reasons which were largely out of our control, the Irish tax system is very strongly influenced and indeed, uses much of the same legislation, as that in the UK.  Having been an industrialised nation for a considerably longer period than Ireland, and with a much greater technical resource available in terms of tax expert civil servants, the UK has been unable to introduce self-assessment or, indeed, to rationalise their <Col N="209" /> prior year basis of assessment for the self-employed. For many years, we tended to copy UK legislation in the tax field.  We are now leading the way.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to other issues, I would like to comment on the amount of drafting, some of it extremely complex, involved in this Bill.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to feel proud of their efforts in producing what is, in general, a very well crafted product.  Several tax advisers have told me that the Revenue seem to be getting on the ball in no uncertain terms.  Having said that I would welcome an examination of the man hours involved in drafting the Finance Bill and, perhaps, an interdepartmental committee might be set up to report on the delays in drafting legislation for other Departments.  I am aware of the fact that the parliamentary draftsman deals with the workload for those Departments other than Finance and I am concerned that legislation which could have critically damaging effects on the Exchequer finances if even small mistakes were made in drafting is capable of being drafted in such volume at what seems relatively short notice while other measures go through what seems an inordinately long gestation period before they see the light of day.</P>
    <P>The massive amount of work achieved in attempting to rationalise the tax system is indeed deserving of praise but the country is still burdened with excessive bureaucratic procedures and with a tax system which is so complex that if we were faced with the order to create such a vast edifice from scratch nobody would believe it was possible.</P>
    <P>Our educational system, which is proving a substantial bonus in attracting industry, and our natural creativity, have resulted in a highly sophisticated financial services back-up structure. Irish lawyers, accountants, financial analysts, stockbrokers and others who are concerned in the financial services sector have shown themselves to be second to none in the world.  The great skill of many of these people has caused many headaches for the Department of <Col N="210" /> Finance and almost certainly will continue to do so.  The real skills of these individuals are too absorbed in dealing with the essentially artificial burdens imposed upon them by the need to mitigate the effects of what are perceived as high tax rates on the individuals and companies that they advise.  It seems to me to be highly desirable that these individuals' efforts should be directed more towards arranging matters so that the real economic consequences of business deals can be concentrated upon rather than issues such as taxation which are essentially extraneous to the main issues on which these professionals are advising their clients.</P>
    <P>The Government have not yet tapped the large reservoir of resources potentially available to them through the financial services sector.  Lawyers, accountants, all those directly involved in the financial markets and others working in the financial services sector are the individuals dealing with many of the complexities imposed on business by the tax system.  While an understandable degree of caution must govern the dealings of Government Departments with these individuals and their firms, a more open approach could be adopted.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Finance Bill specifically, I welcome it as a positive package and proactive step on the part of the Minister to create an environment conducive to real investment, economic growth and employment creation.  I also welcome the additional incremental steps taken by the Minister in the area of personal taxation reform.</P>
    <P>But tonight I would like to focus on two important aspects of Government policy, the encouragement of investment in industry and ultimately jobs and the changes made in relation to the administration of the tax system.</P>
    <P>In relation to these aspects of Government policy I would like to highlight, in particular, the anti-abuse adjustments made to the business expansion scheme which was carried in the Finance Bill. One of the major characteristics of an expanding economy is a buoyant source <Col N="211" /> of venture capital available to entrepreneurs in the development of new business ideas.  Unfortunately in Ireland there has been no real tradition of risk capital being made available for entrepreneurial ideas where the risks may be higher but which offer the individual or institutional investor a correspondingly higher return on their investment.</P>
    <P>I would have to concede that the application of Government industrial policy through the IDA and NADCORP has gone some considerable way towards taking up the slack in this areas, but the performance of the private sector has left a lot to be desired.  Admittedly many financial institutions have now moved into the risk capital area operating specialist venture capital designations, but by applying strict lending criteria they have not made it any easier for the budding entrepreneur who because of his or her age, background or lack of a track record may be unable to match these rigid criteria.</P>
    <P>In other economies where a stronger tradition of venture capital exists the individual would be able to tap into a non-institutional source of start-up funds in return for an equity stake.  The business expansion scheme was established as a tax efficient vehicle for encouraging risk capital.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the operation of the scheme since its inception has led to considerable abuses, and in many ways has drifted away from the spirit of the actual scheme itself.  The introduction of those measures banning all guarantees and the abolition of the 'put' option in relation to the purchase of BES, shares is a signifiant step in the restoration of the spirit of the scheme itself.</P>
    <P>These changes will lead to a significant reduction in the amount of money flowing into designated funds or individual ventures, but any further investments on the part of individual investors will surely be genuine risk capital and eliminate competition for investment capital between guaranteed `ventures' and high risk ventures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> It may also encourage individual investors availing of the tax breaks under the scheme to consider ventures which up to now may have been marginalised or excluded completely by the established financial institutions of State agencies operating in the area, because of the inherent risks involved in the project.</P>
    <P>I refer in particular to the film industry and community-based enterprises who by and large have had to operate outside the established financial world.  The exclusion of 'bogus' ventures will provide promoters of projects in these areas with much more scope for raising both seed and development capital.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to many of the contributions on this 1990 Finance Bill during the past two weeks.  I am not sure that the Minister for Finance or, indeed, the parliamentary draftsman and the officials in the Department of Finance have any real interest in listening to the advice or comments made by Deputies so far as they impact upon what is contained in this Bill.  I do not believe for an instant that the 1990 Finance Bill, was drafted in the context of the Department of Finance and this Government, which was formed as a temporary arrangement and I do not think they have a clear vision of where our country is heading.  We are in the midst of our Presidency of the EC.  It is obvious that the Finance Bill does not contain any major controversial issue. With the Government in exile, globe trotting and attempting to solve everybody's problems but our own it makes common sense that there should not be a series of controversial political issues in this Bill. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, drafted the Bill carefully and gave out certain concessions not only on a countrywide basis but also presumably on the basis of holding certain elements within his own party very close to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We speak on the Bill at a time of unprecedented historic movement throughout Europe.  We are all very grateful for and pleased with many developments, but I am not quite sure that there is a vision or <Col N="213" /> work and progress towards where all the consequences of this kind of movement will place this country in the next decade, because we will be further away from the centre of activity.  Our geographical position on the fringe of Europe will be even more isolated than heretofore.  This will call for unprecedented political co-operation and activity on this island if the next generation are to make an impact and have the facilities and the ability to eke out a living here.  The NESC report published recently indicated that, for instance, Ireland has the lowest population density, the highest birth rate, the highest rate of natural population increase, the only significant rate of emigration, the highest dependency ratio and the second highest unemployment ratio in the EC.  Where or in what areas and with what impact does this Finance Bill, 1990 reach out to address those fundamental problems which have both social and human impact?  Where are the answers in so far as this temporary little arrangement is concerned?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some specifics and generalities in this Bill in the few minutes available to me.  In his budget contribution the Minister for Finance indicated that VAT increases in ESB and telephone charges would be abolished by both organisations.  He has not spelt out the mechanism or facility by which this is to happen.  If an individual, a company or an organisation are properly registered that individual or company can legitimately claim back VAT expenses and charges in respect of ESB, telephone, telex and fax charges at any rate, but if the person concerned is an ordinary member of the public who consumes electricity and has telephone charges, where in this Bill is the mechanism spelt out by which both Telecom Éireann and the ESB are to absorb the increased charges referred to in terms of VAT?  If there is no such mechanism this will undoubtedly lead to an inflationary trend and will be a retrograde step economically.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Taoiseach's comments this week that the British Prime Minister is working diligently towards the completion of the Internal Market.  The <Col N="214" /> Internal Market will remove all the tariff barriers we have at present, physical, fiscal and technical.  How far does this Finance Bill reach out to address those fundamental changes?  The Irish Insurance Federation, for instance, have recently circulated all Deputies with details of the reduction in the life assurance premium relief and they make the point that the reduction in savings in a personal sense has contributed in no small way to the decline and the economic difficulties in which our neighbour across the water now finds herself.  On one aspect of that, many of our major life assurance companies have adopted a policy of blanket selling mainly useless insurance policies to a great number of people.  There seems to be an internal policy with some of these insurance companies to sign on new sellers of insurance on a very frequent basis.  This indicates to me that these policies are being sold by way of personal contact in a very small circle and that when one seller has reached his or her quota a new seller is brought in to further the extent of personal contact in this regard.  This will have a serious effect with insurance brokers inside a number of years.  High commission is now paid on these short term policies, but they are in the main useless. People will find after a period of years that they are not what they wanted so the integrity, to a degree, of some of these insurance companies is called into question. I would like to think that matter would be addressed.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have addressed the issue of the depopulation of rural Ireland and the effect our having no formal land policy in operation is going to have.  The Land Commission, set up 70 odd years ago, had a tremendous impact in one way or another on rural Ireland.  There was not a village that was not affected to some degree by the impact of the commission. One recalls the stories, which are legion, of, in particular, Fianna Fáil Ministers for Lands dividing estates in the quiet of the local cumann meeting, the ashes on the hearth, and if the cumann secretary had not been given the field he wanted they could start all over again.  That is <Col N="215" /> now totally reversed and there is no restriction whatsoever either on the purchase of land &mdash; I understand that is the position legally within the context of the EC &mdash; or upon its fragmentation.  There used to be strict adherence to consolidation of land and the necessity to have it registered under one folio number.  This has now gone out the window and one could divide one's holding of land into ten separate and fragmented pieces.  The ICMSA produced a document recently which indicated that 40,000 people from farms of under 30 acres left the land in the past 15 years. They reckon that inside the next decade that size of farm unit, uneconomic as it is, will disappear from the face of rural Ireland entirely.  What, then, is to happen to that ground?  Is it being bought up by multi-national corporations or by a new form of landlord or is it being taken by agencies for plantation purposes or whatever? Where did these 40,000 people go? Are they now PAYE workers?  Are they on FÁS schemes?  Are they on SES? Have they in some cases taken the long, winding road to cardboard city across the water, as some unfortunately have?  This Bill in the context of impact on the agricultural economy goes no way to address this most serious social problem.</P>
    <P>The recent Land Commission High Court case relating to commonage division will also have an impact both on the visual amenities available to people where commonage exists and on the type and quality of usage of that land in the times ahead.  I would like to think that careful consideration will be given to that development.  While I support it certain difficulties may arise in terms of access for the public, if it goes that far.</P>
    <P>In terms of industrial achievement and the creation of jobs, the Bill is no different than any other Finance Bill.  It has tinkered with the mechanisms and incentives available for individuals and organisations. There has been an extension of the urban renewal scheme to 1993 and an extension of the corporation tax benefit. The theme of the IMI conference in Killarney <Col N="216" /> was that, irrespective of one's geographical location and provided there was proper planning, the right facilities were made available and that people had the necessary motivation, Irish industry in the next decade will be capable of meeting the challenge of the new Europe and of the Americans and the South-East Asian region.</P>
    <P>The statistics issued in the last 12 months indicate how Fianna Fáil in particular judged the mentality of the Irish people.  When we were in Government some years ago there were howls of indignation on the publication of the labour statistics each month.  Crocodile tears were shed in abundance about the thousands who were emigrating.  Our young people are still emigrating and yet Ministers tell us that the rate of unemployment and emigration has slowed down and they tell us that as a consequence the number of jobs created is on the increase.  It appears that everything in the garden is rosy while Fianna Fáil's temporary arrangement continues.</P>
    <P>There has been a drop in the number of children per family and graduates from our third level institutions are anxious to travel abroad.  The consequences of involuntary emigration, particularly from centres that did not suffer from emigration, are of monumental proportions. The Finance Bill does not create the proper incentives or provide the motivation for companies and individuals to try to stem the flow of emigration.  In my native county in 1980, 6,500 people were involved in the manufacturing industry and in 1990 that number had reduced to 5,000.  What does that say for the Finance Bills produced by the many Governments in the last ten years?  Areas outside the eastern pale are no longer privileged. They do not receive any extra grants to establish industries.  They do not receive any assistance to help them meet the additional transport charges they must pay.  The IDA are empowered to give extra grants to firms which set up business in the far west but that is not being done. As a consequence firms anxious to establish in Ireland drift towards the areas with a higher density of population and closer <Col N="217" /> to mainline markets.  That has had a devastating economic effect on small villages and townlands in the west.  Our people are leaving and we cannot encourage them to stay.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate Members referred to housing grants.  In this context I should like to refer to people who are being discriminated against by the Government.  If my memory serves me correctly, in January 1987 all applicants who had applied for reconstruction grants were notified of the Department's approval in principle of the work and were instructed to go ahead and spend their money.  They were told that if the work complied with specifications the grant would be paid in due course.  On a change of Government the new Cabinet ended that scheme but many of those who had spent their money did not receive the grant.  The reason was that inspectors of the Department did not have sufficient time to inspect the work done.  Several hundred genuine applicants have completed the work.  It would be a humane gesture for the Minister to consider those applications and, if the work is up to standard, to pay the grant.  To date we have not seen much evidence of a caring Government, although they try to project that image.</P>
    <P>Like other rural Deputies I have been inundated with representations from farmers who have waited 12 months for payments to be made under the headage scheme.  I fail to understand why if some years ago a double headage payment could be made it cannot be repeated now. The mechanics of decentralisation to Cavan and the tapping in to the computers of the newly extended disadvantaged areas have delayed those payments.  This has gone beyond a joke. There are many people on extended credit from co-ops, hardware shops and so on, who should have been paid their grant six months ago.  It appears that the Department officials are unable to accept telephone calls from those applicants or their representatives.</P>
    <P>Where do all the answers lie, according to those involved in the temporary <Col N="218" /> arrangement in Government?  According to them our future lies in the promotion of the tourist industry.  It is their view that if we succeed in bringing more tourists to Ireland everything will be grand.  They tell us that we have clean air, blue skies, that we will plug the ozone hole, improve our roads and clear away the litter but we find that if we are to succeed in doubling tourist figures it will have to be done in the off-season.  We do not have the necessary accommodation to cater for more tourists in the high season.  Some people tell us that we are doing fine as far as tourism is concerned, that we are ahead of all targets and they wonder why more money is being spent trying to attract tourists.  In my view we must do something urgently about car hire charges, particularly for those who take short breaks in Ireland of one week or ten days. For most people the cost of car hire is prohibitive.  Coach hire expenses are exorbitant and those operators cannot compete with their counterparts from across the water.  Prices must be kept reasonable.  It should be remembered that when an entrepreneur or a person coming back from a foreign country wishes to spend, say £5 million, if he builds a hotel in Dublin he can fill it on the night it opens but if he builds it on the west coast it will take many years before he even goes some way towards recovering his outlay.  There is a serious division between east and west in relation to population density, the method of funding and the advantages of coming over here.</P>
    <P>We are still awaiting decisions on Structural Funds and, if tourism is to be a major factor in our economic development over the next decade, these funds should be pumped into worthwhile projects. I know that decisions will be made in this area in the near future.</P>
    <P>There should be a more open debate on the environment and natural resources. The Government say that we must develop our natural resources, mining and mineral rights, fish farming and so on.  However, they also said that we must <Col N="219" /> protect our environment to attract tourists. There must be a common denominator in that debate, whereby the development of natural resources can take place without undue interference with or disruption of the environment. People become quite emotional about this subject when they do not understand or do not have the full facts available regarding the development of natural resources.  I can speak from the first hand information in regard to mining issues on the west coast.  We will be watching the Minister's decisions very closely in so far as the issue of mining leases is concerned, if and when an environmental impact analysis has been assessed and agreed by his Department.  The Valoren project in terms of wind energy development should be taken to a new plane and although the ESB were very much opposed to this over the years there is now a project, referred to by the Minister for Energy quite recently, which is a forerunner of what may well develop over the next decade.  I should like to think that that programme would be given priority in regard to incentives.</P>
    <P>I do not want to echo the words written by Dr. Eoin McKernan in an article some time ago when he said &ldquo;Anois is uaigneach Eire&rdquo;, &ldquo;now is Ireland desolate&rdquo;. I would like to think that every manager who leaves this country on business, and indeed every person who leaves Ireland, would be an ambassador for the good points of this country.  Think-tanks should be set up, if necessary, by those competent in business to portray our advantages so that those who work in inferior environments in other countries would have the opportunity to come here to sample what we have on offer.</P>

      <P>The budget was a great disappointment to the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, in that it did very little for the environment in terms of making funds available for essential improvements. As far as fiscal incentives were concerned, the only item of relevance was a proposal to increase the rate of VAT on electricity from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Green Party favour a system of taxation based on taxing resources such as energy and land rather than a tax on income and indirect taxation such as VAT.  Pending the adoption of this much more rational method of taxation we are stuck with the present system of income tax and PAYE.  Bearing in mind that income tax is fundamentally flawed, nevertheless considerable improvements could be made therein to render it more equitable, rational and more evenly distributed. There are still far too many tax breaks for the corporate sector and the large private investor.  In order to further widen the tax base I should like to see the end of section 23 relief on investments in residential housing.</P>
      <P>The business expansion scheme is clearly being abused in many ways and should end.  The continuing very nominal taxation of unit-linked insurance funds should also be ended.  While I welcome the reduction in personal taxation rates, the burden of PAYE and PRSI on employees is still extremely severe.  In particular the exemption limits, while they have been raised, are simply too low.  Apart from anything else, there would be a considerable saving in administration if the money spent on reducing the rates was spent instead on increasing exemption limits to &mdash; at the very minimum &mdash; £4,000 for a single person and £8,000 for a married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in the basis of assessment for business profits, interest and rents require very careful consideration to ensure that small businesses and family farms are treated equitably.  There is no <Col N="221" /> longer any excuse for differentiating between wage and salary earners on the one hand and business, professional people and farmers on the other regarding PAYE and PRSI allowances, especially now that PRSI is levied on non-employees. Accordingly, I contend that an equitable PAYE-PRSI allowance should be granted to business and professional people and farmers.</P>
    <P>The question of mortgage interest relief and relief for insurance premiums also needs to be looked at.  Instead of restricting the amount of relief which can be claimed, as was the case, thus treating high and low income earners equally, the 100 per cent mortgage interest relief and 50 per cent of life assurance relief should be restored.  However, that relief should only be given at the standard rate of tax which would resolve the problem of high income groups using it as a scheme for tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>Considerable disquiet has been expressed about allowing tax relief on VHI premiums.  It is an outrage that the general taxpayer has been subsidising the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital.  Tax relief should be limited to the appropriate premium on plan A, that is the cost of maintaining a patient in a public hospital.  Additional cover would, of course, be at the discretion of the insured but should not be allowed for tax.</P>
    <P>There is a continuing failure to provide support for the family through adequate payments of child benefits and/or children's allowances for tax purposes.  In view of the totally inadequate child benefit, I recommend the reintroduction of children's allowances at, let us say, £300 per child.  I would, nevertheless, restrict relief to the standard rate only.</P>
    <P>In this era of free trade it is essential that VAT rates should be reduced in order to safeguard traders, especially in Border areas.  In view of the many shortcomings in the Finance Bill I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>Many difficulties face this country and one of the most serious, which has put this country into a straitjacket, is our national debt, £25 billion. <Col N="222" /> This debt will not go away and indeed it will affect our budgeting for many years to come.</P>
      <P>We witnessed our country on the verge of bankruptcy in the early and mid-eighties when there was no control on our public finances. Since Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1987 we have witnessed courageous government, ability, imagination and flair.  Putting the national interest of this great republic first, controlling inflation and public expenditure and creating a confident climate for sustained economic growth, we can develop a society which offers a good quality of life to all our citizens. To achieve this the policies and fiscal management of the Government which took office in 1987 must continue.  We need to be clear on the importance of the Finance Bill and its contents.  This Bill will implement the provisions of the budget which, given our financial position, has been recognised as a good budget.  This Bill shows the Government are continuing their endeavours to get the finances of our State right, to get out of the strait jacket we were in and to balance our expenditure with our receipts.  I want to refer to the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government of 1986.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were last debating the Bill I suggested that it was a little like The Workers' Party, superficially attractive, but fundamentally unacceptable on closer inspection.  The Bill, I suggested, was a popular but shallow attempt to address a serious problem; again a little bit like The Workers' Party &mdash; a populous party but quite fundamentally flawed.  I said that the Bill had <Col N="223" /> the potential to do more harm than good and attempted to do too much without really addressing any issue.  The social welfare elements in the Bill should be more appropriately dealt with in social welfare legislation.  As I pointed out, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, had already initiated the procedure to bring before this House a Bill which would bring about fundamental changes in labour law so far as it affects the plight of part-time workers.</P>
      <P>I said also that I regarded the protection of part-time workers in law as a topic requiring very serious consideration at this stage.  I acknowledged that there was a growing trend in part-time and atypical work.  Amidst a plethora of helpful interruptions, I referred to latest survey figures in this regard.  This survey shows that 72,000 people are involved in regular part-time work and 15,000 plus are engaged in part-time or atypical work on an irregular basis; 50,000 of those 72,000 people are women and in excess of 60 per cent &mdash; probably 62 per cent &mdash; of the women engaged in part-time employment are married.</P>
      <P>The reason I gave those statistics was to point out that in many cases part-time work is not enforced and many people choose part-time work because it suits their domestic arrangements or needs.  I accept that in other cases part-time work is enforced and very often young people and women who want to get full-time work cannot get it.  Notwithstanding that, we have to bear in mind that part-time work is frequently a desired mode.  I make this point because I believe it is worth keeping it in front of us when we discuss this issue.</P>
      <P>When we are casting legislation in this area we must be careful to ensure that what we are proposing will be in no way counterproductive.  We should at no time produce legislation which will interfere with the work pattern a worker finds attractive for whatever reasons.  This is not the aim of the Bill before us but it could potentially have that impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognising the need to approach this problem in a constructive way and <Col N="224" /> the vital need to stamp out exploitation without damaging the interests of the part-time workers, the Minister for Labour has initiated a series of steps which I believe are the most logical approach to the problem.  Twelve months ago he held a seminar on this issue which involved the Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Minister in his speech on this Bill stressed that his aim, through consensus and consultation, was to bring before this House in the very near future legislation to which we could all subscribe. The Workers' Party Bill is worthy of discussion and I am glad they have put it on the agenda but lest they claim credit for doing anything, I want to point out that the Minister for Labour was there before them, he will be there after them and he will produce&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I welcome the introduction of this Bill by The Workers' Party which deals with an issue that has been ignored for too long. Even though this Bill will not be implemented into law I take very seriously, as I am sure we all do, the commitment given by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, that he has gone a long way in drafting legislation in this area.  I believe all of us in this House including the Minister, will be very disappointed if this legislation is not <Col N="225" /> introduced this session.  The Minister said that a Bill dealing with part-time workers would be introduced after the Bill on industrial relations.  Both Bills are interlinked and deal not only with the protection of workers but recognise the value of workers and the contribution they make to their place of work, industry and society as a whole.  I hope these two long awaited Bills will be introduced and enacted before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should be resuming this debate on May Day which celebrates the setting up of protections and organisations to help prevent the exploitation of workers.  Nobody in this House can deny that legislation on the protection of part-time workers is long overdue.  The Minister, in his introductory remarks, and Deputy Rabbitte gave the numbers of workers involved in part-time employment.  Deputy Rabbitte particularly recited to our horror what many of us suspected when he quoted some of the contracts drawn up under which contract and part-time workers had to sign and adapt even to obtain the badly-paid totally unprotected work they were offered in accordance with such contracts.  It would seem to have been a reflection of Victorian times, of times perhaps two centuries ago, when that was the type of contract that could be demanded of part-time workers by their employers.  As a Legislature we have been very lax in that only now are we endeavouring to bring some kind of order or introduce some structure, some type of legal protection for those workers so long exploited.</P>
      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by other speakers on both sides of the House.  Like most other things in life, there is a negative and positive side to this matter also.  Many of us recognise that for many years, part-time work, particularly as of now &mdash; is a necessity, comprises the only type of work in which some people are allowed engage because it is the only type available to them or, as in the case of women, is the only type their other demands allow.  That is the negative side to which I will revert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the positive side &mdash; and I should <Col N="226" /> like to believe that we could build on this as constituting the most positive aspect of the future, changing structures of work &mdash; the whole concept of work as we knew it, that is long-term, life-long, pensionable, the concept of a person being tied into one job for the sake of security alone, has become redundant in every sense of the word.  Tragically it has become redundant in practical terms in relation to male bread winners and a high proportion of women as well who, though society did not recognise the fact, were main or comparable bread winners, being equal contributors to the family income.</P>
    <P>Because traditional industry has been overtaken by technology, because of the flexibility employees and some employers now prefer within the workplace, part-time work has become a reality, not merely to be perceived as some type of addition or tag to work &mdash; with a capital &ldquo;W&rdquo;&mdash; but one that carries its rightful status and/or value, particularly when we talk about affording it quality and value which may be more acceptable than the type of work that tied people down from youth to old age without any opportunity of cessation.  The whole of the work ethic as we knew it, particularly with regard to male bread winners was not Utopian and extracted a huge price.  The fact that men die earlier than women may not be due to any biological or evolutionary trait. Rather I believe it to have been attributable to the exacting, killing demands made of males in the past, in or out of work.</P>
    <P>We must re-examine what was formerly known as the work ethic, its values but, more importantly, its disadvantages. In looking positively at part-time work we see from the figures available to me and to other Members, that not alone is it a reality of life and will continue to increase according to projections but that from a human, contributory quality of life aspect, it may well constitute the type of work in which all of us, men and women, should engage in the future.  One of the difficulties in considering this matter is that work has been defined as constituting only that that reaps financial reward, that all the informal, unpaid, <Col N="227" /> community, contributory and voluntary work, unfortunately, does not have an equivalent value.  It would be my hope that, in our changing perceptions and definitions of work, we might at long last put a value or status on what is as of now the informal, contributory or voluntary work comprising far more in terms of society, more time, hours and sometimes more sacrifice than what is called formal work, the paid, high status-type work.</P>
    <P>We must remember that that high status value work gave rise to demarcations, discrimination, divisions and dislocation of people.  Work was not built around or for people; people had to adapt to it.  Therefore, in looking positively at the whole concept of work in the future, particularly part-time work &mdash; which is why this debate is so very important &mdash; we must recognise that the hours, months, years, length and value of work will be dramatically redefined and changed.  I say that first because we represent a generation that has suffered vast unemployment, huge changes in the concept of what constitutes a decent, secure job but, more than anything else, the overwhelming changes wrought by technology which have reduced to such an amazing degree the hours and days of repetitive, conveyor belt-type work in which many people were engaged.  Let us hope we can control that technology which is overwhelming us.</P>
    <P>Apart from the protections and values built into the provisions of this Bill it would be my hope that they would also take account of the fact that part-time work may well constitute the work of the future.  Technology has led to the huge problem at present being experienced of vast numbers of people being made redundant, being relieved of jobs which formerly formed the foundation of their lives, converting them to people who &mdash; within the old definition of work &mdash; cannot look forward to any job within their lifetime.  Indeed there have been many people who gave up their jobs, such as women who returned to the home who have not a hope of being re-employed, <Col N="228" /> particularly in Irish terms, unless we redistribute work, leading to the leisure, choices and control we would have over our lives if we distributed what may now be described as part-time work.  Rather than striving to have one bread winner, one income-earner with a whole family unit dependent on him or her &mdash; and all the pressures brought to bear on that person &mdash; we should strive to bring about a household income with a number of people employed, both parents and, as the children grew older, in part-time, flexible work yielding an income that would maintain that household in dignity, affording them a standard of living above that which one income-earner could guarantee.</P>
    <P>I must stress the importance of distributing such work, employing the talents, training and investment that the State makes in everybody in the course of their early education, and training thereafter. It is the most incredible wastage that we invest, as is right, such a large amount of our budget in training our young people, enabling them to work and be financially independent, and then, because of the ruthless, unfair and unjust way in which we distribute and divide work at present, we do not afford those people the same opportunity of work as others.  The real waste occurs at national level, that we do not devise, define and structure our work to allow those, at present excluded from work opportunity, to reap a proportion of that work by redefining what constitutes part-time, flexible work.  Unfortunately, up to now, to the detriment of those who have taken career breaks, opted for job sharing or other part-time work, it has not been rewarded or encouraged in the way I and others would like.  In fact, there is a price to be paid.  I hope the discussion on this Bill introduced by The Workers' Party and on the Bill to be introduced by the Minister this session, will look at this matter in a wider context.  Part-time work must be seen as an exciting, innovative and original way of distributing work more fairly.</P>
    <P>I always wish to stress the positive side first and have decided that that is my vision of the future.  Now I must get back <Col N="229" /> to reality.  The issue being tackled in this Bill, and the type of work I have been just speaking about unfortunately, is neither encouraged nor rewarded.  Given the increase in part-time work with its advantages for employers it is a scandal that it has not been revalued but rather it has been used in an attempt to keep people, mainly women, in positions where they can be exploited, blackmailed and denied the requisite number of hours work required to receive the most basic entitlements in any civilized country, such as holiday pay, sick pay, maternity leave and the right to a contract which would guarantee them the right to return to work if for some reason they have to leave.  These people are denied these entitlements provided under employment legislation.  These entitlements were hard won and ought to be given to those who give their time and talents.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out time and again, the large number of women in part-time employment do not like being exploited, excluded, marginalised or deprived of basic rights, but society demanded that this would be the only type of work available to them.  I have heard Members, particularly on the other side, say during this debate that part-time work suits women.  Let me point out that part-time work does not suit women any more than it suits men but as in so many other areas, it is the only type of work available to them.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that the discussion on this Bill seems to accept that we must tailor it to meet the needs of women. That amounts to discrimination.  Unless we make all Members aware when speaking about part-time work that we are talking about work suitable for both men and women it will continue to be used as a <i>cul de sac</i> in which women will be trapped.</P>
    <P>Why does part-time work suit women? Given what has been said by Members and the desperate situations outlined by Deputy Rabbitte and the Minister, Deputy Ahern, why should anyone want to take up part-time work?  It seems part-time workers need this Bill and all the other legislation and protections we can <Col N="230" /> give them.  That that argument should be made at all is an indication of the kind of work many people feel women deserve. When talking about part-time work we as legislators must stress that it equally suits men.  One of the problems we face is that it seems to be the only type of work open to women because of the poor standards that obtain.  Instead of being seen as valuable work which allows people to follow other pursuits it is recognised as an area where people are exploited.  That is what this Bill and other legislation must address and attempt to change.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the other legislation which must be taken with this Bill will not be introduced this session but there is no point talking about equality of opportunity to enable men and women to make choices between part-time work, job sharing and all other types of work, unless we decide to introduce legislation to provide child care facilities.  Not alone are we denying women the resources necessary to provide child care facilities, but there is a responsibility on us, as legislators, to insist that child care facilities be provided in places of employment. As long as we see the provision of child care facilities as somebody else's responsibility and say part-time work suits women, we will continue to tell women that it is their responsibility to do this work.  In addition to protecting part-time workers we must ensure that those who wish to work other than part-time, men and women but particularly women, have the opportunity to do so.  We must ensure also that the legislation we enact is attractive and positive enough to encourage men, as parents, to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the philosophy of part-time work and what this Bill, which is very welcome, must take into consideration. I will keep the more definite recommendations and amendments in regard to part-time work until Committee Stage.  I am sorry that this Bill is not leading immediately to a Committee Stage where we could do that.  We all realise that this legislation is overdue if <Col N="231" /> we are to even talk about equality of opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that what Deputy Rabbitte said about the scandalous lack of protection and treatment of contract workers will bring home to people who heard it that not alone does that affect part-time workers, because of the low value given to their work and the lack of protection, but that it has a far deeper psychological effect because they are trapped in this type of work at the behest of employers who are ripping them off.  Is it any wonder that many workers in this country have a low self-esteem when the only work they are allowed to have is work where they are exploited, badly paid and totally unprotected? Those workers who have had the courage to stand up and say that they are not taking this any longer have been told that a bus will go out to a disadvantaged area to collect another group of women or young people who will come in and gladly do the job.  We, as legislators, should not allow employers to work at that level.  We cannot claim to have any dignity or status or justice in this State as long as we, as legislators, allow that kind of exploitation to the extent that the blackmail is that, if they are not willing to work in such conditions with all the low self-esteem and all the exploitation and hard work that takes, there are many more out there who will.  If we allow this we are failing.  This legislation is most urgent to make people believe that when we talk of work and the value of work that we are granting all our workers the same rights that people have died trying to achieve.  We quote figures in Europe to show the increasing number of part-time workers we have.  We should be ashamed to acknowledge the increasing number of part-time workers we have at European level until we ensure that we have legislation with protections built in to give those workers what they deserve, particularly if we see part-time working as a positive aspect and part and parcel of employment for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the <Col N="232" /> House I propose to share my time with Deputies Callely and Martin.</P>
      <P>Part-time work is a growing feature of employment in Ireland.  The proportion of all regular jobs which are part-time more than doubled to 7.8 per cent between 1979 and 1988, and is continuing to increase, especially in the service industries.  The total number of regular part-time workers was 72,000 in 1988.</P>
      <P>Married women and young people constitute a high and increasing proportion of those who work part-time.  Many married women choose part-time work for family reasons.  It is important that this option be available to them and that they do not lose out in the social security and labour protection available to workers generally. For many young single people part-time work is becoming the norm as employers, particularly in the service industries, extend this form of employment.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that some employers may take on staff on a part-time basis in order to avoid the legal and financial responsibilities of employing full-time staff and paying full PRSI contributions. While part-time work may suit some employees particularly well and facilitate business, I am not prepared to accept a situation in which the social welfare system is used by unscrupulous employers to exploit vulnerable workers.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment in our Programme for Government, I have already begun a review of the insurability of part-time workers.  I have also asked the National Pensions Board to report to me on the complex question of pension cover for part-time workers.  I expect the results of these reviews by late summer. I will then prepare comprehensive proposals for the social protection of part-time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill takes no account of the complexity of the issues involved in providing social and labour protection for part-time employees.  It is too simplistic. It proposes no minimum criteria.  It gives the same protection to someone working an occassional few hours here and there as it does to a regular part-time worker, <Col N="233" /> who may be dependent on these earnings. Furthermore, changing the definition of employment as proposed in this Bill would remove entirely the present definition (18 hours) while failing to replace it with any hourly or financial minimum.  This would have major &ldquo;knock-on&rdquo; implications for social insurance and for the workforce as a whole.  These critical issues are not dealt with at all in this Bill.  They will be dealt with comprehensively in the Government's proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Social Welfare I have been conscious for some time of the growth in part-time employment and the need to ensure adequate protection for part-time workers both in labour law and in the social welfare code. A study undertaken last year for the National Pensions Board showed that, although the proportion of workers who are part-time in Ireland is low by international standards &mdash; in 1987, 6.2 per cent of Irish workers were in part-time employment compared to 12 per cent in the European Community generally &mdash; this form of work has been growing steadily in recent years.  If one compares Ireland with other countries the number is quite low.  That form of working has developed much more rapidly in other countries.  This is the trend we can expect and it is particularly important that we provide the protection that is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant change has been the increase in the number of regular part-time workers as distinct from occasional part-time workers.  The proportion of all regular jobs which were part-time almost doubled from 3.2 per cent in 1979 to 6 per cent in 1987 and 7.8 per cent in 1988.  Over the same period, the number of people in occasional part-time employment fell by 42 per cent. This increase in regular part-time work indicates a greater permanence of this type of work as employers substitute regular for seasonal and occasional employment. For example, in &ldquo;commerce and <Col N="234" /> professional services&rdquo; the number of seasonal part-time workers declined from 6,700 to 5,200 between 1979 and 1987 while regular part-timers increased from 12,400 to 32,600 over the same period.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the growth in part-time employment.  The expansion of the services sector, where part-time working is prevalent, is a major factor.  Part-time work also offers flexibility for both employers and employees. Many women employees, in particular, welcome the opportunity to take up part-time work.  Labour Force Survey data indicate that two-thirds of women part-time workers voluntarily chose this form of work.  The main reason given was family commitments.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to what Deputy Barnes has said in this regard.  I take it that other Deputies were referring also to the reality that exists as indicated in the labour force survey in which women themselves gave family commitments as the main reason they needed or wanted that type of work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>They had no choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, it may have been all that was open to them but they needed that form of employment. However, this does not necessarily mean that men will not need this form of employment so in terms of the future we have to think in this respect of both men and women.  I agree that the measures must provide for both men and women. Both must have options and that will be the situation in future.  I presume that the Deputies were looking at the same data, the same labour force survey, in which that was the situation.  This is indicative of future trends, that more people will want those kinds of choices, atypical types of work and not just part-time or regular part-time work and they will have to be provided for.  It is likely that part-time work will continue to grow, as the factors stimulating it, such as the growth in the services and the increased participation of women in the labour force are likely to continue in the short to medium term.  Given the likely growth of <Col N="235" /> this form of employment we must consider how we, as legislators, can best protect the position of these employees. It is our duty to provide safeguards to prevent the exploitation of part-time employees by unscrupulous employers. At the same time, we need to ensure that opportunities for increased part-time work, valued by both employees and employers, are not choked off by over-regulation. Finding the correct balance between these two objectives is not an easy task.  It requires careful consideration to tease out the complex issues involved.  Deputy Barnes has indicated some of the other elements that need to be taken into account: the family, the future roles of both men and women in relation to the family and their needs will have to be considered.  Perhaps I can best illustrate the complex problems involved in protecting part-time workers by referring to some of the difficulties which arise in relation to social insurance cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, people working fewer than 18 hours per week are excluded from full social insurance unless they are mainly dependent on these earnings.  This is because social insurance benefits, such as unemployment and disability benefit, are designed to replace the income of people who would otherwise be in employment but for these contingencies.  Some part-time workers work for very few hours, and the extension of cover for benefits to such employees on the same basis as full-time employees would be difficult to justify. Furthermore, in some cases, the contributions paid would be minimal and the cost to the social insurance fund would be substantial.  So, some threshold for entry into insurance must be preserved. I am at present examining the possibility of changing the existing criteria for insurability in order to give better protection to part-time workers while, at the same time, ensuring that benefits are based on a reasonable level of contributions.  This might be done by reducing the 18 hours required, or by moving away from an &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; criterion towards a different system, perhaps one based on earnings, or on a combination of both.  There <Col N="236" /> are various possibilities but they have huge implications on social insurance. The latter would involve a major policy change in the system and needs careful examination.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the insurance of part-time workers I am conscious that such insurance involves paying contributions as well as getting benefits.  If social insurance is extended to all, some employees, particularly those whose work is of an occasional nature, might find themselves paying full PRSI contributions but getting little or no benefit.</P>
    <P>All of these factors, as well as other technical anomalies, are being studied as part of my review of the insurance of part-time workers.  In addition, I have specifically asked the National Pensions Board to examine the question of pension entitlements of part-time workers.  I expect that they will report by the end of the summer and I look forward to receiving their advice.</P>
    <P>While the insurability of part-time workers is a major issue, it is not the only area where the social welfare system has an impact on part-time work.  I would now like to turn to some of the other areas.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the particular value of part-time work as a stepping stone from unemployment to full-time work. I have taken steps to ensure that the unemployment payments system facilitates this process, by introducing the part-time job incentive scheme.  This scheme allows certain long-term unemployed people to take up a part-time job and receive a special income supplement. This income supplement, £30 per week for a single person and £50 for a married person with an adult dependant, is not affected by earnings from the part-time job.  Furthermore, people on the scheme can get credited PRSI contributions in order to preserve their future entitlement to benefits.</P>
    <P>During recent debates in this House, Deputies referred to the fact that people who have earnings of more than £50 per week are not regarded as adult dependants for the purpose of their spouse's social welfare payments.  Part-time <Col N="237" /> workers, specially married women who work part-time, are particularly affected by this ruling.  I am pleased to say that I have raised this limit to £55, with effect from 1 June.  I know from representations made to me that this will improve the position of low paid and part-time workers, who can now receive modest wage increases without the loss of social welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>These measures to help part-time workers are just a beginning.  Much remains to be done.  I will be bringing forward proposals in relation to social insurance when my review is complete. In relation to labour legislation, my colleague, the Minister for Labour, has already indicated his intention to bring forward proposals later this year.  Complex problems need careful study before lasting solutions are achieved.  I urge the House, therefore, to await the detailed and balanced package which the Government will be presenting later, rather than adopting the more simplistic approach of the Bill now before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate with regard to part-time workers.  No one doubts that there is a need for legislation in this area, as the previous speaker across the floor has indicated.  We as legislators should provide that legislation to protect part-time workers, especially in the light of the various figures and reports of growth in the part-time workforce.  There has been an increase of 83 per cent in the number of regular part-time workers, from 39,400 in 1977 to 72,000 in 1988. One would question why there has been such a large increase in the part-time workforce.  In the years 1977 to 1987, <Col N="238" /> economic growth had its own consequences on employment and the type of employment that was available, whether full, part-time or casual.  At present there are over 200,000 people on the live register, many of whom would opt for part-time work if it was available. Maybe that is why we talk of the figure of approximately 72,000 people in the part-time work category.  In the whole area of part-time work, we are talking about part-time work, casual work, part-time work on a full-time basis and so on. There has been a change in the market in relation to employment, consumer demands, labour relations and so on.</P>
      <P>One could be boggle-eyed at the very large numbers of people in the part-time category.  This highlights the importance of having legislation for this area.  Most previous speakers have opted for the line that if there is no legislation there will be abuse and exploitation, and that may be so.  However, I think most people who have participated in the debate have referred to the report by John Blackwell as it relates to part-time work.  It is interesting to note that he states that part-time work can be a way of entering the labour market and can also provide an opportunity to combine work with study for the younger age bracket.  He goes on to say that for some older workers the option of part-time work can be a way of easing the transition to retirement and that is recognised.  The Blackwell report adequately covers the area of part-time work and highlights a basis for policy making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This moment should not pass without recognising the efforts of the present Minister for Labour and the work that he and the Government have endeavoured to do since coming to office in 1987.  He has made strides in four major areas. First, in the area of manpower he established FÁS in January 1988 as a dynamic and comprehensive body to give priority to the needs of those most disadvantaged, particularly the long-term unemployed and the early school leavers.  Jointly with the Minister for Education he launched the Youthreach programme for early school leavers who could not get jobs. <Col N="239" /> He established a much needed advisory committee on management training which highlighted the disturbing gaps in the present level of management development.  As chairman of the ministerial committee on employment, he has already launched a major package of measures on job creation, and extra help to the disadvantaged is also due shortly.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in the area of labour legislation he piloted the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill through this House. For the first time this provides statutory protection for everybody at work rather than merely 20 per cent of workers.  It lays great emphasis on prevention of accidents and ill health.  The Minister is also developing proposals for amending legislation on the payment of wages, unfair dismissals, employment equality and part-time working and is reviewing the out-dated legislation on working hours.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, on industrial relations, the Minister has introduced the Industrial Relations Bill, 1989, the Committee Stage of which will be debated in this House tomorrow.  He piloted the Workers Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1988, through this House. Finally, as President of the Social Affairs Council he supported the development of a social charter and has emphasised the urgency of its implementation in tandem with the development of a single market. He hopes to succeed in getting Community support for putting long-term employment back at the top of the political agenda.  I think all the Members of this House recognise the efforts of the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in what he is doing.</P>

We know he has contacted the social partners in bringing a Bill before this House that will cover the very complex, complicated, and detailed matters that need to be addressed when dealing with part-time workers.  Unfortunately I cannot support Deputy Rabbitte's Bill because it is not a simple matter to be addressed by the Bill before the House; it is a very complex matter and we should deal with it adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the issue of part-time workers.  There is no doubt, as previous speakers have said, that there has been an incredible increase in the number of part-time workers in the employment market and consequently there has been a reduction in protection for many workers.  There is an obvious need for corrective action to be taken to prevent the exploitation that is taking place in the labour market at present by unscrupulous employers who employ people on a part-time basis to avoid the expenditure that would be incurred with full-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two questions arise: first, the question of protection and, secondly, the question of whether part-time work is acting as a substitute for full-time work.  There appears to be evidence to suggest that part-time work is acting as a substitute for full-time work right across the board. The Government's approach is not a simplistic one.  This is not a simple issue because there are major changes in the trends of employment in the economy today.  The old traditional smoke stack industries of the fifties and sixties industrial age have long since gone and have been replaced by jobs in the technological <Col N="241" /> services sectors.  Indeed right across western Europe, Japan and America the services sector accounts for the greater number of jobs in those economies.</P>
    <P>With the growth in the services sector and, in particular, the growth in the tourist sector we have seen a consequent increase in part-time work.  The whole area of tourism and services require a co-ordinated comprehensive approach from Government on the taxation side, on the labour force side and on the social welfare side and need a combination of proposals. I was glad to see the Minister for Social Welfare entering the debate tonight to give his side of the argument. It is appropriate that the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Social Welfare should approach this issue in tandem because there are implications for the social welfare code and system as, indeed, there are for employment legislation. The services sector is one we need to tackle and the tourist industry is one that needs a governmental approach because the tourism, hotel and restaurant area is not satisfactory at present.  First, we have a shortage of skilled employees for that industry and, second, the terms and conditions of employment in that industry leave much to be desired in terms of working hours, pay, benefits, protection and so on.</P>
    <P>If we are to pin our hopes on the tourism industry and on the services sector as growing industries we need to take a co-ordinated, purposeful approach to employment in that sector.  I think the Minister intends to do that.  In consultation with ICTU and the FIE he has discussed the whole issue of part-time work and has tried to arrive at a consensus approach.  There is no doubt that there is a wide divergence of opinion from the trade union side to the employer side; the employers want to maintain a certain degree of flexibility on the employment market and the trade unions want to provide as great a degree of protection as possible for the workers.  That is desirable but there would be little point in bringing blanket proposals if there was <Col N="242" /> not some co-operation from the employment side because legislation on its own will not solve the problem.  There has to be a degree of agreement from both the employment aside and the trade union side, otherwise new legislation could simply mean a new black economy emerging and that has to be protected against.  The proposals that come forward must be well researched and well prepared and there must be no possibility of loopholes.</P>
    <P>Over regulation in itself could lead to a reduction in job opportunities for people who might want to work only part-time. No doubt there is a certain sector of the labour force who still want to work part-time as it suits their circumstances. Above all we must avoid the emergence of a dual labour market with different classes of employees.  It is everyone's concern that employees, be they part-time or full-time, would have the benefits of social welfare entitlements to PRSI, annual leave, maternity leave and so on, the benefits of all the protections which the full-time employee has.</P>
    <P>The current protective legislation is obviously inadequate.  The Minister is well aware of that so we should await the more comprehensive Bill which will come from the Minister for Labour rather than press ahead in a precipitative fashion with The Workers' Party Bill.  The Bill is defective in many respects, as the Minister has pointed out.  For instance, it is defective in that it makes no provisions for its possible effects on the social welfare system.  Something which brought this issue home to me was that in a major retail development in the country, the Dunnes Stores shopping centre at Douglas, Cork, only eight or nine of the hundreds of employees were full-time. That is a very bleak picture in many respects and underlines the necessity for action on this front.  There is little point in having major retail developments and inner city developments, welcome as they are in terms of investment and so on, if at the end of the day they do not improve the quality of life for the vast majority of people living around them.  In conclusion, <Col N="243" /> we await the Minister's Bill with considerable interest.</P>

      <P>I will try to keep to that.  I would like to express my disappointment with the Minister's attitude to this Bill.  It is a very good Bill.  It is a pity it could not be given a Second Reading after which any desirable amendments could be put down.  However, I am afraid this is the way the adversarial politics work in this House.  It is something I will have to get used to.</P>
      <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, support this Bill because we recognise that the present situation is a form of apartheid.  Full-time workers are like the whites in South Africa, they have all the rights while the unemployed are treated like the blacks, they have no rights at all. Part-time workers come somewhere in between like, perhaps, the coloureds. Part-time workers should have the same basic rights and protection as full timers. The Green Party support the concept of part-time work because we believe that full-time work tends to interfere with the opportunities for full human development. It is also bad for family life.  If both parents are working who is to look after the children?  The pressure of the jobs-for-all syndrome means that the environment is put under serious pressure since there is often a conflict between job creation and ecological values.  This was seen clearly in Cork with the pressure to establish inappropriate chemical industries on the basis that they would allegedly improve overall employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious imbalance in society between full-time workers on the one <Col N="244" /> hand and part-timers and the unemployed on the other.  Both management and the unions are to blame for this state of affairs since both accept full-time employment as the ideal and the norm even though there is not a snowball's chance in hell of that ever being realised. The main reason is, of course, the development of new technology which makes it less attractive to employ labour in the productive process.  We in the Green Party urge unions to press for work sharing and reduce working hours in the interests of both workers and the unemployed alike.  After all, reduced working hours is an old working-class demand which has been forgotten about since the unions decided to put themselves squarely behind the work ethic.</P>
    <P>The Green Party, want a society in which work will be shared out much more equally.  They also want a much more equitable sharing out of wealth in the form of basic income.  It may be that in such a society there would be less need for legal and bureaucratic protection for workers since work would no longer be the main source of income.  The labour market would be freed from many of the constraints that cripple it at present but until that day comes, however, part-time workers should have as much protection as full-time workers.  We are, however, concerned that in a transitional period part-time workers might be even more vulnerable since management might find excuses to get rid of people whose rights were about to be strengthened.  This is an issue about which trade unions in particular should be concerned.  Unions need to take on board the rights of the whole community rather than the rights of full-time workers since the exercise of these rights often conflict with the rights of those who do not enjoy the privilege of full-time employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the analogy with South Africa used by Deputy Garland is appropriate because far from being the adversaries of part-time workers, in my experience whatever limited gains have been made by part-time workers, certainly in organised <Col N="245" /> employment, have been made with the active support of their full-time colleagues. The most recent example of that is probably the case of part-time teachers where it was their full-time colleagues, by and large, who championed their case through the Teachers Union of Ireland and who managed to extract, admittedly over a fairly long period, some concessions regarding employment conditions for the part-time teachers.</P>
      <P>The Bill we are debating, which has been proposed by The Workers' Party, concerns workers, and specifically women.  There are approximately 90,000 part-time workers in this State, 70 per cent of whom are women and two-thirds are married.  There used to be an attitude in this country that women working part-time, and especially married women, were earning pin money.  It was seen as a little extra to the stable, and usually male earned, family income.  This is no longer the case.  For most people now working part-time, male or female, their earnings are essential to the family budget.  Part-time work is the essential life raft that prevents many families from drowning in poverty.  For 90,000 people and their families it is a big, exploited and largely unorganised area.  There are more people in this employment than in the commercial semi-State sector and three times the number of civil servants and twice the number of teachers.  This is a body which is growing.  The number of part-time workers has doubled in the past decade.</P>
      <P>The study carried out by John Blackwell shows that the proportion of part-time workers in Ireland is about half The EC average.  As the process of EC monetary and economic union continues we can expect the number of part-time workers to increase to EC levels.  Soon there will be more part-time workers in this State than there are farmers and if they were organised we would not have to wait so long for legislation to protect their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member has come across cases where part-time workers are exploited. In proposing this Bill my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, gave several examples <Col N="246" /> of employers paying low wages and deliberately avoiding the 18-hour threshold which would qualify these workers for legal entitlements.  The 18-hour rule has an interesting anti-woman history.  It first appeared in the 1967 Redundancy Payments Act and was purposely included in that Act so that the married women who were working part-time would not qualify for redundancy payments.  Indeed, the Oireachtas debates of that time are very illuminating with regard to the attitude of Members of the Oireachtas towards the status of women in society, particularly in the workplace; as Member after Member explained to this House and the other House how unacceptable it would be if married women in employment were to qualify for redundancy payments and how unreasonable it would be to expect employers to have to pay redundancy payments to women.  The 18-hour rule belongs to an age when it was assumed that married women did not work and when women in the public service had to resign from their employment when they married.</P>
    <P>Of course, in those days denying married women the right to work was justified by the alleged concern for women, that they had a special and constitutionally guaranteed role in the home.  I find it remarkable that we hear so little concern these days for the homemaker who has to go out to work for no more then £49.50 per week &mdash; it will be now £54.50 per week &mdash; in order to put food on her family's table, a woman who has not had a pay increase in years in case her husband loses social welfare payments, a woman who is denied the right to holiday pay, maternity leave, sick pay, minimum notice in terms of employment and protection against unfair dismissal, etc.  The 18-hour rule, introduced in 1967 to satisfy employers that they would not have to pay redundancy to a married woman, has become the threshold in more modern and progressive legislation.  It is time for it to go and for all workers to enjoy the same basic rights in proportion to the time they work.  The need for part-time workers to be protected by law is well <Col N="247" /> recognised.  It is enshrined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Minister says he wants to do it, but he behaves like the sinner contemplating death: &ldquo;Not yet, Lord, not yet&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why do the Government not accept this Bill?  In his reply on 27 March the Minister for Labour gave a number of reasons and I would now like to deal with them to show how shallow they are and to expose the Minister for Labour, who likes to be considered the worker's friend but who is siding with employers in the exploitation of part-time workers.</P>
    <P>First, the Minister says he will bring in his own Bill on part-time workers.  Where is it?  Last week the Government's legislative programme for this session was published.  It lists 19 Bills the Government hope to have debated this session; it lists a further 12 Bills which are described as being at an advanced stage of drafting, but a Government Bill on part-time workers is not listed.  The weekend before The Workers' Party's Bill was proposed the Minister made a public announcement that he intended to introduce his own Bill.  Is it now clear that this was nothing more than a shabby attempt at political one-upmanship.  Considering the rate at which legislation crawls through the Oireachtas, it will be at least two years before a Government Bill on part-time workers is enacted, even if it were No. 32 on the legislation chart.</P>
    <P>Almost six months ago we had a similar response from the Government on the Fine Gael Environment Protection Agency Bill.  We were then promised Government legislation.  We are still waiting for the Bill to be circulated.  The Minister has the opportunity now to do something to protect part-time workers. He can withdraw his opposition to this Bill, allow it to go through Second Stage and amend it as he sees fit on Commimtte Stage.  Indeed, the Government would obviously have sufficient numbers to carry any such amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second stated reason for opposing this Bill is that he wants to have more consultation.  What for?  He knows the extent and nature of the problem. <Col N="248" /> John Blackwell's paper spells it out.  He knows the views of the social partners. They were articulated at a seminar held months ago which the Minister himself organised &ldquo;to speed up my efforts to reconcile divergent views on the matter&rdquo;. He knows that in many respects the approaches being taken by employers and trade unions on this issue are fundamentally different.</P>
    <P>At the seminar 12 months ago Peter Cassells of the ICTU said legislation was needed urgently and listed five reasons why this was so.  While Mr. John Dunne of the FIE did not explicitly state that he was opposed to legislation, that conclusion can clearly be drawn from his presentation in which he denied that part-time employment was uncontrolled and argued that employers already had to cope with too much legislation and he suggested that further legislation could lead to what he called some unpleasant results.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to make up his own mind on this.  Is he for legislative protection for part-time workers or not?  By continuing to delay bringing in legislation he is coming down firmly on the side of employer organisations who expect that some day there will be legislation but whose strategy is to postpone the day for as long as possible.  Therefore, by taking the side of the employer organisations on this, the Minister is wrecking the spirit of partnership enshrined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  That does not argur well for the prospect for a new programme for national recovery.</P>
    <P>The Minister's third stated reason is that the EC Commission will publish a draft directive on atypical work in May-June of this year.  I share his hope, but an EC Draft Directive, far from promoting legislation in Ireland, may in fact delay it.  In 1982 the Commission published a draft directive on voluntary part-time work, but the British Government objected to it and it was never agreed. Nothing has changed, not yet anyway, to suggest that a new directive will meet with more enthusiasm from the princess of deregulation.</P>
    <P>Even if the Welshman succeeds to <Col N="249" /> Downing Street in the next couple of years, it could take years for the draft directive to get through the European legislative labyrinth and then it could be another few years before an Irish Government comply with it.  When the Minister says he is waiting for the EC Directive, I hear the message &mdash; there will be no legislation on part-time workers until the EC forces the Government to do it, and we could be approaching the end of the century before that occurs.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister will say it is prudent to await the EC position before moving on legislation, but surely he can anticipate it.  He is the President of the Council of Ministers.  He knows the objectives set out in the Social Charter. The Government have declared themselves in support of the Charter.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on EC Secondary Legislation to which a delegation from the ICTU were making a presentation and when asked to identify the area of the Social Charter which they felt should be given first priority for legislation here they answered, without hesitation, legislation to protect the rights of atypical workers.  We do not need to wait for the EC.  We can anticipate indeed from the 1982 Draft Directive what will be contained in the new directive and we can give a lead for a change.  The Government's rejection of this Bill is flying in the face of the Social Charter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's fourth excuse is that the workforce must be flexible.  Of course, it must.  There is no argument about that. The Workers' Party understand the economic, commercial and, indeed, social reasons for the growth in atypical working. Indeed, many workers themselves want more flexible working arrangements. I had experience as a trade union official, before I was elected to this House, of workers in full-time employment seeking a reduction in their hours and more flexible working hours to help them meet their family commitments. Far from hindering flexibility, The Workers' Party would wish to see it encouraged but what we are opposed to, <Col N="250" /> and what our Bill is directed at, is exploitation.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that over-regulation will hinder job creation.  There is no evidence to support this.  I should like to quote what Mr. Peter Cassells said at the seminar last year.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that extending labour legislation and social insurance to cover part-time workers will inhibit job creation.  Employers themselves do not believe this.  In the Department of Labour's survey in August 1986 on employers perceptions of the effect of labour legislation, the following difficulties were listed by companies: uncertainty of demand and the general recession, 46 per cent; VAT, 28 per cent; competitive pricing and cheap imports, 25 per cent; cashflow and bad debts, 24 per cent; banking facilities, 19 per cent, and general overhead costs, 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>Only a tiny proportion of firms, under 1 per cent, raised any issue related to the area of labour legislation and unfair dismissal.  Also, if you look at countries in Europe with the best track record in job creation they are also the countries most heavily regulated with regard to workers legislation. For example West Germany and Sweden.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cassells' view on this has not been challenged.  Flexibility is not a problem. What is the problem?  What are employers nervous about?  The answer is to be found in John Blackwell's paper: it is money.  John Blackwell, in his explanation as to why there has been a growth in part-time working, said:</P>
    <P>The unit cost to the employer of employing a part-time worker can be lower than the unit cost or employing a full-time worker.  There are a number of aspects to this and one is that the hourly wage for part-time work tends to be less than that for full-time work, even leaving aside the question of overtime rates and shift premiums.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about non-wage <Col N="251" /> labour costs, that is employers' contributions to social insurance and to private pensions.  Employers do not have to pay them and, therefore, that is another saving to them.  John Blackwell went on to state that if employers have to pay little or nothing in the form of sick leave and are able to pay less than in the case of full-time workers for holiday pay, there can be an incentive to hire part-time workers.  He said that whenever fringe benefits decline in proportion to the decline in the work week there can be an incentive to hire part-time workers. Many part-time workers have less access to fringe benefits, including occupational pensions, than their full-time colleagues. He went on to deal with the question of flexibility and said:</P>
    <P>It has been argued that some of the increase in part-time working in Europe as a whole reflects an increased desire for flexibility on the part of the employer.  However, a survey of employers' perceptions of the effects of labour legislation &mdash; the Department of Labour 1986 &mdash; indicates that the latter possible explanation has hardly been a major influence.</P>
    <P>For &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; we can read, &ldquo;cheap labour&rdquo;.  Legislation to protect part-time workers means an end to the free market in cheap, and mostly female, labour that is growing here.  That is why there is resistance from employers and that is why, if the Minister persists in his opposition, he will yet come to be known as &ldquo;the Minister for cheap labour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister's fifth and final reason is that, he says, the Bill is a wide brush, that it is too general and, as the Minister for Social Welfare said this evening, too simplistic.  The Bill is based on the 1982 EC Draft Directive.  The definitions in it, the terms of it, the sections in it are lifted from that draft directive.  Successive Irish Governments have made it clear that they have not been opposed to that draft directive; indeed, successive Ministers for Labour have assured the ICTU that they support the directive and were working for agreement on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> Has there been a change in Government policy?  How can the Government on the one hand say they are in favour of the draft directive and then come into the House and oppose a Bill which is based on it?  The Bill is essentially the same as that sought by the ICTU.  Therefore, in opposing the Bill the Government are directly opposing the position of congress.  What will the Minister for Labour say to congress if they ask him why he opposed The Workers' Party Bill on part-time workers?</P>
    <P>What are we looking for in the Bill? We are looking for a number of basic provisions; we are looking for <i>pro rata</i> payment and conditions for workers; we know there is an emergence of a new structure in the workforce, the emergence of a small corps of highly paid people &mdash; this is the wish of employers and employer organisations &mdash; around whom a whole range of part-time workers will be based; we know that contract workers who enjoy no security of employment are paid far less, even on an hourly basis, than their full-time colleagues; we know these workers can be employed and dismissed at will and they do not enjoy legal protection; we want the conditions of part-time workers to be protected by law; we want part-time workers to be able to avail of the same statutory entitlements as their full-time colleagues.  The women who need part-time employment for family reasons should qualify for maternity leave, which is not the case at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Private Members Business I painted a picture of the country's finances.  I said that in 1986 the <Col N="253" /> Exchequer borrowing requirement was £2,145 million but that in 1990 it would be £449 million.</P>
      <P>Given the financial position over the last number of years, the great reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement is like music to the ears of some people, as they feel now that we have it under control and that we should reduce the level of taxation.  While acknowledging that our Exchequer borrowing requirement is under control we cannot forget that, last year, Government borrowing was the lowest in 40 years.  However, debt service costs were in the region of £2 billion which is far too high for a small country and, therefore, has implications for all of us.</P>
      <P>The exemption limits and vast package of income tax reliefs in the first section shows the Government's commitment to reduce the unacceptably high levels of taxation.  There will be no empty promises from this side of the House if that reduction is to continue.  It is the Government's intention that two-thirds of all taxpayers will eventually be on a standard rate of tax.  However, this will mean that tax cuts will have to come out of a strong economy and that tax will be at levels which we can maintain.</P>
      <P>The exemption levels and limits take more people in the lower income groups out of the tax net, and with the reduction of the top rate of tax to 53 per cent, the low rate at 30 per cent and the standard rate remaining at 48 per cent, we are going in the right direction.  Some people think that rates should be reduced faster but let us look at the experience across the water.  Four years ago the UK dropped their rate of tax from 55 per cent to 35 per cent.  This caused a consumer boom but it also caused high inflation. The steady-as-she-goes policy may be the right approach and I would like to see two tax bands, a standard rate of 25 per cent and a higher rate of no more than 48 per cent.  However, this can only be achieved as a result of economic recovery rather than by borrowing.  We have learnt from our past experience in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that when the Minister addressed this year's budget and the vast <Col N="254" /> amount of income tax reliefs costing in excess of £200 million in the present tax year, he had to seek clawbacks in certain areas.  The restriction on life assurance relief from 80 per cent to 50 per cent will yield some £13 million in the current year but, if this restrictive trend is to continue, life assurance relief will be too expensive. This relief has been abolished in the United Kingdom.  I accept that this relief may not really affect the higher income groups but I ask the Minister to look at premium payments and income brackets, particularly so that the lower income groups may avail of tax relief, as life insurance is an important source of life cover and of savings for this income group.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the effect on the economy, the stock market and social dependency on the State, it is recognised that life assurance and pension funds are two primary sources of long-term savings in this country with a high level of investment in Government stocks.  The life companies operating in this field lay down criteria to encourage policyholders to continue their savings and to provide stability for long-term savings managed by these companies.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will take on board my suggestion in relation to income brackets and premium payments to encourage lower income groups to avail of life assurance relief and to provide a means of life cover and long-term savings.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the cost to the Exchequer of mortgage interest relief, which is estimated at over £220 million in the current year.  This figure is up on that of last year by approximately £50 million, mainly due to international factors in regard to interest rates.  Of course mortgage holders have also experienced similar increases in interest rates and I am pleased at the Minister's reference to the level of ongoing Government support for mortgage holders.  I am aware of the Government's determination to ensure that interest rates will be held as low as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear that he will not tolerate abuses of the business <Col N="255" /> expansion scheme.  Last July he referred to some of these abuses as Disneyland schemes.  Sections 7 and 29 of the Bill should ensure that BES moneys are invested in risk type projects as originally intended.  It is vital that our industry and economy get the maximum benefit from business expansion schemes.  Funds available for investment in risk projects should not dry up as a result of arrangements which guarantee returns to the investors regardless.  Business expansion schemes must remain risk capital projects.</P>
    <P>The changes in assessment for the self-employed to a current year basis is reducing the divide between the self-employed and the PAYE worker.  It has always been said that this could not be done, for one reason or another.  Chapter II &mdash; sections 10 to 23 &mdash; paves the way to dispelling that myth.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also providing for transitional arrangements to assist in the change to the new assessment of all income on a current year basis.  These arrangements will safeguard the Revenue Commissioners against abuses while at the same time prevent the over-payment of tax by taxpayers.  I welcome in particular the provision which will allow a taxpayer to pay not less than 90 per cent of the current year ultimate liability or not less than 100 per cent of the preceding year's actual tax liability.  This will be very beneficial to taxpayers who for one reason or another may not be in a position to estimate their liabilities by 1 November of the tax year.  This is a very welcome change.</P>
    <P>Many of the other technical alterations in this section meet the issues raised by the Institute of Taxation.  I have no doubt that they will warmly welcome these changes.  All of these changes, particularly those of a technical nature, will result in greater efficiency in the whole tax system, prevent abuses, relieve the burden of work on tax practitioners and cut down on administration for both the taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners, which will also result in cost savings for both parties.  The direction in which we are heading, of one year, one <Col N="256" /> return and one payment, is the way forward. I wholeheartedly support the Minister in his continuing reform of the tax system.  I do not think anybody doubts the need to simplify the system even further.</P>
    <P>Sections 59 to 70 provide for the removal of capital allowances.  This is in line with the reduction in the rate of corporation tax.  I welcome the provision for new industrial projects which are in the pipeline as many of these projects may not be completed by April 1992.  The Minister has made arrangements for such projects.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the continued incentives for designated areas, such as the Custom House Docks site.  I very much favour the incentives contained in sections 25 and 26 and welcome the moves made by the Minister in sections 27 and 28 to avoid unintended uses of the double rent allowances and the lease arrangements for commercial property.  Certain abuses in this area had come to light, especially in relation to the double rent allowance.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some of these provisions may not assist business houses to expand and develop, particcularly with the abolition of capital allowances. Major concern will now centre on the year to year arrangements for granting fair relief under section 241 (8) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, for wear and tear of plant and machinery through writing down allowances.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the financial services market which may focus on these writing down allowances.  We have witnessed a growth in the financial services in recent years.  With the elimination of capital allowances, the financial and leasing housing section of the financial services market will focus on writing down allowances. Rates of either 10 or 12 per cent per annum for plant and machinery on a reducing balance basis were allowed by tax authorities in respect of wear and tear.  These WDA rates are now out of line with the life of some plant and machinery.  The average computer life is now put at three to four years.  Yet the writing down allowance, if applicable at the 10 or 12.5 per cent per annum rate, <Col N="257" /> would write down the life of a computer in excess of eight years.  This highlights the need to address the area of WDA.</P>
    <P>I understand WDA rates were formulated to reflect physical depreciation of assets but against the background of the elimination of capital allowances &mdash; as I said earlier I am particularly concerned about the area of leasing &mdash; and the failure to address and increase the writing down allowances to fair levels, finance houses and industry will be faced with major problems.  If we do not have realistic WDA rates &mdash; writing down allowances should be provided for in legislation rather than giving discretionary powers to the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; lease rental levels may exceed market loan rates and there may be an increase in the cost of leasing, which will have its own implications for inflation.  In addition, the UK leasing markets may have an unfair advantage over Irish finance and leasing houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the important source of new jobs in the financial services market and the need to develop this new market.  If we want to assist in further job creation and the development of such a market while at the same time clearing the deck with the removal of capital allowances, we should put all our cards on the table and set realistic writing down allowances of between 20 and 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister is amending many sections of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975. In particular, section 73 extends the relieving provisions regarding the disposal of assets in a family business to a holding company.  This is a practical measure which will be welcomed by the business community.  He is also making a positive move in reducing the top rate of capital gains tax to 50 per cent.  However, I believe this is still too high and should be reduced further.  It is an impediment to investment and will reduce the potential overall yield from this tax.</P>
    <P>The introduction of legislation to restrict manufacturing relief to genuine manufacturing companies is further evidence of the Government's policy to <Col N="258" /> combat the use of legislation for unintended purposes.  The definition of manufacturing industries which could avail of the 10 per cent corporation tax rate had to be addressed as there were blatant abuses in the system.  Manufacturing should relate to changing the form of a raw material and manufacturing a product and not just breaking down bulk.  I am particularly worried about section 33 (1) (b) (iii) which reads:</P>
    <P>(iii)  cooking, baking or otherwise preparing food or drink for human consumption which is intended to be consumed, at or about the time it is prepared, whether or not in the building or structure in which it is prepared or whether or not in the building to which it is delivered after being prepared, ...</P>

      <P>Since the introduction of the special low tax rate for manufacturing industry by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley in 1978 it has proved to be a very important element in the development, investment and expansion of that industry.  I wholeheartedly support and welcome the extension of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the year 2010.</P>

It was wrong that offshore funds had a competitive advantage heretofore as investors in certain foreign funds were able to convert certain taxable income from the funds into tax-free income and pay capital gains tax only if they disposed of such units.  Here again the Minister is showing his commitment <Col N="259" /> to introducing legislation to prevent such abuses.</P>
    <P>The many changes proposed in customs and excise duties in Part II of the Bill constitute a welcome change.  I will be monitoring the position carefully to ensure consumers benefit from these vast changes.  Of course the major change comprises the reduction from the high rate of VAT of 25 per cent to 23 per cent.  Bearing in mind the large array of products affected by this tax everybody should benefit and it should also have an impact on lowering the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the restoration of child relief in the residential property tax code. I am interested in the use of the index of house prices.  Here I should like to refer to particular areas of Dublin where the new house price index has reached an all-time high.  I am concerned that many householders who purchased houses some years ago prior to the introduction of the residential property tax or the boom in the house market will now find their family home has become an unexpected tax burden.  They may not have made provision for this tax and, if they have purchased their homes over a long number of years, may find themselves on restricted incomes, retirement pensions or whatever.  Indeed, the residential property tax code makes no allowance for mortgage holders.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of two houses side by side.  The residential property tax is based on the value of one's assets.  If we take each house value at, say, £120,000, one purchaser may own his property outright while the other may have a large mortgage on the property. Yet they must both pay the same amount of residential property tax.  This is one area in which some amendments are necessary to accommodate the two categories to which I have referred, people who find themselves within that tax net who, because of restricted income or whatever, cannot afford to pay or, as in the other case, somebody who purchased their house before the introduction of the residential property tax or the increase in <Col N="260" /> new house prices, finds themselves caught in the trap.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very lengthy one.  Nobody doubts that we are going in the right direction.  As I did not have an opportunity to speak on the budget I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Finance on what was recognised as the first budget he prepared along with his departmental staff.  I know it is the second budget he introduced in this House but it is the first containing his policies throughout.  I congratulate him on the way he has got our national finances on the right rail and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of necessity I will be brief. First, I compliment the Minister on this Bill.  Its provisions benefit most sectors of the community to some degree.  Needless to say, there are also some sectors who would like to have been more favourably treated.  Unfortunately the Minister does not have access to bottomless funds when drawing up his budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to one sector this evening, the farming community.  There appears to be some anomaly in the method by which they are being taxed compared with the method employed with regard to most other workers.  For example, in preceding years PAYE workers received a tax-free allowance of the order of £800 to which they were entitled.  The farming community did not benefit from any such tax-free allowance. The reason given was that farmers were taxed not on the current year's but on the preceding year's production.  That was the excuse given which was generally accepted.  In addition to that £800 tax-free allowance most workers received there was also a PRSI allowance which, this year, amounts to £286.  In the past the farming community were not granted <Col N="261" /> that allowance, for the same reason they were not given the £800 allowance.</P>
    <P>From and including the year 1990 farmers will be taxed on their current year's production.  Consequently I do not see any valid reason they should not be given the benefit of that £800 tax-free and the £286 tax-free allowances &mdash; which would amount to £1,086 &mdash; to which I honestly believe farmers and the self-employed are genuinely entitled. Farmers are honest to goodness, hard working, God-fearing people who like to pay their bills and do not like others owing them anything; they like to receive their proper entitlements.  Consequently, they are anxious that that anomaly of £1,086 be rectified.  Perhaps the Minister would so ensure before this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another small sector, that of farmer's wives.  Normally the farmer's wife comprises part and parcel of the workforce on the farm.  On a 500 acre farm &mdash; of which we have not many &mdash; the wife may not be part and parcel of the workforce as she is on the ordinary sized farm with which most of us are familiar, where she rears calves, lambs and fowl.  Her contribution to the family farm income is sizeable.  When the Revenue Commissioners come to estimate the farmer's tax bill they take the contribution which his wife has made into account and rightly so, as in many cases this is sizeable.  Unfortunately, when they estimate what tax-free allowances the farmer should receive they fail to acknowledge the presence of the farmer's wife.  The farmer's wife should be entitled to receive all the allowances PAYE taxpayers receive.  Taking the farmer and his wife together, we can see that there is a difference of £2,172 in the tax-free allowances they are given and the allowances which PAYE taxpayers receive.  I ask the Minister to look at this matter and try to rectify it.</P>
    <P>City dwellers tend to forget what life down on the farm is like.  They sometimes think in romantic terms, of people basking in the sunshine in green fields, but between the months of October and April they do not do much basking in the <Col N="262" /> fields.  Anyone who visited a mart or a factory during the past few weeks would have received sad news, sad from the point of view of the farmer.  The price of lamb today as compared with last year is down by between £10 and £20 per head. I will not dwell too long on this point but last year the price of lamb per pound was £1.20 but now it is around £1.08 per pound.  Some of our economists have pointed out that before the end of the year it will be as low as £1.05 per pound.</P>
    <P>Up to about November or December last farmers with dry stock, cattle and sheep, had negative income.  One may well ask, if that was the case what did they live on?  They got by selling their assets, their stock, and not replacing them, the reason being that because of the low level of profit in that line of business they had to sell off some of their assets.  They now find themselves in the same position.  I ask the Minister, given this fact, to bear in mind the anomalies that exist in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>In speaking about farmers we should remember that they are not a separate group from ourselves.  We all form part of the same conglomerate.  The statistics indicate that 24.5 per cent of our exports are agriculture-related while 18.8 per cent of the workforce are employed in agriculture-related industries.  Therefore we cannot argue that we are a separate group.  We form part of the one outfit.  I ask the Minister to approach the question of taxation in a more realistic manner. All that is required is plain, ordinary commonsense and the Minister has his fair share of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Foxe for sharing his time with me.  My contribution will be brief as I realise others wish to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to the measures announced in the budget.  It is brought in against the background of a misplaced belief that our economic problems are at an end, that the hairshirt days are nearly over, if not over, and that Ireland is at last the master of its own destiny, but we know that sadly this is not the case, even though it tends <Col N="263" /> to be the impresson given by the Government party and their supporters.</P>
    <P>The reality is that we still have a massive foreign debt of £25 billion, twice the European average.  It costs well over £2 billion or virtually all the expected income tax yield from PAYE workers to service this debt per annum.  This means that there is no surplus from that source for necessary social and economic development.  That national debt is the monster hindering our real advancement, any meaningful development or serious challenge to poverty in our urban communities. This debt leaves us vulnerable to international trends, rising interest rates and inflation abroad which can increase the burden even more.</P>
    <P>It is not common nowadays to stress the enormity of the national debt or to place emphasis on what it costs to service it.  We all want to be optimistic, lift morale and encourage people who are sorely taxed and plagued by cuts in every area.  I can see that it makes very little sense to preach economic gloom <i>ad infinitum,</i> but we must remember how the debt accumulated and how easy it was to get to the precipice as we did just before the Coalition Government came to power in 1982.  Fianna Fáil's major contribution to the profligate days of spending between 1979 and 1982 puts a heavy moral obligation on that party to steer a course out of the economic bog, but this must be done in a humane and sensitive way, a way which will not bludgeon or hammer the less well off, the disadvantaged and those merely struggling for existence.  I am afraid that a humane and sensitive touch has not been evident during the past three years. Indeed I recall several Ministers challenging a report of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Conference of the Major Religious Superiors of Ireland about the figures they quoted for the poverty plateau here.</P>
    <P>For the fortunate ranks of the better off including those of us in this House, who are very concerned with the issue of tax it is not possible for them to know the hardship suffered by families on the dole, <Col N="264" /> in receipt of social welfare or in low paid jobs.  Of course no one is starving in the true sense but people are badly nourished, poorly dressed, in debt, and suffering as a result, and unable to cope with unexpected costs.  Can anyone who does the weekly shopping for groceries for a family, easily spending £80 or more on food for four, not have qualms of conscience about families of six or seven living on less than that for their total needs?  One can witness the stress caused by poverty in Dublin every day.  As legislators, we have to take responsibility and this means making hard decisions on policy, favouring the poor in an affirmative manner right across the spectrum of public spending.  While I am aware that there is poverty in other European cities I believe the number of our population who are poor, at around one million, is proportionately higher with little hope of changing this cycle in succeeding generations.  Indeed one often witnesses a depressing passive acceptance of disadvantage and deprivation.</P>
    <P>Third level education, which is acknowledged as being the key to better living standards, is denied to the majority of our young people.  They cannot afford to go to college and grants which are provided to the children of those on higher income levels are of absolutely no use to them.  This is discriminatory and unjust and blocks off careers, particularly those in the professional sector, as people cannot afford to pay for education for their children.</P>
    <P>Poor people also know the real effects of the health cuts.  They know of the long delays experienced in awaiting surgery and treatment, know they cannot buy their way to comfort and, worse still, feel they do not have any power or influence to bring about change in these and other areas.  They, too, are the group who, once again, will feel the effects of the new housing shortage in Dublin city and county.  During the past two years the housing waiting list has dramatically increased and unless measures are taken to extend the public housing stock we will experience a housing crisis as great as the one experienced in the late sixties and <Col N="265" /> early seventies.  Only 50 local authority houses are being built in Dublin this year and there are now 1,500 applicants on the housing list.  We are back to the lottery system when it is a matter of how many children a person can produce, what infectious diseases a person can claim or how great is the overcrowding.  Of course there has to be a qualifying scale and decisions have to be made on the basis of need, but the present system seems to favour those who can collude and conspire and therefore excludes many genuine cases who are not good at duplicity.</P>
    <P>Other speakers in this debate have referred to problems with housing but I am surprised at just how often the issue of housing has come up, with particular reference to the Eastern Health Board area.  Deputies expressed frustration at their inability to help constituents with chronic accommodation needs.  Unfortunately the system operates by grinding applicants down despite the care and well meaning nature of those officials trying to operate that system.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is nothing in this Bill for that group.  One situation in my own constituency I would like to put on record illustrates what I am talking about.  A 53 year old woman who is separated from her husband and has £48 a week in maintenance from him lives with her 21 year old unmarried daughter, who is on £57 per week allowance, and a six months old baby.  When this woman's marriage broke up the sale of the house was forced and the two women had to rent in the private sector at £300 a month.  They did not qualify then for local authority housing and cheaper rented accommodation was unavailable because of the baby.  They are getting no rent subsidy.  Their sin was that they had a few pounds out of the house sale and were therefore deemed ineligible for public housing.  No small family group could have been more in need but despite my best efforts there is nothing I can do for them.  In two months time that small family will have nothing left, all their money will have gone on exorbitant rent.  The mother is already in bad health and utterly depressed and <Col N="266" /> distressed with a hopeless situation but the county council, under their system, can only help this small group when they are destitute, out on the street, most likely ill from stress.  I find this a very short sighted policy, one which indicates that the individual background of each applicant is not considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>We have a housing problem in Dublin and it is due to cutbacks in the local authority house building programme.  I wonder where the Government envisaged people like the woman whose case I have outlined being accommodated when these cutbacks were being decided?  Only more new homes, or the purchase of homes by the county council &mdash; which I believe is happening &mdash; will alleviate the problem.  Some interim relief in the meantime might be considered for people like my constituent.  For instance, could there be tax reliefs or other financial incentives for householders living alone to rent rooms?</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to make a few new points.  I welcome the initiative of the Revenue Commissioners to include with the certificate of tax free allowances a notice to people that they have a right, in certain circumstances, to claim family income supplement.  This is clearly the most sensible of decisions and the most obvious way to ensure that those who are entitled to the payment can claim it.  We know 3,000 people are eligible for family income supplement but less than half this number have taken it up.</P>
    <P>On a less ideal note is the procedure under which the Revenue Commissioners operate the joint assessment of married couples.  This has long been an area of grievance to some couples and it could and should be resolved.  The practice which causes the problem is that when a married couple opt for joint assessment after marriage the allowances are all allocated to the husband.  This is not a problem where the wife works in the home and not outside it.  Where both husband and wife are opting for joint assessment which does result in a saving of tax it means that the wife no longer gets correspondence on tax matters in her own name, the PRSI number allocated to <Col N="267" /> them is the husband's number, it is with him that the Revenue Commissioners correspond and it is to him that they send any rebates also.  In effect the wives in these instances feel as if they cease to exist for purposes of tax collection.  The question I would like to ask is if the procedure could be looked at and if it would be possible for each of the spouses to have correspondence sent to them so that each may keep their own individual records.  I know it is a small matter in overall terms but it is an irritant and relevant to many working wives.  They want to be consulted and involved in their own right and also feel that this could be an area for conflict in a relationship that is not completely trusting and stable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Foxe for allowing me to share his time.  Ten minutes is fine for anybody.  It sharpens the mind.  I doubt if I will get as much said as Deputy Fennell did in the time available to her.</P>
      <P>There is a number of points I wish to make.  I am disappointed with this Finance Bill.  There was a major hype before the budget in regard to what would take place.  There was to be a major change to assist the PAYE sector and the Minister was to raise the tax levels for corporation taxes etc.  This was widely speculated on beforehand.  It was very disappointing then to find that not only was the Minister not trying to get up to the general European levels of corporation tax but that he actually reduced corporation tax from 43 per cent to 40 per cent.  In fact in 1988 corporation tax was 50 per cent so it is being progressively reduced.  The main point about corporation taxes is that they are only nominal taxes in any case because there are so many allowances and methods of avoiding taxation that the effective tax levels are way below that; in many cases there is no tax paid at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been a good thing if the Minister had begun the process of eliminating the various allowances by tackling the complexities of the tax system thus saving a lot of time for the Revenue Commissioners, accountants <Col N="268" /> and everybody else and producing a very simple taxation system of corporation tax on companies.  For example, in the case of non-manufacturing companies the Minister could eliminate all the allowances and simply put a 20 per cent tax on their profit.  That would eliminate all the messing with accountants and there would be a decent return.  If the banks were paying 20 per cent tax on their £400 million the Minister would have £80 million which is way above what he gets with his 40 or 43 per cent tax at the moment with all the anomalies and methods of avoiding paying tax that are available to people at present.  I hoped that the Minister would begin to tackle the maze of tax exemptions and allowances which are a bonanza for accountants and tax officers who are leaving the Civil Service and the Revenue Commissioners at such a rate to go into the private sector as tax advisers in order to show big business and big farmers or high earners among the self employed how to deprive the Exchequer of its rightful share of tax. They show these people the various methods by which this can be done and, of course, make fortunes out of it.</P>
    <P>As well as that it makes it very difficult for anybody to fill in a tax form.  Even the PAYE workers who have much less areas of allowances find it difficult to complete a tax form but for the self-employed and farmers it is a very complicated business and it should be simplified.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation produced five reports.  The Workers' Party would disagree with many of the points they made but we recognise the main thrust of them as the foundations on which an equitable tax system could be built which would encourage industry and encourage the creation of jobs.  Unfortunately, a few points from here and there are being introduced by Ministers but there is no pattern of the development of tax reform.</P>
    <P>I want to tackle one particular point in regard to PAYE.  It is dreadful that a widowed person who has lost his or her spouse is treated as a single person at a <Col N="269" /> time when they have enormous difficulties, reduced income and, in many cases, increased outgoings because if they get a job they have to employ somebody to look after the home, etc.  In any case the tax on single and widowed persons on anything over £63 a week cannot be justified.  I do not know how any Minister for Finance can tax poverty.  People on these incomes are in the lowest depths of poverty when they are on earnings of that nature, yet they are being taxed.  The Minister for Social Welfare then has to look for methods to try to assist them in their poverty so that they can get money for food.</P>
    <P>On the other hand section 8 in this Bill is, I think, a dirty trick.  It is an attempt to take the last lump from a person who has worked all his life and who is going out on pension and getting a lump sum. The Minister has now raised the threshold to ensure that he will take a bigger slice from the person going out on pension, who will need a nest egg, and from the person who has been made redundant and receives a redundancy payment which will only cover him for a couple of years.  It is an absolute disgrace that in section 8 the Minister for Finance is making provision to take a further amount from these people.  We will certainly be tabling an amendment to the section on Committee Stage although the Minister has made noises about adjusting it.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the reluctance of the Minister for the Environment to grant designated area status to the essential new town centres in Blanchardstown and Ronanstown.  It is relevant to refer to the Minister for the Environment now because I am talking about the designated area status.  The developers of the Blanchardstown town centre have been ready and waiting to commence work for over six months but they await the Minister's decision to give them the designated status that was given to the developers of the Tallaght town centre.  Indeed, the proposed Blanchardstown town centre is superior to the Tallaght town centre because it includes amenities such as theatres, skating rinks, etc. which are not <Col N="270" /> included in the purely shopping centre at Tallaght.</P>
    <P>There is a suspicion, which I hope has no basis in fact, that another developer who wishes to construct a huge shopping centre in Palmerston at the junction of the new Galway road and the new Western Parkway, and who I believe is an old friend of the Minister, is opposed to the development in Blanchardstown because it would be in direct competition with his development which is only a couple of miles away.  I understand that the Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, fully supports the Blanchardstown town centre getting designated area status and that the Minister for Finance has no objection either.  It simply stands with the Minister for the Environment.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Flynn, will ensure that the tens of thousands of people who were sent out to develop this new town in Blanchardstown, which has been planned for 20 years, will not be abandoned in the desert of Blanchardstown without a town centre because that is precisely what appears to be happening at present.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to raise in the few minutes remaining is the issue of smog during our &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Presidency.  The Air Pollution Act, 1987, which we put through this House was expected to eliminate smoke and smog but the Minister appears to have totally abandoned it and announced simply that he will ban coal. I understand that only £3 million has been made available for the elimination of smog.  I had hoped it would be made clear in this Bill what procedures and funding would be available to eliminate smoke in the city.  Coal is to be banned and £3 million have been set aside for the whole country to subsidise those who will obviously need help to meet the higher cost of substituting smokeless solid fuel.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill which we are now considering is one of the most complex that has come before the House in many a long year.  The Bill deals comprehensively with the Government's tax strategy for the present year and continues to implement the highly successful economic policies which have been implemented by Fianna Fáil since our return to power in 1987.  The policies which this Government have continued to operate since 1987 have returned the country to economic stability and have laid the foundations for further economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because Fine Gael revisionists have been so active of late, as they have often been in the past, it is now worth while reminding ourselves where we stood in 1987 and how much has been achieved in the short period since then.  The most striking achievement has been the reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  The last Fine Gael speaker to raise the matter touched on this issue, so let us put the record straight.  In the years 1981-82, the peak years of the Exchequer borrowing, Exchequer borrowing reached the staggering sum of 16 per cent of GNP.  Between 1982 and 1986, for which the second FitzGerald Coalition Government can take credit, and must accept blame, our borrowing continued apace.  Indeed in this period the national debt increased from just over £12.5 billion to just close on £25 billion. By 1986, in spite of the higher amount of cash borrowed, only a modest improvement in the Exchequer borrowing requirement was achieved.  It is just as well to remind Fine Gael that the end year figure for the 1986 Exchequer borrowing requirement stood at a modest 13 per cent, in other words, in four years, <Col N="272" /> despite all that had been claimed, there was a drop of 3 per cent in the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  That is hardly what we could call massive progress from a party that now claim to have redressed the balance of the economic life of this nation.  In fact, they are claiming credit where no credit is due.</P>
    <P>Given the consensus that existed as to the need to curb borrowing from the early eighties onward, the Government who were in power from 1982-86 stand rightly condemned in this regard.  Real progress commenced in 1987 and by the end of that year the Exchequer borrowing requirement as a proportion of GNP had been forced down by the courageous Fianna Fáil policies to 10 per cent.  The downward trend has been continued ever since and last year the end of year figure for Exchequer borrowing was at a 40 year low at less than 3 per cent.  That is what you call progress, or economic achievement. While there was a modest cut in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and GNP ratio between 1982 and the end of 1986, the same could not be said about the current budget deficit which reached an all time record at the end of 1986 when it peaked at 8.5 per cent of GNP.  How do Fine Gael Deputies square that with their comments on moral responsibility? I do not know and I would be delighted to hear from them.</P>
    <P>There was intriguing correspondence in one of our national newspapers recently and in spite of the fact that it went on to tedious length, it certainly did not answer that fundamental question. This deficit on the current account budget added to the deficit of preceding years meant that the debt-GNP ratio grew from 94 per cent in 1982, when that party's Minister for Finance took up office, to a staggering 130 per cent in 1986, an extraordinary figure by any standard in any country at any time.  This fact is worth recording because it is conveniently avoided by those who would revise our economic history in a Lewis Carroll fashion and who seem to find a place in Fine Gael's front bench at this time. Their success in controlling the nation's <Col N="273" /> debt and public expenditure is not the only policy area in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1987 Ireland faced the seeds of disaster in terms of our national debt but we were also facing punishing levels of personal taxation.  It is worth recording that in 1982 a Fine Gael Minister for Finance promised that there would be massive changes in the levels of personal taxation.  This was no lie, because there were massive changes, massive disimprovements.  In spite of the promises made in the early eighties to reduce the level of personal taxation, Fine Gael in office did the opposite.  The 25 per cent tax rate on low incomes was abolished by the stroke of a pen and the top rate of personal tax was jacked up to a remarkable 65 per cent.  This party is now seeking to con the Irish people into believing that they have some way of reducing personal taxation.  It is worth recording that while they were in power far from reducing personal taxation, it was increased to the highest level ever suffered in this over-taxed State.</P>
    <P>It is again worth reminding ourselves of these facts.  Fine Gael revisionists have recently been claiming that they took the first steps in the present round of tax reform when, having realised their mistake, they reduced the top rate from 65 per cent to 58 per cent.  Big deal.  That is about the equivalent of the hangman who looked after Sam Hall handing his widow the rope and saying how kind he was.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 there have been major improvements in the tax system and they have been costly to the State.  Much in this Bill is about further improving the tax system.  The Bill has been recognised as progressive legislation.  We should give credit where it is due.  Deputy Michael Noonan paid tribute at the outset of his speech to the incisiveness of the Minister's approach and his dealing with this extremely complex legislation.  Some credit is due in that regard.  In this Bill the standard rate of income tax will come down to 30 per cent, 5 per cent lower than the rate two years ago.  Of course, 30 per cent is still too high but at least the inexorable trend is now in the right direction.  The top rate of tax will come <Col N="274" /> down from 58 per cent to 53 per cent, again 5 percentage points below the 1987 rate and a staggering 12 percentage points below the ludicrous level reached when a Fine Gael Minister was in office. That is an extraordinary turnabout and one for which the present Minister and his immediate predecessor are due great credit.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of tax is just one aspect of the tax reforms achieved in the three short years since Fianna Fáil took over the Finance portfolio.  The scandal of unpaid taxes has been addressed first of all by the carrot of the highly successful tax amnesty which, it must be recalled, was much derided by Opposition parties at the time.  There were hoots of laughter when the Minister suggested relatively modest targets for this but of course the cynics were confounded when the money began to roll in in hundreds of millions.  This tax amnesty, one of the most imaginative and courageous things done by any Minister for Finance, began to redress the imbalance and the scandal that was to the discredit of all of us.  Since the tax amnesty there has been effective use of revenue sheriffs. With the establishment of the tax task force the position with regard to avoidance and the criminal level of outstanding taxes has started to be redressed but the scandal of tax fraud has not been resolved completely.  I am not saying it has been resolved completely and I think no Fianna Fáil member has said that but at least it is being tackled.  The resolution of the Government in this regard has under-pinned the good work done by the Revenue staff to the point where the taxpayers can be assured that there exists not just the political will but also the political willingness to resolve the scandal and the shame of outstanding tax figures.</P>
    <P>Another major step has been the introduction of self assessment.  When this concept was mooted by the Minister's predecesser, there were some scoffing, cynical remarks.  The suggestion was made that self assessment would not work and a lot of cold water was poured on the Minister's claim for such a system assessment at that time.  Allied to the <Col N="275" /> general self assessment system there is the decision in principle that tax on income as opposed to tax on some imputed income should apply to all.  That was the second major tax achievement to establish the principle that whether you are a PAYE worker, a farmer or other self-employed person, you should pay tax on the same basis as everyone else.</P>
    <P>There were probably two sides to the argument about matters such as land tax but the principle which has become enshrined in Finance Bills for the last few years, that income is the basis of all tax, is a very good principle and one which all politicians in this House should support and continue to underwrite.  Self assessment, when fully operational, will be one of the most fundamental long-term improvements in the tax system in this State.  When you take self assessment on a current year basis with the principle that income is the basis of all tax, you begin to put the tax affairs of this nation onto a level playing field.  It is worthwhile reminding ourselves that when the Government first announced the move to self assessment the cynics, not just on the Opposition benches but also in the media, chortled and suggested that there would be no real effect.  How wrong they have all been proven.  An additional £70 million has been received from those who are now in the self assessment system. This is an extraordinary change in events and represents the biggest uptake in taxation from those sectors in the history of the State.  It is something that is obviously to be welcomed.  It shows what has been done so far and what can be done on the coming into operation of a full self assessment scheme.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill follows on the three years of progress I have summarised.  As the Minister for Finance has said, it aims to build on those three years of achievement. In this regard I would suggest that it is a Bill which recommends itself to all right-thinking people in this House.  I have listened to other contributions here and to the carping of Deputy Mac Giolla a few minutes ago.  I listened to the same Deputy and to his cohorts from the RDS <Col N="276" /> last weekened and I wonder that anybody has time to listen to them at all.  They are so imprecise, unfocused and concerned only with the creation of mayhem and the conjuring up of smoke screens I wonder how any intelligent person can adopt the sort of approach they have adopted.</P>
    <P>Three years of achievement underpins this Bill.  Significant improvements are provided for in the Bill in so far as the PAYE payer is concerned.  The provisions on personal taxation bring us further along the road to meeting the Government's target of a 25 per cent standard rate of tax by 1993.  We recognise that PAYE payers wish they were on the 25 per cent rate now.  I wish, as a PAYE payer, that that were the case.  In this Bill there is a further set of steps which are achieveable to bring us to that ultimate point.  This is surely welcome to all parties.  How can anybody object to this or suggest, given the record in recent times, of Finance Ministers from other parties, that they would do better?</P>
    <P>The cut in the top rate moves us towards the point where we will have a single top rate of tax and at a lower level than is currently the case.  I have no doubts that the people who argue that our tax system is a major disincentive to work are arguing from a position of strength.  The Minister and the Government implicitly accept this.  The movement towards a lower and a single upper rate of tax is very welcome indeed and should be supported by all parties who have a capacity to honestly analyse the position.</P>
    <P>Progress is also achieved in the Bill by the Government's measures towards the target of having two-thirds of PAYE payers on the standard rate.  Additional reliefs introduced this year will cost the State £200 million and it will mean that 63 per cent of PAYE payers are on the standard rate by the year's end.  Again, this is surely good news and can hardly be reasonably opposed by any serious political party.  In addition to introducing reliefs, the Minister is exempting 31,000 taxpayers from the tax system altogether and providing additional marginal relief <Col N="277" /> for a further 65,000.  That is surely very welcome news.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the tax system in any area costs money and those costs must be born by additional taxes, by spreading the tax net, by cutting expenditure or by borrowing but most of those alternatives are simply unattractive.  The Minister is finding some of the money he needs by reducing life assurance relief from 80 to 50 per cent.  While I understand the reasoning here I cannot say in all honesty I welcome this change.  In recent years there has been a great deal of academic attack on measures such as the relief on life assurance, the mortgage tax relief and now on VHI relief.  Some financial journalists and a few politicians have been urging reductions in these reliefs also.  I suggest this is an area where we should tread warily.  The reliefs are of most benefit to the middle income groups.  Understandably they are regarded by people in these groups as the only perk they can get.  While in a sense this perception is a self-delusion in that every perk must be paid for, I would urge, nonetheless, caution were we to proceed any further down this road.</P>
    <P>In relation to mortgage tax relief I am pleased that the Minister has resisted the pressure to cut again.  The reductions in 1988 and 1989 could be tolerated at a time when interest rates were falling rapidly. The unwelcome and, I hope, temporary reversal in the trend of interest rates meant that a cut here was not desirable this year.  The Minister was correct to resist the advice which had been proffered to him by some new friends in this regard.  I, as a member of our parliamentary party, am very pleased that the Minister resisted the political pressures put on him to move against this.  Predictably Opposition spokespersons have been sounding alarms about the need for steps to alleviate the undoubted problems being felt by mortgage holders because of the rise in interest rates.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the best the State can do for the mortgage holder is to ensure that it does nothing to increase interest rates is, of course the right decision.  This is not to say that the position should not be kept under close scrutiny.  If towards the end of this year interest rates are forced up by external factors, then we would have to consider this area very carefully indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned the success of the self-assessment system.  The changes in Chapter II of the Bill bringing self-assessment to a current year basis represent a logical move and one which I welcome.  If we are to have a proper system of self assessment it should be on the basis of current year income.  The Minister is absolutely correct when he says this would bring greater certainity and efficiency to the system.  It would undoubtedly have advantages for the tax collector but it would also have advantages for those of us who pay taxes. Lower compliance costs in the long term will assist those paying tax on the self assessment system.  I am and I have always been a believer in a common system of tax for all based on income.  The self assessment system based on current year incomes brings us very close to that objective.  When the system is operational it will be necessary to ensure that there is equality in terms of the remissions and allowances.  In this regard submissions being made on behalf of those who are being brought into the self assessment system demand careful consideration. Arguments being put forward by the self-employed and by some farmer organisations at present have a great deal <Col N="279" /> of logic in them and they must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely referred to inequalities in the residential property tax system. The failure of the residential property tax system to discriminate in favour of the person who is in the process of buying a house is a serious anomaly and one that will now have to be addressed.  It is exacerbated by the rising market trend in house prices in the greater Dublin area. For example, in my own town of Bray, the price of houses has escalated dramatically in recent times, yet the income in those households has not increased dramatically.  In some cases, because of the artificial increase in house prices, people have been tripped over and are now in the residential property tax net. Those people who are paying increased mortgages and who find themselves in this circumstances have a right to feel poorly done by.  It will be necessary to introduce some amendment to the residential property tax system to take account of the mortgage holder.  That is a point that has been made by a number of speakers and it is one which I emphasise.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas which demand some comment.  The announcement made by the Minister that the 10 per cent tax concession on manufacturing is to be extended to the year 2010 is very good news.  I am at a loss as to how The Workers' Party can make objection to this initiative.  I do not think any serious politician who is interested in progress, development and jobs could possibly object to it, particularly when we take into account that the Minister has begun to address the obvious anomalies in this aspect of our tax system.  The Minister's decision to get rid of what he has in his own inimitable style classified as the Disneyland schemes is welcome.  I was a little dismayed by the suggestion of Deputy Noonan of Fine Gael that this decision would inevitably lead to an increase in costs in items such as bottled gas and coal.  That is surely suggesting to those people who produce bottled gas and to those who distribute coal that they <Col N="280" /> should increase their costs.  I felt it was uncharacteristic of Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <P>When he has had the opportunity to consider the matter further I am sure he will have the same regrets about his indiscretion as I have. The extension of the urban renewal taxation benefits to 31 May 1990 is welcome. Today, in a hotel not far from here, many of us had good news that the end of years of lobbying has finally borne fruit.  If Deputy Mac Giolla has not been successful in crying in the wilderness for his pet area, at least I was successful in crying in the wilderness for Bray.  I welcome the extension of the urban renewal scheme to Bray.  It has been one of the schemes introduced in the past few years that has been remarkably successful.  It has been successful because the confidence that underpins that type of development has been created by Fianna Fáil in office. It has been successful because we have imaginative Ministers in Government.  I have no doubt that within 12 months I will be knocking on the doors of my friends the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance &mdash; those farsighted people &mdash; and I will be saying to them: &ldquo;We have now exhausted all the land in the town of Bray, please could we have some more.&rdquo;  There is no doubt, looking around the country, one finds that the urban renewal scheme has been a remarkable success.  The jobs done at the West Gate in Wexford, at Merchant's Road in Galway, the work being done in Limerick and, of course, in the Christ Church area in Dublin is praiseworthy. This is an inspired scheme.  I believe the scheme is well focused.  My belief in the scheme has been reinforced today by the decision of the Minister for the Environment with the support of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, and the rest of his colleagues in Government, to extend this very worthwhile scheme to the town of Bray. This comes at a time when the Government have made another inspired <Col N="281" /> decision regarding the town of Bray, which was to extend the higher rate of industrial grant to the entirety of County Wicklow, making Bray the best place in Ireland &mdash; north east Wicklow &mdash; for any investor.</P>
      <P>Other changes have been made in the Finance Bill which are welcome.  Another change which commends itself was the Minister's decision to intervene in the operation of the BES.  The BES is worthwhile and I am prepared to give credit, as has been suggested to me from time to time, for those occasional successes to Fine Gael Ministers.  The BES was a successful scheme, of course made more successful when Fianna Fáil came into office and extended and focused it properly.</P>

      <P>The decision to change the operation of the BES is very welcome. The schme had begun to fall into an element of disrepute.  The way it had been operated to effectively give its benefits to non-risk capital clearly was not intended when the scheme was established and was undermining the benefits coming from the scheme.  Therefore, the Minister is to be congratulated on his decision to get rid of the anomaly and to focus on risk bearing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey discussed the extraordinary situation where some local authorities were facing taxation charges before the courts at the hands of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister's decision was very sensible and was made in a situation where one public authority would sue another in the High Court at the expense of the taxpayer.  That is to be done away with.  This is in line with a tidying up procedure which has been undertaken over the last two or three years and is one of the highest success areas operated not just by this Minister <Col N="282" /> but by his predecessor and by the Minister for the Environment to effectively stop circular transfers where we have anomalies that cost the taxpayer and achieve nothing.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Finance Bill marks, to my mind and I think to the minds of many fair minded persons, a watershed.  It is unique in its complexity, and is extraordinarily complex.  The Bill runs to 130 pages <i>in toto</i>.  It is undoubtedly one of the longest Finance Bills introduced in this House in my memory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;generating this sort of stuff and I have never seen another Finance Bill which was so well drafted and focused.  It has been identified as such by others, including Fine Gael Deputies who have contributed here.  I have every confidence that in the last three years a Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil led Government in this case &mdash; have put this country back on the road to economic recovery.  I have no doubt that the Finance Bill which has been introduced by Deputy Albert Reynolds, Minister for Finance, will continue that good work.  I have no doubt that secretly, in spite of the fact that Opposition Deputies have conjured up artificial claims against this Bill, they are in admiration of what the Minister for Finance has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has done us all a great benefit on the taxation side. There is an incisiveness here which has been missing on the taxation debate for a long number of years.  I accept that, because of the changing political climate or the change to a more mature political climate, it is easier to effect these changes, but we are now in sight of our ultimate aim, and not just our aim but the aim shared by the sensible parties &mdash; not by some of the nonsensical parties &mdash; of the type of equitable tax system we all <Col N="283" /> desire.  The change to a current year basis for self-assessment and the consequential provisions are very welcome changes indeed.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that these taxation changes will in the years ahead be seen as a turning point.  In spite of what Deputy Mac Giolla said, the changes in corporation tax and capital gains tax are inspirational, and well focused and they have been accepted by Opposition spokespersons as such.  The changes in the whole process of tax administration are very welcome.  This is an excellent Bill which has a great deal to commend it to the House.</P>

Where are the employment prospects for those people? What about the evictions that will take place if present increases in interest rates on mortgages continue, as Deputy Roche has advocated and thanked the Minister for doing tonight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> I welcome the fact that there is a move in this finance Bill towards reforming the tax system.  Reform does not mean a reduction in taxation. It means a change in the focus of taxation.  We need to create a greater incentive to work, and that is not there at the moment.  Not enough employment is being created, and we must consider all the costs employers have to meet.  At the moment the employers are the Government's whipping boys.  They are being whipped every minute of the day for not creating more private sector employment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and I am very surprised the Minister for Finance did not rap his Cabinet colleagues and backbenchers on the knuckles for saying very nasty things about private sector employers not getting their act together to create employment.  I know the Minister does not like what I have to say but because of his collective responsibility he can say nothing about it.</P>

      <P>I look at this Finance Bill to see how it will create jobs for the young people who are emigrating from Kilkenny and from other areas in my constituency.  I want to look at it to see what I can do to protect viable industries like Mahon and McPhillips because of the competitive forces acting in this economy and the high costs in terms of interest rates and of labour, energy and transport costs.  It is because of our position on the periphery of Europe that we must be addressing the uncompetitive forces in our economy to make our industries more competitive abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is a very important contributor to our economy and it was galling to see the Minister for Finance when we are expecting farm incomes to be down by £350 million in 1990, coming <Col N="286" /> home with £87 million from Europe and claiming that he had done a great day's work.  I am not surprised that there are splinter groups in the farming organisations. They are not happy with the leadership of the farm organisations and Deputies opposite know that.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister for Finance to consider an amendment that will be tabled on inheritance tax. That issue is causing great difficulties for the farming community.  It was never intended that milk quotas should be treated as a capital asset for the purpose of calculating that tax and the Minister is aware of that.  It is my hope that he will address that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have addressed it more than anybody else in the last 15 years.  I am surprised at Deputy Hogan.  I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and to respond as comprehensively as I can in the time available to the major issues which were raised.  Other points relating to individual sections of the Bill can be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan in his opening contribution dwelt strongly on his contention that, as he put it, &ldquo;the budget is going off the rails&rdquo; and asserted that there would be a significant budget overrun in 1990. In the light of current trends, there is no basis for this view.  While the end-March Exchequer returns showed that borrowing for the first quarter was higher than expected, this was due in the main to a number of once-off timing factors affecting both expenditure and tax receipts &mdash; which should correct themselves as the year progresses.  The underlying figures are running broadly in line with the budget forecast.  The tax revenue picture is satisfactory and does not support Deputy Noonan's argument that the budget arithmetic was based on an over-optimistic estimate of tax buoyancy. Indeed, some outside commentators said at the time that my Department had been over-cautious in their revenue forecasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I accept that there is no room for complacency in regard to the public finances.  I said at the time of the publication of the first quarter Exchequer <Col N="287" /> returns that the Government will be monitoring trends closely over the remainder of the year, in the light of developments at home and abroad, so as to ensure that the budget targets are achieved again this year.</P>
    <P>The Bill to establish the debt management office is at a very advanced stage of preparation and I expect to be able to introduce it shortly.  I do not see any difficulty in setting up the office within the general timescale I indicated in my budget speech and in staying within the estimate for debt servicing costs this year.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy questioned with &ldquo;anecdotal evidence&rdquo; whether the pace of economic activity is faltering.  In relation to 1990 of course, few statistics are yet available.  However, some of the few available are worth mentioning. Registrations of new cars in Dublin, which are a useful pointer to the overall position, are performing satisfactorily and are well in line with the forecast level of sales for the year as a whole.  Leaving cars aside, the value of retail sales countrywide to end-February was close to 7 per cent up on the corresponding period of 1989.  These figures suggest an overall volume increase of about 2.5 per cent.  One must take into account also that anticipation of the reduction of VAT from 1 March may have temporarily altered underlying trends.</P>
    <P>As to the Deputy's remarks about the building sector, the monthly index of employment in private firms for February last &mdash; the latest available &mdash; shows an increase of 10 per cent in employment in the first two months of this year compared with 1989.  While exports are not moving ahead as rapidly as in recent years, trade data to the end of February confirm solid volume growth more or less in line with expectations at budget time, and industrial output data for January underpin the trade data.</P>
    <P>Overall, there is no reason at this stage to alter the Department of Finance's post-budget forecast for the economy. We will of course be monitoring the position closely as the year develops, as I have already indicated.</P>
    <P>A key point in Deputy Noonan's comments related to the direction of fiscal <Col N="288" /> policy over the next few years.  He advocated revising and strengthening the objective which I announced in my budget speech of reducing the debt ratio towards 100 per cent of GNP in the period to 1993.  I agree with his desire to make substantial progress on this front, but I believe in targets which, while ambitious, are realistically so.  They are the only ones worth setting.  When targets are clearly unachievable, the will to try to attain them evaporates, and, as clearly happened in the past, no progress is made.</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy genuinely want to aim for an end-1993 debt-ratio of 75 per cent of GNP?  To achieve such a target would require progressive improvement so as to have a negative Exchequer borrowing requirement, that is a surplus, of more than 10 per cent of GNP by 1993. This would require an unsustainable adjustment.  It would require from next year, by comparison with 1990 policies, an average net reduction in annual expenditure of some £2 billion or an increase in taxation of the same order each year for the next three years.  The Deputy conveniently avoids addressing how this would be done or how, at the same time, we would accommodate further reductions in income tax rates and the requirements for approximation of our taxes with EC levels.</P>
    <P>It is all too easy to set targets but they have meaning only if they are part of a coherent overall financial and economic strategy.  The new objectives we have set are by no means unambitious.  On the contrary, as I pointed out in my budget speech, they will be difficult to achieve while at the same time addressing the other problems we are facing.  Success will depend on continuing tight control of expenditure and, in part, on the continuation of a reasonably favourable international climate.  If conditions should enable us to do better we will of course do so, as we have done in the past three years.</P>
    <P>Given the huge progress made since 1986 in improving the public finances, there should be no doubt about the Government's determination to continue the process.  Having said this, I do not want to appear to be at odds with Deputy Noonan in his underlying proposition in <Col N="289" /> which he is absolutely correct.  The national debt has not disappeared.  It is still increasing in absolute terms and there is a major overhang of debt which is burdening the economy.  The only way we can achieve our economic and social objectives is to reduce that burden further. As I said when I was opening this debate there is no room for relaxation in our efforts to improve the public finances.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte have suggested, we do have a successful policy approach which is achieving results and is leading to more jobs and lower emigration.  We would all like to see more rapid growth in employment to match the very rapid growth in the potential labour force.  The fact that employment is not growing as fast as one might wish does not mean that we are not making good progress on the employment front or that there is some alternative magical formula to transform the jobs situation overnight.  The challenge to translate economic growth into more jobs is the challenge facing the Government and we accept that challenge but there is no magic formula.  Let us look at the facts.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> over 60,000 jobs have been created in 1988 and 1989.  With the dramatic fall in jobs losses &mdash; notified redundancies fell by 42 per cent last year &mdash; an increasing number of these new jobs are translating into net employment growth. Last year non-agricultural employment is estimated to have increased by 1.5 per cent and this year we expect an increase of 1.75 per cent.  This is better than the annual average growth in the decade from 1960 to 1970.  In the last two years, the average live register has fallen by some 16,000 and a further large fall is expected this year.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Labour Force Survey gave the number out of work as 203,000. Taking account of the subsequent increase in employment and of the associated decline in the live register, at present there must be fewer than 200,000 without jobs on this basis.  This is, of course, far too many but, unlike the situation prior to the programme, unemployment is now falling, as I have said.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies need to catch up with <Col N="290" /> these facts.  During the debate I heard some formulae for employment creation being trotted out &mdash; tired old formulae &mdash; which have been abject failures here and elsewhere and which are now being discarded all over Europe.  We should all have learnt by now that sustainable job creation with improved living standards in any economy, but particularly in a small open economy such as ours, is vitally concerned with costs and competitiveness. It entails a whole range of policies including those aimed at developing our economic infrastructure, reducing the discentives in our tax system and improving productivity of labour and capital.  This is the kind of comprehensive strategy being pursued under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It has succeeded in turning around the situation on jobs and I am convinced that it is the kind of strategy which we must continue to follow if we are to to build on the progress to date.</P>
    <P>During the debate reference was made particularly by Deputy Rabbitte to the lack of improvement in real take-home pay in the past ten years.  We should probe this further to see what has really been happening.  The real take-home pay of a married worker with two children, earning the average manufacturing wage, fell by over 8 per cent in the period 1980 to 1987.  In the three years 1988 to 1990, real take-home pay of this worker will have increased by almost 4 per cent.  In an environment of high inflation and mushrooming national debt, such as we had well into the 1980's, workers' real take-home pay suffered.  It suffered first because of inflation and second because of the rising tax burden associated with servicing the national debt.  In the period 1980 to 1985 inflation averaged about 13¼ per cent per annum while in the three years 1988 to 1990 it will average about 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The moderate pay increases under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> coupled with income tax reliefs of well over £800 million, as well as low inflation, have been putting real money and purchasing power in workers' pockets in contrast with the situation for much of the 1980s.  Anyone who contends that the <Col N="291" /> policies implemented under the programme have not been favourable to workers is ignoring the facts.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Noonan when he says that the benefits of a strong currency should be automatically passed on to the consumer through price reductions.  We must achieve our objectives for lower inflation this year.  I am watching prices closely in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I should now like to deal with the points made by Deputy Noonan on interest rates.  First, there is no upward pressure on Irish interest rates at present and I do not accept that there is widespread speculation among informed commentators that such pressure is about to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to assure the Deputy that, as I stated in my budget spech, the Government's <Col N="292" /> objective is to pursue a strong currency policy within the European Monetary System and to implement whatever monetary and other measures may be necessary at any time to secure this position.  Sometimes it is necessary to maintain a level of domestic interest rates higher than we would wish in order to achieve the vital exchange rate objective.</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear again that the level of interest rates is primarily a matter for the Central Bank.  In arriving at its decisions the Central Bank will carefully weigh such matters as the position of the external reserves, currency movements, credit growth and other factors which impact on the conduct of monetary policy and on the welfare of the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>Movements in interest rates are usually influenced in the first instance, of course, by developments in the markets.  As we are a small and open economy, international trends will always have a big impact on our situation.  The markets are strongly influenced also by the general conduct of economic policy here.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the fiscal and economic policies pursued since 1987 by the Government have exerted a major positive influence on interest rates.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement has fallen from £2,145 million in 1986 to a projected £449 million in 1990.  The ratios of our national debt to GNP fell from 129 per cent in 1986 to 121 per cent in 1989 and it will fall again this year.  The current account of the balance of payments is in surplus and inflation is low.  As a result of these developments the differentials between Irish interest rates and rates abroad have improved dramatically since March 1987.  For example, in March 1987 UK interest rates were more than 3 per cent below corresponding Irish rates; they are now more than 3 per cent above them.  This is an improvement of over 6 per cent.  During the same period the differential with German rates improved by over 5 per cent.  This is a dramatic improvement in competitiveness and is the true measure of the interest rate gains arising from the policies being pursued by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also made repeated reference to a credit squeeze.  In this <Col N="293" /> connection, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the most recent banking statistics issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.  These show that in the period mid-February 1989 to end-February 1990 bank lending to the private sector increased by almost 16.5 per cent. This is over twice the growth rate projected for nominal GNP this year and does not provide evidence which would support the view that the economy is suffering because of a shortage of credit. At end-February licensed banks had, on aggregate, more secondary liquid assets then they were required to hold.  The financial markets are available to assist in ironing out imbalances between one bank and another.  The level of liquidity ratios will, of course, continue to be kept under constant review in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan alleged that I do not have an overall plan for tax reform. Where did I hear that before?  This time last year.  I totally reject this assertion. Very tangible progress has been made in the past few years, as I outlined in my opening statement.  Our plans for ongoing tax reform are set out clearly in the Programme for Government and we have made a very good start on meeting our commitments in this Finance Bill. The key elements of our approach on tax reform are: reductions in the level of personal income tax so as to achieve a standard rate of 25 per cent by 1993 and movement towards a single higher rate; expansion of the tax base through, for example, the curbing of abuses and the payment of more tax by the corporate sector; and achievement of a more efficient tax assessment, collection and enforcement system.  The Finance Bill makes significant advances under all these headings.</P>
    <P>By contrast, we heard little or nothing from Deputy Noonan on his general approach to tax reform except to suggest the re-establishment of the Commission on Taxation.  I see no need to reconstitute the commission, because the thrust of the Government's policy is very much in sympathy with the principles set down by the commission in their reports.  There has been adequate debate already.  The Government must take responsibility for <Col N="294" /> decisions and implementation of reforms.  This is what we are doing.  While on this point, it is worth noting that when Deputy Noonan was last in office the Government of which he was part failed to act to any significant degree on the commission's recommendations.  In the circumstances, his call for the reconstitution of the commission rings very hollow indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke at length about alleged inaction in relation to tax evasion. Nothing could be further from the truth. The last few years have seen the most concerted drive ever to achieve better collection and enforcement and to curb tax avoidance.  The key measures taken were as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Self-assessment procedures for the self-employed and companies were introduced; as I indicated in my opening address these procedures have been very successful leading to a significant increase in the yield from the self-employed.  The provision in the Bill for a current year basis of assessment for the self-employed will greatly facilitate the further development of self-assessment. The result will be a lower compliance burden on taxpayers and more resources freed for the pursuit of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Tax enforcement has been considerably strengthened, following the successful tax amnesty, by the granting to the Revenue Commissioners of a power to attach the financial assets of tax defaulters. This measure has been successfully used by the Revenue and, in tandem with the activities of the Revenue sheriffs, has resulted in a much tougher tax enforcement regime than was the case a few years ago.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The tax clearance procedures for public sector contracts have been extended to publicly-funded grants. The principle behind this is that tax defaulters and evaders should not be able to benefit from State-financed grants and I am sure that this is a principle with which Deputies on all sides of the House would concur.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" />&mdash;A completely new general anti-avoidance provision and various specific provisions have been introduced.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of these measures has been that the war against tax evasion has been stepped up considerably in the last three years.  The success of this campaign has been reflected in increased tax yields and, therefore, in greater equity in the tax system.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies sought an elaboration of the situation in regard to progress towards indirect tax harmonisation within the Community.  The main item settled by EC Finance Ministers during the French Presidency in the second half of last year was the outline of arrangements for payment and receipt of VAT in intracommunity trade after 1992.  Under the consensus reached, exports will continue to be zero-rated VAT purposes during a traditional period and VAT will be charged in the country where consumption of goods takes place.  The Commission is now close to completing the detailed proposals to give effect to these arrangements in a situation where border controls would not apply.  The Irish Presidency has been pressing for the production of these proposals and will have them considered in the appropriate working groups as soon as they become available.</P>
    <P>While agreement on VAT rates has not yet been reached, it was agreed last December that member states whose standard rate already falls within the range 14 to 20 per cent should not move out of that range between now and 1 January 1993; and that member states whose standard rate is outside that range should not diverge further.  Timetables were set last December for the further decisions necessary on the format and level of the proposed standard VAT rate, on the scope and levels of the reduced rates and on the products which may continue to be zero-rated from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain this mountain of progress, the Irish Presidency initiated an examination by a Council <i>ad hoc</i> group of the important issue of classification of items for the different VAT rates.  At <Col N="296" /> the meeting on 23 April, the ECOFIN Council took note of the useful progress achieved to date by this group and authorised the necessary definitional work to be undertaken in regard to those categories where there is general agreement that reduced rating should apply.  The acceptance by the Council of the progress made under the Irish Presidency is a further significant contribution towards completing the post-1992 picture.</P>

      <P>Progress in regard to excises has been slower than in the case of VAT.  In an effort to advance matters the Irish Presidency has initiated an examination of the minimum rates approach put forward by the Commission last year for alcohols, tobacco and mineral oils.  We are still awaiting promised Commission proposals on the structure of the various excises and the controls to apply to movement of excisable goods. All these proposals are interrelated and firm positions are unlikely to be taken until member states see the entire package.</P>
      <P>I would accept that there is still a long way to go and many hard decisions needed to be taken before the process is complete.  As part of this the budgetary problems facing Ireland, which, as I said earlier in the debate, are being examined by the Commission, must be resolved. Nevertheless, I believe that, with sufficient commitment from all sides, the target date of 1 January 1993 remains attainable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor was critical of the level of social welfare payments and accused the Government of being uncaring.  The 1990 budget welfare package was in fact unprecedented in its cost and scope.  The full year cost of the package, including the special tax and PRSI changes for those on low incomes, will be almost £200 million.  This reflects the priority accorded to the achievement of greater social equity by this Government.  Unemployment is at the root of poverty and we are determined to continue the progress we are now making in reducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> I would now like to turn to some general points made by Deputies or various provisions of the Bill.  I am very heartened by the general welcome which most Deputies who spoke gave to my proposals for a current year basis of assessment for all income.  There was general recognition that this change should simplify and improve the administration of the tax system with benefits for self-employed taxpayers, their agents and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies held the view that, with the change to a current year basis of assessment for self-employed taxpayers, these taxpayers should not gain entitlement to the PAYE and PRSI allowances. However, as I stated in my opening address, notwithstanding the change, important differences will still remain between the tax regime for PAYE and self-employed taxpayers.  The key differences are as follows.  Even under the current year basis the self-employed will, in general, still not be taxed on a current tax year basis, unlike taxpayers on PAYE.  They will be taxed on the profits of their accounts ending in the current tax year.  Those who have accounting periods ending early in the tax year will, in effect, remain on a preceding year basis.  Overall, therefore, the basis of assessment will remain more favourable than that for PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the tax payment arrangements will continue to be different.  Persons on PAYE will satisfy their full tax liability of the year by the end of the tax year.  By contrast, under the new arrangements, self-employed taxpayers need only pay by the end of the tax year either 90 per cent of their current liability or the full amount of their liability for the previous year.  The balance will not be due until close to the end of the following tax year.  Thus, the self-employed are more favourably treated in this regard.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the self-employed have the advantage of a considerably more liberal system in relation to the deductions they can claim for business-related expenses and loan interest than is available to PAYE taxpayers.  This facility enables them to significantly reduce their income tax liability.</P>
    <P>As regards the PRSI allowance, I <Col N="298" /> would point out that the switch to a current year basis does not affect the PRSI rate levied on the self-employed, the employee element of which is well below that paid by full-rate PAYE workers. Thus, the question of extension of the PRSI allowance does not arise.</P>
    <P>In the specific case of farmers they have further advantages, including the right to average their incomes over three years and the right to stock relief, which are not available to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of cost.  Extension of the PAYE and PRSI allowances could not be confined to the self-employed but would have to be granted to others such as proprietary directors, who although on PAYE are not entitled to the allowances.  The full year cost to the Exchequer would be almost £120 million.  The overall effect would be a major reduction in the tax burden on the self-employed and farmers.  In this regard, I should point out to Deputies that the breakdown of the total expected income tax yield for 1990 under the existing system is as follows: PAYE, £2,298 million or 88.8 per cent; farmers £50 million or 1.9 per cent and other self-employed £240 million or 9.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte expressed concern that some self-employed taxpayers might abuse the changeover to a current year basis by switching their income to the 1989-90 year which will not form the basis for an assessment.  I can assure the Deputies that this will not be the case.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the current year basis were not published until after 5 April 1990, the last possible day on which expenditure decisions could have been made with manipulation in mind.  It is possible, nevertheless, that some taxpayers may have taken a chance and made expenditure decisions for the purposes of taking advantage of the changeover. For this reason the Revenue Commissioners and their inspectors of taxes will be monitoring the situation closely.  It was partly with this in mind that I included in section 19 of the Bill a requirement for the interim return dealing with the income of the period falling out of reckoning &mdash; the 1990 income tax return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> I would also remind Deputies that the income chargeable for 1990-91 will not be returned until after 5 April 1991 &mdash; the final return filling date is 31 January 1992.  Accordingly, I will have an opportunity in next year's Finance Bill to bring forward measures to counteract any abuses found and I can assure Deputies that I will not hesitate to do so if necessary. One possible option in this regard would be to allow the inspector of taxes, subject to necessary safeguards and conditions, to base the assessment for 1990-91 on the return for 1989-90, that is on the interim return rather than that for 1990-91.  It is my earnest hope and indeed my expectation that such action will not in fact be necessary.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked for more clarification of the scope and application of section 33, which aims at narrowing the definition of manufacturing for the purpose of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  I would like at the outset to assure the House that the vast bulk of activities which now qualify for the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing will not be affected by the exclusions in section 33.</P>
    <P>When the special 10 per cent rate for manufacturing was introduced in 1980, the term manufacturing was not defined and it was intended that the concept should be interpreted in its normal everyday meaning.  Thus the intention was that it would apply to those companies which were subjecting raw materials to a process of manufacture which resulted in a new product and to companies carrying out other similar activities.  What has happened since 1980 is that this normal meaning of manufacturing has been considerably extended as a result of actions pursued by companies before the appeal commissioners and the courts to have their operations considered as coming within the ambit of manufacturing and thereby benefiting from the low 10 per cent rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Section 33 counteracts these developments by specifying particular categories as falling outside the scope of manufacturing. No genuine manufacturing is excluded under this approach.  The 10 per cent rate will accordingly continue to apply to what would commonly be held <Col N="300" /> to be manufacturing.  That is the processing of basic raw materials into a new finished commodity.  The excluded categories of activities are broadly those which either obtained the 10 per cent as a direct or indirect result of decisions of the appeal commissioners or the courts in particular cases, or which are the subject of appeal proceedings at this present juncture or which are analogous to these types of cases.  A process will not be regarded as manufacturing if it consists primarily of one of these excluded categories.</P>
    <P>Section 33, therefore, narrows the scope of manufacturing relief in a coherent and organised way.  However, there will inevitably be borderline cases.  This will always be the situation as long as manufacturing is not positively defined in the legislation.  By a positive definition I mean specified criteria which all firms would have to meet before they would get the 10 per cent rate.  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners have examined the question of such a definition but have concluded that it would mean the creation of a complex piece of legislation which would generate a much greater degree of uncertainty and inevitably lead to far more appeals to the courts.  On the other hand, a listing of more specific excluded activities, which would be very narrowly defined, rather than categories, would also be most unsuitable.  It would mean producing an initial detailed list this year which would have to be added to in every subsequent Finance Bill as a result, for example, of decisions of the appeal commissioners and the courts made in the interval between each Finance Bill.  This would also place the courts in a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>The approach in section 33 is, therefore, the most appropriate way to tackle the problem.  The section will be interpreted by Revenue so that the relief will continue to apply to all proper manufacturing activities.  If companies feel they have been unfairly excluded they will continue to have the option of taking the matter up with the appeal commissioners and the courts.</P>
    <P>The fact that meat processing, the repair and maintenance of aircraft and <Col N="301" /> the production of films are specially regarded as manufacturing in the section does not imply that all other non-specified activities will lose the 10 per cent rate.  This is done for technical drafting reasons.  The general rule will continue to be that genuine manufacturing activities will retain this rate.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Noonan raised specifically the question of food processing. I can assure him that the vast majority of food processing activities will continue to qualify for the 10 per cent rate.  I will be glad to go into greater detail on Committee Stage.  I have made our intention quite clear and will be happy to discuss the precise wording at greater length.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan claimed that the decision to extend the 10 per cent corporation tax rate beyond the year 2000 was a premature one and that the question was not considered in any proper fashion.  This was certainly not the case. It was, in fact, indicated on a number of occasions last year that the matter was being considered.  The CII and other organisations had sought an early decision because the time horizon for international business planning is such that industrial location plans are now being made for the period extending far beyond the year 2000.  The IDA were being pressed by foreign investors about the post-2000 position.  The question was examined in the first instance by an international specialist consultancy group which compared Ireland's international competitiveness for internationally mobile investment with that of other regions in the EC.  The Government decision was arrived at following the consideration of these and other relevant factors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also asked if EC permission was needed for the extension. The position is that such permission is not needed in the case of manufacturing industry.  EC clearance is, however, needed in the case of non-manufacturing activities.  My Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce have already been in touch with the Commission on this question.</P>
    <P>The extension of the 10 per cent rate is not affected by any EC proposals for <Col N="302" /> harmonisation of corporation tax rates. There are, in fact, no such proposals at present &mdash; earlier proposals have been overtaken by events &mdash; and the Commission have recently withdrawn them. The emphasis now is on tax measures to facilitate cross-Border mergers and co-operation arrangements between companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan claimed that, as a result of corporation tax concessions in the Bill, no additional corporation tax revenue would now be forthcoming to help finance the necessary reduction in income tax over the next few years.  This is not correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to express my thanks to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening.</P>
      <P>A very strange, inexplicable and totally unacceptable situation has developed in regard to the training courses organised by FÁS.  No fewer than 45 members of the staff of FÁS were summarily laid off on Friday last.  Seven of those worked in the Cookstown section of FÁS in Tallaght. They were actively engaged in teaching courses &mdash; many of them intensive &mdash; to approximately 500 trainees. Among the courses affected &mdash; and this is not a comprehensive list &mdash; are the women into industry course, which was very worth while and well supported, courses on dressmaking, upholstery and a wide range of other skills.  Having gone half way through the courses the people who were attending them now find themselves in the amazing position of being discarded.  They were supposed to have been given a course running for 16 weeks but now, after only eight weeks, the course suddenly comes to an end.  These people were told that they need not attend any more but that if matters could be organised and staff got back, they will be sent for to resume the course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What way is that to run a State agency? These courses were critical and important. People were motivated to undertake these courses, to apply themselves to the courses and they acquired a tremendous interest in the work being done there, particularly in the women into industry course.  I spoke to some of the women who have been involved and they told me they were intensely interested in the course, that they were enjoying it and felt it was extremely worth while.  They just could not believe, and neither could I, that half way through the course, they were told that the instructor had been laid off.  All the students agreed that these instructors and <Col N="307" /> tutors were first class dedicated people doing a fine job.  However, they were summarily laid off and told that their services were no longer required.</P>
    <P>This has happened to 45 staff members, some of whom have been working for FÁS in excess of two years. After two years' dedicated service they were summarily dismissed and told their services were no longer required.  There are 500 trainees around the country who have had their courses interrupted.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Labour is not here this evening.  I am sure he is busily engaged elsewhere and I accept that.  I gather the Minister for Education is here to deal with the matter on his behalf.  There is only one thing that would be acceptable to the House tonight and that is to be told by the Minister that this will be rectified immediately and that the necessary arrangements will be made to bring in whatever staff are necessary to complete these courses and to ensure that the repeat courses to be organised within the next few months will be organised and carried on in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>These lay-offs may be the result of the Government's programme of cutbacks. The Government say they are organising a fine scheme of FÁS training courses, yet they implement cutbacks in staff and apply embargos to tutors, teachers and trainers.  What is the point in saying that Government policy is to train people in important functions which are considered to be necessary if we do not provide the staff to do it?  These lay-offs are totally unacceptable, this decision is inexplicable.</P>
    <P>Not alone were these courses not completed but a very dastardly trick was played these people.  They were encouraged to get involved in these courses, to develop an interest in them and then all of a sudden, on two or three days' notice, they were told the course had to end and that they will let these people know if they can sort matters out with the staff.</P>
    <P>These staff are dedicated people who want to work.  The money they are being paid is modest in the extreme. These people are skilled in dressmaking, <Col N="308" /> upholstery and other important areas. They have been shoved onto the dole queue now.  The students who were in the middle of the courses are anxious to complete them but are now forced to sit at home.  What are we at?  What is the Minister thinking of?  I hope the Minister will be able to assure the House that an end will be put to this ridiculous nonsense quickly and that these courses can resume this week, or if not, next week at the very latest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Taylor for raising this matter in the form of a question today and now on the Adjournment debate.  I would like to apologise for my collegue, Deputy Ahern, Minister for Labour, who is otherwise engaged in Europe on EC Presidency business.  He asked me to say he is keeping in contact on the matter.  I will give details of the events to date and what it is hoped will happen.  Deputy Taylor knows, as indeed do Members of this House, that FÁS came about as the result of an amalgamation of the National Manpower Service, AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  Everybody more or less agreed that a merger of these bodies was a good development.  The amalgamation involved over 2,400 staff at 70 locations throughout the country. Because of the different staffing structures in each of those three bodies, it was to be expected that in the start-up years there would be some teething problems. In fact there have been very few serious difficulties.  It is a tribute to all concerned that the amalgamation of these agencies went so smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS have been in operation for over two years and the Minister, for whom I am standing in tonight, is satisfied that FÁS services are being delivered in a more co-ordinated and effective manner. The training in FÁS centres is provided mainly by permanent FÁS staff.  In addition, a number of contract instructors have been engaged to optimise training centre facilities.  The staff unions have pressed for permanent posts in place of <Col N="309" /> the contract staff, and 20 additional permanent appointments were sanctioned within the past number of weeks.  The union are pressing for further appointments at both instructor and clerical level and have indicated that they intend to take a form of industrial action which would result in the suspension of training courses.</P>
    <P>This is the reason that Deputy Taylor has put his case to the House tonight and he has given details of the various courses for women returning to work, for example, upholstery, which will be affected.  I am glad to say that industrial action has, however, been deferred by the union following a request by FÁS for a time lapse of one week to allow for further consultations and discussion.  I have not got the exact numbers of trainees that FÁS are able to accommodate during this week, but I asked this question and I have been informed they are endeavouring to accommodate as many as possible.  I know Deputy Taylor will appreciate that this is a sensitive issue at this time and that comment outside the appropriate negotiation mechanisms would not be helpful.  I quite understand that this is the time for raising matters but the Deputy can be sure that the Minister for Labour, who is currently abroad on EC Presidency business, has been keeping in close touch with the situation and is, in fact, reasonably hopeful that further discussions will ensure which will enable a satisfactory outcome to be achieved, for which we all wish.  As I have said, I know that the Minister for Labour who will return shortly, has been keeping in touch with the matter and is anxious that there will be a satisfactory outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the <Col N="310" /> opportunity of bringing this very important matter before the Dáil so quickly. Very often the Standing Orders of this House are criticised for not being sufficiently flexible to enable urgent pressing matters to be discussed; no such criticism can be levelled in this case.</P>
      <P>A few short weeks ago, Dáil Éireann passed the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, which is enabling legislation for the setting up of representative associations for members of the Permanent Defence Forces.  All of us concerned with that legislation were astounded to learn of a development in the Defence Forces which is totally at variance with the promises repeatedly made to us in this House.  In essence, a group of seven officers, the Gleeson team, were asked officially to draw up ideas and plans for the officers representative association. They did this and produced a draft constitution. The general staff did not like what they produced and the designated officers were summoned to Army headquarters and were told that the tenor of the document was gravely and seriously at variance with the military ethos expected of professional officers.  They were asked to withdraw the draft constitution. They were reprimanded and we understand that, not surprisingly, they felt humiliated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all stages of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, indeed at practically every intervention, assurances were given by the Minister for Defence that this would be a process of consultation and nothing would be imposed on anybody. They were seeking the views of members of the Defence Forces and there would be no impositions.  They were trying to reach consensus, agreement and accord.  We were told this was the reason that it was to be done by regulations and not by legislation.  What went wrong?  What now of the promises that were given to us across the floor on innumerable times?  We argued about this and suggested that the major part of the framework should be in the Bill, by way of legislation.  We tabled amendments to achieve that but the Minister wanted to do it by a process of consultation.  The core value of the Minister's operation was that it would be done by way of <Col N="311" /> consultation and discussions with members of the Defence Forces.  We now see the results of that.  We have a defective Act and much sooner than anybody expected, we see the results that has generated. I am afraid to say that we now have a new version of what is meant by consultations, that is you can have them provided that the conclusions of the consultations are the way the general staff like it.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way, and I want to make this point very clear, blaming the General Staff for not liking what was produced by the designated team.  The commanding officers in charge are very experienced people.  They should have, and of course they have, very firm ideas on what is or is not at variance with the military ethos.  That is fair enough, but if they do not like the message does that mean that they should treat the people who brought it, in the way these officers have been treated?  This team, the experienced Gleeson team, are carrying out the exercise specifically at the request of the Minister and the military authorities. Is that what the Minister meant when he promised us consultations?  Is this an exercise of democracy within the Army, which we heard so much about during the passage of the Bill?  Are we now discovering the real reason that the Minister was being advised to be so inflexible on the issue of regulations in preference to our suggestions on this side of the House that the matter should be incorporated in legislation?</P>
    <P>The Minister is the person who asked this team to stay together to get the officers' ideas on an officers representative association.  I ask the Minister what brief was given to this team?  I also want to know whether he had been informed, before it became public knowledge through the media, that the team were to be reprimanded and that they were being asked to withdraw their draft constitution? Will the Minister now ensure that the draft constitution will be published and made available throughout the Army as part of the consultative process? Would the Minister not agree that any further meaningful consultation is at risk and will be extremely difficult, in view <Col N="312" /> of what has happened to the officially appointed team of officers who were doing this work?  How does the Minister propose to remedy this?  I would also like to ask the Minister what input the officers who will be elected through the due process which will be set up will have in deciding the constitution and the structure of the representative association. Finally, will the format of the association be something like what we were told so many times across the floor of this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon for giving me the opportunity to make a contribution on this debate.</P>
      <P>I was utterly appalled on hearing of the disciplinary action taken last week against officers in the Defence Forces. I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.  These officers, with the consent of the Minister, were employed to prepare a draft constitution for their representative association.  It was agreed in this House that this was to be a consultative document, and no more.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the Defence (Amendment) Bill although I differed substantially with the Tánaiste on many aspects of it.  The Bill left the House with our understanding and the Minister's word that there would be wide-ranging consultation prior to and immediately following the internal election process. During the debate I stated very clearly that, notwithstanding the Tánaiste's stated support for the Bill, it was imperative that we discuss it line by line.  I felt strongly about it because it was my firm belief that at the highest level of command within the Defence Forces there would be objections and resentment to the whole concept of representative bodies and I regret that this has been borne out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the previous Minister not stated the opinion of the Defence Forces headquarters on this matter, that the granting of a representative body would be against the whole ethos of the Army structure, or words to that effect?  I understand that was stated in this House.  I regret also that PDFORRA are finding the same resentment among certain people in the Defence Forces.  I would say very clearly <Col N="313" /> that the Minister must immediately take charge and ensure that the full consultative process is not put at risk and that the views of the Oireachtas are carried through.  Obstructionist policies cannot be allowed hinder the proper consultation process.  I hope that message will be brought clearly not only to the Minister but to the generals at the top.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other Deputies in thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of raising this very important and fundamental matter.  I join with Deputy Nealon in seeking on explanation and further assurances from the Minister and from the Minister of State who is present. The obvious facts seem to indicate that these officers, who were represented in the public gallery here during the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, clearly did no more than act on what they had heard the Tánaiste say during the debate on the Bill.  To suggest that they have committed some form of an offence is an affront to the notion of democracy, debate and discussion and flies totally in the face of what the Tánaiste publicly invited them to do in his remarks during the debate.  What has happened vindicates the view taken by the Opposition parties in the Dáil, that we should have written into the Bill basic fundamentals with regard to what the Oireachtas felt should be the direction in which discussions would go and what would be the essential features of the structures when introduced.  This is another example where a blunt guillotine applied by Government has produced the type of results that none of us like to see.  I hope a lesson can be learned from this by the Minister of State who is also Chief Whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In adopting the arguments put by the other two Deputies, I would ask the Minister of State to undertake in the Department the following steps to try to retrieve the matter.  The document, as published and prepared by a team of representatives, should now be sought out by the Department and circulated to every member of the officer corps of the Defence Forces in the same fashion as the document prepared by the Chief of <Col N="314" /> Staff before we debated the Bill was circulated with a covering letter of endorsement from the Tánaiste indicating that this was a discussion document and a document that was being circulated for the opinion and advice of the members. I would ask the Tánaiste or the Minister of State to ensure that this is done as a first step, recognising the consultation to follow.  I would also ask that he let it be known to the Chief of Staff, officers and others involved that all ideas are open for discussion at this stage and that no one sector should seek to dominate, calling or pulling rank.</P>
    <P>There is a very important point to be made here, that reference to the 1954 Act, to regulations or any other earlier notion of ethos or tradition should not be relied on to stifle or hinder discussion or debate on any ideas that are put forward. I would ask the Tánaiste or the Minister of State present to underline that basic principle.  We are breaking new ground. New rules and regulations will apply and it is not helpful to harp back to old ideas. If the reprimand represents a mark on the character of the officers I would ask the Tánaiste or the Minister of State to seek to have the reprimand withdrawn and establish again the <i>status quo</i> so that we can progress at least along the lines of the indications and assurances given by the Tánaiste during the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, provides for the establishment of representative associations in the Defence Forces.  The commitment to the establishment of representative associations stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the undertakings given to this House by the Minister for Defence, the first election will be conducted under the general supervision of the principal officer in charge of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment.  He will determine, on the basis of submissions from interested parties, the procedures for the election of representatives.  The process has already begun and in order that the elections can be held as soon as possible the head of the franchise section has invited submissions <Col N="315" /> from individuals and groups of individuals within the Permanent Defence Force on the structures into which representatives will be elected; the electoral system to be used; the constituencies to which the election will relate; the number of representatives to be elected; arrangements for the conduct of the elections; and any other relevant matter.  The franchise officer is available for discussions with interested parties.  Submissions are to be forwarded to him by 9 May.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of a constitution for an officers' association the position is that the franchise officer is primarily concerned with the electoral system to be employed.  After elections have taken place, discussions with the elected representatives of Defence Forces personnel will be held to settle the detailed arrangements for representative associations.  It is at this stage that issues such as draft constitutions will be considered in detail.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, three representative teams were formed to present the views of privates, NCOs and officers to the Gleeson Commission.  These teams have been requested to make submissions to the franchise officer.  I wish to emphasise that this process is proceeding as planned.</P>
    <P>As to reports in the news media over the past few days about action taken against military officers by the military authorities, I wish to make it clear that no officer incurred a reprimand as such in military terms.  A meeting with the officers' team did take place during which <Col N="316" /> they were told, I am given to understand, that in the present context they should concentrate their efforts on the electoral process pursuant to the request for submissions made by the franchise officer. The purpose of the meeting, I gather, was to clarify the situation and to remove any misunderstanding as to the nature of the present part of the exercise and to ensure that issues extraneous to the immediate objective to holding democratic elections would not delay that process.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise very strongly that the duly elected representatives will be given every opportunity to participate in the drawing up of the new arrangements before the associations are established and before the Defence Force regulations are made.  Clearly, that is the best way to proceed to ensure that a system emerges which will have the confidence of all concerned. There is no question of disciplinary action being taken against anyone.  Commitments given on behalf of the Government during the passage of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, will be honoured in full.  I have noted the comments of the speakers here tonight and I shall certainly pass them on to the Minister for Defence.

    <P>Where there is an outbreak of salmonellosis an investigation is carried out by the health board through the director of community care and his team to determine and isolate the cause of the outbreak.</P>
    <P>There were three significant outbreaks of salmonellosis which contributed to the increased figures for 1989.  Apart from these outbreaks it is difficult to say to what extent the increased figures for 1989 may be due to an increase in the incidence of salmonellosis generally or an improvement in notifications to my Department following on an increased public awareness to the risks of salmonellosis.</P>

      <P>The food hygiene regulations were last updated by amendment regulations which came into effect on 1 May 1989. However, implementation of the directive on the official control of foodstuffs will entail further amendment of these regulations and of food legislation generally. The Food Safety Advisory Committee is at present considering proposals for amending legislation and other measures necessary to give effect to the directive and will make recommendations as soon as possible.  Approximately 90-100 environmental health officers are currently engaged in food inspection duties.  I do not envisage that implementation of the directive will entail appointment of additional staff by health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to solvent abuse the annual report on vital statistics classifies deaths under the following headings:</P>
      <P>International Classifications of Diseases (ICD) Codes 981 and 982, referring to the toxic effects of petroleum products and non-petroleum based solvents respectively, and ICD Code 304 which relates to deaths due to drug dependence which includes glue sniffing.</P>
      <P>The most recent Report on Vital Statistics, 1986, records six deaths in these categories.</P>
      <P>In relation to the age profile of the six deaths notified one was in the age group ten-14, two were aged 20-24, a further two were between 25-35 and one in the 45-49 age group.</P>
      <P>The likelihood is that official figures underestimate the numbers of deaths where the underlying cause is solvent abuse, since such deaths may be classified under differenct headings, e.g. cardiac arrests or respiratory causes.</P>
      <P>A huge variety of consumer products contain solvents.  As it would be unrealistic to completely ban the sale of these products to children, a provision is included in the Child Care Bill, 1988, to make it an offence for persons to sell or make available solvent-based products to children where it is known or suspected that they are likely to be abused.  It is proposed that persons found guilty of this offence would be liable to a fine of up to £1,000 or to 12 months imprisonment or both.  These are very stiff penalties and they underline the seriousness with which the Government view this kind of activity.</P>
      <P>Legislation, of itself, is not the complete answer to this problem.  The creation of greater awareness of the dangers of solvent abuse, among children, among parents, among those who work with children and among traders is also important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has prepared an information programme which focuses on the role of traders and of parents and those who <Col N="49" /> work with young people.  The programme was prepared in consultation with the various professional and trade associations and consists of an information booklet for parents/guardians and professionals and an additional information leaflet and point of sale warning stickers for retailers.  The booklet gives detailed information about solvent abuse and describes many aspects of the problem. The retailers leaflet provides summary information and suggests ways in which retailers can exercise vigilance over solvent-based products on general sale. These materials are available on an ongoing basis from the health promotion unit and from health board offices.</P>

      <P>In any case where an allegation is made about the safety of an Irish product all necessary steps are taken to verify this.</P>
      <P>In a recent case, regarding the claimed association between an Irish cheese manufactured from unpasteurised milk in Cork and an outbreak of salmonella in the UK samples of the cheese were analysed at laboratories in both Ireland and the UK.  Despite the fact that the results in Ireland proved negative positive results were found in nine of the 16 samples analysed in the UK Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale, London.  The variations between these findings were discussed between the Southern Health Board and Colindale and were found to be attributable to differences in test methods.  Salmonella is difficult to isolate from cheese because of the high fat content in which the organism can be protected.  Colindale used a special detergent to raise and break up the fats and used a higher incubation temperature. The Southern Health Board were satisfied that the results achieved at Colindale were accurate and in the interests of public health therefore and under its powers under the food hygiene regulations they required the cessation of production and the withdrawal and destruction of stock from distribution and retail outlets.</P>
      <P>Steps are being taken by the Southern Health Board to revise their own test methods to match that of Colindale.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if, in the light of public disquiet arising from the case of William Dunne Junior vs. Holles Street hospital, he will (1) conduct a full and open review of the entire circumstances of the case, and in particular (a) the reason the hospital did not respond satisfactorily to requests for information by the Dunne family (b) establish the reason the hospital gave apparently inadequate information to the court about its monitoring of two foetal hearts (c) establish the reason the hospital did not provide vital evidence in the case (d) establish the influence of the hospital's insurers on its handling of the case (e) request the Medical Council to conduct a formal investigation of the conduct of the practitioners involved (f) request the Bar Council to investigate the identity of the missing barristers in the case and take appropriate disciplinary action should it be necessary; and (2) consider the establishment of a statutory patients' council which, amongst other things, would operate a mechanism for considering complaints by the public about their treatment by authorities providing health services.</Quest>

      <P>It is a matter for the board of management to regulate the affairs of the hospital and if, arising out of this case, any review of policies or procedures is to be carried out it would be the responsibility of the board to do so in the first instance.</P>
      <P>However I would wish to say that if the circumstances of this or any other case point to the need for a review of policies or procedures in a particular service it would be dealt with as part of an overall review of the service concerned.</P>
      <P>While I am conscious that this was a tragic and very sad case, I am informed that the question of requests for information were dealt with by the hospital in the same way as any other requests where the possibility of legal proceedings in regard to a particular case might be indicated.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of a patient's council the Deputy will recollect that I announced the action plan for the health services on 6 February 1990.  The action plan included an initiative on the quality of patient care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the chief executive officer of each health board and the secretary/manager of each voluntary hospital to submit proposals on appropriate patient feedback or complaint mechanisms which could be introduced to deal <Col N="55" /> with complaints and to increase communication between the hospital and the patient.  These proposals will then be examined by my Department with a view to introducing suitable patient feedback mechanisms in all hospitals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 73 together.  The recent allocation from the national lottery for services for people with mental handicap is in addition to extra moneys announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>An estimated breakdown of the budget allocation of moneys for these services is set out in the tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report. Final decisions have not yet been reached on the distribution of the national lottery allocation for health services.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the practice of hospital waste from Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9 being disposed of by deep burial at a county council tiphead; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that such a practice is inherently dangerous, especially if the wastes have not been sorted, as hospital wastes contain both toxic and hazardous materials which, in the due process of time, contaminate the ground waters and thence the water courses; and the measures he intends to take to rectify this situation.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that the incinerator at Beaumont Hospital has not been in use since September 1989 and I understand that the policy of the hospital is to segregate the waste into infected and non-infected categories before disposal.  The non-infected waste is sent to a landfill site and the infected waste is incinerated off-site by private contractors and by another hospital.</P>
      <P>Incineration is the preferred method of disposal of hospital waste and my Department is investigating the feasibility of installing large central incinerators which would serve a number of hospitals and be capable of meeting stringent environmental standards.  These investigations include an assessment of the possibility of using the proposed national toxic waste incinerator and are at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>The right to treatment services for those needing medical attention is already established under the Health Acts and includes statutory entitlements to primary and secondary health care according to category eligibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the health services must also have regard to the quality of care to the patient as consumer.  Therefore the plans to improve the health services which I announced last February included measures to ensure that patients received the quality of care they are entitled to expect.  These measures, which are now being put in place, include an appeals system for applicants for medical cards and an improved appointments system for hospital out-patients clinics as well as improved information <Col N="65" /> for patients.  These measures are underpinned by the commitment of all health care workers to providing a high standard of care to patients.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, over the past decade, a number of measures have been applied to counter drug addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In more recent times, I have reviewed the legislation pertaining to controlled drugs.  The list of drugs which are controlled has been significantly extended. The Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988, have up-dated the previous regulations relating to the possession, supply, import <Col N="66" /> and export of controlled drugs.  Generally speaking, the measures previously in force will continue to apply with some tightening up in particular areas, notably in relation to prescription writing and dispensing requirements.</P>
    <P>I might add that the activities of a number of general practitioners are currently being investigated under the Misuse of Drugs Acts with a view to curbing the street availability of some of the drugs involved.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána for their part are giving as much attention as possible to the prevention and control of the misuse of drugs.  Permanent units of the Drug Squad operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Over 3,000 members of the force have completed a special intensive training course designed to ensure that each Garda division has a substantial number of members with advanced training in the prevention and detection of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the introduction of legislation providing for the seizure and confiscation of the assets of drug traffickers is being considered.  As the Deputy will appreciate this type of legislation gives rise to certain constitutional questions and has therefore been referred to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>These steps, together with the other measures already in place, will I feel, be of great benefit in the fight against drug abuse, and I can assure the Deputy that the momentum and impetus in this area will be maintained.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of services to the family in question is a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the board are providing considerable assistance to the family.  Three of the children are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, currently £47.20 per week.  A domiciliary care allowance of £79 per month is being paid to the parents in respect of the fourth child.  In addition one of the children with disabled person's maintenance allowance also receives a mobility allowance of £30 per month.  Those on disabled person's maintenance allowance automatically get free travel and two of them have unrestricted travel passes to facilitate them in attending the Rehabilitation Institute and the Irish Wheelchair Association's Activity Centre.</P>
      <P>The board has also approved of a grant to cover the cost of driving instruction for one of the children who is likely to qualify for a motorised transport grant of up to £1,500 from the health board.  I might also mention that if he were to buy a new car specially adapted for his use, he could avail of the Revenue Commissioners schemes for refund of VAT and excise duty on the car, refund of excise duty on petrol and free road tax.  The Revenue Commissioners also operate a scheme for the refund of taxes on new vans converted for the carriage of wheelchairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infected persons has been carried out at both national and international level for the past six years.  Close co-operation has been established with the EC Centre for AIDS Surveillance in Paris and the pattern of the doubling time for AIDS cases has been carefully monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial impact of the AIDS epidemic was in homosexuals and haemophiliacs but from 1985 onwards, when HIV testing became available, it was apparent that the epidemic was moving towards IV drug abusers.  At this stage AIDS cases were doubling on a nine month basis which was the classical position observed in the USA and EC countries.  During the past 12 months a change has been noted.  The doubling time of the disease in Ireland, as in most EC countries has lengthened to 15-16 months.  In the EC AIDS surveillance system to which Ireland contributes its data the doubling time is now 69 per cent <Col N="72" /> over a period of 12 months.  In addition it has been noted that the ration of drug abuse cases to homosexuals has markedly increased over the past five years.  Also, the EC surveillance system has shown a gradual but significant increase in heterosexual cases from 6.9 per cent in 1987 to 9.8 per cent in 1989.  Approximately 4 per cent of Irish cases of AIDS are heterosexual.  The lengthening of the doubling time is attributable to a change in lifestyle amongst the homosexuals. The evidence is that the number of cases among drug abusers and heterosexuals is increasing in all EC countries and the USA.  The Irish experience of the AIDS epidemic is similar to that in the USA and other EC countries.</P>
    <P>The comparable figures of cases of AIDS over the past three years are as follows: 1987 &mdash; 37; 1988 &mdash; 74; 1989 &mdash; 124; and 1990 (to date) &mdash; 142.</P>
    <P>In my reply to an earlier Parliamentary Question I set out the Government's AIDS strategy.  It is proposed to continue to develop this strategy during 1990, with particular emphasis on prevention through education and information.  Central to this will be the introduction, on a formal basis, of an AIDS educational programme in secondary schools which is due to commence in 1990.  As regards the management of cases of HIV, the EHB has recently established a 20 bed respite unit at Cherry Orchard Hospital which has direct links with St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In addition, in view of the increasing life expectancy of persons suffering from AIDS, the Department are considering the provision of domiciliary support for persons suffering from the disease.  It is envisaged that this would involve both statutory and non-statutory bodies.</P>

I indicated that I had arranged to expand services at Roscommon County Hospital, including the appointment of a consultant physician in geriatric medicine, the provision of 20 additional beds with appropriate staffing and the opening of the acute psychiatric unit.

      <P>Our efforts on behalf of Mr. Keenan involve constant contact with those whom we hope can be of assistance. Since my last statement to the House on 7 February, I have discussed the sad <Col N="83" /> situation of Brian Keenan with the Syrian Foreign Minister and, more recently during my visit to New York last week, with the Iranian Foreign Minister.  On each occasion, I renewed my appeal for assistance in obtaining information regarding Mr. Keenan's whereabouts and wellbeing and in securing his release. Both assured me of their goodwill in the matter and promised to continue to help us.</P>
      <P>Among other contacts, I would mention that our Ambassador to Syria visited Damascus in March and had discussions with the Syrian authorities.  During April, our new Ambassador to the Lebanon visited Beirut in order to renew the contacts which his predecessor had with political representatives and leaders of the main militia groups.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Vincent Brady, also discussed Mr. Keenan with the Syrian and Lebanese Defence Ministers during his visit to the Middle East in March.</P>

    <P>Where a civil servant has been formally assigned to perform the full duties of a post in a grade higher than his or her own, an allowance is paid.

    <P>Civil servants located in provincial centres can be granted career breaks of up to five years and may return to that office subject to there being a suitable vacancy.

      <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient staff to process headage payments and other applications in all the local offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>There were some special circumstances in 1989 i.e. a High Court case which delayed the issue of applications and completion of inspections and industrial action which delayed processing of grant payments in local offices which led to delays in payments for that year's schemes.  To avoid hardship to farmers, I arranged payment of 70 per cent of disadvantaged areas cattle schemes grants at the end of 1989 and for overtime working in the local offices since then to clear the backlog of payments.  As I am satisfied that this has been done and that the only cases not yet processed for payment are cases that cannot be processed in any event until the applicants concerned reply to certain queries, there is no need to appoint extra staff to clear that backlog.</P>
      <P>Total payments for 1989 schemes come to £207 million, of which £195 million has been paid, £5 million is expected to be paid by the end of this week and £3 million is expected to be paid in the first half of May, leaving £4 million outstanding on foot of query cases &mdash; which cannot be paid until applicants reply to queries raised.</P>

      <P>Some delays in payment of grants did arise as a result of a High Court case taken by some farmers against my Department last year and also as a result of the industrial action towards the end of 1989 which led to delays in the issue of applications, completion of inspections and processing of grant payments. Because I was aware that these delays might cause some hardship to farmers, I arranged for payment of 70 per cent advances of disadvantaged areas cattle schemes grants to applicants at the end of 1989.  The amount paid under all 1989 schemes now exceeds the amount paid at the same date last year.  The person named in the question has already been paid 1989 suckler cow, special beef premium and beef cow and equines headage schemes grants.</P>

      <P>Employees' entitlements are determined under collective and individual agreements on the one hand and statutory labour law on the other.</P>
      <P>The conditions under which a person is employed are governed primarily by the terms of the agreement or contract entered into by the parties.  It is these rather than the passage of any particular period of time which determine whether the employment is to be regarded as temporary or permanent.  While some agreements may provide for permanent status after a particular period of satisfactory service, this is entirely a matter for negotiation and agreement between the parties in drawing up the contract of employment.</P>
      <P>In relation to statutory labour law there are no clear cut provisions which respond directly to the question which the Deputy has put.  The employee's entitlements under a range of protective enactments, including the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1984, are determined by reference to the eligibility requirements specified in those Acts and not by the description of the individual's employment status.  These eligibility requirements generally include provisions relating to hours of work and duration of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, employees who work at least 18 hours per week and who have at least 13 weeks' continuous service with the same employer are generally entitled to a minimum period of notice on termination of employment. The Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, applies <Col N="102" /> in general to employees who work at least 18 hours per week and have at least a year's continuous service with the same employer.  Employees with two years' continuous service, or more, who are normally expected to work at least 18 hours per week are covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1984.</P>

      <P>There is no measure of poverty levels in Ireland based on a nutritionally adequate diet corresponding to the poverty line used in the United States.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the measurement of poverty were addressed by the Economic and Social Research Institute in their report, <i>Poverty Income and Welfare in Ireland</i>, and also in their working paper on <i>Concepts of Poverty and the Poverty Line</i>.  The ESRI did not adopt the US approach but stated that no entirely satisfactory and convincing method of drawing a unique poverty line is available.  The ESRI consider that poverty can only be meaningfully interpreted, in a country such as Ireland, in the context of the standard of living and ordinary living patterns in that particular society.  They, therefore, concentrated their efforts on measuring poverty by means of a set of relative poverty lines.  I intend to continue to support their very valuable work in this area.</P>

      <P>The person concerned will reach qualifying age for retirement pension in 1994 or for old age pension in 1995.  Based on insurance /PRSI contributions definitively recorded on his behalf, he is <Col N="105" /> expected to satisfy the qualifying conditions for receipt of either of these contributory pensions even if he gets no further contributions reckonable for those pensions.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for an old age contributory pension it is necessary to have a minimum average of at least 20 contributions recorded from 1953 or from date of entry into insurable employment, whichever is the later, up to the last contribution year before reaching pension age.  Entitlement to retirement pension is subject to an average of not less than 24 contributions.</P>
      <P>In this case the records of my Department show that a total of 1,011 reckonable contributions have been recorded up to 5 April 1989 &mdash; the most recent year for which records are available.  This represents a yearly average of 24 contributions for the period 1953 to 1995 &mdash; the year he reaches pension age.  This average would result in a pension at the current weekly rate of £54.90 for a single person or £92.90 for a married pensioner whose spouse is under 66 years of age. The 1,011 contributions recorded exclude certain contributions since 1984-85.</P>
      <P>The contribution record of the person concerned is at present under investigation for 1984-85 and subsequent years. The results of these investigations may result in prospective entitlement to a higher rate of pension.  When investigations are completed he will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>
      <P>I must stress that the information contained in this reply is not a formal decision on pension entitlement.  It is not possible to give a formal decision so far in advance of pension age.  The reply provides an indication of entitlement based on existing social welfare legislation.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance. On 7 March 1990 he appealed the means assessed against him.  Arising from contentions he has made in connection with his appeal it was decided that further inquiries were necessary before his case could be submitted to an appeals officer. The social welfare officer will call on him on Thursday this week in connection with the matters which require clarification.</P>
      <P>His appeal will then be submitted without delay to an appeals officer.  The appeals officer will decide, in accordance with regulations which permit him to do so, whether his appeal is such that it can properly be dealt with summarily or whether there should be an oral hearing. No distinction is made between farm and non-farm cases in deciding whether there should be an oral hearing.</P>

      <P>My Department's personnel policy for 1990 allows health agencies flexibility to make permanent or temporary appointments within the parameters of their financial allocation and an overall establishment ceiling.  Accordingly, the Eastern Health Board have authority to revise their staffing mix in accordance with service priorities while adhering to overall financial and staffing targets.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy the Eastern Health Board are currently reviewing their staffing requirements in the supplementary welfare service and as an interim measure, arrangements have been made to place some additional staff in area 5 where the situation is particularly pressing.</P>
      <P>It is inaccurate to suggest that community welfare officers on leave are frequently not replaced.  As a general rule, replacements are provided for all planned leave and for most unplanned absences. In a small number of instances it is not possible to provide a replacement where the absence occurs without notice but even in such cases, a replacement is always provided not later than the third day of absence.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the stress factor inherent in the role of the supplementary welfare service, the Eastern Health Board includes stress management as a component of its training programme for community welfare officers.</P>

      <P>The question of the approval of orthodontic treatment for the person concerned is a matter for the Western Health Board.  Priority in the provision of other-dontic treatment is granted to children in accordance with the severity of their orthodontic problem.  Because of the protracted nature of orthodontic treatment, it is not possible to indicate when the person referred to, who is in the third priority grouping, will be called.  The arrangements for the delivery of orthodontic treatment are under review at present and it is expected that the posts of consultant orthodontist for the health board dental service will be readvertised shortly with improved conditions of service. One of these appointees would be based in the Western Health Board and it is anticipated that the filling of this vacancy would bring about a considerable improvement in the waiting times for orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>The Government made a special allocation of £300,000 available to the health boards late in 1989 to bring about an improvement in orthodontic services, while a further allocation from the 1990 budget provision of £3 million for dental services brings to about £1 million the additional amount provided for orthodontic services in recent months.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for the Registrar-General of Births, Debaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There is a procedure under the law whereby, in cases of error, the records can be amended to ensure that death certificates issued will contain only the correct details.  I am anxious that the records should be corrected and I have been informed that when the mother of the deceased infant called to the office of the registrar-general on 11 April last, this procedure, which involves the making of a statutory declaration, was explained fully to her by registration officials.  His office is now awaiting a response from the mother to enable the matter to be rectified.  I have asked the superintentent registrar of the Eastern Health Board to follow the matter up.</P>

      <P>The great majority of publicly-employed physiotherapists work in hospitals.  There is also a limited community-based service. Up-to-date information on waiting <Col N="123" /> lists is being sought and will be forwarded to the Deputy.  In general, physiotherapy services in hospitals are provided without significant delays for patients.  I am aware, however, that in some areas patients referred to hospitals by general practitioners for out-patient physiotherapy experience a waiting time of several months.  Treatment is, of course, provided according to medical need and urgent cases receive priority.</P>
      <P>Current physiotherapy employment in the health service is in excess of 400 whole-time equivalent posts.  Within present personnel policy, health agencies have autonomy to make necessary appointments within approved employment ceilings and financial allocation.  It is estimated that the cost of physiotherapy services nationally is £6.4 million.</P>

      <P>The Working Party on Services for the Elderly <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> recommended planning norms for beds for the care of the elderly which have been accepted by my Department for planning purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for each health board to decide on the number and type of beds for the elderly in the light of national norms and local needs.  The number of beds for the elderly managed by the NWHB each year since 1980 is: 1980, 846; 1981, 888; 1982, 884; 1983, 875; <Col N="130" /> 1984, 910; 1985, 910; 1986, 905; 1987, 986; 1988, 984; 1989, 973.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a number of elderly people from the Sligo and Leitrim areas are now resident in privately run old persons homes or nursing homes for whom no maintenance is being paid by the North Western Health Board; that this is causing a great hardship to the families of a number of these people; and the criteria for payment of a subsidy for the pensions of these people, in meeting the cost of the old persons' homes or nursing homes.</Quest>

      <P>Health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in an approved nursing home under section 54, Health Act, 1970.  Nursing homes are approved by the Minister for Health.  No new nursing homes have been approved since 1980 due to financial constraints on the health services.</P>
      <P>In assessing a person as eligible for a subvention in an approved nursing home, the North-Western Health Board takes into account his or her medical condition, financial circumstances and whether alternative accommodation can be provided by the board.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, 1989, which is at Committee Stage in the Dáil, will introduce a new system of subvention.  Health boards will be able to pay a subvention towards the cost of care in any nursing home licensed by a health board.  The legislation provides for the payment of subventions on the basis of an assessment by the health board, of the person's need for nursing home care and of his or her ability to pay part or all of the costs involved.  I hope that this new system will be in place before the end of this year.</P>

These regulations apply to all teachers, including those from Northern Ireland, and I have no plans at present to change them.</P>

      <P>Article 128 of the Treaty of Rome states that, &ldquo;the Council shall, <Col N="135" /> acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the Economic and Social Committee, lay down general principles for implementing a common vocational training policy capable of contributing to the harmonious development both of the national economies and of the common market&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Article 128 refers only to vocational training.  However, Article 235 of the same Treaty states that, &ldquo;if action by the Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and this Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, take the appropriate measures&rdquo;. The provisions of Article 235 in conjunction with those of Article 128 have enabled the Community to co-operate in education policy matters up to the present in a reasonably satisfactory way.</P>
      <P>However, the impetus towards political and economic union within the Community will undoubtedly have implications for education.  Existing Treaty provisions may not be adequate to meet the aspirations and needs of the Community in the area of educational co-operation in the future.</P>

      <P>The question of appraisal of primary teachers is one which the Primary Education Review Body is considering as part of their remit and I would not wish to pre-empt their recommendations on the matter by making a statement.  I would, however, wish to draw attention to the fact that inspection of the work of teachers is provided for in Rule 161 of the Rules for National Schools and that the procedures therein were revised and up-dated by Circular No. 31/82.</P>
      <P>In the case of post-primary teachers, it is a function of inspection to report on teachers performance in schools.  Inspection procedures are formalised, in the case of vocational teachers, in my Department's Circular No. 43/85.</P>
