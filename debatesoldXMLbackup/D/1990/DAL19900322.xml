      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Last night I welcomed the fact that the Minister had introduced a number of changes into the Social Welfare Bill.  I welcomed the fact that he had introduced a clothing allowance for social welfare recipients which will come into effect next September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to hear the Deputy in possession.  Ciúnas le d'thoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> This allowance is welcome.  There is a particular difficulty for people in receipt of social welfare in September because of the enormous cost of clothing, school uniforms and school books.  In many cases this creates hardship for those concerned. I am glad that the Minister has seen the need to remedy this situation.  I hope that the means test will not be severe and that it will not be full of bureaucracy and red tape.  Over the last few years when people have approached their local community welfare officers, there have been severe problems in obtaining the allowance for uniforms etc., some people get the allowance, some do not.  I would hope that all people in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension etc., will automatically be entitled to this allowance without being <Col N="876" /> subjected to harassment or means testing. I welcome the fact that the Minister has made improvements in the free schemes and in particular the provision under the free travel scheme whereby a companion will be enabled to travel free with a person on disabled persons maintenance allowance.  That is a welcome change because many people who had this allowance were not able to travel on their own.  Under the old system they could not bring anybody with them other than a wife or husband.  That will be a major benefit to those concerned.</P>
      <P>The carers' allowance is a major change and one that must be welcomed on all sides of the House.  The general thrust of the policy of the last Government and of this Government is to keep senior citizens at home in the community with their sons, daughters, nieces or nephews, as the case may be.  This represents large savings for the Department because the figures being bandied about indicate that it costs in the region of £500 or £600 to keep an old peron in hospital. Under this scheme by paying the carers' allowance many of those people can now remain in the community of which they have been part and parcel for so long. The Minister has also decided that the son, daughter, niece or nephew, or a person outside the family can claim the allowance for looking after old people. This represents a significant development in the social welfare services and the Minister should be complimented on introducing it.  For the first time it gives official recognition to the role of the carer and it is one that has received a broad welcome across the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lone parents allowance is also one that will be welcome, it will apply to unmarried mothers, deserted wives, deserted husbands and unmarried fathers.  This is an area that has caused much confusion.  My only grudge is that it is very expensive to the taxpayer.  Since I came into this House I could be regarded as a champion of this area because I have advocated that deserted wives and unmarried mothers get a fair deal, are looked after properly and <Col N="877" /> should not have to suffer because of the situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>The time has come to look at the situation of the unmarried father.  He should not be allowed walk scot free.  This is an area where there must be a link up between the Department of Justice and the Department of Social Welfare.  If the unmarried father or mother is in a position to look after the child financially, they should be asked to do so and there should be some legislation to enable the Department of Social Welfare to claim back if the parent or parents are in a position to pay.  Certainly there are those who would not be in a position to pay but there are people who could and should be made to pay certain amounts of money and should not be allowed to walk away from their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>There are abuses in the system where unmarried mothers live with their boyfriends. It pays them not to get married and that is a bad situation.  Financially they are better off if they live together rather than getting married because the unmarried mother's allowance and the unemployment assistance added together is greater than would be the case if they married and the husband was claiming unemployment assistance.  I do not know how we will get over this difficult problem but it is one which should be looked at. The unmarried mothers' allowance is means tested.  They are not supposed to get benefit if they live with their boyfriends but in many cases this is happening. It is an abuse of the system.  All abuses have an effect down the line in that they leave less money available for other people who should be getting it.  It is up to all of us to play our part in the stamping out of abuse.</P>
    <P>The deserted fathers' allowance was introduced by the Minister last year. There appears to be some problems with it and there are delays in payment.  The attitude adopted by some of the social welfare officers is not in the best interests of the people applying.  I know a deserted father who applied for the allowance and provided evidence that he was deserted &mdash; he went so far as to produce evidence which showed that his marriage has been <Col N="878" /> annulled &mdash; but the social welfare inspector insisted that he should produce his marriage certificate.  Because he had not been married in the county in which he was making the application for the deserted father's allowance, it proved difficult for him to get his marriage certificate &mdash; the priest who had married them had left the parish &mdash; and it took two months to process his application.  I believe that once he had produced evidence that the marriage had been annulled this should have been satisfactory evidence.  However, because of bureaucracy and red tape he had to produce his marriage certificate even though all the other evidence proved he had been married originally and the marriage had been annulled.  This is a classic example of where some social welfare officers are carrying their duties a little too far.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of an appeals office.  The present appeals system has caused severe problems for people who make the appeals and for politicians who spend more time making representations about appeals than any other area of social welfare.  Some recipients of disability benefit can be cut off from receiving their allowance by medical referees even though such recipients may be able to prove they are going into hospital the week after or they have a severe ailment. When a recipient appeals this decision more often than not he will be called before another medical referee who will probably uphold the decision made by the first medical referee.  If the recipient makes a final appeal some guy will visit the local hotel or social services office where he will sit in judgment and more often than not decide that the person should be cut off from receiving his allowance. This can happen even though the person's doctor may insist he is not fit for work and he should be entitled to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of this independent appeals office which I hope will give a fair deal to people who make appeals right across the whole social welfare area.  The appeals system which has <Col N="879" /> operated up to now has not been satisfactory. I hope enough staff will be made available in this office to deal with appeals.  It can take a very long time to process appeals.  In County Wexford it can take up to 20 to 25 weeks to process unemployment assistance appeals.  This is far too long for a person who needs unemployment assistance.  It is strange that if I put down a parliamentary question about an unemployment assistance appeal, which may take 20 weeks to decide on, I will be able to get an answer in a day or two.  This is unfair to the Minister and should not happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister should question why appeals are taking so long to process.  It seems to take longer to process appeals in some counties than in other.  When I ring the social welfare office in any town I am usually told that the file is on the desk, the social welfare officer dealing with it is out of the office and when he comes back in he will be given the message. He is given the message and will deal with the appeal eventually, but this is no good to the person who is waiting to receive the money.  Some people may argue that this person will receive a supplementary welfare allowance while he is waiting for his unemployment benefit, but sometimes this may only be 25 to 30 per cent of the unemployment assistance he would receive.  This is causing severe hardship for many people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a very good day's work in setting up this appeals office and appointing a chief appeals officer who will deal with all aspects of appeals. I thank the Minister for taking this initiative. When I referred to the long delays in the processing of appeals I was not being critical of the Minister; I was being critical of some of the social welfare officers out in the field who are not carrying out their job in the proper manner and who have no regard whatsoever for the people and the hardship they are being caused.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the scheme for contributions from the self-employed a few years ago.  From April of this year <Col N="880" /> the contribution rate for the self-employed will be 5 per cent.  It is only right that the self-employed should make a substantial contribution to the PRSI pensions scheme.  Income from the scheme for this year will be £62 million, which is some 30 per cent ahead of the original target set down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look at one aspect of this scheme.  People have to pay into this scheme for ten years before they will be entitled to receive any benefit.  Even though a person may have only six years to work before he reaches pension age he must still pay into the scheme for these six years.  I ask the Minister to look at the position of people who are over 60 years of age who will have to pay into the scheme for six years even though it will be of no benefit to them. The Minister should look at the position of people who have only five or six years left to work &mdash; he can decide on the cutoff point &mdash; and allow them to buy the remaining four or five years in order that they can claim contributory pensions.  I do not know how feasible this would be, but it is very unfair for people to have to pay into this scheme for up to nine years and not receive any benefits because they do not have the magical ten years contributions.</P>
    <P>I know self-employed people who would be prepared to pay for those extra four or five years, even at a higher rate, so that they can get into the system.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this proposal.  People have asked me why they should have to pay money into the scheme for up to nine years when they will not get any benefit because they do not have ten years' contributions.  They believe they would be better off paying their money into some other pension.  I believe the Minister has room to manoeuvre and should allow people to buy the other four or five years' contributions. I know that the Minister has taken on board different proposals which have been made to him by politicians over the years in order to help the people who will benefit from them and I hope he will do the same in this instance.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has again <Col N="881" /> increased the long-term unemployment payments substantially.  This area needs to be looked at continuously and payments increased on a regular basis.  It is sad that people can remain unemployed on a long-term basis but because of the lack of jobs they do not have many other choices.  The Government have a duty to care for those people and provide an adequate standard of living for them. Families on long-term unemployment assistance who have children in primary, second level or third level schools suffer severe hardship and it is only right that the Minister gives a greater increase to these families.  It is essential that these increases are kept in line with inflation. I believe these increases are welcomed by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers are the most abused and forgotten people in the country. Because of the shortage of jobs and the huge numbers unemployed, managers of multi-national supermarkets, petrol stations and other shops are exploiting part-time workers.  Supermarkets in particular are ensuring that most of their staff are part-time, working less than 19 hours a week, which allows the employers out of the system of paying full PRSI for holiday, sick pay and maternity entitlements etc. while at the same time paying a pittance in wages to the workers &mdash; in some cases as low as £1.27 per hour in supermarkets in my own county.  That is an absolute disgrace.  It is an abuse that the Government and Members on all sides of the House must look at seriously.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are over 30,000 part-time workers, two-thirds of them women, working less than 19 hours a week.  The full PRSI rate is not for those people.  They are not entitled to claim disability, unemployment or any other social insurance payment.  I suggest to the Minister here today that he have discussions with the Minister for Labour with a view to introducing legislation to ensure that part-time workers would be entitled to the full social welfare payments that other people are entitled to. The supermarkets, petrol stations and so on should not be allowed to abuse this <Col N="882" /> system because there is a multitude of workers and a shortage of jobs.  What is happening at present is a national disgrace. It must be tackled.  I will be very disappointed if our Ministers for Social Welfare and Labour do not tackle it over the next few months to ensure fair play for part-time workers.</P>
    <P>Generally, the Bill is a good one which will benefit the less well off in our community. I hope the Minister will take on board the suggestions I put forward last night and again this morning.  I thank the Minister for the way he has listened to politicians from the different parties and for introducing some of the changes that he did over the past year.  I hope he can take on board some of the suggestions that were put forward yesterday and today, aimed at ensuring that the less well off, the weaker sections and the older people in our community will continue to get a fair deal.</P>

      <P>If that is the interpretation the Minister of State wishes to put on it, if that is what being concerned means, I will not duck from that.  I would further put it to the Minister of State <Col N="883" /> that if being concerned about the 232,500 people on unemloyment assistance, about the 40,000 people who emigrated last year, about the 2,700 people waiting for hip operations, about the 800 people waiting for heart by-pass operations and about the 18,000 children waiting ten or 12 years for essential orthodontic treatment because orthodontic surgeons are not appointed in the Western Health Board area means that we are of the Left, so be it.  I am not ashamed to be concerned about those matters and I am pleased to speak about those matters here today.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken on board some of the constructive suggestions made by speakers in the budget debate.  Some of the matters I concentrated on in the budget debate have been altered since, but I am looking for further clarification. I accept that the Minister is going in the right direction with the changes but they are not spelled out clearly enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the carer's allowance, a matter that has caught the attention of the public.  It is a very good move, but I want clarification in regard to a number of matters related to it.  In the budget debate I indicated that the Minister was making great play of the increase from £28 to £45, but this is no good if people cannot qualify for it. Fewer than 2,000 people in the country could qualify for that allowance, called then the prescribed relative's allowance. The Minister tells us now that 8,000 people will qualify for the new carer's allowance.  There is still much to be clarified and before this Bill is adopted I or our spokesperson, Deputy Flaherty, will be putting down amendments and looking for clarification of certain matters before deciding whether to support this Bill in its present form.  The Minister stated that for the first time in our legislation we were giving official recognition to the role of carers who provide full-time care for elderly people in our community. I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say about this in the budget debate and last night, but he has <Col N="884" /> still not spelt out clearly what he means by full-time carers.</P>
    <P>The Minister praised the wonderful work which carers are doing.  Of course, I agree.  Those caring for old people in their homes are providing a wonderful service.  Age structures are now different, people are living longer and the age structure in the family has changed.  Probably both spouses are working.  I am not satisfied with regard to conditions governing the payment of the full time carer's allowance. A farmer or his wife could be looking after an aged relative in the home. Let us suppose that the carer has to go out during the day to look after five or ten cattle.  Will that provide an opportunity for some conscientious social welfare officer to disqualify that person from the carer's allowance on the basis that he or she would not be deemed to be a full-time carer, despite the fact that no income would be received this year from looking after those cattle?  It appears from the Minister's speech that the allowance will be payable only to full-time carers and I do not want technicalities to be brought into the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is to be payable subject to a means test.  Does that mean that small farmers or a person in receipt of social welfare payments could be disqualified? If the same means test applies in this case as that which applies to smallholders applying for a medical card, people would be disqualified who genuinely have no income.  Smallholders have no income this year.  In the western region in 1988, 89 per cent of people depending on cattle farming had a family income of less than £5,000.  That was in 1988 when there was at least some income from such farming, but in 1989 and 1990 they will have no income whatsoever.  Yet when such people apply for a medical card they are asked the number of cattle they had at the last test and the social welfare officer tells the smallholder that he is disqualified because his income puts him above the guidelines.  There is no point in putting down the number of livestock and multiplying it by a magical figure to achieve an imaginary means <Col N="885" /> tested income.  I want the means test to be a genuine one under which real incomes will be taken into account rather than imaginary incomes.  The whole system must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>To care for a person in an institution costs between £350 and £500 per week, depending on the type of care.  It is a very small concession to allow somebody a maximum of £45 to care for such a person.  An income of £45 a week is very slight when one considers the responsibility involved and also the benefit to the old person who can continue to live at home.  A realistic allowance would be about £100 a week.  Such an allowance would make it viable for some people to give up gainful employment to care for a relative or neighbour, thereby releasing a job for somebody else.  I want to ensure that people caring for a relative are not adjudged to have a fictional income which would disqualify them from the allowance. Neither should they be adjudged not to be full-time carers if, for instance, they have to care for a few cattle on the land.  These are matters which concern me and I would ask the Minister for clarification.</P>
    <P>The Minister is taking a step forward in looking for the first time in a serious way at a carer's allowance.  It was almost impossible to qualify for the prescribed relative's allowance because there were far too many exclusions.  A person who was in receipt of unemployment assistance could not qualify, but that payment was greater than the prescribed relative's allowance.  The whole system was a farce and the Minister has gone some way towards eliminating it.  I want to see the new allowance implemented in practice. I do not accept that a maximum of 8,000 people should qualify for the carer's allowance.  I am sure there are 20,000 or 30,000 such cases throughout the country where relatives are genuinely caring for old people and keeping them out of institutions. Those people should qualify for the carer's allowance.  It should be extended far beyond the scope envisaged by the Minister.  By keeping people out of institutional care, beds are made available in hospitals and institutions for <Col N="886" /> people who do not have others to care for them.  I am asking that the £45 be genuinely made available to carers and that it be regarded as a pilot scheme. There is vast potential for good in this type of allowance.</P>
    <P>A press report last week referred to £5 million extra and an additional 8,000 people to be paid £45 per week.  That is misleading.  It says nothing about the means test or being a full-time carer.</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of last Thursday.  I wonder where that £5 million is.  I hope the Minister will spell that out for me.</P>
      <P>The Minister made some play about the level of spending on social welfare. Praising himself and his Department, he said that the level of spending on social welfare is the highest in the history of the State and demonstrates once again his continued determination to protect and improve the position of those people.  I submit that the level of spending on social welfare is indeed the highest ever because this Government's policies have put almost 250,000 people on the unemployment register&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the child benefit and gave himself credit again. I referred to this matter in my budget contribution and I thought I might be corrected on it.  Lo and behold, it turned up again in the Minister's speech last night.  He made a big thing about the fact that a family with four children will receive an increase of £3 a month.  In my simple arithmetic that amounts to an allowance of 75p per child per month.  Is that a realistic increase in child benefit? It is a sick joke.  The child would want to go very easy spreading jam on his bread to make the 75p last the month because <Col N="887" /> I am afraid that after two weeks of spreading the jam &mdash; or after a week if he was spreading it thickly &mdash; the 75p would run out.  That inclusion in the Social Welfare Bill is nothing to be proud of.</P>
    <P>I had better be positive about some things in the Bill.  The Minister said the free travel scheme is being extended to allow recipients of DPMA who cannot travel alone to bring a companion when availing of free travel.  That is very welcome, but that occasion should be extended to other recipients of free travel.  An old age pensioner not in receipt of DPMA and several other categories might need a companion to travel with them because they might be unable to get on or off buses or other public transport.  The scheme should be extended to companions of certain persons qualified for free travel.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to pensioners over 80 years of age being allowed to retain their entitlement to free electricity when somebody comes to live with them. That again is welcome.  However, some elderly people who have not reached 80 years need someone to live with them because they are incapable of living alone.  Particularly they might need someone to stay with them at night and that would disqualify them from the free electricity allowance because they would not then be classified as living alone, even though they would be living alone in the day.  A realistic adjustment would be to extend this scheme to people of 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme is another matter I dealt with at length in my contribution to the budget debate.  At that time it was being extended to long term recipients of unemployment assistance living alone.  I questioned that at the time and said that that allowance should be extended to smallholders.  I instanced a family on long term unemployment assistance, a smallholder with five, six or seven children coming in from school at different times of the day and the women would have to have hot meals ready and fires lighting to <Col N="888" /> dry clothes, etc.  According to the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement that category would not qualify for the free fuel allowance.  I think the Minister has heeded my contribution and the contributions of other people in that regard because he has gone some way towards meeting this, but I want the matter spelled out much more thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I made certain inquiries about this since the budget.  An article in the <i>Farming Independent</i> of 6 March headed <i>&ldquo;Smallholders to Get Free Fuel Allowance&rdquo;</i> stated that the free fuel allowance scheme worth £5 per week was to be extended to farmers on smallholders' assistance and that this was announced by the IFA after a meeting with the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods. I rang the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister's office and found it very difficult to get any clarification of that article.  A number of people had contacted me about my contribution to the budget debate, wondering if the Minister had taken heed of it and when I read that article I wondered if the Minister had taken heed of what I said.</P>
    <P>On telephoning the Department of Social Welfare I was assured that the article was correct, smallholders were to get this allowance, application forms would be available at social welfare offices and post offices and the scheme would apply from last October.  I got that information initially on 6 March. Subsequently a number of people who had called to social welfare offices and the post offices contacted me and said that nobody knew anything about application forms for smallholders to qualify for the free fuel allowance from last March.  I contacted the Department of Social Welfare last week and they informed me it would apply from next October.</P>
    <P>I was assured then that &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; as stated in the Bill and in the Minister's press release did not actually mean living alone, it meant something else.  The Minister said last night: &ldquo;We are extending the national free fuel scheme to householders where a long term social welfare <Col N="889" /> recipient lives with someone on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance, and to smallholders receiving long term unemployment assistance who are living alone.&rdquo;  The magic words &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; were in the Minister's speech last night. I want clarification of this here in the Dáil.  I am not going to bother ringing the Department of Social Welfare or the Minister's office again about the matter. Does this free fuel scheme apply to smallholders on long term unemployment assistance if they are not living alone?</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear any more contradictory statements about it.  Will a smallholder on long-term unemployment assistance with five or more children get the free fuel allowance?  It is usually the wife of the smallholder who has to face five or six children coming wet and hungry from school at different times of the day.  The mother has to have a fire going all day and if she does not qualify for the free fuel allowance the publicity surrounding it is inaccurate and not in accordance with assurances I got from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by officials in the Department of Social Welfare that &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; need not be taken literally as it means that a family can be included. However, I want the matter clarified so that I can have accurate information for the people who come to me with problems in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the lack of finance for local authority housing.  It is related to social welfare because I did research in County Galway and found that 450 people had been approved for local authority housing, 275 in the borough area and the remainder in the county.  Most of those people are on some kind of social welfare assistance and unable to provide housing for themselves. However, nothing is being done for them because moneys are not being provided for necessary housing.</P>

      <P>I also wish to refer to eligibility for medical cards.  Deputy Browne referred to the red tape attached to the qualification for any benefits.  I recognise that there have to be checks and cross-checks but sometimes they go too far. Smallholders with ten or 20 cattle do not have an income and the departmental officials know this.  However, they have to refer to previous figures and take them into account.  The Minister of State knows that this is so because, like me, he came from the grass roots.  The Department are obliged to follow the criterion set down in relation to these matters and to multiply the number of animals by a figure given to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The guidelines in this matter should be changed to realistically take account of false incomes. The same applies to other matters I have dealt with arising from the budget, including the living alone allowance and qualification for the free fuel scheme.  If the guidelines are not changed loopholes will be found to disqualify people who are genuinely entitled to benefits.  There is no point in having flashy headlines about increases in social welfare if people cannot qualify for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be anxiously awaiting the reply <Col N="891" /> of the Minister for Social Welfare to the debate and I will interrupt him if he does not spell out clearly the situation in relation to the qualifications for the carer's allowance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the carer and the means test.  He should also spell out the qualifications for the free fuel scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare who has done more since 1987 than any of his predecessors in seeking to rationalise the number of payments and to simplify the social welfare system generally.  He is making a very sincere effort to create a workable structure which should be welcomed and encouraged by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Before I speak on the main provisions of the Bill it is important to emphasise what my party and I have been advocating for some considerable time. The manner in which social welfare issues are dealt with by the Oireachtas is totally unsatisfactory.  There are only two general debates each year on matters relating to social welfare: the first is on the Social Welfare Bill which gives legislative effect to the changes introduced in the budget and the second is on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare which usually lasts for two hours and deals with the allocation of money for various social welfare schemes.  This leaves a lot to be desired, given that the Department of Social Welfare will spend £2,766 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Progressive Democrats favour the setting up of an all-party committee of the Oireachtas to examine the entire social welfare code.  We recommend that the Economic and Social Research Institute work with that committee, acting in the first instance as a research group to the committee and secondly as an outside independent group working on a consultative basis with members of the committee.  The committee should receive submissions from people working with social welfare recipients and other deprived groups in our society.  Many of these groups put a lot <Col N="892" /> of time and money into preparing detailed and worthwhile submissions, but unfortunately they do not get very far. The all-party committee on social welfare should be asked to report to Dáil Éireann within nine to 12 months and the findings should be fully debated and implemented by the Government.</P>
    <P>This is not just another Bill to come before the House.  It will affect 36.8 per cent of the population.  The expenditure of the Department of Social Welfare represents 12.6 per cent of the gross national product.  I do not believe the time given to debate this Bill, or indeed social welfare matters generally, is adequate and I would sincerely ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the establishment of such a committee.  I recall last year I made an appeal to the Minister to set up an all-party committee to examine the Commission on Social Welfare and, in fairness to him, he said he was considering that report at the time and that he would consider the setting up of the committee but so far this has not happened. I am not casting any reflection on the Minister in this respect because, as I said already, I know of his dedication in trying to establish a workable structure.</P>
    <P>There are many disadvantaged groups in our community and social justice demands that they be given the best support and protection that the community can afford, along with opportunities to develop their potential and play a fuller role in the life of the community.  The Progressive Democrats are committed to protecting the living standards of those dependent on social welfare and to creating the maximum opportunities for their involvement.  What the vast majority of social recipients want most of all is the opportunity to work, to enjoy the dignity and self-esteem of having a job and to be able to look after their families by using their own skills.  In the absence of full employment, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil are committed to providing social welfare increases for the long-term unemployed over and above the level of inflation and will continue to do so as resources permit. <Col N="893" /> In particular we are committed to reducing the instance of poverty.  Special increases will be given to families with dependent children and special account will be taken of the needs of small farmer households.</P>
    <P>There should be an overall strategy to tackle poverty, particularly in areas where there is a concentration of many complex social problems.  Increased private sector support for local community development should be encouraged by introducing tax relief and by giving capital donations for anti-poverty work.  I know there are thousands of local groups throughout the country who seek and obtain assistance from the regional health boards under section 65 of the Health Act, 1970, but the vast majority of these groups who get assistance for worthwhile community development frequently complain that they cannot properly plan or develop their activities with these payments which they rely on each year.  In the past number of years the regional health boards have been finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet and a substantial number of these groups have had reductions in their allocations. As a result, some of them have had to give up their activities while others have had to reduce substantially their activities. I know the Department of Social Welfare have given substantial grants to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for home management courses and also to other groups, but the time is now opportune for all of the section 65 grants to be taken over by the Department of Social Welfare.  They should deal with the organisations involved in anti-poverty work and particularly with groups working in areas where there is a concentration of social problems.</P>
    <P>Likewise, there should be a fundamental review of the entire social work service.  I want to place some emphasis on this matter.  The vast majority of social workers at present employed by the regional health boards confine their work to dealing with problems related to children under 16 years of age.  There are no social work services available to families who find it difficult to make ends meet, <Col N="894" /> not necessarily because of the inadequacy of the payments but, sadly, in many instances because of their own personal inadequacies.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the entire number of social workers in this country should be employed by the regional health boards. This is an area in which the Department of Social Welfare should get involved, especially in the years ahead.  I would like to see the Department of Social Welfare directly employ social workers.  These people should work hand in hand with the local community welfare officers, who have first-hand experience of the families and their problems.  This is of vital importance.  Perhaps this would be something new for the Department of Social Welfare, but I strongly suggest to the Minister that he discuss this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Health, in the hope that social workers would be employed by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In the agreed Programme for Government the Progressive Democrats are anxious that a special social welfare appeals officer would be appointed in order to ensure that not alone is the social welfare appeals system fair but that it is also perceived as such.  I welcome sections 9 and 20 to this Bill which give legislative effect to the setting up of such an office.  Section 19 (b) amends section 298 (4) of the Principal Act and allows the Minister to direct the chief appeals officer to determine appeals by way of oral hearing.  This is a significant provision in the Bill and I hope the Minister will exercise the authority he is giving himself in this provision.</P>
    <P>I know only too well that a substantial number of social welfare recipients are not in a position to articulate their position when requested to do so in writing. Many of them, through no fault of their own, are poorly educated and find it difficult to correspond with the Department in such a manner.  While the system would be much slower, at least people should be given the opportunity of speaking directly to the chief appeals officer or indeed bringing a representative with them who would be able to articulate <Col N="895" /> the position to the appeals officer.  This should make a substantial improvement to the way in which the whole system works and should certainly reduce the number of complaints, particularly the increased number of complaints that have been made to the Ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a very serious matter which has developed since the beginning of this year in relation to rent subsidies.  Section 209 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, empowers health boards to pay subsidies to persons in receipt of social welfare payments who have difficulty in paying their rent or mortgages. Guildelines issued by the Department in 1988 stated specifically that rent subsidies should not be paid to people in local authority houses who are assessed on the differential rent system.  In my own area of Cork, Cork County Council recently reviewed all people who are on the differential rent system and, I regret to say, as a result of this review thousands of families have had substantial increases in their local authority rents.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of a man with a wife and four dependent children who is in receipt of unemployment assistance of £117 a week.  He is now expected to pay a differential rent of £16.50 under the normal calculation for supplementary welfare allowance purposes.  This man would normally be entitled to a rent subsidy of £5.20 per week.  Similarly a married man with six children receiving unemployment assistance of £137 per week would normally be entitled to a rent subsidy of £57.70 per week, but all of these people are being debarred from receiving supplementary welfare allowance under section 209 of the principal Act because of internal guidelines which the Minister is aware of, but which have no legal basis.  The original intention was that local authorities would not impose rents that would have the effect of bringing people below the supplementary social welfare allowance rate.  I ask the Minister to look into this matter because the anomaly needs to be rectified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> Local authorities are finding it difficult to make ends meet and are trying to find ways and means of increasing their revenue through the differential rents system.  Families are being put in an intolerable situation and many of them can no longer afford to pay the full rents. Subsequently they are accruing substantial arrears with the local authorities. I know there is nothing to prevent the local community welfare officer from making payments under section 212, where there are exceptional circumstances of hardship.  However, I believe that the health boards are not prepared to make these payments because they claim that, in cases of arrears where families are finding it difficult to make ends meet, the county managers have the authority to write off the arrears.  This circle goes on because the county managers are not prepared to write off these arrears as the revenue is badly needed.  I ask the Minister to give me some assurance that guidelines on rent subsidies under section 209 of the Act will be extended to people paying differential rents to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with Part VII of the Bill and in particular sections 34 and 35 which deal with the assessment of means.  I welcome section 34, which exempts from assessment of means for the purposes of various non-contributory means tested payments under the Social Welfare Acts, persons living in the Gaeltacht areas who accommodate students who wish to improve their fluency in Irish.  The Minister is to be commended for introducing this section.  From my understanding of section 35 regulations are to be introduced which empower the Department to exempt income from the sale of pensioners' residences from the assessment of means in certain circumstances. Too often old age pensioners go into private nursing homes in order to obtain private nursing care which is badly needed.  Because of the high charges in these nursing homes, they are frequently forced to sell their own homes to cover the costs.  Once their home is sold the Department have no alternative, under the present regulations, but to hold as <Col N="897" /> means the income derived from the sale, thus reducing their non-contributory pensions substantially.  I welcome this move, particularly in the light of the Department of Health's policy in relation to the care of the elderly.  I want to emphasise this because the Minister was aware of the views of many Members of this House on this point and he has facilitated our demands.</P>
    <P>It is time we looked at the whole area of means testing.  The Progressive Democrats believe that one comprehensive means test should be carried out which could be used by all agencies.  At present means tests are used by the Department of Social Welfare, for a substantial number of income maintenance schemes; by the Department of Health in relation to medical card and other income maintenance schemes such as the disabled person's maintenance allowance, the infectious disease maintenance allowance, and blind welfare.  The Department of the Environment have their own means testing system for housing grants and local authorities have another system for means testing those on differential rents.  The Department of Education have a means test for deciding eligibility for third level grants.  The Department of Justice have another set of means tests for deciding those entitled to free legal aid.</P>
    <P>The scenario in respect of the person claiming unemployment assistance has been frequently outlined.  The person is means tested by the social welfare officer and has to face a delay of several weeks until such time as the deciding officer has made their decision.  In the meantime the claimant is forced to go to the local health board to apply for the supplementary welfare allowance, where again they have to undergo a means test.  Shortly after receiving their supplementary welfare allowance they may apply for a medical card and have to undergo another means test.  They may also apply to some other Government Department which would require a means test along the lines of those used by the health board and the Department of Social Welfare.  This is a <Col N="898" /> terrible waste of manpower.  This duplication and indeed triplication could be done away with by having one separate means testing office.  The person, having been assessed by the officer who would be knowledgeable of all the criteria for a wide range of services, would be given documentary evidence which they could take along to the health board and the Department of Social Welfare in order to obtain the allowances or services they require.</P>
    <P>I believe it is possible to establish such a scheme and for that reason I ask the Minister to consider it as I know he is sincere in trying to make the social welfare code work.  This is already happening in a limited way in community information centres.  If you go along to them and explain your circumstances they will advise you on the range of services that you are likely to be entitled to, but you still have to go to each individual office and make a separate application.  I believe the suggestion of a single means testing office is worthwhile exploring and I welcome the Minister's view on the matter.</P>
    <P>Under the 1985 Social Welfare Act, which dealt with equality in social welfare matters, we introduced a threshold of £50 for a working spouse of a person claiming social welfare to retain full payments.  If the working spouse was earning less than £50 per week, the spouse was allowed claim the full personal rate in addition to the full adult dependant rate and the full child allowance rate.  However once the earnings of the other spouse went over the threshold of £50 per week, the spouse claiming social welfare payments had the adult dependant rate withdrawn and then only received half the child dependant allowance.  It is now almost five years since the threshold was set and since then spouses have begun to get very small increases in their salary.  However when they go over the £50 threshold some of their spouses stand to lose a substantial part of their social welfare benefit.  I have taken this matter up privately with the Minister and it is not my intention to embarrass him in any way in raising it today.  Instead, I wish to highlight the <Col N="899" /> very serious consequences if no adjustment is made to the £50 threshold.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a man on disability benefit with a wife and four dependent children.  If his wife is working and earning £45 per week he will receive the full personal rate, the full adult dependant rate and the full child dependant rate. However, if his wife's earnings go over the threshold of £50 per week, he would lose the £29 adult dependant rate and half the child dependant rate for each of his four children, which amounts to about £20.  The gross loss would amount to £49 per week.  Similarly, in the case of a man on invalidity pension, if his wife earns more than £50 he stands to lose in the region of £54.10 per week.  These losses will have disastrous consequences for families dependent on social welfare for their main source of income.  I appeal to the Minister's sense of fair play and justice to ensure that the threshold is raised as soon as possible at least in line with inflation.  While I am not in a position to give any indication as to the cost of this, the cost of doing nothing will be ten times worse.</P>
    <P>Recently, I met a deputation of between 20 and 30 unfortunate women employed in the cleaning industry who informed me that they have been offered an increase of 10p an hour in salary. However, if they accept this increase they could lose anything up to £45 per week. I am aware that equality legislation was introduced by the previous Coalition Government but no provision was made at that time for an adjustment to this threshold.  The Minister has promised that he will give this matter serious consideration and I hope he will raise the threshold well above £50 to ensure that families with young children in particular have an adequate income.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions contained in section 9 which exempt employees with gross weekly earnings below a prescribed amount from paying the employee element of the social insurance contribution with effect from 6 April next.  I have always advocated that the best way <Col N="900" /> to raise the living standards of those in low paid employment is by exempting them from paying certain social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to state that the Programme for Government agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats contains a number of important elements concerning social welfare. We agreed that a separate social welfare appeals officer should be appointed to ensure that not alone will the appeals system be seen to be fair but also seen to be fair and independent.  We further agreed that we would continue to provide special increases for the long term unemployed over and above the rate of inflation throughout the life of the Government as resources permit.  We also agreed to try to reduce the incidence of poverty by providing special increases to families with dependent children and taking special account of the needs of small farmer households.  We further agreed that payment of an allowance to persons who need assistance in caring for elderly and handicapped relatives in their own homes should be considered and that the complex range of welfare payments should be further simplified with particular reference to the social assistance scheme for the unemployed and sick with the eventual aim of introducing a single payment for one parent families.  All of these issues were to be addressed over a four year period.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that these issues are being tackled in this Bill and the Minister is to be congratulated for this.  As I said at the outset, I am aware of his determination and dedication to establish once and for all a workable structure in the Department of Social Welfare.  It is not unusual in a debate on social welfare for us to forget those working with the Minister and they are his officials.  I, and anyone who I have been associated with who has done any business with the Department of Social Welfare, have always received tremendous co-operation and been received very kindly.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out last night that no matter what amount of money is spent <Col N="901" /> on social welfare we will never be satisfied. This is only natural because what we are aiming for in the working of the Department of Social Welfare is perfection. We also wish to ensure that the best deal is given to those living in poverty. Criticism is always welcome provided it is constructive.  I hope all those who will contribute to this debate will understand fully &mdash; I have always advocated this and have sat on both the Government and Opposition benches &mdash; that irrespective of who is in power no one in the House, including the Minister, will ever be satisfied that we are doing enough.  We can only work in accordance with our resources, but I want to say I am very proud of the efforts being made by the Minister, his officials and all concerned to ensure that once and for all we have a workable social welfare structure which is seen to be fair to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up one of the points made by Deputy Wyse in his excellent contribution.  I have come to the conclusion that it was in a somewhat different tone to the contribution he made when sitting to my left, but I suppose that is the difference between being in Opposition and being in Government. I wish him well in that regard.  He indicated that people will never be satisfied when it comes to social welfare &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; but they will never be satisfied because obviously they will never achieve the level of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many others in the House I strongly argue that it would be much better if we were talking about the creation of employment and the transfer of resources spent on social welfare to create meaningful employment, in particular for our young people.  I doubt very much if anyone enjoys being out of work and in receipt of social welfare, except perhaps the elderly who have retired due to age or illness and for whom every community has to provide.  Unfortunately, the amount of money spent on social welfare within the community is substantially higher than the amount paid <Col N="902" /> out in any other country in Europe.  This adds to the burden of taxation which must be secured from the working population.</P>
    <P>As this is a very serious matter we should seek the transfer of resources spent on social welfare towards job creation schemes in an effort to get people off the dole.  We are reaching the stage where thousands of young people have never actually worked and where social welfare is a fact of life.  One simply goes down to the employment exchange to sign on and get paid and if the person is married they go shopping with their wife, if she is not working, and just goes through the motions of living.  It is a very degrading way to have to go through life and we should try to move away from the view that there is no alternative to social welfare.</P>
    <P>There are many welcome proposals in the Bill and it is no harm to point out that I have been pressing for them over the years as spokesperson for my party on Social Welfare.  I have highlighted the need for a change in the appeals system and for that reason I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce a new appeals office.  The whole question of appeals is chaotic.  There is a problem in regard to how appeals are dealt with and the criteria for deciding appeals.  Members will be aware that there are two types of appeals, appeals concerned with unemployment assistance and benefit and those concerned with disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I assume that the new appeals office will deal with those schemes.  Will the Minister say if the appeals office will deal with disability and invalidity benefits on the one hand and unemployment assistance and unemployment benefits on the other?  It is important that he should spell out that because they are distinct benefits. Under the present system an appeals officer sits with an employer and trade union representative to deal with appeals and they are assisted by two assessors.  The latter people can give an opinion but they are not involved in the decision.  It is their duty to influence the appeals officer.  I assume that that will continue to be the position under the new system.  It is my view that appeals should <Col N="903" /> be heard by a tribunal.  Very often, particularly in rural areas, the worker representative, or the person representing employers, do not turn up for such hearings and it is left to the appeals officer to make a decision.  That officer must arrive at that decision without the advantage of local knowledge and very often local knowledge is an important consideration in such cases.  It is important that the appeals officer is made aware of whether it will be possible for an applicant to obtain employment locally.</P>
    <P>Many appeals are based on the assumption that applicants are not seeking employment.  It appears to me that a person who has qualified as an engineer is expected to seek employment as an office cleaner and that carpenters are expected to work in supermarkets.  In other words, the training or educational qualifications of an individual are not taken into consideration.  People are expected to take on employment irrespective of whether it is permanent or temporary or whether that person is suited, physically or mentally, for the work.  The important thing is that people must seek employment.</P>
    <P>In my view those who have educational qualifications or training in crafts should not be expected to take on other work. There is no point in people studying for educational qualifications or pursuing training courses if when they are unemployed they are expected to sweep the streets.  The Minister should regularise that provision.  He should set guidelines for the UB and UA appeals system.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a need to clean up the medical appeals system. I receive complaints daily about that system, particularly from women. Women turn up for what are called medical examinations but they could not be described as such.  If a woman has prenatal problems there is no point in asking a GP to decide an issue related to her condition.  An examination of that person should be carried out by a gynaecologist. A medical referee cannot decide an issue that should be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon.  Like other <Col N="904" /> Members, I must deal with complaints along those lines daily.  I have heard of women having their temperature taken by the medical referee when they should have been referred to a specialist.  In many cases, after a cursory examination women have been told that they are fit for work.  Those women, when they return to their own GP, are told that they will not be certified as fit for work for various reasons such as blood pressure or another illness that could not be detected by the medical referee.  It is important that specialists are called in to deal with such appeals.</P>
    <P>Another problem that the Minister should deal with in connection with appeals to medical referees relates to the cost of engaging the service of specialists. If a woman wants to engage the services of a gynaecologist for her appeal she will have to pay a huge fee to that specialist. I understand that the fee is in the region of £135 but the grant payment to that specialist is £30 which means that the applicant will have to pay the balance of £100 out of her own pocket.  There is no doubt that consultants will not attend social welfare appeals for a fee of £30. The Minister, in establishing the appeals office, should take those points into consideration. I have no doubt that he has received many complaints about the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to introduce a payment for lone parents.  For many years I have been calling for the inclusion of many benefits under one heading.  I am glad the Minister has done that.  Like Deputy Wyse, I am concerned about means testing.  Last year the Minister told us that he was examining that matter and I hope that when he is introducing the lone parent payment he will harmonise the means testing system.  He should eliminate the wastage of manpower.  If he does, he will save the Department and taxpayers a lot of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to introduce a PRSI exemption for workers earning £60 or less in a week.  On numerous occasions I commented on that.  Originally, PRSI stood at 30 per cent of earnings and later it was reduced to 20 per <Col N="905" /> cent.  It now stands at 12 per cent, but the contribution has consistently increased since the PRSI system was introduced.  It is my contention that PRSI is nothing more than an addition to the PAYE system.  I have held that view for a long time and quite frankly for the amount of administration involved in the PRSI system, it would be much better to eliminate PRSI altogether.  Even if one was to maintain the PRSI contribution and incorporate it into the basic social welfare payment one would eliminate an enormous amount of administration and delay because the system of PRSI does not operate for payment purposes for a period of five weeks after payment commences. Many workers never get it because they may be out only for four or five weeks.  If they are out for six weeks they receive one payment for which they may have to wait eight or ten weeks. Very often they are told that because of the level of earnings that now operates with the PRSI system they do not qualify for payment.</P>
    <P>I have held that the whole system of PRSI is illegal because money is taken out of workers' pay and a very substantial proportion of the workforce receive no payment in return for their contributions. I do not know any other system of contributions in any section of the community where people pay into something and receive nothing in return even if they qualify for it on the basis that they are out of work through illness.  I would urge the Minister to seriously consider the elimination of the PRSI system.  It has outlived its usefulness.  It is no longer of any real benefit to the working class people and it would be better to incorporate it into the system and have one system of payment.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of incorporating PRSI into the payment of disability or unemployment benefit, I would urge the Minister to give consideration to other forms of duplication.  I do not see why there should be three forms of sickness benefit &mdash; in fact there are four: disability benefit, invalidity benefit, disablement benefit and injury benefit. <Col N="906" /> Regulations governing all four are different. Each one has to be administered by a separate section and now some of the benefits have to be organised, paid for and administered from Sligo.  Because of the shortage of staff and because of the setting up of the system there we expected that there would be delays, but it is chaotic.  I want to convey to the Minister and to the officials of the Department that the service from Sligo is not as efficient as that which operated before the transfer.  I am satisfied from inquiries I have made that the reason is that the number of staff who were to transfer to Sligo did not transfer and there is a severe shortage of skilled and experienced personnel.  That is a matter that should be looked at.  I am not suggesting that the people there have told me that, I have succeeded in finding that out from inquiries I have made.</P>
    <P>In relation to duplication, I cannot understand why the one sickness benefit cannot cover the four systems.  I can accept that there may be a case for injury benefit to be paid separately, but when a person is out sick, whether a man or woman, they should receive the same payment.  I do not see why somebody in receipt of disability benefit for ten or 12 years, or in some cases 18 years, receives one benefit while after 52 weeks in receipt of disability benefit a person can qualify for invalidity benefit on a permanent unavailability basis.  I do not understand the difference between somebody in receipt of disability benefit for ten or 15 years and somebody in receipt of invalidity benefit for ten or 15 years.  Both are ill, both have been certified as unfit for work, yet the person on invalidity benefit receives a higher benefit of about £7 per week, plus a higher rate for dependants, free television, free ESB, free travel, free fuel and free telephone rental, but the person on disability benefit does not get the same perks.  It does not make sense. I do not see why these benefits cannot be harmonised where the same rates of benefit and the same subsidiary benefits &mdash; whether it be free television, free ESB or free travel &mdash; would apply.  Whatever applies to one person who is ill should <Col N="907" /> apply to all categories of people who are ill.  This would save the Department of Social Welfare millions of pounds in administration costs.</P>
    <P>I will refer to another anomaly, which I mentioned previously.  In relation to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, there is a reduced level of benefit based on contributions. There is long-term unemployment assistance benefit and short-term unemployment assistance.  A person who is unemployed, who does not qualify for unemployment benefit, and who is in receipt of unemployment assistance for a period of not more than six months, is deemed to be on short-term unemployment assistance and, therefore, in receipt of a lower rate of benefit.  As I understand it, after six months that person goes on to long-term benefit and now qualifies for other subsidiary benefits such as free fuel.  What is the difference between a man with four children at school and who is out of work for five or six months and a man who is out of work for two years?  Does it cost any more to maintain a family of three or four children and a husband and wife if he is unemployed for two or three months?  The loaf of bread and the pint of milk cost the same, the ESB and fuel charges are the same, everything they buy in the supermarket costs the same.  When two women go into the supermarket &mdash; one husband is in receipt of short-term benefit and the other's husband is in receipt of long term benefit &mdash; the manager of the supermarket will not ask which benefit they are in receipt of, and say that if her husband is on short term benefit and therefore on the lower benefit he will charge her less. I cannot understand the thinking behind this.  That benefit should be harmonised. One of the reasons for the delays in paying unemployment assistance benefit is trying to decide whether the applicant is entitled to short term or long term benefit.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with the benefit about which I feel strongest and the one which discriminates against young people, particularly those who have left <Col N="908" /> school and unfortunately are unable to secure employment either in the short term or in the long term.  The Minister should listen to this because this is where the greatest problems are caused.  I hope the officials of the Department are listening. At present because of the way the regulations are operating, if a young person over 18 signs on for unemployment assistance and his parents are working &mdash; whether in full-time or part-time employment, or one in full-time and one in part-time employment, or both in full-time employment &mdash; that young person will not qualify for any unemployment assistance payment.  If one of the parents is working there is a chance that they may be paid £10 or £15, or perhaps £17 or £18.  I know young people who have been asked to travel into my town to collect unemployment assistance of 50p.  It costs them more than that to travel to town by bus.  This has got to be put right.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position of an 18 year old person who applies for unemployment assistance, whose parents are unemployed and whose father is receiving social welfare and is paid in respect of his wife.  When that young person applies for unemployment assistance the income received by other members of his family is calculated as household income and used against him in assessing his entitlement.  One brother may receive £42 or £47 in unemployment assistance, a younger brother may receive £20 but the third brother will receive nothing because the household income is used against him in that respect.  I hope someone does not tell me that I am wrong.  If they do, I will produce a file the length of my arm on numerous cases where this is happening.  I am sure Deputy Wyse and other Deputies can certify that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Household income is being used against these young people even if it is social welfare income.  It is very degrading for a young person who has done his group, intermediate or leaving certificate and perhaps gone to a third level institution not to be able to get employment and to be told, after signing on for eight <Col N="909" /> to ten weeks and waiting for a social welfare officer to come out to the home to ask him what he had for his breakfast or whatever, that he can be given nothing because of the level of the household income.  That young person would have no alternative but to leave this country in disgust.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited London where I met over 600 young people from my town. This is only half the number who could have turned up.  It was the first time we had made an effort to get these young people together to find out how they are doing.  Some of these people who have degrees or who may have got eight honours in their intermediate certificate examination are now working on building sites or in menial security jobs and paying £80 to £100 per week for one room accommodation.  Many of these young people had to leave Ireland because the State did not pay them a reasonable level of income which would have given them time to find employment.  Most of these young people are now living in London. I can assure the House that these young people do not count us or the Department of Social Welfare among their friends.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to do a number of things in this area.  He will have to put more manpower into the relevant unit of the Department of Social Welfare.  It is not good enough to leave young people waiting for eight weeks to be assessed for unemployment assistance and then to tell them they are not entitled to benefit. They should be entitled to a minimum payment at least.  When they sign on for unemployment assistance for which they qualify on the basis that they have no employment they should automatically get a minimum payment.  They should not be kept waiting for 15 weeks and then told they are entitled to nothing.  They should at least be given an interim payment until they have been assessed.  This would put the responsibility on the Department of Social Welfare to carry out the assessment as quickly as possible, if such an assessment is necessary.  At present young people are going around like travellers begging their parents for a few bob.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> I have referred on a number of occasions to old age pensioners who are forced to queue up for their pensions in post offices.  A number of these pensioners are in receipt of payments which are changed only once a year in the budget.  I cannot understand why these people cannot be paid their pensions by way of Banklink.  I raised this point a few years ago.  I cannot understand why the plastic card system cannot be used for paying pensions.  If a pension for a married couple remains at £113 for a year I do not understand why they cannot be given a plastic card so that they can withdraw their money by way of Banklink.  I do not know what the delay is in introducing such a system because it is not all that complicated.  Banklink systems could be installed outside post offices so that elderly people would not have to queue in post offices from 8.30 a.m. or 9 a.m. on Thursdays and Fridays.  They would only have to put their plastic card into the Banklink system, press their number and get their money.  The plastic card could be changed at the end of the relevant period.  Surely there is nothing complicated about the technology involved in that system.  After all, men were going to the moon 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the position of single parents who are cohabiting.  Obviously we are going to have to come to grips with this issue in terms of social welfare.  I do not think we should encourage people not to get married.  I am a family man and I believe in the institution of marriage.  I do not believe that we should set up a system that would encourage people not to get married but by the same token we have to recognise that many people are cohabiting because they have no other choice, for example, people whose marriages have broken down.  Unfortunately it is the children who always suffer in such instances.</P>
    <P>The position of single parents must be examined very carefully.  I do not think we should provide an incentive for people not to get married but we should take into consideration the people who may be forced to cohabit through no fault of their own.  The Minister should set up a <Col N="911" /> committee within his Department to look at this matter.  This is a growing monster which will get larger and which will not go away until some form of divorce is introduced, and I do not think that will happen for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a minority group who are fairly substantial in numbers.  This group would include some Members of this House, members of the professions and members of trade unions.  I am referring in particular to people who have been in employment for 20 to 25 years and have paid A1 contributions.  When these people leave their employment and come into the Dáil or take up work in any of the other professional organisations they will have to pay a J1 contribution. As a result they will lose any entitlement to social welfare benefit after two years.  They could have been paying into the system for 30 years but once they change their employment they will not qualify for any benefit after a maximum of two years.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister that these people should have the right to voluntarily pay an A1 contribution.  I thought that perhaps that could be done if, for example, the public service was being taken into the system; but it appears that the Minister has taken a step to the rear on that one for the time being. I suggest that that could be done very simply.  In order to qualify now for social welfare benefit of any sort under the regulations one requires 260 qualifying stamps or credits or a combination of both.  In this case, for qualification purposes it is 260 qualifying stamps.  I do not see why somebody going into the Dáil or any State or semi-State body who has worked for a trade union or in a professional capacity and has paid 30 years of stamps should not qualify for payment.  The qualification should be frozen, based on the last 260 stamps before they went into the new operation.  If somebody has five years' full qualification of A1 stamps before they transfer to the professional job where they are not covered for A1 contribution, the position should be frozen, they should maintain their benefit <Col N="912" /> and have the opportunity to pay the A1 contribution themselves on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>I have raised this on a number of occasions.  There are a number of Deputies in this House, including myself, who are adversely affected by the present situation.  I spent 30 years paying into the system and it is not worth a curse now. If I were out of work tomorrow I would not qualify for the dole.  I am not arguing about that.  I hope I will be here long enough to get a pension, but if I am not I would not even qualify for the dole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Woods, for the manner in which he has continued in this Social Welfare Bill to tackle this whole area.  Major changes have taken place over the last few years and again in this Bill the Minister has endeavoured to target those most in need.  Members of this House, whether in Government or in Opposition, will agree that this Minister has shown his deep concern for the elderly, the handicapped, the long term unemployed, low paid workers, lone parents and carers in our society, particularly those caring for the elderly.  The Minister is concerned for the welfare of these people and has taken steps to improve their standard of living and to continue the work he has done in the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the Opposition are trying to find fault with this Social Welfare Bill.  So many changes have taken place in three years under this Government as to put the Opposition to shame.  I do not intend to be negative today, but I would like to refer to the contribution of The Workers' Party spokesman last night.  The despicable, personalised campaign against Members of this House was unprecedented and had no relevance to the Social Welfare Bill.  The Workers' Party should go back to their central committee, the people preparing their contributions, because the Member who was here last night had difficulty reading his contribution and certainly did not understand some of it. <Col N="913" /> This was very evident to me in the short time I was in the House last night.  This House wants contributions from the people who are representing the people and not from the faceless people we do not know in this House.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, let me first refer to equal treatment.  I would like to call on the Minister to review the £50 dependancy limit.  This figure comes into play when a person in receipt of unemployment payments has a spouse earning less than this figure.  In this event the spouse is regarded as a dependant and the recipient is entitled to the adult dependant's allowance, which is now £31 a week.  However, if the spouse gets an increase in wages &mdash; say, from £48 a week to £52 a week &mdash; the social welfare recipient loses the adult dependant's allowance.  This limit of £50 has been in operation since 1986 and needs to be revised.  I have had meetings with women who go out of their homes to work out of the need to support their families because their husbands are unemployed and in receipt of assistance.  They have not been able to accept a rise in their wages because if they go over the limit their husbands would lose total benefit.  There is a need for action to be taken and I call on the Minister to raise this figure to the 1990 equivalent of £50 in 1986.  I have also had representations from the trade union movement expressing their concern on behalf of their members.  We should remember that these families are possibly at the lowest level of the scale. For this reason the Minister should give them special attention.  This sort of case speaks for itself.  People cannot accept a rise of £5 from their employer because their husbands would stand to lose £31. The scheme is a good one, allowing people on low incomes to benefit, but it must be reviewed and I would strongly urge the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>The lone parents scheme is a new scheme.  It is an historical development and part of the process of change and improvement adopted by the present Minister.  Last year the Minister extended social assistance cover to widowers and <Col N="914" /> deserted husbands with dependent children. This was the first time that people in this category were covered for social assistance.  It was a welcome development and paved the way for the new lone parents scheme which is being introduced here today.  It is important that this new scheme be extended to cover all single people with dependent children on the same basis.  No longer will it be necessary to prove desertion or the fact that the other spouse is at fault.  There have long been demands to move away from a fault based system to one based on need.  This new scheme is a clear move in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a new allowance for parents bringing up children on their own.  The new scheme will streamline all existing social assistance payments for lone parents and incorporate the existing unmarried mothers allowance, widowers non-contributory pension and deserted husbands allowance.  Women receiving widow's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's allowance and prisoners wife's allowance for those who have child dependants will also be brought into the new scheme.</P>
    <P>This new allowance will for the first time provide a special means tested social welfare payment for certain lone parents such as separated spouses, unmarried fathers and prisoners' husbands.  Up to now the only social welfare payment available to lone parents in these circumstances has been supplementary welfare allowance.  I am sure we all agree that this is a very welcome development. It is intended that the new allowance will apply to lone parents who are bringing up at least one dependent child on their own &mdash; children can be regarded as dependent until they reach the age of 18, or 21 if they are in full time education &mdash; satisfy a means test, are not cohabitating with another person as husband or wife, and as separated persons have made reasonable efforts to get maintenance from his or her spouse.  The social welfare code imposes a liability on a person to maintain his or her spouse and children and where a person fails to do so the Minister for Social Welfare will be able <Col N="915" /> to require that this person contribute towards benefit or allowance payable to his or her family as a consequence.  We welcome this.</P>
    <P>Deserted wives have had the responsibility of proving that they cannot secure means from their husbands before they can qualify for deserted wife's allowance. We all know of wives who would not go within a thousand miles of their husbands because of violence in the home and the effect it had on the family.  Many people who applied for deserted wife's allowance were refused because they could not adequately show that they were unable to get assistance from their husbands. The new weekly allowance will be made up of a personal rate for the claimant with extra amounts for dependent children. The amount of the allowance will depend on the number of dependent children and the claimant's weekly means. The maximum weekly rate that will apply will be a personal rate of £53 and £13.50 for each child per week.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a welcome development.  There has been much anxiety about this matter.  This is a major change which we have been seeking for a considerable time.  We know of people who gave up jobs and went home to look after their parents.  Because they were not available for employment they were not eligible for unemployment assistance. Last year the Minister transferred an allowance of £20 per week from the person being cared for to the carer.  Now there is to be a new carer's allowance for people providing full-time care to pensioners. This scheme replaces the prescribed relative's allowance.  The money is paid directly to the carer at the rate of £45 per week.  The categories of people who can qualify as carers can be extended to include, among others, married women and people caring for non-relatives. To qualify for the allowance the carer must be living with and giving full-time care and attention to a social welfare pensioner satisfying a means test.  The pensioner to whom the care is being given must be in receipt of an invalidity pension or a blind person's pension or must be <Col N="916" /> aged 66 years or more and in receipt of social welfare payments.  The person must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention.  The rate of pay will be £45 per week with increases for child dependants of the carer.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has extended the scheme to cover married women and non-relatives.  A married woman with children whose husband is receiving a social welfare payment will be able to claim the full carer's allowance herself and half the child dependant's allowance.  A married woman whose husband is working will be assessed with half the joint means of the couple and will also be eligible for half the child dependant's allowance.  That is very generous and accommodating.  A carer with no other income &mdash; previously debarred because, for example, others were living in the house &mdash; will gain £45 per week.  This gives such people an opportunity to have an income of their own.</P>
    <P>Where a prescribed relative's allowance is being paid and the carer has no means the household will gain by £17, that is, the difference between £28 and £45.  Where the pensioner or carer is already receiving a prescribed relative's allowance the means test will not reduce the payment below the rate of the prescribed relative's allowance.  This is in line with the Minister's policy of protecting people who depend on social welfare, especially when any changes are made.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme needs some consideration. This is an income scheme operated by the health boards instead of by the Department of Social Welfare and I believe it should be taken over by the Minister.  There has been much discussion in recent years about the efficiency of the public service.  We need to streamline further the administration of systems.  The transfer of responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare would enable a more rational approach to be adopted.  There appears to be a divergency of approach by the health boards.  I am not one for centralisation, but when people apply for this <Col N="917" /> allowance they are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance for some time and it can take months in some health board areas for a decision to be made about the payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance.  This is very unsatisfactory.  The Minister could streamline the system and make it more efficient.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of a new central appeals office.  This is an area which has caused much trauma.  People are called before the medical referees and they find themselves in a &ldquo;Catch 22&rdquo; situation if they are found fit by the medical referee, but their own general practitioner will not sign a certificate stating that they are fit for work.  I have had cases of people attending consultants for treatment who have been brought before the medical referees and found capable of work.  We all know there are many people in the community who have been succeeding in fooling the system, but we must be conscious of the people who are genuinely unfit for work.  Under the present system we have certainly cut people off unjustly.  A bus driver came to me recently who had fractured his ankle and claimed social welfare benefit for the first time in almost 25 years.  He went before the medical referee and was told to put away his crutch in order to strengthen his leg so that he would be fit for work.  He was informed shortly afterwards that he was fit for work, although he was still attending a consultant in Cork.  In no way was he fit for work.  We must see what can be done for such people.</P>
    <P>Major problems have been caused. People end up seeking supplementary welfare allowance.  Because they are not fit for work they cannot sign on at the exchange.  The medical referee tells them they are fit for work but their GP says otherwise.  In many cases people have consultants' reports to back up their GPs advice.  I ask the Minister to consider either having consultants appointed or certain categories of patients referred for a consultant's report.  In fairness to the medical referees, when people claim to have certain illnesses &mdash; Deputy Bell <Col N="918" /> referred to some of them &mdash; because of the non-availability of equipment for testing or whatever, the medical referees may decide that some of those people are fit for work.  The person who suffers in the end is the patient.  I know some people who have been taking the system for a ride but we must not penalise people who are out of work through no fault of their own.  The one instance I give is of a person, 25 years at work, who for the first time applies for social welfare and sees people around him getting all sorts of benefits.  He has made a major contribution for 25 years, paid his contributions, and he is a victim of the system I referred to.  I ask the Minister to see if he can give some relief to such people who have found themselves in a &ldquo;Catch 22&rdquo; situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concession given to people over 80 years of age.  I have known social welfare officers call on people and inform them they were not entitled to some of the benefits they already had, such as free fuel and free electricity, because somebody was living with them. Two cases come to mind.  A woman now over 80 years of age many years ago had taken a young boy who was not normal out of an institution in Cork.  She reared him and he was in receipt of unemployment assistance.  She had been in receipt of benefits for a number of years, then all of a sudden, we became so sophisticated in the Department of Social Welfare with computerisation, which I welcome, that it was discovered that many people were in receipt of benefits they were not entitled to.  This woman's benefits were cut off.  I made representations on her behalf.  The social welfare officer was doing his job according to the rule book, but this woman suffered terribly.  She was under medical care herself.  She went through trauma because she lost the benefits she had had for a number of years.  Therefore, I welcome the budget provision for the extension of benefits such as free travel and free electricity for certain pensioners.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill a companion will be allowed to travel free with a pensioner in receipt of DPMA who is entitled to free <Col N="919" /> travel.  This will benefit particularly handicapped people, including those with a mental handicap.  We have had representations from many people in this area where the handicapped person had a travel pass but could go nowhere unless travelling with someone who had to pay his or her fare.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to concede on this.  The extension of the national fuel scheme is important and will benefit many people.</P>
    <P>This Minister has listened to backbenchers and to representations from Opposition Deputies and he has acted on them and we see the result in this Bill. Generally he has tackled many areas.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to local community based areas.  The Minister has close contact with people in the community through the social welfare grants &mdash; such as the May-field group in Cork who get financial assistance.  Here the Minister is showing his foresight in targeting the area in the community most in need.  Long-term unemployed people in Cork who have endeavoured to do something for themselves were penalised because if they did a job in the parish, voluntarily or otherwise, they were classed as not being available for work and they were inhibited from doing that kind of work.  In this Social Welfare Bill, the Minister has recognised such matters.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister and to appeal to the Opposition, particularly the main Opposition party, to withdraw their amendments.  It is farcical.  There is great benefit in this Social Welfare Bill but we got negative contributions from some of the people on the other side of the House.  It is easy to smile.  I feel sorry for them because there is so little they can say against this Bill. We are revolutionising the Department of Social Welfare and the changes can be seen right down to the lowest level of the community.  There is still a great deal of work to be done.  I appeal to the Opposition to be positive and to give credit where it is due, to the Minister, the Government and the Department for the changes that are taking place which are making life easier and better.  We could <Col N="920" /> do a great deal more if we had not inherited some of our problems such as the national debt, inflation, high borrowings, all the things the Opposition like to forget.  There seems to be a blockage of minds on that side of the House regarding these matters.  If we did not have the doubling of the national debt in a very short time, we would be able to do much more for the people to whom I have referred and we might be able to do some of the things the Opposition Deputies have been looking for.</P>
    <P>This Government and this Minister have taken decisions that affect people in a positive way and the evidence is in this Social Welfare Bill.  I compliment the Minister and the Government and look forward to working with the Minister as we have done in the last couple of years. I hope that at the end of the day the people will realise that there are Deputies here who have concern for them, and are not just expressing concern.  The evidence of that is in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> That is being negative.  I suppose no industry has grown so much as the section that deals with social welfare.  Unfortunately for many of the officials, they did not get the extra help they needed when the demand for extra services was coming.  I compliment in particular the social welfare officers in the community welfare offices throughout the country.  From my experience they have been excellent and the Minister has got great value from them.  They are the last line of defence in many cases where people have been refused or delayed over unemployment assistance payments, separation payments and so on, and social welfare at community level had to come along and deal with problems.</P>
      <P>Last week I decided what teachers should be; this week I will give two qualities that I think social welfare community officers have and need.  They need the charity of St. Vincent de Paul and the wisdom of Solomon.  In the long run they can never grow so callous that they will not see the human side of any story. At the same time, they have to realise that someone might try to pull the wool over their eyes.  They have to be able to judge a situation.  I have found they have rescued many people who were in difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are long delays in cases which social welfare officers are investigating. Will the Minister consider whether this is because of shortage of staff or the system?  Today I telephoned Sligo about a case and they told me that the social welfare officer had got the file on 17 January but that it had not been returned. All the social welfare officer does is to confirm that the person is separated and give details of the person's income.  These delays are far too long when investigating allowances to which people are entitled. <Col N="922" /> I cannot understand how our emigrants can go over to England and be fixed up within a week or so when it takes eight weeks here for a file to be sent back for a decision on a case.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter?</P>
    <P>We welcome all the increases given and quite a lot has been made of the fact that the 5 per cent is well above inflation. The Minister is forecasting an inflation rate of 3 per cent from mid-1990 to mid1991 and I hope he is right.  The Taoiseach yesterday managed to double the number of hours we were discussing an Army Bill so I hope the figures in relation to inflation have not gone haywire.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on doing something about free travel for the disabled. We passed a motion in my health board area over two years ago and sent it to the Minister.  When I arrived here last autumn my first question was in relation to free travel for disabled people. It was a gross injustice over the years and I am glad the Minister did something in this regard.  The carer's allowance and the lone parent's allowance are new and welcome.  However, I hope there is not a catch in relation to income assessment and that everyone will get the £45 allowance.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the appeals office because I have very strong views in relation to medical referees.  Indeed, I tabled a question in regard to their qualifications and I was flabbergasted to find that they had to have a minimum of six years' experience.  I thought that most of them were anything but medical people because, as far as I am concerned, they are the Paul Daniels of the medical service. They can overrule everything that a specialist or surgeon said and, by looking at a person, decide that he or she is fit for work, which is incredible.  The system should be abandoned or changed to make it more flexible.  People have been told that they are fit for work although that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I know of the case of a welder in heavy steel who had an operation for a hernia. He had not missed work for ten years but, five weeks after the operation, he was declared fit for work.  His own doctor <Col N="923" /> said he was not fit for work but the medical referee did not agree.  I made inquiries and I was told he did not have to go back to the job he had been doing.  I am sure he would have been able to turn a page of the Book of Kells in Trinity College or to lift milk bottles but, of course, that is absurd.  Where do people find employment except where they have spent their life working?  There is no such thing as special jobs for people recovering from an operation.  I cannot accept that people are getting a fair crack of the whip from medical referees at present.  People who have been in hospital are simply told they are fit for work.  I do not know if the Minister will listen to this complaint but it is a very serious matter to expect people to go back to work when they are unable to do so.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a standard answer to women looking for unemployment assistance, which is that they are not available for work.  I know of a case where a woman worked all her life.  Her five children are reared and have left home and she and her husband occupy the house.  The firm for which she worked closed down and she signed for unemployment assistance.  Lo and behold, they decided that she was unavailable for work even though, for the first time in her life, she did not have anybody to look after and was free to take up employment.  The other answer women get is that they are not looking for work.  How can anyone decide that when there are so few jobs? I accept that there must be a certain standard but when you know the people involved it is a different matter.  We find it very difficult to accept the rulings given.</P>
    <P>Another matter which regularly crops up is the question of people living at home with their families.  They can be classed as having an income of £25 &mdash; or in one case £39 &mdash; which is absurd.  It is unfair to the father who is working, paying his PRSI and income tax, to have to hand over £25 to a son or a daughter. If the son or daughter is assessed with means of £25 it is technically the father <Col N="924" /> who has to provide it.  Deputy Bell mentioned that the total income of the household is included when it comes to local charges.  Sometimes a single unemployed person is receiving about £30 which means that the household is automatically over the limit for the waiver scheme.  However, that has been mentioned by so many Deputies I will not go over it again.</P>
    <P>I already tabled a question to the Minister about the Freefone system now that social welfare is being dealt with in Sligo. The Minister's answer was that if people ring the Dublin number they will be transferred, free of charge, to Sligo.  That would be fine if everyone lived in Dublin but, unfortunately, if somebody rings from Carlow, Kerry, Cork or Donegal, they still have to pay the cost of the call to Dublin.  Anyone who makes regular telephone calls knows that it can be very expensive to ring Sligo and to hold on while they look up files and so on.  It is part and parcel of the system that there is a delay.  The people who are telephoning about payments are those who are awaiting payments and they cannot afford to be in a telephone booth looking at their money disappearing into the telephone. The Minister said that he might consider telephoning people back and something like that will have to be done because people cannot afford the high cost of telephone calls.</P>
    <P>I hope an amendment will be tabled to the section on PRSI for the self-employed and farmers.  I ask the Minister to consider giving <i>pro rata</i> payments to those who do not have the full ten years as there is a difference of about £8 between the contributory and non-contributory pension.  If somebody is short three years he should be cut by £3 and if he is only short one year he might get the full pension. It is indefensible that, as the Minister said in a reply some time ago, in the case of a non-contributory pension 50 per cent of the PRSI payment would not be returned.  It is unfair that the farmers and the self-employed should have to contribute to a non-contributory pension. That is a contradiction in itself.  It is something that the Minister could readily <Col N="925" /> adjust if he so wishes.  As I have said, I hope to put down an amendment on PRSI payments for those who have less than ten years' payments.  These people have no choice at present other than to make these payments.  They will get back 50 per cent of it and the rest will go towards a non-contributory pension which, as I said, is a contradiction.</P>
    <P>Medical certificates get lost on a regular basis.  I wonder would it be possible to have medical certificates presented at local offices.  This would save a lot of red tape.  When they are transferred from one place to the other some of them get lost.  This is not an unusual occurrence. There should be a system whereby medical certificates could be supplied to the local office and the information could be conveyed by computer to Dublin.  That would save a lot of hassle.</P>
    <P>I want to make a special plea to the Minister on behalf of a group of people who are forgotten in Ireland, that is the deaf.  Many young people suffer from this handicap but do not appear to be suffering.  I was amazed to hear &mdash; I hope it was wrong information &mdash; that there is only one social worker dealing with the deaf in all of Ireland.  I find that incredible considering the seriousness of this handicap. There are about 30 social workers dealing with the blind.  I am not for one minute criticising that fact &mdash; I am sure that number is not half enough considering the handicap they have to deal with &mdash; but I would ask the Minister to take a serious look at the way the deaf in this country are treated.</P>
    <P>Deaf people who go through second level education have certain facilities available to them.  I have discovered that a third level student who until now has had the facility of what is known as a phonic ear &mdash; a disc with two earphones and a microphone which can pick up sound &mdash; is now deprived of that facility and has not the slightest idea of what is going on.  That person has to read books at home in order to make up for what he is losing out at school.  I would appeal to the Minister to make sure that third level institutions have a facility such as the <Col N="926" /> phonic ear so that deaf people can continue with the standards to which they have become accustomed.  They have handicap enough in life and they should not be further handicapped because they will get frustrated and may decide to leave school.</P>
    <P>I know grants are given for phones for these people whereby they can tap out messages but many people do not know about them.  It is very important that a number of social workers be appointed who could give these people information on grants which they can get from the health boards or the Department of Social Welfare.  We can hear and speak but these people are cut off and it is important that they be provided with facilities, which may not cost very much. I believe there is a special alarm clock for the deaf which costs about £70.  Perhaps that amount is beyond the means of a student attending classes in Dublin.  The deaf are not being catered for and I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I welcome that and I congratulate the Minister on it.  We should do everything possible to encourage people to go back to school. They are brave people and we should give them a medal as well as providing facilities for them.</P>
      <P>The question of fraud has been referred to.  God knows I am not defending anyone who defrauds the system because they cause too many problems for the genuine people, but I notice that the cut-off point for payment to them is three months now instead of six months. I wonder is this the best way of punishing them.  If they are depending on that money how will they survive for the three months that they are deprived of any payment?  Perhaps they will commit crime in order to survive.</P>
      <P>The delay in social welfare people coming out to check matters is a problem. There is too much red tape in this area. As I have said before, if you were lucky enough to wake up some morning and hear that every regulation in the Department of Social Welfare was burned in a fire, your life would probably start anew.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> If that does not happen, maybe the Taoiseach would consider giving the Minister a sabbatical for three months in order to do something about the matter.  There are many anomalies in the system, as was pointed out before the Minister came in. I know of a person on supplementary allowance who has been accused of having £38,000 but everyone knows this person has not got the money.  I went to the trouble of getting a photocopy of the person's savings account from the social welfare officer and sent it to Sligo on behalf of the person.  The office in Sligo told me they had to send it back to the <Col N="928" /> social welfare officer, even though he had already seen it.  There are anomalies such as this in the system, as the Minister well knows, and if he could get rid of half of them it would be a great help.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell mentioned the use of plastic cards for pensioners and suggested it would be a very good system.  If it was introduced I wonder would the Minister receive a mass of letters from people saying he had taken their money from them.  Would old people accept plastic cards?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of participating in this debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1990.  The Bill is a comprehensive and detailed one.  It proposes important alterations to our existing social welfare schemes and services. It is part of this Government's stepped care programme for continued improvements in social welfare.  Since 1987 this Government, the previous Government and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, have shown the commitment to rationalise our social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill is very comprehensive and it would be unfair of me to take up too much time, so I intend to focus on a number of sections of the Bill.  Part II, sections 3 and 4, refer to increased payments for social welfare unemployment benefit and assistance recipients.  I welcome the increase in the payments to the elderly, the disadvantaged and particularly for the long term unemployed.  I firmly believe that <Col N="929" /> we must keep other unemployment payments and benefits, such as the medical card, etc., under review.  Surely it is unfair that individuals in the community and active in the work force, contributing by way of tax, PRSI and health and youth employment levies, can avail of few benefits and no allowances.  I believe we must encourage more people into the workforce and we have to increase the differential between those on unemployment benefit or assistance and those who enjoy employment.  If we take the example of a married man with two or three children who is in receipt of social welfare and availing of other benefits, such as a medical card, etc., he may find that he would lose all State benefits if we were to obtain employment.  This must surely be addressed.  We should have a graduated system before a social welfare recipient loses all benefits if he or she were to come off the live register.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of new initiatives in the Bill and it is appropriate that we give due recognition to them. The new carer's allowance is dealt with in sections 17 and 18 of the Bill.  This is the first time we are putting in place legislation giving official recognition to carers.  This allowance is, of course, a development of the prescribed relative's allowance and provides for an increase in payment and an extension of the categories who will qualify for it.  The expert opinion is &mdash; and I believe it is recognised &mdash; that care in the home is providing a quality of life and a reliable source of care for incapacitated persons.  I hope that the new carer's allowance of £45 weekly is just the start of the development of a structure that will encourage more care for incapacitated persons in the home.  There are large amounts of money being spent on the care of incapacitated persons either by way of hospital services, welfare homes, subventions to nursing homes and the development of community care services in providing day care centres, ambulance services, day hospitals, taxi charges, home help, respite care, meals on wheels, grants to voluntary organisations and other such services.  Taking the global <Col N="930" /> expenditure on these services, we have great potential to develop the carer's allowance recognition of carers.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether a person in receipt of the new carer's allowance for caring for an incapacitated person will be affected if the incapacitated person receives day care services or respite care?</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the lone parent's allowance, and this is indicative of the retionalisation of our system.  We had a rather confusing and complicated array of allowances payable to the widows, widowers, separated, deserted, and unmarried persons.  In the case of desertion, I have come across a number of situations where one side blames the other and you have difficulty in proving who deserted whom.  This section removes the question of fault; the payments are based on need, ensuring that allowances are paid to one parent and the children in need.  This is indeed very welcome.  Recently we have seen more and more lone parents raising the family on their own.  The lone parent's allowance normally recognises the right of all parents to bring up their children and for the first time provides payments for certain lone parents such as separated spouses and unmarried fathers.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 22, inclusive, are very interesting and deal with appeals and the setting up of a separate appeals office in the Department.  I look forward to the results of the challenges that face these new arrangements for social welfare appeals.  In the past I have been advised that social welfare recipients had to undergo nightmarish interviews when appealing decisions.  I therefore welcome these new arrangements for a new self-contained and precision made appeals office, which will include private rooms for the hearing of appeals, the appointment of the chief appeals officer and appeals officers and the measures being taken to separate clearly the appeals function from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at the following case.  An individual who had contributed to the PRSI system for a <Col N="931" /> number of years goes abroad, for example, to the UK, for a period and contributed to their system, when he returns home and cannot get employment he cannot avail of unemployment benefit as he needs one stamp from the time he comes back.  I appreciate that he may be entitled to unemployment assistance, but I feel he should be entitled to unemployment benefit in his own right as he had contributed to the system.  There are also a number of persons who have contributed to the PRSI over their working lives but for one reason or another they had come out of insurable employment during some period of their working lives.  In the case of a CIE bus conductor who had been paying the A1 PRSI contribution who is promoted to the rank of inspector, who no longer pays the A1 contribution and does not avail of voluntary contibutions, he may not realise until he applies for an old age contributory pension that he is short a number of stamps.  Indeed, quite recently a constituent of mine who had contributed for many years as a self-employed taxi driver and for a short period &mdash; I think the Minister is aware of the 1953 anomaly that exists &mdash; was out of insurable employment.  When he eventually applied for a contributory old age pension he realised, when it was far too late, that he had not sufficient stamps.  I believe this situation must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which I wish to refer to in the Bill.  The clothing allowance and the allocation of £3 million to assist social welfare recipients to provide school and winter clothing for the children are very welcome.  The streamlining of the rates for children and adult dependants, particularly in section 6 of the Bill, which provides that long term social welfare recipients continue to receive child dependant payments for the children up to 20 years of age who remain in full time education, is welcomed.  The increase of child benefit to £15.80 per month for the first four children and to £22.90 per month for the fifth child is also welcome.  The extension of payment after the death of a spouse, the extension of <Col N="932" /> the national fuel scheme and the fact that invalidity pensioners who transfer to retirement pension retain their entitlements for the free scheme, and that pensioners over 80 years of age can retain their entitlement to free electricity when someone comes to live with them &mdash; all of these have to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the free travel scheme to allow recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance who may require a guardian or parent to travel with them, to bring along a companion who can travel free of charge. I am aware of a number of cases where recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance were offered the opportunity to avail of sheltered working but because of the concerns expressed by their parents and the fact they would have had to travel to the place of employment by bus they were unable to avail of this opportunity.  The extension of this scheme will open up new frontiers for the recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to various measures contained in the Bill.  I have before me a copy of the amendment to the Bill tabled by the main Opposition party.  Paragraph (a) of the amendment reads &ldquo;it fails to fundamentally reform the Social Welfare system&rdquo;.  It is my understanding that last year the PRSI scheme was extended to cover the self-employed and now we are introducing a carer's allowance and a lone parent's allowance, and flexibility in the social welfare system.  For example, one will be able to undertake a course of education or part-time work while continuing to avail of social welfare payments.  Given the fact that some attempts have been made to reform the system, I cannot understand why this amendment has been put down.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the amendment reads &ldquo;it leaves the bulk of the low-paid in the PRSI net&rdquo;.  However I understand that this is the first such exemption to be granted.  The Minister has stated that those earning £60 per week or less will be exempt from paying PRSI contributions. There are many arguments one could put <Col N="933" /> forward about the way in which this could be implemented but this exemption is still to be welcomed.  I am somewhat surprised that the Opposition have tabled this amendment, as not so long ago, as was pointed out by a speaker on this side of the House, they were in Government when they had the opportunity to introduce exemptions of this nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (c) of the amendment reads &ldquo;it retains substantial anomalies and multiple means-testing based on gross rather than net incomes&rdquo;. It is our objective to improve payments and this Bill must be seen as part of an attempt to rationalise the system.  Paragraph (d) of the amendment reads &ldquo;it makes only a token gesture towards anti-poverty measures&rdquo;.  During the past three years there have been sustained improvements in social welfare payments and this Bill must be seen as part of our care approach.  The unemployed have received increases of just over 25 per cent during the past three years and this compares most favourably with the increases granted by the previous Government.  Furthermore, it will cost £216 million to implement the measures announced in the budget, yet the Opposition say that it is only a token gesture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of the amendment reads: &ldquo;it totally fails to develop adequate educational opportunities and voluntary work options for the quarter of a million unemployed and their dependants&rdquo;. Once again they have got their figures wrong as there are not 250,000 unemployed; indeed, this figure is steadily being <Col N="934" /> reduced.  What is of more importance is that legislation has been introduced which allows the Minister for Education greater flexibility.  This is another reason why I am somewhat surprised that the Opposition have put down this amendment, which I cannot support.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for bringing this Bill before the House.  I referred to the opportunities the previous Government had but which they failed to take, while previous speakers highlighted the mess we inherited on coming into Government in 1987.  It should be remembered that the Minister who introduced this Bill also introduced the Social Welfare Act, 1981.  This Bill is an improvement on that Act and is substantial legislation.  The fact that the Minister introduced that Act in 1981 and is now bringing this Bill before the House in 1990 shows his commitment in this area.  As I said earlier, it is Government policy to make improvements in the social welfare system and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I want to make on this major Bill but before doing so I would like to take up a number of the points made by Deputy Callely.  The amendment put down by the Fine Gael Party highlights some of the anomalies in the system.  In relation to the number of unemployed, 250,000 is a conservative estimate, because if we took into account the number unemployed and the number who have emigrated, the figure would be much greater. Unfortunately, those people had no option but to emigrate.  It is not my intention to get involved in a political argument, as many homes throughout the country depend on the social welfare system for their main source of income. I want to be as positive as I can rather than negative and therefore would like to welcome some aspects of the Bill.  For example, the lone parent's allowance, the carer's allowance, the increases in social welfare payments and the establishment of a social welfare appeals office are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> On becoming a public representative I was shocked to discover the number of queries from social welfare recipients. Many difficulties in the system have been highlighted to me.  There is concern about the length of time it takes the Department to make a decision in regard to the payment of unemployment assistance.  I wonder why it is necessary to have so many sections in a Department dealing with the various schemes.  People have to go all over the place to find the relevant section and obtain a response to their queries.  I wonder why there is a need for all the red tape in regard to the schemes.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that all public representatives have expressed their concern about the delays in the payment of unemployment assistance, disability benefit and so on.  It is unacceptable that there should be long delays in reaching decisions with regard to such applications. We should bear in mind that the people involved may be in dire need of a social welfare benefit.  It is up to the Department to expedite all applications and to have payments made promptly.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that it should take so long for a person to receive unemployment assistance.  A person who applies to a social welfare office for assistance will have to wait from five to 14 weeks for payment, but if that individual approaches their local health board they will be given a decision on an application for supplementary welfare allowance almost immediately.  I cannot fathom how a health board official can make a decision on the spot and that the Department, with all the facilities at their disposal, can take up to five weeks to make a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department are governed by legislation and that is the basic difference.  However, I accept that there should not be delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity to make radical changes in the system and he should do so.  I cannot understand why it should take the <Col N="936" /> Department so long and I should like the Minister to investigate that complaint.</P>
      <P>I agree with the amendment tabled by Deputy Flaherty to the Bill.  The first reason advanced by Deputy Flaherty for not supporting the Bill is that it retains substantial anomalies and multiple means-testing based on gross rather than net incomes.  We must give that issue our serious attention.  It is wrong to take gross income into consideration.  Health boards and other agencies take the gross income into consideration when dealing with applications for medical cards and so on.  That is unfair because it does not take account of the financial commitments of families.  Under the existing means testing system it is not possible to ascertain if the family are finding it difficult to exist on their income.  We must take into consideration the financial outgoings of a family and their net income.  There are many families in need of social welfare, or other help such as medical cards, but they are debarred because gross incomes are taken into consideration. I appeal to the Minister to consider changing that provision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty also stated that she is opposing the Bill because it totally fails to develop adequate educational opportunities and voluntary work options for the 250,000 unemployed and their dependants.  I agree with that sentiment. I was glad to hear the Minister reassure my colleague, Deputy Browne, in regard to those attending second level schools but I wonder why the concession was not extended to those attending third level courses.  Are those who pursue third level courses entitled to social welfare benefits? A person in Cork who was in receipt of social welfare benefit while at secondary school succeeded in obtaining the requisite number of points to gain entry to university.  Unfortunately, once there was a threat to withdraw the social welfare benefit if he went to university he had to turn down the offer of a place at one of the college's faculties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A pilot scheme along the lines suggested by the Deputy will be <Col N="937" /> introduced shortly.  The problem is a lot greater than the Deputy realises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but individuals who do everything possible to gain educational qualifications should be encouraged, even if they decide to go on to third level education.  I accept that money is always a problem as far as such schemes are concerned.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the carer's allowance and the increase in the rate of benefits under other schemes. However, under the means testing system those on the borderline do not qualify for benefit.  That is a big problem for many people, particularly those living in rural areas.  The carer's allowance, which is an extension of the prescribed relative's allowance, discriminates against those living in rural Ireland.  In my constituency agricultural holdings are small and the financial return from them is very low.  It is unfortunate that under the new scheme those who get a return from an agricultural holding, irrespective of its size, do not qualify for the carer's allowance.  I am referring to the people who look after the elderly and the handicapped, the dedicated people in our society.  Those who take on that responsibility are dedicated whether they live in rural Ireland or in the cities.  I accept that to extend the provisions of the scheme will cost more money but in the long term it will mean a saving to the State.  We should do all in our power to keep those people at home.  Most Irish families will keep their elderly and handicapped relatives at home if it is financially possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to state an example where another anomaly lies, that is in the area of unemployment assistance for farmers and of the way in which the means test is carried out.  If a farmer is seeking unemployment assistance he is means tested by the local social welfare officer. The price of cattle at 1987-88 prices is taken into consideration though, as everyone is aware, cattle prices have fallen dramatically in the past 12 to 18 months.  It is unfair to means test an individual who cannot obtain the <Col N="938" /> amounts of money provided for in the guidelines laid down by the Department of Social Welfare.  This is a matter that should be looked at immediately.  If the price of cattle increased in the next six or eight months there should be some means available, through legislation, whereby the means test could be varied.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with social welfare fraud.  Since the Minister took office much money has been saved in this grey area.  I congratulate him on that achievement.  However, the Department may have become obsessive in relation to fraud so far as social welfare is concerned. A special group was set up &mdash; whose name I cannot recall &mdash; to deal with this issue.  I have constituents, and I would think this applies to every Deputy in the House, who have had the experience of these groups visiting local areas and speaking with ten or 15 people who were in receipt of unemployment assistance or disability benefit.  This practice is nothing short of total and utter intimidation because these people were told that the Department were aware they were working.  A number of constituents came to me very worried and very anxious because what was said to them was totally untrue.  These bullyboy tactics in the long term will create problems rather than alleviate them.  I would ask the Minister to examine the matter so that it does not continue on the scale on which it has occurred in the past and to ensure that if these people are going into an area they have their facts and do not behave in a threatening or intimidating manner.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit has caused some problems.  Most Deputies have dealt with this issue and with the question of medical referees deciding on whether a person is able to work.  This is a difficult area to sort out properly.  There are people who are genuinely unable to work but a medical referee may look at such a person and decide he or she is able to work and should go to work.  I recall being in the House on the last day when social welfare questions were taken and the Minister stated that possibly the problem was <Col N="939" /> one of mental attitude, that people might think they were not fit for work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was an example I do not know what kind of people he should employ as medical referees, perhaps psychiatrists would be of some help.  Unfortunately there are many people who are unable to work but by some psychic powers which medical referees have they state that such people should be working.</P>
      <P>There is one example I would like to give the Minister and it relates to the whole area of bureaucracy and the frustration of social welfare recipients and public representatives in this regard.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the lone parent's allowance because it is putting together unmarried mothers and widowers in this respect and is getting rid of unnecessary bureaucracy.  I had a constituent who was called before a medical referee.  On the date in question the person was ill and sent in a doctor's certificate.  Because the doctor's certificate did not state the actual day and date the medical interview took place, the woman was requested to provide another one.  She was ill and had to remain in bed for a further week.  The Department of Social Welfare did not accept that and that woman had to forward three certificates all of the same date; even then they were not accepted. As a new Deputy I put down a parliamentary question on the matter and was told it had been investigated and that the Department would accept the certificate. I do not want to be totally negative but the person who had called the Department of Social Welfare on numerous occasions should have been entitled to the same answer as I got when I put down the parliamentary question.  Until we do something positive we will still have those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the initiative he has taken.  This is a very substantial Social Welfare Bill.  It goes 25 per cent to 40 per cent of the way towards a <Col N="940" /> total overhauling of the system.  As a country we are not enticed towards changing too quickly but there are substantial changes that will have to be made in our social welfare system in the not too distant future.  I hope the Minister will take them on board in the short term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in paying tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, who has introduced in this Social Welfare Bill the largest amount of social welfare legislation introduced in any such Bill in over 40 years.  In many ways this gives the lie to the many comments and analyses of Fianna Fáil Governments of recent years to the effect that we have somehow veered to the Right or are a party of the Right.  The performance of the Minister in the Department of Social Welfare gives the lie to that impression because he has been extremely consistent in overhauling the social welfare system and in making it responsive to the real needs of the poorer sections of our society.  We saw the Fine Gael Party at their recent Árd Fheis apparently moving to the Left but, as Hugh Munroe in a recent article in the <i>Evening Press</i> pointed out, that in many ways is a tribute to the Fianna Fáil Party because it is an indication that Fine Gael accept, as many others do, that for many years Fianna Fáil have had the overwhelming support of the working class people in our society.  That is no accident.  It is as a result of the party's own inherent philosophy, which is to care for the lesser sections of society and to create a society in which equality of opportunity is available to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That philosophy has been continued and implemented by this Government and by the previous Government during their period in office.  It is very important to put this on the record.  Fianna Fáil are very close to the people; they know what their needs are and they are very anxious to improve their living standards.  I want to pay special tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare Deputy Woods, who has taken a number of initiatives in recent years and continues to take an innovative approach towards the social welfare <Col N="941" /> system by trying to help the less well off in our society.</P>
    <P>The general increases in this Bill more than match the rate of inflation.  The Minister is to be praised for this.  People have been impressed by many of the initiatives in the Bill, particularly the carer's allowance. The carer's allowance represents a major step in the evolution of the social welfare system and will help to bring the family back to the forefront in the care for the elderly.  For the first time in our legislative history official recognition has been given to the role of the person who cares for the elderly in the community. I believe this measure will have major repercussions on the institutionalised care of the elderly.  In time it should lead to a significant reduction in the number of old people who are very often prematurely sent into institutions.  This in turn could result in savings in the health area, thereby releasing even greater resources for the care of the elderly in the community. I think the Minister said that the family must remain at centre stage in caring for the elderly and incapacitated, and that the family unit represents the best means for channelling State resources towards that end.</P>
    <P>I suppose in many respects institutionalised care for the elderly started with the industrialised era.  In pre-industrial societies the family catered for the elderly, the incapacitated, the mentally handicapped and so forth.  There were simply no institutions to which elderly people could be sent.  With the industrial revolution, the growth of cities and urbanisation, we witnessed a growth in health institutions and institutions for the mentally handicapped.  The pendulum swung too far and people sent elderly relatives into institutions to get them out of the way, so to speak.  In many respects the carer's allowance will redress the balance and give due recognition to the people who have cared for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The new clothing allowance to help social welfare recipients provide for their children's school and winter clothing is a very practical response to the difficulties being faced by the poorer sections of our society.  The months of September and <Col N="942" /> October have often been the times of greatest financial hardship for the parents of large families who have to meet the enormous cost of preparing for the new school year.  The allocation of £3 million should go a long way towards easing the burden on those people.  I know the Minister received numerous representations from Deputies and various organisations dealing with welfare and poverty issues asking for some form of allowance to help large families when their need is greatest. The introduction of this allowance is a very practical response.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the success of the vocational training opportunities scheme and the part-time educational initiative, much more still remains to be done in the educational area.  We should move towards the stage where anyone coming out of second level schools who cannot immediately find employment should be automatically given an allowance as well as the opportunity to pursue some further education or training.  I think regulations were introduced last September to facilitate long-term unemployed persons to participate in second level courses while receiving unemployment payments.  This was a major step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister told the House that he intends to announce shortly details of a pilot scheme which will allow the long-term unemployed to pursue third level education in the future. The long-term unemployed should be entitled and encouraged to pursue third level education.  I wish the Minister well in his initative.  As a general principle, an unemployed person should be entitled to pursue educational opportunities at both second and third level without the welfare system putting obstacles in his or her way.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has made tremendous efforts in this regard but has come up against numerous bureaucratic obstacles within the Department of Education.  Essentially this is a matter which has to be resolved between both Departments.  With the expansion in the post-leaving certificate courses which we have witnessed in recent years, particularly in the vocational sector, many young people of 19 and 20 years who <Col N="943" /> have completed their leaving certificate and are now entering vocational education programmes and various other schemes under the auspices of the Department of Education are receiving no allowance.  In many ways the absence of a welfare payment is stopping people from taking the educational road and directing them elsewhere.  This will have a negative impact on society as a whole. The welfare system should &mdash; I know the Minister is moving in this direction &mdash; encourage people to stay in education so that they can improve their capacity to gain employment in the future.  The only way many lower skilled workers who have been on the long-term unemployment register would be able to gain fruitful employment in the future is to learn new skills and be given the opportunity to pursue further education and training.  This will enable them to take up jobs and it will be possible to recruit them for many of the new job opportunities which arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the means testing of young people to the Minister's attention. This system of means testing should be reviewed because young people who choose to stay at home with their parents and families are being discriminated against in some ways.  Means testing the family income often means that the young person who has applied for unemployment assistance receives a pittance, or nothing at all.  The present system encourages young people to leave home and in the process this contributes to the creation of greater social problems in larger towns and cities.  The Minister should review this entire situation.  A young person who has left school and reached adulthood should be entitled to receive a basic social welfare payment, irrespective of the income of his or her parents, brothers and sisters.  That should be an established principle.  For far too long young people have been receiving £5 and £7 unemployment assistance because of the income of their parents, brothers and sisters.</P>
    <P>Other areas of the Bill deserve commendation. I welcome in particular the <Col N="944" /> rationalisation in the lone parent's allowance. Up until now there were six different payments in this area and the Minister has rationalised these into one lone parent's allowance.  I congratulate him on doing this.  I also welcome the move to allow the companions of a recipient of a disabled person's maintenance allowance a free travel pass.  People have been calling for this measure for some time.  I welcome this very charitable and decent response by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme is one mechanism by which people on lower wages can top up their income, particularly if they have large families. It is regrettable that the take-up of this scheme is not as high as the Department of Social Welfare estimated.  Some people who are entitled to benefit under this scheme have not applied for it.  The word must go out loud and clear that people should apply for assistance under the family income supplement scheme so that their position will be improved.  I welcome the recent moves made by the Minister in advertising the scheme more widely in order that more people may benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well in his endeavours to bring in further reforms in the social welfare code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of speaking on social welfare. The Minister said that massive amounts of money, £7.5 million per day, were being spent on social welfare.  That is a figure of considerable magnitude, but it must be balanced against the numbers who are dependent on it &mdash; the 233,000 unemployed, people on disability benefit, old age pensioners and all the other categories. We have to look at what it means to the individual.  Unemployment benefit has been increased from £45 to £48 per week; that is their lot from Irish society. Unemployment assistance goes up from £42 to £45.  Society is not over-providing for these people.  The increases are indeed small and inflation will cut deeply into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any public representative will know of <Col N="945" /> the frustration expressed by the recipients of a variety of services within social welfare, but no two areas cause as much frustration as the appeals structure for unemployment assistance and disability benefit.  I appreciate that there are problems because of the substantial volume of payments.  There is nothing more frustrating for a person, however, than a protracted wait for a decision.  This might be alleviated by providing additional staff for certain areas.  There is a particular problem in relation to decisions made by medical referees.  It is not my intention to contest the decision of a professional person but many of their decisions seem amazing, with referrals to a second and third medical referee.  There seems to be a total lack of recognition of the reports of consultants and others involved with the claimant.  Decisions appear to be based exclusively on the certificate of the medical practitioner.  The Minister would do well to have an in-depth examination of that whole procedure so that where a consultant is involved his evidence would be borne in mind.  If this were done, there would not be the dissatisfaction that exists at the moment among people who feel they are being thrown off just to save money.  I accept that is not the situation, but consultants' opinions are not receiving the emphasis they should.</P>
    <P>Let me relate the position of a person who has been turned down by two medical referees and by a lay deciding officer and who will not be allowed back to employment by his employer's medical officer.  This man has fallen between two stools and is suffering accordingly.  Surely this sort of case should not arise if there was some co-ordination between the medical people in the Department of Social Welfare and those acting on behalf of the employer.  In this case the person cannot go back to work, but at the same time he is denied the benefits for which he has contributed because the medical referees in the Department of Social Welfare have determined that he is capable of working.  There should be a general ruling on such cases so that no insured worker can find himself entitled to <Col N="946" /> neither disability benefit nor to resume employment.</P>
    <P>There is a general welcome for the new carer's allowance and the fact that the existing tight strictures of the prescribed relatives allowance are being relaxed so that the housewife will for the first time be included.  We would all acknowledge that in the main it is the housewife who has been carrying the burden of caring for her own parents or the parents of her spouse and doing an exceptionally good job.  It is disappointing, however, that there will be a means test for this allowance. That is a pity at a time when there is so much need for this service in the community to obviate the necessity to place aged people in homes or institutions. The Minister should have opted for a wider discretionary base.  There is no means test for child benefit; it is one allowance to which the housewife has automatic claim.  I would suggest that this carer's allowance should be treated in the same way and should be given automatically to the housewife, generally in the younger age group, who is catering for a family and a spouse and at the same time carrying out tremendous humanitarian work caring for the aged within her house.  If that is not done the number of people who will qualify will be exceptionally low.  The Bill has merit but it needs to be capable of being utilised by the incapacitated and others in the community by widening the base of the means testing structure.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 18 on 15 February 1990, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has at my request:</P>
      <P>already undertaken a survey of certain grocery prices to determine whether the favourable movement in pound-sterling exchange rate was reflected in lower retail prices; and</P>

      <P>In recognition of its work in the consumer area, I recently provided direct Exchequer financial assistance to the Consumers Association of Ireland from my Department's Vote.  This is the first such allocation for over 20 years.</P>
      <P>Moreover, as I pointed out in reply to Question No. 25, on 5 December 1989, my colleague, the Minister for Health, provided State funding both in 1988 and 1989, which has assisted in the procurement by the association of substantial financial assistance from the EC Commission.</P>

In view of the recent annual report by the <Col N="948" /> Director of Consumer Affairs in which he clearly indicated that due to lack of resources in his office he is unable to do all the things he has been asked to do, is it not time to recognise that one of the best ways of dealing with the passing on of price reductions would be to involve the consumers' association in a watchdog capacity?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 3 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most notable effects of Government economic policy in recent years has been the improvement in the cost competitiveness of Irish industry resulting from reduced inflation, lower <Col N="951" /> interest rates, competitive wage increases, a stable currency within the EMS and reduced public utility costs. This improved competitiveness has been reflected in increased employment and output and record export levels.</P>
    <P>Recent changes in interest rates reflect an international trend designed to keep inflation under control, while the fluctuations in the sterling/punt exchange rate are a reflection of events in the UK rather than any problem in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of 1987 there have been significant improvements in the differentials between Irish interest rates and those in other countries.  While in March 1987 the key three month rate in Ireland was nearly 3.5 per cent higher than in the UK it is now considerably below the UK rate.  Similarly, differentials <i>vis-à-vis</i> German rates have improved dramatically. The stronger punt/sterling exchange rate will inevitably have some adverse effect on the competitiveness of Irish industry on the UK market. However, against this must be considered the considerably higher UK inflation and wage rate increases.  Overall the competitive position of Irish industry has improved considerably in recent years both generally and more especially over UK industry.</P>
    <P>The priority for Government policy is to continue the efforts to restore order to the public finances and create a favourable economic climate in which interest rates can be kept as low as possible while maintaining the value of the punt within the EMS.  This will create the right environment in which industry can invest with confidence.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the recent increases in interest rates will have any adverse effect on our ability to attract inward investment.  Quite the contrary, the strength of the Irish economy and our clear determination to maintain a competitive environment for industry will make Ireland more attractive for such investment.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister's reply one would swear everything was rosy.  Is he aware that the clothing industry is going through a very difficult period and that this industry depends on the British market to the extent of 60 per cent of its exports?  Given that employers' PRSI rates in Britain and Northern Ireland are 5 per cent less in this industry, would the Minister agree that something must be done to assist this industry which has a high employment content?  Would he also agree that it unwise at this point to consider the abolition of Fóir Teoranta, a body which could assist the two companies mentioned here and many other companies?  The uncertainty of the future of Fóir Teoranta with no replacement is detrimental to Irish industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Fóir Teoranta are concerned, I think the Government decision to wind them up is the right one and I support that fully.  The decision had been taken about a year ago.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned in his question two companies who have run into difficulties where receivers were put in the last six or eight weeks.  In the case of the larger of these two companies the problems were caused by the receivership of the UK parent and the receivership of the UK parent was caused by the fact that they were a very highly geared company as a result of a management buy-out in Britain.  Because of the high interest rates in Britain, which are very substantially higher than they are here, the British company were unable to continue in business.  It had the consequential effect here that because these were subsidiaries of the British company they had go into receivership as well.</P>
      <P>As far as the other smaller companies the Deputy mentions are concerned, I do not think interest rates were a problem that contributed to their decline.  There were some deeper, more long-term difficulties there which they had experienced for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that the number of <Col N="953" /> closures of this kind in the UK is much greater than it is in this country.  Irish clothing companies have been in the happy position of being able to avail of some of the opportunities that have been created in Britain by the closure of a number of long-established companies there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware of the fear being expressed by Irish industry in relation to the increase in interest rates?  Since the Government the Minister is now part of have taken office interest rates have increased considerably, which is detrimental to the development of Irish industry and the creation of jobs.  The Minister's reply indicates that they have no proposals whatsoever to deal with this. To say that our environment is conducive to expansion, ignoring the fact that interest rates continue to increase and that there is every likelihood of further increases, leaves a great deal to be desired.

      <P>I think it is worth drawing the Deputy's attention to the fact that three years ago interest rates in this country were 3.5 per cent higher than they were in Britain.  Interest rates in this country today are 4.5 per cent lower than they are in Britain.  The competitive advantage has swung enormously towards Ireland in this regard and it is very happy for us.  We should be very glad that this is the case.  There have been interest rate increases in recent months, as the Deputy is well aware.

      <Quest>if, having regard to the fact that the last successful fraud prosecution in Ireland took place in 1982, he is satisfied that the powers and resources available to him, as opposed to those available to other Departments, are adequate to assist him in eliminating fraud from Irish businesses; if he is satisfied that the Companies Bill, when passed, will ensure that all legislative provisions necessary for the elimination of fraud will be in place; if he will consider publishing a code of good business practice to supplement and augment the existing and forthcoming companies legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy refers to prosecution of fraud, I take it that he does so in the context of companies legislation, because that certainly is the context in which I am addressing the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see the elimination of fraud from Irish businesses as solely or even primarily a matter for direct action by me or my Department; in fact, I consider that other parties who have dealings with companies, whether as members, creditors, auditors, receivers, liquidators or otherwise, have an equally important role to play under companies legislation in eliminating such abuse.  The Deputy will therefore appreciate that, while certain <Col N="955" /> powers are provided in company law for the Minister's ultimate use, my policy would not be to have a permanent investigatory section within the Department engaged in the elimination of fraud from Irish businesses.  I see it as infinitely more important to provide a framework within which parties dealing with companies who suspect fraud has occurred can use the provisions of company legislation to tackle the problem directly themselves.</P>
    <P>In this regard, while neither the Minister nor Department of Industry and Commerce were directly involved in the cases, I understand that there were a number of successful court actions relating to fraud taken under companies legislation subsequent to 1982.  At the same time, I have to say it is for the very reason that the existing provisions of the 1963 Act which relate to fraud have apparently proved less effective than might have been expected that these provisions are being refined, reinforced or replaced in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  In particular, the provisions of sections 115 and 116 of the Bill, which substitute two sections for the existing section 297 of the Companies Act, 1963, and deal respectively with criminal liability for fraudulent trading and civil liability for fraudulent and reckless trading, will, I think, considerably increase the effectiveness of the existing section 297.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the provisions of Part II of the Bill, dealing with company investigations, which will in future be undertaken under the auspices of the court and which can include the investigation of the affairs of a company which have been conducted with intent to defraud creditors or other persons, will considerably improve the effectiveness of this aspect of companies legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, Chapter 2 of Part VII of the Bill, which deals with the disqualification of directors who have been convicted of indictable offences, including fraud, will greatly improve the ability of the courts to deal effectively with this problem.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, I believe that the Companies Bill, when passed, will, in so far as this is possible, contain the <Col N="956" /> necessary provisions to control fraud in business.  No legislative provision, here or elsewhere, will ever eliminate fraud in business altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the publication of a code of good business practice by me, as suggested by the Deputy, is necessary or desirable.  I am satisfied that the provisions of existing companies legislation, as supplemented by the proposals contained in the Companies Bill, breach of which will leave those guilty open to the appropriate sanctions, is the proper way forward.  In the circumstances I do not intend to publish a code of good business practice.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister be satisfied that, as against existing legislation, the new Bill will allow the Minister and his Department to deal more effectively with groups like the Gallagher Group, as we have recently seen on national TV?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gallagher Group, in so far as they consisted of Merchant Banking Limited, who I understand were the main company in the group, were a bank holding licence under the Central Bank Act.  Therefore, it was and would remain a matter for the Central Bank to deal with banks who default or get into difficulties.  Whatever difficulties occurred in other parts of that group or other companies of that group perhaps were precipitated by the defaults in the bank.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain hire purchase lending agencies, in conjunction with some sections of the car sales industry, conspire to charge exorbitant rates of interest to car purchasers, particularly in relation to lump sum payments to garage owners by some lending agencies to attract business.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has not been drawn to any conspiracy of the nature described by the Deputy.  If the Deputy has any grounds for believing that there may be such a conspiracy, he should bring the matter to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, who is responsible for the investigation of complaints into unfair or restrictive practices in regard to the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it appears restrictive practices are being pursued between some hire purchase companies and some garages? Sums of between £300 and £400 seem to change hands just to ensure that the business is kept between the two. Obviously the motoring public will be penalised because they will have to pay for it.  I am a little disappointed that the Minister does not have inspectors who will check this because it might be quite hard to pinpoint exactly where this is happening.  However, it has been brought to my attention by a number of people and I had hoped that the Minister would employ an inspector or inspectors because, if it is as widespread as I am led to believe, it is quite a problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to conspiracy and I am not aware of any evidence of conspiracy.  I am advised that there are cases where it is believed that some motor car dealers are being given money by lending agencies in order to put business their way.  If that is happening I would regard it as an undesirable practice but it is not illegal and certainly does not amount to a conspiracy. The unfortunate part is that it is the purchaser of the vehicle who takes on the hire purchase, leasing or other arrangements, who pays for it in the long run.  For that reason I regard it as undesirable but it is not &mdash; as termed in the Deputy's question &mdash; a conspiracy and it is not, on the face of it, illegal.  I should like to see full disclosure of this fact to the people concerned so that they <Col N="958" /> could shop around for better terms where a payment of this kind is not being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is an element of most unfair trading in it in the sense that other companies are unable to penetrate the market because they are being kept out?  Surely this comes within the ambit of the Fair Trade Commission? Given the importance of this matter I had hoped that the Minister would be in a position to test the waters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No company is necessarily being kept out because, in the last resort, the purchaser or the lessee of the vehicle can dictate where they will get the finance.  He can insist on some other company being brought in and, if it is a company which do not make this form of undesirable payment to the dealer concerned, the customer is not subject to the additional cost which would be the case in the instance the Deputy gives.  It would not be possible for a car dealer to prevent a customer from getting his finance from another source if he so desires.</P>

      <P>The IDA and SFADCo maintain contact with companies which they have assisted and provide my Department with information on companies at risk whenever such come to notice.  The State agencies work with these companies and assist them wherever possible within the terms of the industrial development legislation.

      <P>I do not think that is necessarily the IDA's fault.  For some time the IDA have identified quite clearly the possibility of a bovine tannery here and have been trying to encourage people in that business to establish such a plant. I understand from them that they are at a fairly advanced stage of negotiation at present with at least one of the two parties whom I mentioned and it would obviously be my hope that these discussions would come to fruition quickly.</P>

      <P>That has been the position in many industries where technology has passed them by; but in this case, provided we get a modern high technology plant, it will be possible to reestablish this form of industry.  I might add that there is not the remotest possibility of the kind of numbers the Deputy mentions ever being employed again in the industry.  The numbers employed will be quite small.</P>

      <P>Section 14 of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, provides that &ldquo;if the Commission, in a report to the Minister, recommend the making of an order and if at the expiration of a period of 12 months after he has received the report the Minister has not made the order, he shall, within 21 days after the said period, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing giving the reasons why he has not made the order.&rdquo;  The Fair Trade Commission report of their study of Restrictions in the Profession of Patent and Trade Mark Agents did not recommend the making of an order.  I am not, therefore, under any obligation to place a statement before Dáil Éireann concerning my reasons for not acting on this report.</P>
      <P>I do not intend publishing this report at present.  My Department are currently examining reports by the Fair Trade Commission on competition law and the legal profession and I regard the examination and publication of these reports as a top priority.

I thought it was appropriate that it would be published in connection with a number of reports on professions generally which are becoming available from the Commission on Restrictive Practices.  The legal profession report has been received recently and there is one awaited on architects, surveyors, estate agents and auctioneers.  When all the reports are available and the Government are in a position to make a decision on what provisions are necessary to discourage the restrictive practices that are going on in these professions, perhaps it would then be appropriate to publish tham all together.  I have made an exception in the case of the legal profession because it is important to get that report out as quickly as possible.

      <P>As I indicated in my public statements on this matter on 19 and 22 December 1989, the Fair Trade Commission concluded that Mr. Laurence Goodman was in effective control of the Master Meats Group.  I consider that this control of the third largest meat processing group by an individual with other substantial involvement in the meat trade in Ireland is undesirable and contrary to the common good, and I am continuing my examination of the legal means, including the powers available to me under the Mergers, Take-overs, and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, by which this control can be brought to an end.

      <P>The obligation on me to take steps and make a decision in regard to it expires on 16 April, which is three months from the time of the reply to the queries which were furnished to the company concerned in the early part of last year.  The company declined earlier to reply to the queries which were raised but they did reply in mid-January and as a result the three months period runs from then.  The matter is one of great complexity.  It has been necessary to get the Attorney General's advice repeatedly on a series of issues and the latest and major part of the Attorney's advice only became available towards the latter part of last week.  The principal reason for the delay is the attitude of non-co-operation shown by the group concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to publish the report of the Fair Trade Commission on the matter?  Does he envisage that legislation will be required arising from the consideration he has given it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the second part of the Deputy's question first.  I think it is very likely that legislation will be required, because I have found that the 1978 legislation is not adequate, in my view at any rate &mdash; and I hope that is a view the House will share &mdash; for the purposes it was intended.  For example, one of the things it did not envisage was active non-co-operation by a notifying party.  It was thought that the considerable sanctions in the 1978 Act would be sufficient to encourage people to comply with it.  That appears in practice not to have been the case, in one instance at least.  I propose, therefore, to include in the Competition Bill, 1990, which I referred to earlier today and which is under preparation at present, provisions which will amend the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>On the question of publication of the report, the most I would be prepared to publish would be an edited version of it leaving out confidential information which was provided by a number of companies.</P>

      <P>I am considering that, but unfortunately if you publish an edited report I am afraid you are liable to be <Col N="971" /> accused of leaving out the most interesting bits and it will not satisfy those who want publication.  It is a matter I will have to consider when the decision has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The average IDA grant cost per job created and sustained, in constant 1985 prices, for the years 1985 to 1988 is as follows: 1985, £17,079; 1986, £16,720; 1987, £17,460; 1988, £16,100.  Full details are contained in the relevant IDA annual reports which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Figures for 1989 and 1990 will be published in due course in the annual reports for those years.</P>
      <P>Details of the grant and estimated fixed asset cost per job approved are no longer published on a regular basis, as the cost per job created and sustained is considered a more accurate measure of grant payments against employment performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the imminent abolition of Fóir Teoranta, as announced this evening, and the closure of Sunbeam Limited and other factories throughout the country, would the Minister not agree, taking into account the costs outlined in his reply, that we should put greater emphasis on job preservation as distinct from job creation, taking into account also the restrictions being placed <Col N="972" /> on the IDA in the area of job preservation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Job preservation is obviously an aspect of industrial policy which is always to the forefront and will, as far as I am concerned, continue to be to the forefront.  I would not however, encourage the agencies concerned &mdash; nor, I am sure, would they wish to &mdash; to seek to preserve jobs at all costs in non-viable operations.  I am not talking here about the particular case the Deputy referred to, nor am I making any judgment that that is non-viable, but from time to time there are failures of companies for simple market reasons that show they are no longer viable undertakings, with the changes in technology and with changes in the market-place.  It can never be an objective of industrial policy to preserve every existing job no matter what the consequences.  There will have to be changes, rationalisation and modernisation and companies will have to follow the market and the technology. Some of those who do not will not survive.</P>

The abolition a year or more ago of Fóir Teoranta seems to be regarded as something of great importance today, but it worth remembering that the number of job losses in the past 12 months was the lowest for a very long time and the net job creation as a result was the highest in the eighties.</P>

      <P>The improvement in our general economic situation since 1987 has been directly reflected in a turnaround in manufacturing employment, which has gone from an average annual net loss between 1980 and 1987 of around 4,000 to a net gain of 6,000 in the year to <Col N="974" /> April 1989.  This reflects improved cost competitiveness and increased confidence by industry to undertake new investment.  Total employment in the services sector has also increased substantially since 1986.</P>
      <P>Because of the time lag between decisions to undertake new investment and the appearance of jobs on the ground the full benefits of the improved situation in industry may not yet have been fully realised.  The very positive indications of a continued increase in employment in the FIE-CII survey of employment trends earlier this year indicate that private sector employment is expanding steadily.</P>
      <P>I would be very hopeful that, if we maintain our commitment to improve the public finances, achieve real reform in the tax system and maintain cost competitiveness, significant further net job creation can be achieved in the short term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Minister has changed his mind since 13 March when he said that the performance of industry in relation to employment creation was disappointing?  Would he accept that the climate for employment creation during the past number of years, given the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, low wage costs and low inflation, could not have been better and that these circumstances are now about to change, given that interest rates are increasing and that the Government have missed the boat offered to them under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in relation to the creation of employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking at what I said on 13 March and I do not see anything which is in conflict with what I am saying here today.  The fact of the matter is that, instead of an average net loss of 4,000, which was the case for every year in the eighties up to 1989, in manufacturing employment, the year to April 1989 showed a net gain of 6,000, which is a turnaround of 10,000 in manufacturing employment alone.  That is very satisfactory. If this trend can be continued <Col N="975" /> and the figures grow somewhat further it will be a creditable performance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Manufacturing employment rose by a substantial number.  In relation to the losses in particular areas of employment, these were mainly in the public sector as a result of deliberate Government policy which was right and which most people on reflection would agree was right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify this matter for us once and for all. A number of Ministers at various stages have expressed disappointment about the performance of the private sector in relation to the creation of employment and subsequently have pulled back from it.  Is the Minister confirming or denying the report contained in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 March in which he is reported as saying that the job creation performance of industry was disappointing?  Can we be told what exactly is the Minister's view of the performance of industry in relation to job creation?  Is he disappointed or happy with it?  We know what the figures are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put the matter beyond doubt by reading what I am reported as having said in <i>The Irish Times</i>, some of it is a direct quotation while some is not.  The relevant part reads:</P>
      <P>The job creation performance of industry was &ldquo;on the face of it slightly disappointing&rdquo; but the Minister was confident that employment growth will suddenly start to happen quite rapidly if the economic conditions can be kept correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On what does the Minister base his confidence that the performance of industry will improve from their &ldquo;slightly disappointing&rdquo; performance to date given the fact that interest rates are increasing and the indicators are that the circumstances which have existed up to now in relation to the creation of employment are not going to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to agree with the Deputy when he says that the favourable circumstances are not going to continue.  At any given time they are probably not as favourable as one would wish, but if our interest rates are four or four and a half percentage points lower than the rates in Britain this is very favourable from our point of view.  If our inflation rate is half or less than half the inflation rate in Britain, that is very favourable.  Needless to say, I would love if it was a quarter of the rate in Britain and not just half.  Given the history of the past 20 years, when our figures were consistently higher than those in Britain, the position in this country is much better.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>if he is satisfied that Irish motor car importers can purchase their stocks from EC based manufacturers at a price equal to or in excess of the prices being charged, excluding VAT or excise duty, to dealers in the country of manufacture; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function in the negotiation of the prices payable by Irish car importers to EC car manufacturers. Consequently, I do not have particulars of the prices at which Irish motor car importers can purchase their stocks from EC based manufacturers nor do I have details of the prices charged by such manufacturers to dealers in the country of manufacture.</P>
      <P>Article 85 (1) of the Treaty of Rome prohibits agreements, decisions or concerted practices between undertakings or associations of undertakings which may affect trade between member states and which has as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market. In particular those agreements etc. which apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage, are specifically prohibited. If Irish car importers consider that they are being treated less favourably than dealers in the country of manufacture it is open to them to bring the situation to the attention of the EC Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister will readily recognise, it is not the importer who carries the cost of an uncompetive or restrictive practice but the consumer. In view of this would he be prepared to initiate a survey to be carried out by officials of his Department into the prices being charged by European car manufacturers to the various markets, such as the British, German and Irish markets, to ascertain if in fact a special price is being charged taking into account the size of the market in a particular country, <Col N="978" /> as this would seem to be completely at variance with European competition law?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the Irish market is charged the highest price or anything like it.  There is a suggestion in a survey which was carried out privately that the Irish pre-tax prices are on average higher than those in Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  If this survey is correct, and I do not know whether it is, it would seem to indicate that we are roughly about the middle of the league in this respect.</P>

      <P>Surely, with 1992 looming fast, now is a good time for the Minister to initiate a survey, through the aegis of his Department.  Following that he will be in a position to tell the House what the position is.  Will the Minister agree to initiate such a survey in order to protect the interests of Irish consumers who in this case happen to be those who purchase motor cars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the importers feel they are being charged more for identical models than is the case in other markets it is open to them to complain to the commission.  So far as I am aware importers have not found it necessary to make such a complaint.  If the prices they were being charged were seriously out of line I have no doubt that they would make such a complaint.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that I believe we have too many State agencies dealing with different aspects of industrial development and that there may be room for improvement in the existing arrangements. I have instructed my Department to examine how State agency structures might best be re-organised in the context of the Triennial Review of Industrial Performance which I expect will be published very shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no responsibility for Údarás na Gaeltachta but I am aware that they labour under particular difficulties. I would see that body primarily as a social organisation rather than a specifically economic one.  They have tried to achieve certain valid social objectives through economic means and they are clearly not in a position to do that on the basis of the same criteria which would apply in the remainder of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last resort the location of each industry is a matter for decision by the promoter of the industry concerned.  If a foreign promoter was to seek advice from one of the agencies concerned the agency would give that advice.  Presumably in regard to location they would do that on the basis of the viability of the company and by taking into account the places in the agency's area where the difficulties are greatest. They would seek to encourage the company, perhaps, to go there if its location would not adversely affect its viability.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to include SFADCo in the review and does he agree that the question of the inter-relationship between the different agencies has been considered to varying degrees by different Governments over the years?  Will the Minister agree that the stop-go approach to the different agencies &mdash; under one Government they appeared to be on the point of abolition and under another Government they appeared to be getting an extension of their role &mdash; is hindering the work of the agencies and making the climate under which they work uncertain?

One of the basic difficulties we have is that we have too many such agencies involved in some respect or other with industrial development.  That has been a fact for some time and Governments have tried to come to grips with it.  At the moment four different Departments and 14 State agencies are involved in one way or <Col N="981" /> another in aspects of industrial development. Frankly, that is too many.</P>

The Department of Industry and Commerce, along with other Government Departments, are subject to restrictions on the recruitment of staff and the filling of vacancies.

In regard to the complaint by the director in his report, which incidentally relates to the year 1988 and is now somewhat out of date, the fact is that there has been a reduction since 1987 of two people in his staff from 25 to 23.  That amounts to an 8 per cent reduction at a time when there has been a reduction in the entire Department from 623 to 513, which is a reduction of 18 per cent.  In so far as any unfairness or inequity or imbalance has arisen it is that the reductions in the whole of the Department have been very substantially greater than they have been in the Office of Director of Fair Trade.</P>

The reduction in numbers is, as I told the Deputy, from 25 to 23, that is much less than the reduction in numbers in every other section of the Department.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I was dealing with the importance of the carer's allowance but had grave doubts in relation to its effectiveness because of the limitation of £45 income related benefit and the means test.  I would strongly urge the Minister, having regard to the tremendous contribution this basis of care for the incapacitated and the aged would bring about, to have a further look at that angle of it; otherwise it will achieve very little.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether incapacitated and aged people in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health board are included for the purpose of the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>I should like to have some anomalies put right.  I refer to the electricity and free television allowance allocated to an old aged pensioner and his spouse.  When the old aged pensioner dies the spouse, if under the age of 66, loses the benefit of free electricity, free television and in some cases free telephone rental. Because of the death of the pensioner and the loss of the various benefits, the household income is reduced almost by 50 per cent.  Because of that reduction the remaining spouse is exposed to the recurring cost of electricity, television and in some cases telephone rental.  This is a matter which I think the Minister would have great sympathy for and I am sure once it is drawn to his attention he will consider ways and means of extending or continuing a benefit that had been available to a household while both parties were alive and when the income was double.  In this Bill the Minister has gone some distance in that direction.  He has provided that where a person in receipt of invalidity benefit changes over at the age of 65 to a retirement pension, a category which is not covered for free electricity, television etc. and where they enjoyed those benefits, they will be continued. That is welcome because I am sure it was a deterrent to a number of people in receipt of invalidity benefit to transfer to retirement until they reached the pension age of 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that young people of 17, 18 <Col N="1020" /> and 19 years of age who apply for unemployment assistance are obliged to give their family income is outdated.  Where society has failed to provide employment opportunities for those young people, the State should not rely on the income of the parents as a subsistence allowance.  I strongly urge the Minister to remove that provision.  If records and statistics were available it could be seen that a high number of those who were refused unemployment assistance in such cases have a very readily taken to the emigrant ship. They do not want to have to keep asking their parents week after week for a subsistence allowance.</P>
    <P>In some cases, an applicant for unemployment assistance may request an oral hearing.  Such an oral hearing was readily forthcoming up to the recent past but deciding officers now seem to have taken it entirely upon themselves to determine whether an oral hearing should be acceded to.  Even though this may not ultimately change the outcome of an applicant's appeal, an element of satisfaction can be gained by an applicant in presenting a case to a deciding officer which he does not get when a decision is taken by a deciding officer when he is not present.</P>
    <P>There are a number of anomalies in the fuel scheme.  Like every other public representative in rural Ireland I know pensioners who, when their means were investigated, were disallowed payment under the scheme on the basis that their relatives had the capacity to provide them with fuel.  If an old age pensioner is living alone and is unable, for health and other reasons, to provide the fuel necessary, the State should be more Christian in its outlook and deem him to be qualified for the scheme rather than leave it to his relatives to provide the fuel.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is much appreciated by social welfare recipients. People in urban areas avail of the service to a great extent but people in many parts of rural Ireland, in particular, the west, live in areas which are very far removed from public transport so that the free travel voucher is very seldom used by them.  The cost to them of travelling to a <Col N="1021" /> point where public transport is available would probably nullify any advantages of the scheme.  The Minister should consider giving the people involved, with their consent, some monetary allowance instead of the free travel voucher.</P>
    <P>Under the family income supplement scheme, a child born during the year of operation of the existing application is not taken into account until the following year.  Because of the very severe financial constraints on such families, all the children in the family should be included under the scheme from the date of birth.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the points I have made.  I look forward to the introduction of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this major Bill and for the research and time he has to put into it.  At one stage, we were not used to a major Bill of this type.  I know the Minister has travelled the length and breadth of the country to employment exchanges trying to elicit from the administration side the problems they are experiencing.  In addition to receiving that information the Minister also hears the views of Members of both this House and the Seanad.  Some amendment to the Bill may be necessary on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I will accede to the request made by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to limit my speech in order to give the other Deputies present a chance to speak.  My contribution will be as brief as possible and I will confine my remarks to two important sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken a major step in attempting to redress some of the imbalances which existed in the system.  I want to refer to the smallholders who live mainly in the west and north-west and the islands off the west coast.  Many of these farmers own fragmented holdings and they need to be at base for most of the year, in particular during the winter and summer months.  As a result, these smallholders are not in a position to accept employment even though it is offered on a full-time basis.  They have to look after their small farms, cows, calves and sheep and ensure they have a supply of turf and fodder for their stock for the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A young married couple may try to increase their income by improving their land, increasing their stock numbers, carrying out some welding for a neighbouring farmer, engaging in salmon or lobster fishing for a few weeks &mdash; the financial returns from these two types of <Col N="1023" /> fishing are very dicey at present &mdash; helping a neighbour to build a house or helping in the harvesting of crops.  Because of this work, which is of short duration, the person may not sign on because it is not worth while.  In most of these cases the person in question may lose his or her dole, an injustice in my view, even though only a small remuneration may be forthcoming from that type of work.  I would ask the Minister to look at this section of the unemployed who cannot take a permanent job but who are existing on a small holding for sentimental reasons, trying to hold on to the family farm, to the homestead they were born in to continue tradition.  This is not covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a new appeals office if it will improve the system we have at the moment, but I would like to see a fair system in operation.  The old system did not work fairly because most decisions favoured the Department of Social Welfare investigator.  Centralising militates against the rest of the country. Any team playing away is at a disadvantage. If the Minister brings the appeals office to the city, people from the west will have to travel to Dublin to an oral hearing.  Will there be some officers down the country?  I see the Minister nodding so he should be able to answer this.</P>
    <P>Oral hearings are good if they are impartial but they very seldom are when the judge is from the Department of Social Welfare.  It is time this system of examination by a medical referee on a visual assessment in poor clinical conditions was done away with.  The greatest professional man, with documentation from all the X-ray units in the country, would not change the decision of the previous referee on an appeal.  I know of several cases where two or three appeals took place and the decision was always the same; they do not want to go against the decision of the first referee, regardless of the medical evidence produced. Also it is not easy to make an assessment in a local courthouse where there are <Col N="1024" /> no facilities to assess an applicant who appeals against the decision of the social welfare referee.  I would welcome an improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>When I was listening to the debate I heard long list of who would benefit from this Bill.  I do not want to go into all that but I want to compliment the Minister. He is dedicated and has put a lot of work into this.  Things may not always come out as he wishes, but he means well.  He has put in the work and has visited rural Ireland to find out the facts for himself. He has listened to many complaints from Deputies and Senators and has a wide knowledge of what the position is.  If this Bill does not work it will not be his fault. He has tried to bring in a Bill that will give a better standard of living to the underprivileged and better compensation for those in receipt of unemployment benefit.  Many people will benefit considerably as a result of this Bill.  There are anomalies in all Bills that come to this House and there will be in this one too, but I know the Minister has the energy and the dedication to take corrective measures against any imbalances in a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can. I would like to speak in support of the Fine Gael amendment to the Social Welfare Bill, 1990.  In their amendment they set down five reasons they feel the Bill should not be given a Second Reading.  I do not propose to deal with each but will be generally supportive of all.  I would, however, like to highlight the first reason, which is that the Bill fails to fundamentally reform the social welfare system.  This is undoubtedly true and is something that we in the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, are in complete agreement with.  In fact, we were the first political party in the country to say so in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare system is incapable of reformation; it has to be totally replaced by a basic income for all.  This basic income would be paid to everyone as of right without a means test.  It would be paid to females and males irrespective of the person's marital status.  It would <Col N="1025" /> be paid without inquiry to people who are separated, divorced or co-habiting. In this connection I see nothing in the Bill which deals with the scandalous interference in people's private lives by prying social welfare officials looking under the bed, or in some cases in the bed, for signs of co-habitation.  This is grotesque, to say the very least.  This basic income would be paid to people whether they are unemployed, self-employed, employed, at third level education or retired.  A proportionate amount would be paid for children by way of the child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>This policy of basic income has now been adopted, if belatedly, by The Workers' Party and Fine Gael.  I appeal to the other political parties to take this concept on board.  It is non-ideological and so patently logical, practical and equitable that I can see no good reason it cannot be accepted, in principle at least, by everyone in this House.  The only reason I can see for the failure of people in this House to accept this concept is that politicians generally like to keep things complicated to ensure the dependency of the voters.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the vast bulk of time spent by TDs at clinics is dealing with social welfare matters.  The introduction of a basic income scheme would render much of our work redundant and would leave us with more time to do what we are paid to do.  The amount of time spent by Deputies on these matters is a scandal of major proportions.  As a result of personal representations made by Deputies, vast sums of taxpayers' money is expended answering Dáil Questions to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Some may recall an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> two or three years ago when Deputy Briscoe was asked how much of his time as a TD had been given to legislative matters in the House.  In a rare moment of candour he replied to the effect that his electors would not wish him to waste his time dealing with such matters.  Deputy Willie O'Dea stated recently that he spent nearly 90 per cent of his time dealing with such constituency matters.  There has to be something <Col N="1026" /> seriously wrong when people elected to legislate use their time in this way.</P>
    <P>I would ask each Deputy to examine his conscience in this regard.  I am sure very many would have an attitude not dissimilar to that of Deputy Briscoe and Deputy O'Dea.  I would like to ask both Deputies if they feel their time as Deputies is wasted in dealing with the business of the House.  It so, perhaps they would indicate who they think should deal with such mundane matters as legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons why a basic income scheme is superior to social welfare.  I will mention a couple of them.  The first is the total elimination of the proverty trap.  As is well known, this is a very serious problem for many couples with an above average sized family. The social welfare increases proposed in this Bill are very welcome in that they do provide higher cash income for those at the bottom of the pile.  Unfortunately, higher social welfare payments tend to inhibit employment by making it financially unattractive for people to take low paid or part-time work or perhaps to start a small business.  With a basic income scheme the poverty trap simply vanishes, but with higher social welfare payments the more the poverty trap comes into operation.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, lest anyone should feel that my reference to low pay implies the desirability of having a low wage economy, I should like to put this statement in context.  A basic income scheme would enable a large increase in the number of people employed, particularly in such labour-intensive areas as local authority schemes and in recycling.  This would make these jobs viable because those employed would receive a basic income in addition to their wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another great advantage of basic income is the freedom it gives to married women in that all women would as of right have a basic income equal to and <Col N="1027" /> totally separate from that of their husbands.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to deal in detail with the Bill because the whole concept is basically flawed.  However, there are several good sections in this Bill such as those dealing with the increase in the carer's and lone parent's allowances. Basically it is like adding good bricks into an already crumbling wall, just putting off the evil day of total restructuring.</P>
    <P>In making my contribution to the debate I am taking into consideration a series of submissions by the poverty lobby.  It goes without saying that we in the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, are very concerned about poverty in Ireland. There is a very great deal of it.  I will leave it to the statisticians to work out what percentage of people are poor but it must be apparent to everyone in this House that a substantial number of families and individuals are living in poverty. It must almost be recognised that most poverty is due to unemployment.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the poverty lobby is to look at those who are poor and say &ldquo;These people are unemployed and they are poor, so let's pay them higher social welfare&rdquo;.  I suppose that is fair enough. These organisations are non-ideological, by and large, and much of their thinking is of necessity short term.  I would, however, put it to the House that in our anxiety to please these organisations and in our anxiety to eliminate poverty we fail to think the problem through.  Bishop Helder Camara has been quoted as saying, &ldquo;When I fed the poor I was called a saint; when I asked why they were poor I was called a Communist.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am nearly finished.  I am trying to read quickly.  I am the only speaker for our party.  The Green Party-Comhaontas Glas asks why.  The simple answer is that the resources and health of this country are to a great extent concentrated in the hand of large national and multinational concerns and this trend is getting worse.  All Governments <Col N="1028" /> since the foundation of the State have worked basically for the benefit of those who already have wealth.  While the trade union movement has achieved many worthwhile advances for the working class, they have not been able and never will be able to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, a much simpler answer to the unemployment problem than having 82 per cent of the working population working a 40-hour week and paying high taxes to support the other 18 per cent for whom no jobs are available, that is, a reduction in working hours, job sharing and early retirement, together with career breaks and so forth.  This in the short term must be the way forward, together with the payment of a basic income to eradicate involuntary unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confine myself to some very serious omissions from this legislation.  It may be regarded by the Minister as a very long piece of legislation with a great number of sections, but there are certainly very serious omissions.</P>
      <P>In regard to the carer's allowance, I welcome the increase in the amount being paid.  At the end of the day the effect will be very limited because it will be means tested.  There is no reference to those providing care for the mentally handicapped.  Does the reference to carers who are not relatives mean that some helps, who at present are paid 75p per hour, will be brought into the scheme?</P>
      <P>The most neglected group depending on social welfare are widows, whether in receipt of contributory or non-contributory pensions.  The increases for them are from £52.50 to £56 and from £49 to £53.  No provision is made for widows on fixed income to get electricity and telephone allowances and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance code, which came in under the 1975 Act and was brought into effect in 1977, needs to be changed.  I would also refer to the archaic and outdated system by which benefit and privilege &mdash; in other words, board and lodgings &mdash; are assessed <Col N="1029" /> against young people seeking unemployment assistance.  The assessment of board and lodgings often reduced the amount payable to such a derisory sum it is hardly worth collecting.  The family are poorer as a result.</P>
    <P>Mortgage allowances under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme need to be addressed by the Minister. Under the supplementary welfare code a person may be granted a mortgage subsidy. A husband, wife and three children may receive £98.90 in long term unemployment assistance or £105.80 in unemployment benefit.  One is subtracted from the other.  A figure of £3.10 or £3.20 is added and if they are paying £20 they get £10 relief on the mortgage interest, not on the principal.  A person in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit could be paying £15 or £20 rent to a local authority.  There is no provision for a family to get relief.  This needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I was hoping the Minister would have had sufficient representations regarding the free telephone rental scheme to broaden its scope to include couples where a spouse may be incapacitated, perhaps not to the extent of needing a wheelchair but to such an extent that he or she would not be able to go for help if one or the other should require it.  There are many such instances in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Since 1970 every insured person's PRSI contribution contains an element for the death grant.  That grant amounts to only £100, despite the fact that burial costs amount to about £1,000.  There is an urgent need for an increase.  A person who does not qualify for the death grant will be relying on the health board for a grant and basically the same criteria apply.  I would ask that the matter be rectified.</P>
    <P>We have a plethora of what I have many times described as Mickey Mouse schemes.  Instead of a job creation programme we have such schemes that are short term.  Long term schemes are needed.  Submissions have been made to the Minister's office by the council of which I am a member showing that for a little effort schemes could be introduced <Col N="1030" /> to provide long term employment in public works.  Many such works can be provided to give a satisfactory week's wages to a breadwinner or a single person as the case may be, but no effort has been made to do that.  Instead, we have a plethora of Mickey Mouse schemes. They mean nothing and will never mean anything.</P>
    <P>That is my contribution.  I am well within my time.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Sherlcok for staying within his time and filling his speech full of points with which.  I agree. I want to say a personal word of thanks to Deputy O'Toole for his initial generosity in allowing all of us to come in.  I will take one of my precious minutes to say what I think is very important.  I think this is Deputy O'Toole's maiden speech in the Chamber.  That is a very special time and it is all the more generous of him to split his time so generously with the rest of us.  May he be here for many more speeches.</P>
      <P>I do not want to impinge on the Minister's time because he has a great deal to respond to.  I want to focus on a few points, some of them like an anthem, coming round again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garland introduced the basic income concept as if the Green Party had suddenly discovered it.  If he were here I would remind him that from the day I entered this Chamber I have taken every possible opportunity I got to hammer out that concept.  However, I agree with the Deputy.  The Minister might be able to tell us he is working towards that basic concept.  I know the anomalies and difficulties, but a great number of the discriminations and difficulties that still exist can be removed.  The Minister and his officials will acknowledge that.  Let me acknowledge their work.  Every time I stand up here I have to acknowledge the amount of work and reform undertaken by the Minister and his staff.  They will agree that much of the discrimination and many of the difficulties they are still coping with would be removed if we could move to the concept of building on a basic income and crediting and debiting from <Col N="1031" /> that.  That would take away first the stigma of receiving State payments while other people are seen as more gainfully employed.  Secondly, it would give people a sense of independence in their own right and remove what is probably the most eroding and corroding effect of social welfare, that of dependency, taking away people's financial and psychological independence.  The sooner we can do that the sooner will its effects be evident.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulty the Minister is in when he has to impose certain infringements on payments.  One of the conditions applying to the single parent's payment is that the recipient is not cohabiting, that is, living with another man or woman as husband or wife.  It denies people the formation of loving relationships regardless of the fact the person is not cohabiting with a spouse who cannot support him or her financially. The threat of their payments being withdrawn very often inhibits such people from forming a loving relationship which they did not get in their former partnership when the spouse could not support them.  We are talking mainly about women here.  The sooner we get away from the idea of one spouse having to be supported by another the better.  The idea that a man moving into the house is automatically responsible for supporting the woman and can do so is wrong.  It denies women who have come through trauma and the men who would like to share their lives that opportunity that the rest of us have the privilege of choice of having.  I know people feel enraged if they think there is fraud of the system, but we must write that provision out of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the carer's allowance, I will not repeat what other Deputies have said here, but I ask the Minister to reflect strongly on it and to realise the cost effectiveness of this to the State in the building up of community care.  The Minister is endeavouring to acknowledge that the work of the carer in the community is part of the community health service for which all of us, particularly the <Col N="1032" /> Department of Health, have responsibility. If he has not sufficient funds in his own budget for this let him go into negotiations with the Minister for Health to underwrite that so that we do not means test our carers to the extent for which the Bill, as I read it, provides.  We expect much from the carers, so let us not sell them out again.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the national lottery £500,000 or £1 million is being given as an extra bonus to the purchasers of lottery tickets.  I suggest that that money go towards helping to pay our carers and thus reduce the stringency of the means test.  Those extra bonuses should go not to lottery winners but carers who humanise and deliver people from institutionalisation. If we are talking about health care in its fullest sense, the extended family and care within the community, we must put that investment into it.  I ask the Minister to put pressure everywhere else where money is available but do not sell out the carers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is bringing in legislation with regard to part-time workers.  The Minister here will be aware that the free legal aid centres have held a Press conference, which was highly covered in the media, showing that as a result of a court case taken by a Dutch part-time woman worker the way could be open here for part-time workers in this country to apply and be accepted for full eligibility.  This is crucial when you consider that 78 per cent of part-time workers are women.  They are vital with regard to keeping families above the poverty line, as poverty research shows.  It is the least they deserve.  Remember that these part-time workers are not alone badly paid; but exemption from the contribution system the rest of us feel privileged to be part of is a further discrimination against them.  Employers are deliberately keeping them below the level at which they can have full access to the benefits of contributions and social welfare cover.  I ask the Minister to give his full attention to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that from the beginning of the next tax year workers currently liable for Class A contributions whose <Col N="1033" /> gross earnings are £60 or less in a week will be exempt from their share of the PRSI contribution for the weeks in which they earn less than £60.  Regrettably, most part-time workers come into that category.  I ask the Minister to consider whether those part-time workers could be included under the heading of low income workers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the constructive remarks on both sides of the House in regard to this vital area to which we are all committed. I should like to thank everybody for allowing me my few minutes.  I am looking forward to a positive response from the Minister and I commend him and his staff on their continued reform of the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their contributions.  Needless to say, I do not agree with them all as one or two were fairly nasty in the early stages of the debate and I do not thank the Deputies who made them.  However, generally speaking, speeches were thorough and relevant to the Bill and the whole area of social welfare.  I particularly want to thank Deputy O'Toole for his concise contribution which enabled other Deputies to speak in the latter stages.  I note what he said about smallholders, the islands and the problems of people on short-time work.  There are various measures to cope with this but we will look at it again.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Toole was a little concerned about the centralisation of the appeals office.  It is not centralisation, it is making it independent and seen to be independent. We will have a very fine office in Dublin when it is completed.  The appeals offices will operate in the same way but we will try to improve facilities around the country.  The local officers will now be reporting to a director and chief appeals officer who will be an independent person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Garland wanted a basic income for all but I am sure he frightened many people when he spoke in multi-billions, not millions.  It is easy to say that everybody should have an income but <Col N="1034" /> one must quantify it and say who will pay for it.  Maybe he will prepare a green paper on the subject which might be helpful to us.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to many matters and I do not want to go into them all in detail as I do not have time.  We will have a long Committee Stage next week when these matters may be raised again. Deputy Ferris referred to the changes in conditions in 1985, 1986 and 1987.  We did not implement some of the changes proposed by the Fine Gael-Labour Government.  One was to reduce the duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit from 15 months to 12 months. They also wanted to eliminate claims for disability benefit for the duration of less than one week but we refused to implement it.  All these measures were published and all the work was done before I came to office.  However, we have maintained the essence of the whole system which compares favourably to international standards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris raised a particular case. There was a question of an appeal, the appeal form was sent out but not returned.  The Deputy subsequently took an interest in the case and the Department have taken that as an appeal which is being pursued.  The person's daughter has made affidavits stating that the herd number is now registered in her name and the matter will be reviewed.  However, there are other factors and we must be clear that the person is not in beneficial ownership in any way.  That element is still there but the matter is being reviewed following the Deputy's intervention.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made about widowers and deserted husbands.  In regard to widowers, to date 420 have availed of the scheme and 152 cases are under consideration.  As far as deserted husbands are concerned, they will not be able to avail of the scheme as quickly because there is a period of three months in which the desertion must be established. However, 134 deserted husbands have been awarded an allowance and 293 cases are still under consideration.</P>
    <P>Various people raised the question of <Col N="1035" /> means tests.  Social welfare officers have strict and formal instructions to give priority to means-testing, which is, of its nature, always regarded as urgent.  In recent years I made a series of arrangements to reduce the time spent investigating means generally and to put a greater onus on the applicants to tell us all the facts in a self-assessment style of operation.  I will be developing that further.  It takes a while for the public to react positively to a greater level of trust and staff must also be trained in the new techniques.  I want to deny charges made about a lack of urgency in this matter because the facts speak for themselves.  In general these cases are treated urgently although there will always be individual cases which are an exception to this. Indeed, when you look into many of these cases you find that there are all sorts of protracted difficulties.</P>
    <P>In Wexford 20 per cent of applications for unemployment assistance are dealt with by the social welfare officers on the date of receipt.  In total 65 per cent of cases are back with the employment exchange within three weeks.  In Dublin and the Carlow-Kilkenny area, where things are a little more advanced, over 30 per cent are cleared within one or two days of receipt so the position is better there.  The House will appreciate that detailed investigations are still necessary in cases where the applicants clearly have means and where the precise amount cannot be established without a home visit and other investigations as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Recently I directed that the following changes would be made: the practice of desk interviewing is being extended to all locations and to more categories.  Of course there is more risk in it so Deputies need not be complaining to the Committee of Public Accounts that the officers of the Department are letting people off and trying to get the money back later.  If we demand a faster system we must accept a higher degree of risk; where another family member had a recent means assessment it will be applied in appropriate cases.  That is <Col N="1036" /> another way of shortening the list.  Simplified and streamlined arrangements are being applied in small farm cases and I am sure that Deputy O'Toole will be pleased to hear that.</P>
    <P>The extent of poverty was referred to during the course of the debate and several Deputies perpetuated the myth that one third of the population are living in poverty.  This figure is the result of a gross distortion of the work which the ESRI have carried out at our request in examining the extent of poverty in Ireland.  The ESRI approach is to establish relative poverty lines and to estimate the number of individuals falling below them.  The amount of poverty depends on which poverty line you choose.  For example, the ESRI estimated that only 13 per cent of individuals fell below a poverty line equivalent to 40 per cent of mean household equivalent income.  Moreover, even these figures are incomplete in a number of respects.  Their real worth is their comparative value in that they show the people who are most at risk.  It showed very clearly that the long term unemployed, especially those with large families, were at risk.  This also applied to small farmers and lone parents.</P>
    <P>Generally the elderly are not considered to be at risk.  Of course we could all point to situations where elderly people are very much at risk but one must be careful when using figures because they can be quite misleading.  In relation to the figures, the ESRI took account of cash income only and did not take into account the substantial benefits in kind afforded to those who are less well off. There is a whole range of these and Deputies are quite well aware of them. The survey was undertaken at a time when farm incomes were temporarily depressed and naturally they overestimated the level of poverty in rural households.  That has been seen since from further studies.  Thirdly, the survey was carried out in 1986 and the beginning of 1987 since when, thanks to the efforts of this Government, the economy has experienced a rapid rate of growth and the level of unemployment has declined. A key finding of the ESRI report is that <Col N="1037" /> families where the head of the household was unemployed were at the greatest risk of poverty.  The substantial progress in reducing unemployment and increasing employment has undoubtedly increased the living standards of the poorest sections of the community over the last two years.  Finally, and probably most importantly, since the survey was carried out, I have made substantial increases in the level of support to those relying on social welfare.  It is fundamental that the figures were based on 1986-87.  It is time all the people who lobby against poverty and everybody in this House began to recognise that a lot has happened since 1986. That is a reality and can be seen quite clearly but yet people in the media quote those figures again and again <i>ad nauseam.</i></P>

      <P>For example, between 1986 and the present time the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance has been increased by over 40 per cent.  Increases of 30 per cent are being given to married persons with three children on long term unemployment assistance. This represents an increase of almost £27 per week.  Old age pensioners and widows have obtained increases of between 15 and 18 per cent.  Deputies should be aware that the interpretation put on the ESRI report by pressure groups is totally misleading, was never true and is becoming increasingly irrelevant due to the substantial economic and social progress this Government have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> Despite the very large increases in social welfare rates which I am putting in place this year, some pressure groups have alleged that social welfare has not been given the priority in the budget that it deserves.  They base this assertion once again on a very misleading use of statistics.  The level of expenditure on social welfare in total or the proportion financed by the Government is not a useful indicator of the priority put on this area by Government.  Because of the reduction in unemployment, which this Government's economic policies have achieved, expenditure on unemployment payments has declined, allowing me to devote the resources saved to increasing the level of payments to those who continue to need support.  I have also, through improved control measures and administrative efficiencies, realised savings &mdash; these were referred to by some of the Deputies &mdash; which could be used to benefit social welfare recipients without imposing additional burdens on the hard-pressed taxpayer.  Deputies come into the House and say the taxpayer has to pay too much but here we have managed, through these savings and through an improved position all round, to get more money and to plough it back into the system.  People are misrepresenting the reality.</P>
    <P>Over the last three years I have put in place improved social welfare rates, with full year costs in excess of £400 million. A major reason I have been able to achieve this without putting a corresponding burden on the Exchequer is through a broadening of the social insurance base in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I extended social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988 and income from this measure will be £62 million this year, or 30 per cent ahead of target.</P>
    <P>Another criticism which has been mistakenly levied is that this Government have no commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I would advise everybody to go back and look at what has been done since then and to stop talking nonsense <Col N="1039" /> because the recommendations are being implemented.  The four basic recommendations were: improvement in basic payments; improved child income support; a broadening of the social insurance base and improvement in the delivery of service.  Without exception, substantial progress has been made on each of these issues.  The level of expenditure devoted to improvements in the past three years and the rates of increases granted represents substantial progress towards the commission's recommendations regarding basic payments and the people who know the position have acknowledged that publicly.</P>
    <P>Child dependant rates have been reduced from £36 to £6 and a minimum child payment of £11 has been introduced.  The social insurance base has been extended to include the self-employed. Major and ongoing improvements continue to be made in the quality and delivery of the social welfare services as witnessed by the programme of expenditure on improvement of employment exchanges and by increased computerisation of services.  In addition, in this budget I have introduced two measures which are specifically in line with the commission's recommendations. First, as recommended, the prescribed relative allowance is to be abolished and replaced by a social assistance payment for carers.  Secondly, the new appeals office will go a long way towards implementing the commission's recommendations in this regard through the establishment of a separate office with its own staff, self-contained accommodation and the transfer to the chief appeals officer of certain functions which currently reside with the Minister.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have raised the question of the insurability of part-time employment.  Over the past two decades there has been a substantial increase in OECD countries in the proportion of the workforce which is part-time employed and Ireland is no exception in this regard, although part-time employment is still less prevalent here than in most other <Col N="1040" /> countries.  However, it may be anticipated that with the growth in service industries in particular, part-time working will become more widespread.  This development creates problems for the social insurance system which was designed largely with the full-time worker in mind.  I have been concerned for some time with the exclusion of some part-time workers from social insurance and with the anomalies which can arise in regard to their treatment.  I have requested my Department to undertake a thorough review of the question of extending social insurance to part-time workers, especially with a view to eliminating the anomalous situations which have arisen.  I expect to have the results of this review, which has been ongoing for some time, by mid-summer.  I have also requested the National Pensions Board to examine the question of the pension entitlements of part-time workers and I intend to draw on both reports for policy changes in this area.</P>
    <P>The question of extending insurability to part-time workers is a very complex one.  There is a need to ensure that workers make at least a minimal contribution towards benefits.  That entitlement to benefits does not create a disincentive to work and the system of social insurance contributions is an equitable and administratively simple one.  For these reasons I have arranged that the most thorough analysis be undertaken prior to final decisions in this matter.  It is also likely that any changes in insurability of part-time workers will have implications for employers as well as employees and I intend that the social partners will be fully consulted.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dennehy, Wyse and Wallace raised the question of the £50 limit on the amount of earnings which spouses may have and still be regarded as dependants for the purposes of social welfare payments to their wife or husband.  As Deputies will know, this limit was introduced in 1986 as part of the equal treatment arrangements.  The basic provision in the equal treatment legislation was that a person could not be regarded as a dependant if they were themselves either <Col N="1041" /> in receipt of a social welfare payment or were at work.  The total exclusion of persons at work was subsequently relaxed by allowing persons with earnings up to £50 a week to qualify as adult dependants.</P>
    <P>I recognise that wherever the limit is set there will be difficulties for spouses of social welfare recipients whose spouses have earnings just below the threshold because an increase in earnings which brings them over the threshold will result in the loss of the adult dependent allowance. This is one of the matters which is being addressed by the working group which I established last year to look at the treatment of households under the social welfare system, with particular reference to the equal treatment arrangements. Following the report of the working group there will be an opportunity to examine again the equal treatment arrangements and see whether a different approach would be more appropriate and possible.  In the meantime however I am happy to say that the Government have approved an increase from £50 to £55 in the limit and this will come into effect in July when the increase in social welfare payments comes into effect.  I know that this increase will be welcomed by persons in this situation and by the trade union movement which has made representations to me in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the transitional alleviating payments of £20 and £10 which were introduced in 1986 to cushion people who lost the adult dependant increase as a result of the equal treatment arrangements.  As Deputies will know these payments, when introduced, were to last for a maximum of one year.  We, however, have kept these payments with small reductions each year ensuring that when account is taken of social welfare increases, nobody suffered a reduction in their payments.  This year the same arrangements will apply.  The alleviating payments which currently stand at £16 and £8 will again be reduced by £2 and £1 with effect from July.  Where account <Col N="1042" /> is taken of the increases in payments generally and particularly of the higher increases for persons on the lowest payments the people concerned will still enjoy substantial increases in the payments being made to them.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were raised in relation to the new carer's allowance. Generally speaking Deputies expressed a welcome for this new scheme.  This welcome has been echoed by the response which I have had from all round the country to the scheme.  From my own experience working in my own community I have always been very conscious of the work of carers and I am very proud as Minister for Social Welfare to be in a position to introduce this new scheme which is practical recognition of the work they do.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern about the numbers who will qualify for the new allowance.  Let me say that I am very conscious of the good work done by all carers, no matter what their income situation is.  My purpose in this new scheme, however, is to direct the available resources at this stage to those who need them most and I believe that the new scheme achieves this.  Obviously it would be nice to have a scheme without a means test, but would it be the best use of resources and how much would it cost? The scheme I am proposing in this Bill will target the available resources in an effective way.  I am widening the scope of the present arrangements very considerably. For the first time married people living with a spouse will be able to qualify.  For the first time persons other than relatives will qualify.  Those are major achievements.</P>
    <P>Deputies have expressed concern that the new carer's allowance was not being applied, under the terms of the Bill, to carers looking after people receiving disabled persons' maintenance allowances from the health boards.  The existing prescribed relative's allowance, which the new carer's allowance will effectively replace, does not apply to this category of disabled person.  I am, however, conscious of the needs of this category of beneficiary and it was my intention to <Col N="1043" /> respond to these needs in the context of the transfer of responsibility for the DPMA scheme to my Department.  An interdepartmental committee has been set up to look at that transfer.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say, however, that the Government have accepted my proposal to broaden the scope of the carer's provision to cater for persons caring for recipients of DPMA in certain circumstances. I will be putting down an amendment on Committee Stage to give me the necessary power to do this by regulation in due course.  In other words, instead of waiting until Committee Stage to do the work, we will have the enabling legislation to take action as soon as we are ready.  I want to emphasise that my proposal deals with incapacitated people who need full-time care and attention.  I do not want people saying &mdash; and that is the very thing we have to be careful about &mdash; that it applies to all DPMA cases.  I am examining the provisions with a view to specifying people with specific handicaps in an area that is not under my control at this time.  I appreciate the concerns about that area.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have tabled an amendment that the Bill should not be read a Second Time.  I am sorry that the proceedings are not televised at this stage because I would love to have the television to show the people standing up in this House and voting against a provision of £216 million for the people who depend on social welfare.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at their amendment.  They mention that the Bill fails the 250,000 unemployed people and their dependants, whereas the unemployed number 232,000.  They did not even get that much right.  Last year, the average number of <Col N="1044" /> unemployed was 231,500 and the average for this year will be fewer than 222,000. At least, Fine Gael could have got the figures right in the first instance.  Their whole approach to this amendment is not credible or defensible.  If people outside this House, for instance, old age pensioners, heard that Fine Gael had tabled an amendment that the Bill should not be read a Second Time, in other words, that the Bill should be thrown out, what would they say?</P>

      <P>I believe their approach is not credible or defensible.  It is even technically wrong because the Fine Gael Deputies welcome everything in the Bill but they want more.  However, we will deal with that on Committee Stage when they can say what other things they want. Surely the Fine Gael Party are not going to vote against all these improvements the Government are providing?</P>
      <P>There are 16 different categories who will get more than the 5 per cent increase. What about them?  For the first time, we have broadened the scope beyond the long-term unemployed so that old age pensioners and widows will receive more than the 5 per cent because they have been targeted.  This Bill is doing that.  It is not happening in the budget but if this Bill does not go through that will not happen also.  That is the reality we are facing.  I am sure this will be very embarrassing for some Fine Gael Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, this is the largest Social Welfare Bill to be brought before the House for 40 years.  There is no gainsaying that.  That is clear cut.  If you look back on the Bills which were introduced when Fine Gael were in Government, you will see that in the 1984 Bill there were 30 sections, in the 1985 Bill there were 15 sections, in the 1986 Bill there were a whole lot of cutbacks to sections which numbered 24, but in this Bill we have 51 sections all bringing improvements and developments.  Are they going to vote against that?  What are they voting against?  Are they voting against the PRSI exemption for low paid workers, the lone parent's allowance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party are now going to vote against the carer's allowance.  They have said how much greater it should be and how the scope could be widened, but they are going to vote against the allowance.  If they succeed there will be no carer's allowance. They are going to vote against the social welfare appeals office and all the extra benefits.  In fact, there were so many that we had to get out facts sheets on them.  However, if Deputies look at the back of the press release they will find the scale and size of these improvements which I have mentioned very clearly in my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Fine Gael Party have lost their way.  They have about one minute in which to get themselves back on course and to say they accept that this is a good Bill, that it is probably the best Bill in many years, and that they will support it in principle on Second Stage, but, of course, they will table amendments on Committee Stage.  I can understand that they would want to table amendments on Committee Stage, but it is very difficult to understand how they can vote against giving £216 million to the poor people, the very people they are always bleating <Col N="1047" /> about in theory.  Here is the practice.  I call on them to withdraw their amendment, to do the honourable thing and to vote in favour of giving £216 million to those who depend on social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, whereas freedom of movement is a basic civil right, and whereas the IRA's disruption by bombs and threats of bombings is a denial of this right, Dáil Éireann condemns the IRA for:</P>
      <P>(a)  disrupting this service which has linked the people of Dublin and Belfast for over a century;</P>
      <P>(b)  putting the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk;</P>
      <P>(c)  threatening the jobs of railway workers;</P>
      <P>and calls on the Government to take all practical steps which are necessary to keep the lines open.</P>
      <P>This motion arises from the participation by a number of Deputies, Senators and others in the peace train protest last October.  I understand that a similar motion has been tabled in the Seanad.  I would be very surprised if the Provisional IRA were to pay any attention to the motion.  The disruption of the rail link has been widely condemned by almost all sectors of public opinion in this country, North and South, without any apparent effect.  However, there are others, particularly people outside the country, who in one way or another support the Provisional IRA and they may pay some attention to what our national Parliament has to say.  They may be guided by it to discontinue their support for that murderous organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers to civil rights.  I remember well the early days of the civil rights campaign in the North when the sympathy of responsible opinion everywhere in the world was on the side of the <Col N="1051" /> minority Catholic, Nationalist community in the North for what were considered and seemed to be their just demands.  The sympathy of the whole world was on our side.  Then the Provisional IRA came into existence and, because of the way they developed their campaign, because of the murderousness of their campaign, because of their massacres and butcheries by their sectarianism, public opinion in this part of the island and elsewhere in the world began to change.  Over a period of time we suddenly found that even Orange bigots were becoming respected.  That was because of the murderous campaign that was being waged against them by the Provisional IRA who started to do things which people found totally inexplicable. As we know, some awful things have happened, some things which have been far worse than the disruption of the rail link between North and South.  The disruption of that rail link is another example of the stupidity of the actions of the Provisional IRA as well as the immorality of them.</P>
    <P>Why do they do this, is the question most often asked in relation to the disruption of the Belfast-Dublin railway line.  What political, military or other advantage does the IRA gain from disrupting this railway line, putting the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk, threatening the jobs of railway workers, causing inconvenience and financial loss, particularly to people who do not have or who cannot afford to own a car?  Why do they do it?  Is it part of the so-called economic war?  If it is, how many bombings, how many disruptions, how many decades will it be before the political will of the British Government is changed?  Is the reason military in that the blowing up of the line and the hoax warnings provide opportunities for booby traps and ambushes? Again, if this is so they have not been very successful from the IRA's point of view.</P>
    <P>The British know how to deal with these threats.  They have learned over years of experience how to deal with them.  They take a lot of precautions to <Col N="1052" /> ensure the protection of their personnel using aerial and other surveillance.  Is it to tie down the maximum numbers of security forces?  If so, they have not been very successful in this game either.  The British Government have not allowed that to happen.</P>
    <P>The inconvenience to the public has always rated a much lower position on their priority scale than military considerations and the safety of members of the security forces.  I understand that. Does the reason lie in the symbolism of the railway line?  A symbol it certainly is, but hardly, one would have thought, the sort of symbol the IRA find useful in its cause.  The Dublin-Belfast line is symbolic of the unity of this country.  The IRA is supposed to be fighting for the unity of this country and how is that aim assisted by continually blowing up a major link and symbol of the unity to which I have referred?  How do they explain, for example, to an Irish American supporter that the unity of the country is hastened by blowing up one of the things that unites us?  Surely even such a very gullible supporter &mdash; they have to be very gullible to continue to support the IRA &mdash; would wonder why it is not those who are opposed to unity of the country who are blowing up the railway line rather than those who ostensibly support unity.  The most gullible of them must wonder about that.  Again, why do they do it?  None of the so-called justifications, whether economic, military or symbolic, explain why they continue to bomb this line.  The answer to the question, a Cheann Comhairle, is that the destruction of the Belfast-Dublin railway line has more to do with &ldquo;Mafiaism&rdquo; than it has to do with patriotism.</P>
    <P>There are economic implications but they have nothing to do with the so-called economic war.  The economy that concerns them is the economic future of the godfathers of violence and the sneaking regarders who support them.  A Cheann Comhairle, I have to be careful.  My hatred and contempt for the Provisional IRA and all that murderous organisation stands for does not blind me to the fact <Col N="1053" /> there are in the North other equally contemptible organisations on the extreme Unionist side also looking for excuses and for justification for killings.  I do not intend to give them any excuse by going further and being more specific.  All I will say is this: there are people who have a financial vested interest in disruption of the rail line.  There are direct vested interests and indirect vested interests.  In the latter category I will put the dilemma of people who are more accessable to demands for protection than are the railway authorities.  For those who would wish to inquire further I recommend the old Latin tag <i>qui bono</i>&mdash; to whose benefit?  I think that would be a useful thing to recommend.  A Cheann Comhairle, it is my privilege to propose the motion and recommend it not only to this Government but to the other one concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of widespread concern expressed throughout this island, which is united in its condemnation of the Provisional IRA campaign against the Dublin-Belfast railway line.  I know that the views expressed by Deputy Currie will, no doubt, be expressed by other Members of the House who will join in that condemnation of the Provisionals before this debate is concluded.  It should be clear to those who are involved in this campaign that their actions in disrupting a service which has linked North and South for over 100 years, in threatening the safety and well being of passengers and staff alike and in putting at risk over 400 jobs are very much resented by the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Since December 1988, the Dublin-Belfast railway line has been subjected to a concerted campaign of disruption by the Provisional IRA or by persons purporting to act on behalf of that organisation. As a result of this campaign the railway line has been closed on a number of occasions during that period following actual attacks by the placing of bombs or by the making of hoax telephone calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 24 explosives devices have been planted on the Northern side of the line during the course of the campaign, <Col N="1054" /> the most recent being at Newry station on 23 February, when a bomb exploded causing serious damage.  It is only through sheer good luck that no passengers or railway personnel have been killed or seriously injured by the placing of such devices, although one British Army explosives officer was injured by a booby trap bomb during a clearance operation last July.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand what those who endanger the lives of civilian passengers and staff expect to gain from a bombing campaign against a railway line which unites both parts of our country. Apart from raising questions about the mentality of those persons who would risk a major disaster by placing explosive devices on a railway line, one must ask what objective can be achieved by a campaign which puts jobs at risk as well as putting a question mark over a long established cross-Border link.  One possible objective would appear to be to close down the line.  It is difficult to see how this type of action can be reconciled with the objective of reunification.  The irony of the situation becomes clearer with the realisation that, while the IRA are attacking the line, the leader of the political wing of that organisation is on record as calling for European Community assistance for the development of the link.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government are most concerned by these attacks and condemn them in the strongest possible way.  The Tánaiste pointed out in a statement on 13 March 1989 that the continuing campaign of violence, as reflected in the attacks on the railway line, is deepening the division between parts of the island and seriously damaging ongoing business, trade and personal links between North and South, and their further development. In response to parliamentary questions in April and May last year, the Tánaiste also pointed out that the Department of Foreign Affairs has maintained close contact with the British authorities on the matter through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and that he had personally raised the issue with the Secretary <Col N="1055" /> of State for Northern Ireland.  The concern of the Government about this issue and the importance of keeping the line open and safe for travel have been brought to the attention of the British authorities on a number of occasions and they fully accept our concern in the matter.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that, while the vital railway link between the two parts of this island has been subjected to this senseless campaign, services have never been withdrawn or suspended and have been maintained by bus substitution between the nearest stations on each side of a particular incident.  That, of course, is not an entirely satisfactory solution but it shows a determination to ensure that this important service will continue to run despite the pathetic attempts of the men of violence to sever the link.  The staff of Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways deserve great credit for maintaining the service in the face of adversity.</P>
    <P>Those who are responsible for this campaign are well aware that it is a cause of considerable anger to the general public who, apart from being inconvenienced, not to say endangered, in going about their everyday business, see this campaign as a brazen affront to the very fabric of our democratic society.  It is clear from the views expressed here by Deputies on behalf of their constituents, and from views expressed through the general media, that the public want this action against the line to stop now.</P>
    <P>I would again call on those who are responsible for this senseless campaign to put a stop to it before we suffer a major disaster as a result of a bomb on the line. For my part, I can assure the House that the Government recognise the importance of the Dublin-Belfast railway link and will continue to take whatever measures are necessary on our side of the Border to ensure that the line stays open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be easy to join in the chorus of condemnation all of us share in regard to this matter but this House has a greater responsibility than that.  Without in any way depreciating the <Col N="1056" /> stature of the current Minister for Justice, if the men and women of violence would not listen to the Pope in Drogheda in 1979 it is unlikely that they will listen to condemnations of violence from this House in 1990.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record the Labour Party's condemnation of what we regard as the Government's continuous complacency about this ongoing campaign of violence against the railway line.  It is right and proper that this all-party Opposition motion, which clearly has the support of all parties in the House, was moved by Deputy Currie.  No Deputy in this House has more direct experience of the sectarian and Fascist violence of this maffioso group of so-called patriots than Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>We have to recognise what is at issue here.  This has nothing to do with patriotism, democratic politics or decency. We are looking at a new nascent form of Hiberno-Fascist &ldquo;maffiosoism&rdquo;, which, if we do not nip it in the bud with all the due processes of law, power and authority a democratic State commands, will lead to a situation where our children and grandchildren will live in peril of a crowd of bandits who have identified a clear target which happens to straddle a Border between the North and South of this island.</P>
      <P>I cannot put our condemnation of this act of violence in any stronger terms than the ones I have just used.  Some Members of this House have honourably severed their links with the Provos.  Other Members were linked with the Provos and in some cases financed them in different times.  I would say to everybody listening to this debate that the kind of maffioso gangsters who are now extorting large sums of money from people whose economic livelihood depend on cross-Border trade have never had anything to do with the politics of the nationalist struggle on this island.  We have to be very clear about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I condemn utterly the hypocrisy of Gerry Adams, who calls for EC structural aid assistance for the upgrading of the rail link between Belfast and Dublin on the <Col N="1057" /> one hand and who on the other hand authorises, either directly or indirectly, the godfathers of violence to take out periodically the regular passenger and freight traffic on the railway line between Belfast and Dublin so as to ensure &mdash; this is the net point of this debate &mdash; that the extortionists can focus in on those people who depend on rail travel for their freight and say to them &ldquo;Unless you deliver to us the 10, 15 or 20 per cent of the money required we will ensure that you will not travel across the Border&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of what is happening. We are looking at a kind of Hiberno-Sicily in northern Europe where the maffioso who have reigned supreme in southern Italy since the turn of this century are now being embedded in a frightening manner in this country.  Anybody who has family connections in that part of the world, as I do, has only to look at the names, the families, their background and activities to realise that they are no more patriots, nationalists, democrats or politicians than the thugs and violent extortionists who roam the streets of Chicago and parts of south Boston.  These are the same kind of political animals who use the language and uniforms of politics to dress themselves up as protectors for nothing more than their own bank balances.  We cannot use language strong enough with which to condemn them.</P>
    <P>The democratic language of condemnation is not enough.  We could all find unity of purpose in this Chamber to which each of us was elected, but we have to go further.  I put it to the Minister for Justice that the Government are not doing enough.  Al Capone was ultimately taken out of the political and social society of North America by means of civil income tax legislation.  The extortionists, the businessmen behind the poor innocent gunmen who place the bombs and make the phone calls, are tools of a much wider and deeper conspiracy.  I am sure Deputy Ahern and Deputy McGahon, who are present in the House, know exactly what I am talking about and I suspect they could put names on some of <Col N="1058" /> the beneficiaries of the extortion rackets which are a direct consequence of the frequent phone calls which inform people that there is a bomb on the railway line.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Justice, who is present in the House, that his Department know the 20 to 30 potential beneficiaries of the disruption of traffic across the Border.  I put it to his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that an inspection of bank accounts and the books of companies directly and indirectly related would reveal transactions which do not correlate with the normal patterns of trade. I put it to the Minister for Justice and his colleague, the Minister for Defence, that the levels of electronic surveillance along the railway line are insufficient and that the railway line has not become a symbol of North-South unity but has become a soft target which does two things at the one time &mdash; on the one hand it draws out the military personnel in Northern Ireland, the British Army, the UDR and the RUC as a kind of target where they become potential victims and on the other it ensures that the level of extortion against ordinary commercial business communities and the people who work for them, who are frequently put at risk, continues.</P>
    <P>What can the Irish Government in Dublin do?  I put it to the Minister for Justice that they can do more than the simple condemnation and the wringing and washing of hands we have heard here this afternoon from the Minister.  I want to put some questions to the Minister. Has the level of electronic surveillance been improved since December 1988 when this campaign started?  Has the level of top level security co-operation between the military authorities North and South improved since the campaign started?  Have there been any detailed discussions between the railway authorities North and South on the question of protecting the line?  This is a military security area which could be addressed. Has anybody on the ground spoken to the victims of this extortion racket?  As Deputy Austin Currie said at the beginning of the debate, this is a matter of <Col N="1059" /> protectionism, extortion and the creation of a maffioso which will go on from generation to generation unless we do something about it.</P>
    <P>If we approach the victims with all the discretion, with confidentiality and all the instruments that are open to this State, we can go after the real godfathers who are placing money in the pockets of the wrongly motivated innocent individuals who place the bombs.  Not in any negative or partisan way, I have to say to the Minister for Justice that he and his Government are not doing enough.  The combined apparatus of Government can go after the godfathers.  As Deputy Currie says, we have to take these people off the political and social stage and, after due process of law, put them properly behind bars whether it is for income tax evasion, extortion or whatever.  The godfathers have to be removed if we want to end this mafioso type extortion on the railway lines.  Appeals to decency, so far as. these people are concerned, will fall on the same barren ground as did the appeal made by the Pope outside Drogheda nearly 11 years ago.  It is not sufficient for the Government to sit back, wring their hands and say they are doing their best, that they condemn without hesitation the acts of violence and so forth.  More has to be done.  The Government must do what, so far as I am aware, has never been done before.  They must go after the potential victims who are being blackmailed, who are being hit for money by the godfathers and ask them what kind of help they need, how they can be supported and how these godfathers can be identified, these people who have nothing to do with the reunification of the country, with the land or the people, but who are simply in it for the money.  If we do not do this we will have permanently on this island a mafioso which if it takes root at all &mdash; and it has shown all the signs of taking substantial root &mdash; we will find impossible to uproot not for this generation but for future generations.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are totally against what is happening.  We denounce it unequivocally but all of us must do more. <Col N="1060" /> The Government in particular must do more than simply wring their hands and say they deplore what is happening. There must be clear executive action within the framework of the law of the land.  Those options are open to the Minister. I would invite the Minister or any other spokesperson on behalf of the Government to respond and outline the specific action they propose to take in the light of the continued campaign against the North-South rail link.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this motion.  It is not often there is all-party agreement on motions that come before the House.  In regard to Deputy Quinn's criticism of the Government my recollection is that in 1981 Fianna Fáil put specific pressure on the British Government to reopen the Newry railway station which subsequently reopened.  They did so on the basis that the fact that it was closed was a disadvantage to the people living in the Newry area, it having been decided expedient by the powers that be in the North 20 years previously, to close it.  It was through the pressure of the Southern Government that it was reopened, so far as I am aware.  If someone else in the House can say otherwise, I would like to hear it.</P>
      <P>It is not often that I and my constituency colleagues, Deputies McGahon and Bell agree, but this is one issue on which we do agree and it is important for us, as representatives of that constituency, to let the general public in the South know the feelings of our constituents in relation to the campaign that is being waged against the rail link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was honoured to be a member of the British Irish Parliamentary body at its inaugural meeting and I specifically raised the issue of the Dublin &mdash; Belfast rail link.  At that time I called on both the Irish and British Governments to give a continued commitment to the retention of the rail link and I welcome what the Minister has said here tonight.  I have no doubt that the British side would also be of that opinion.  I also called on the two Governments to endeavour to upgrade <Col N="1061" /> the rail link through the trans-frontrier Structural Funds that are available.  I understand that at present the Government are examining the possibility of a study group made up of Iarnród Éireann and Northern Ireland Railways and I would hope that some consideration would be given to upgrading <i>vis-à-vis</i> electronic surveillance and things like that.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects which some Deputies and the general public are not aware of.  Not only is the rail link disrupted by bomb hoaxes but also the road link, to coincide with the hoax on the railway.  On a number of occasions around Christmas time both the rail and the road were closed for considerable periods.  The Minister referred to the bus substitution and while that does work one has to go to Dundalk railway station to see how exactly it works; it means people have to lug all their baggage off the train and on to a bus and travel to the next station across the Border and that is causing severe disruption to travellers and tourists coming here and using this rail link.</P>
    <P>There is a suspicion around where I live that the considerable time it takes to give the all clear in the case of a bomb hoax is, to a certain extent, to the advantage not only of the Provisional IRA but of the British Army who, I know, have a difficult job when they have to go out and take away a bomb and be sure that the bomb and everything in relation to it is cleared away.  At one stage just before Christmas I understand that there was a bomb on the line for nearly a week before it was cleared and this caused severe disruption to the people in the area because at that time the road was also closed.  All the people travelling either or north or south had to use some of the minor roads either to the west or east of the main Dublin-Belfast road.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that every time there is a hoax in the area it gets national and international publicity and that does not help the continued bad press that the area I represent gets.  Some people have mentioned that lives and jobs are at risk. There is no doubt about that.  No later <Col N="1062" /> than today I was talking to a retired engine driver who was hijacked on one occasion and who told me that on another occasion he passed over a bomb and but for the fact that the bomb was four seconds late in exploding he would have been killed.</P>
    <P>If the rail link were ever to close it is quite certain that ultimately the Dublin to Dundalk rail link would also close with the consequent loss of jobs at the Dundalk station.  This is something I do not think people in the Republic realise.  The rail link is a vital link to a very disadvantaged area, the north Louth area. Quite a number of jobs depend on that rail link and that is something we should also bear in mind.</P>
    <P>While I supported the peace train and was there when it came into Dundalk, it caused a number of hoax telephone calls to the Garda in the Dundalk area from the southern side of the Border, stating that there were bombs on the southern side.  That never happened before.  There is a feeling in the Dundalk area that the peace train has highlighted the problem to the disadvantage of the area.  It is not my opinion but a number of people have said it to me.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how this bombing campaign has continued.  The rail link is symbolic of Irish unity of whatever shape or form we would like.  The acts being perpetrated against the rail link are partitionist and they frustrate the aims of the people perpetrating them.  I am not totally sure that it is all to do with Mafia-type operations on the Border.  The escalation of the bombing of the rail link has taken place since the watch towers mushroomed along the Border.  There have also been road closures along the Border which have disrupted people's lives.  This has put a ring of steel around the Border and has to a certain extent curtailed the activities of the terrorists in and around the Border but it has disrupted the lives of people in the area.  The escalation of the bombing is perhaps due to a feeling among the terrorists that they have no other way of getting at the British Army. Putting bombs on the line or on the road is a way of drawing out the British Army.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> Disruption is also caused because of customs delays along the Border.  One has to go to the area to see exactly what I mean.  The bombing of the rail line is nothing new since it has been taking place for years.  I recall that it was bombed by the Official IRA in the early seventies and there were petrol bombs in Lurgan. Perhaps Deputy Currie would be able to give more information on this.  I am not sure that these problems can be attributed totally to Mafia-type operations along the Border.  I feel that the Provisional IRA are trying to entice the British Army out of the watch towers and bunkers.  We should not forget that.</P>
    <P>I should like to lend my voice to the commitment which has been given by the Minister here and on previous occasions. Our Government and the British Government through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat should continue to ensure that the rail link is maintained.  The day it is not there, we would be giving in to the terrorists and it would be a sad day for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity on behalf of The Workers' Party jointly to propose this all-party motion which deplores the attacks on the Dublin-Belfast rail line and also condemns the continuing spate of bomb attacks and the use of bomb scares by the Provisional IRA in an attempt to close the rail link.  The motion also calls on the British and Irish Governments to co-operate in whatever joint ventures might be necessary to keep the line open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past 18 months there have been scores of bomb attacks on the line and many more bomb scares.  In one two-month period last year the line was closed for more than 50 days as a result of these attacks.  The resulting commercial losses are estimated to be in the region of £800,000.  A number of important issues are raised by these attacks.  The most important is, of course, the threat to the lives of passengers.  In one attack on 2 March last year the bomb which damaged Craigmore viaduct went off just four minutes before a passenger train from <Col N="1064" /> Dublin was due to leave the nearby Newry station.  There were more than 70 people on the train and had the bomb gone off as it was passing over the bridge or when it was too late to stop the train the consequences would have been appalling. There was another narrow escape in August last year when an express train was due to pass the location of a bomb near Lurgan just two minutes after a warning about the device had been received.  Luckily for the 31 passengers abroad, the train had been delayed at Portadown.  Had the train been running on time the police would not have had time to intercept it and the bomb would almost certainly have exploded as it passed over the device.</P>
    <P>The attacks have been continuing. Only last month the Provos destroyed Newry station and again closed the line. This was almost certainly linked to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions women's conference which was being held in Northern Ireland that weekend.  The hotel in which the delegates were staying was also bombed by the Provos.  This was clearly aimed at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who themselves have been conducting a campaign to protect the rail link as a parallel effort to other campaigns. The ICTU general secretary made it clear on that occasion that they would not be intimidated by such cowardly attacks and stated categorically that the trade union movement were totally opposed to the Provo campaign of violence.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of jobs. Trade union leaders have estimated that up to 400 workers, North and South, could lose their jobs if the Provos get their way and are allowed to shut down the line.  Apart from the railway workers directly affected, there are many more employed in firms which depend on the railway line for freight services between the two parts of Ireland.  Some major firms use the line such as Cement Road-stone, Guinness, NET, Richardson's Fertilisers and Bell Lines.  If they cannot get their products through or if they have to incur additional costs by transferring <Col N="1065" /> to roads it will clearly threaten the jobs of their employees.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the strategic importance of the line to transport on this island.  We tend to refer to it simply as the Belfast-Dublin rail line but it is more than that.  It is the only rail link between North and South.  At present it is possible to travel or to move freight by train from Derry to Kerry but this will be ended if the Dublin-Belfast link is destroyed.  It is also a key part of the whole Eurorail network.  It was shocking to find that the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Mr. Bruce Millan, said in Belfast on 12 January that European Community money was available for the upgrading of the line and all that was holding it up was inaction on the part of the Dublin Government.  Proposals to upgrade the link were included in the transport programme submitted by the Northern Ireland Office at the end of 1989 and it is inexcusable that improvements to the line should be held up by the failure of the Irish Government to make a similar application.</P>
    <P>Following Mr. Millan's statement the Department of Tourism and Transport tried to suggest that the delay was due to CIE's failure to submit proposals, but my understanding is that CIE simply do not have the money to upgrade the southern section of the line and feel that unless money is forthcoming from Government it is not feasible to pursue European Community funds.  Whatever the reason, I would urge the Government to sort out the matter rapidly and ensure that an application is made for the money which Commissioner Milan has clearly indicated is available.</P>
    <P>There is also a basic civil liberty issue involved.  Between 2,000 and 3,000 passengers travel on the line each week for business, work, education or family reasons.  In many cases people have no alternative means of transport.  The effort by the Provisional IRA to close the line is a challenge to the very right of Irish people to move freely about this island. Imagine the outcry there would be if the authorities in Northern Ireland decided to close the line on their side on security <Col N="1066" /> grounds.  No doubt Provo spokesmen like Adams and Morrison would be among the most vocal on the matter.  The Minister has pointed out that with one side of his mouth Mr. Adams calls for improvements to the line but with the other side of his mouth he supports those who, virtually on a monthly basis, attempt to close it down.</P>
    <P>The continuing attacks illustrate once again the appalling arrogance and hypocrisy of the Provisionals.  On the one hand, they claim to want to eliminate the Border while at the same time they are doing all in their power to make travel and trade between the two parts of Ireland more difficult and dangerous. Their whole strategy is to create divisions between people, between communities and, indeed, within communities.  Their very survival is based on feeding sectarianism, bigotry and racism.</P>
    <P>The rail line is used entirely by civilians. This raises the question of why it has become a focal point of attacks by the Provos.  There have been rumours of money being paid to the Provos to have the line closed for commercial reasons. Deputy Quinn made a very strong statement here today to the effect that he believed that is true, but I have no way of knowing whether there is any truth in it.  There are strong Mafia type operations being carried out by the Provos in various parts of Northern Ireland, but I have no way of knowing whether the rail link attacks come under that heading.  The fact that the rail link offers an opportunity to destroy and endanger lives and is a soft target may well be enough for their perverse logic.  This has certainly been the case in relation to other attacks by the Provos, such as the Enniskillen slaughter and the murder of Harry Keyes in Donegal and Gillian Johnson in Fermanagh. The Provos themselves have claimed that their motive is the ghoulish one of forcing the security forces out into the open presumably so they can more easily murder them.  Whatever the motive for their life threatening and destructive attacks on the line, it is important that the Provisionals are not allowed to succeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> In the early seventies the Provisionals destroyed the electricity interconnector and frustrated the possibility of cheaper electricity in both parts of Ireland.  They must not be allowed to do the same with the railway line.  The two Governments must co-operate in whatever security and other measures are necessary to keep the line open.  Workers, passengers, companies, all citizens should make their views on these attacks known publicly to the Provisionals at every opportunity. They should to be told in no uncertain terms what the ordinary public think of their vicious campaign.</P>
    <P>The debate today is an important part of that public declaration that we want no part of what the Provisionals are about. I disagree with Deputy Quinn that the passing of this motion in this Dáil today will have no effect.  Today all the democratically elected representatives of this State are unanimous when we say that we want the Provisionals to stop their attacks and that we want both the Irish and British Governments to take every step necessary to ensure that they do not succeed in their evil intent.</P>
    <P>I am proud that The Workers' Party, my party, played a central role in the event which led to this motion being taken tonight.  The Workers' Party have resolutely opposed the attacks on the line and sought to mobilise public and political pressure against them.  Speaking in an Adjournment debate in the House on 10 April last year, I indicated that I had established a Workers' Party committee seeking to organise a peace train from Dublin to Belfast.  The resulting response was so positive from such a wide range of political, commercial, cultural, trade union, religious and supporting interests both in Northern Ireland and the Republic that it became possible to establish two broadly based committees, North and South, who eventually organised the very successful peace train in October, which included many Deputies and Senators and many political figures from Northern Ireland.  More than 1,000 people travelled on that train to show <Col N="1068" /> their opposition to the Fascist tactics of the Provos.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the point made by Deputy Ahern, in some way the peace train gave weight or encouragement to the Provos.  I know from people who have come to me since that they were very put out by the fact that the peace train event had taken place; it was such a massive demonstration that they felt very demoralised as a result.  I know Deputy Ahern said it was not his personal view, but if we were to go down the road of saying we must do nothing in case we provoke these people, then we should simply close shop and give the country over to the Provos.  That is the logic of not wanting to take any action which would in any way upset or provoke them. True to form, the Provos displayed their contempt for public opinion by disrupting the train with a bomb scare.  Many on the train, including Members of the Oireachtas, decided to take a stand and refuse to submit to Provo intimidation by remaining on board.</P>
    <P>The idea of this all-party motion had its origin in the discussions during that long night when we were marooned in Portadown, where we had excellent courtesy and care from people of all political shades.  Following that event, my colleague Deputy Eamon Gilmore, circulated a motion which was signed by nine Members of the House, a slightly revised version of which is now before us in the names of the Whips of The Workers' Party, Fine Gael and Labour. It is intended that similar motions will be moved in Belfast City Council, Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council and I intend to seek a declaration, with the support of all MEPs, North and South, from the European Parliament on the same issue.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, these attacks on the railway line and other murderous attacks by the Provos simply emphasise the need for political action to isolate and defeat the gunmen.  This can best be done through dialogue between the democratic political parties in Northern Ireland, leading to the establishment of <Col N="1069" /> devolved government there, a government guaranteed by a bill of rights, and we will see moves towards real integrated education in Northern Ireland and the tackling of the very serious economic and job situation there.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for this House simply to pass this motion, to feel we have done our job and then to forget about Northern Ireland.  We must seek to create a sense of solidarity, commitment and unity of purpose between people North and South, which we saw in the organisation of the peace train, and develop that into an unstoppable force for peace that even the Provos cannot ignore.</P>

I hope we have more pleasant journeys in the future.</P>
      <P>I have to dissociate myself from my friend and colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in his veiled criticism of the peace train which typifies the ambivalence of all Fianna Fáil Deputies about the Border question.  His reference to the watchtowers in south Armagh, which is a totally different issue, is a sop to the Republican vote in north County Louth, which I understand but I do not think is particularly relevant here.</P>

      <P>His refusal to accept that racketeering is the root cause of this problem and of most of the problems in the Border area is staggering.  I have to describe it in relation to the activities of terrorists as a babe in arms.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn left no stone unturned. He called a spade a spade, and he comes from a very honourable Northern Republican family.  He knows a thing or two about what happens in the Border area. John McNulty's death 18 months ago gave a clue to the extent of racketeering in the Six Counties.  The recent announcement by the Bank of Ireland that they had been asked for a donation of £2 million illustrates how deeply racketeering is ingrained there.  How many years will it be before it comes down here?</P>
      <P>Deputy Currie and Deputy Quinn referred to the Mafia tactics of the IRA. On one hand you have the IRA and on the other the UDA; they have a tacit agreement in the North to ply their trade, the IRA in west Belfast and the UDA in east Belfast, and they earn huge profits from it.  I know of a North of Ireland Protestant businessman who parted with £10,000 sterling in this State &mdash; he is in the lorry business &mdash; to a gentleman representing the INLA who is now incarcerated in jail, where he should be.</P>
      <P>As I said, Deputy Quinn referred to the IRA as the Mafia and that is what they are.  However, Al Capone would appear like an altar boy when contrasted with the likes of Mr. Adams, to whom I have referred on previous occasions as Dr. Mengele, the Irish angel of death. He is an abomination which this country could well do without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ahern knows, our own town has suffered grievously as a result of the war carried on in the next county. That is the reason we have an unemployment rate of 34 per cent &mdash; double the national figure &mdash; and why there are more Dundalk people working in Birmingham and London than in Dundalk town.  This Assembly should shed its naivety about the IRA and what they are about.  They are totally removed from any previous manifestation of the IRA <Col N="1071" /> who, 70 years ago, were honourable people.</P>
    <P>The IRA are a cloak to allow people to indulge in gangster activities and we should all be united in our recognition of that fact.  I commend the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; I do not often pay tribute to trade unions organisations &mdash; for having the courage and the determination, despite total harassment from the IRA in placing a bomb in the lobby of the Slieve Donard Hotel, Newcastle &mdash; for defying that evil organisation and successfully carrying on this year's conference. I also commend them for their spirit, initiative, courage and determination in saying that they will go back to Newcastle.  I understand that this was a ladies' conference and it must have been terrifying for many of them, especially those from the South, to face the threat of a bomb.  This was a cynical manifestation of the contempt which the IRA have for Irish people.  Instead of being seen as some type of red branch knight outfit, they should be seen by all shades of political opinion in this House as the vermin and scum they are.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate the Government for their commitment to the continuation of a rail link which has served Dublin and Belfast for over 100 years.  It has given gainful employment to generations of people from Dundalk, Drogheda and Balbriggan and many towns on the other side of the Border such as Lisburn, Portadown and Newry.  The railway is a direct link that brings thousands of people each way to enjoy leisure activities. It also brings them on educational courses, apart from the commercial and freight carrying aspects.</P>
    <P>The threat to the continuation of the line is hard to accept from a group of bandits who claim to want to unite Ireland and yet attempt to enforce partition and close the direct link which has been there for 100 years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Northern Ireland Railway Company, Iarnród Éireann and the British and Irish Governments for their determination in the face of a prolonged and vicious attack on this line.  A lot of <Col N="1072" /> money and freight has been lost to both railway companies and more will be lost in the future.  I ask the Minister to give a continuing commitment to ensure that the IRA will never impose their will on the railway line and that the jobs &mdash; about 500 on each side of the Border &mdash; will be safe.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider that with the approach of 1992 more opportunities will present themselves to road transport companies as Europe opens up. I believe &mdash; and Deputy De Rossa touched on it &mdash; although we have no concrete proof, that the beneficiaries of a rail closure would be some people engaged in the road transport business.  It is easier for the IRA to exact a road tax from people in that industry than it is to stop a train and ask the people on it to hand over their money.</P>
    <P>I want again to refer to the Bank of Ireland dilemma last week when they were asked for £2 million.  Naturally, Governments, North and South, will want to keep a lid on this but how many other business concerns one each side of the Border have been approached and asked for money?  Indeed, it would be very interesting to know how many businesses have paid money to the IRA since the troubles started in the late sixties.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the initative of The Workers' Party and congratulate Deputy Currie, Deputy Barnes, MEP Mary Bannotti, Senator Norris and indeed everyone who travelled on the peace train. At least we defied the IRA.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment at the end of this debate that the necessary rail link will be kept open as long as he is in Government.</P>

      <P>I will not take anything like that length of time.  On behalf of the Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, I welcome this motion regarding the Belfast-Dublin rail link.  I would like to have been a sponsor of this motion; however I was not asked to co-sponsor it.  I was one of the first TDs to get <Col N="1073" /> involved in the peace train as I was a patron from the very beginning.  Unfortunately a long standing engagement in the country prevented me from joining the peace train and it is one of my great regrets that I did not make other arrangements. However, I do not like letting people down.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed to hear from Deputy Ahern that there was criticism of the peace train in the Dundalk area.  I hope this does not reflect the views of the majority; perhaps he was listening to the wrong people.  I certainly hope so.  The peace train last October gave the general public an opportunity to show their feelings of disgust at the IRA's campaign of disruption of one of the essential services in this island.</P>
      <P>The disruption of the rail link adversely affects both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland socially, economically and culturally and is an attack on commerce and employment in both parts of the island.  If the pressure of public opinion means anything to the IRA, they must surely take note of the support for this issue from people of all ideologies, of all backgrounds, from each part of the island.  Those two trains carried people from all political persuasions, of all social backgrounds and of all ages who said to the IRA: &ldquo;hands off our rail link&rdquo;.  They asked that the lines be kept open.  If any message comes to the IRA from this motion it is that there are no legitimate targets and there is no support for their campaign of violence in this part of the island.  We need to retain our rail link, our lines of communication and, let me repeat to those men of violence, Belfast and Dublin agreed to keep the lines open.</P>

      <P>I certainly will not take up the time of the House.  I would like to think that everybody who wishes to contribute on this important motion will be able to do so.  The representation and constructive co-operation from all sides of the House in the downright condemnation of what the Provisional IRA are attempting to do speaks for itself. That condemnation was evident when the peace train was organised and travelled to Belfast.  That was a symbolic gesture. The stand that was made by the people who travelled to Belfast and back to Dublin without being forced to transfer to buses, as so many passengers had been forced to do on previous occasions, was an indication that we would not accept what the Provisional IRA were doing to the people who have to take that train day after day for business and social reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that struck all of us forcibly, especially the people who travelled on that train, is that people who usually use public transport are those who are least able to afford the privilege of private transport.  In that sense alone, what the IRA are doing is a denial of any sense of socialism they may claim to have. What the Provisionals are doing when they force women and children, shoppers with baskets and bags, people who might be hungry and tired and not a little unafraid, intimidated and threatened by what is happening to them, is hitting the most vulnerable people, the people with the least power and clout in our society.  They actually claim, in the name of republicanism, that this is some kind of patriotric gesture.  The distortion and abuse they have brought to republicanism and the tenets of a republic are horrifying and disgusting and I am glad we are able to be here to condemn them tonight. Travelling in hundreds and thousands on <Col N="1075" /> those trains, as people did in October, was a gesture of solidarity and condemnation of the distortion and double dealing of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the organisers of the peace train.  It took a lot of voluntary organisation, time, effort and money.  I also want to congratulate the people, North and South, who rallied to the symbolic gesture and gave their support. They acknowledged what the ordinary people, north and south of the Border and, as Deputy De Rossa has said, even as far as Kerry and Cork, have to put up with every time they try, as citizens of this country, to make a normal train journey. What angers me &mdash; and this is something I would lke to emphasise in this debate &mdash; is that a small, undemocratic, violent, vicious group, either through their bluff or the reality of planting a bomb, could force out everybody who travels on these trains, with no mandate, no democracy and no consideration of the needs and priorities of these people.  The negation of our travelling rights is something that has to be experienced to realise what people suffer every day at the hands of the Provisional IRA, who claim to be liberating all of us and to be bringing about a United Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is symbolic that we are discussing this motion, which I would like to think will be built on, the week after St. Patrick's Day which symbolises unity, North and South.  St. Patrick was a civilising, christianising force.  It was from Northern Ireland that he started his journey south.  It is also symbolic that at a time when the other House debated the implications, constitutional and political, of articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution regarding the unity and the jurisdiction of this country, the IRA, without any conscious belief in the constitutional rights of people North and South of the Border, override them to the extent that they continue to do.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Ahern that it is important that we take a non-violent stand against this violence.  In that way we can offer, as a contrast, a symbolic, collective, solid, supportive model.  I am <Col N="1076" /> sure Deputy Ahern realises that the IRA did not like the international publicity they received.  When they go out on their propaganda travels to gather finance as a liberation group as they term themselves, we show them to be the small, vicious, terrorist, undemocratic, unrepresentative group which they are and show what they do to the ordinary decent and vulnerable people of this country, including women and children, shoppers and others, who want to travel to see their families and relations on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>It is a special distaste for all of us that in the very months when we see the crumbling of walls and boundaries in a peaceful, democratic way, as we are now witnessing in eastern Europe, the old, redundant, uncivilised, violent, vicious and bitter conflict that has dogged this country for so long can still be seen by the IRA as the only one they can put forward.  They are redundant and irrelevant and they are an absolute insult to everything that this State and Northern Ireland stand for.  The sooner we can get that message across to them through the corporations, councils and elected representatives, the better.  The people who have been voted in have to take that stand against them and isolate them.</P>
    <P>I am glad I have an opportunity to speak like this because I think we have to isolate them and show them how irrelevant and redundant they are in a changing world where people have coped with far greater discrimination and difficulties in a way that is a model and hope for the rest of us for the future of the world. Above all else, I want to agree with what Deputy Quinn said, that they are Neo-Hiberno-Fascists. In a world that is rejecting non-violently, thankfully, Fascism and Totalitarianism and the crowding out of individual rights, I hope that at least we may be able to get through to the IRA and show them how futile, stupid and fruitless their campaign is.</P>
    <P>We have talked about our ambivalence and I would like to draw attention to one point so that all of us who are elected may be in a position to do something about it.  I find it difficult to try to explain <Col N="1077" /> why the political wing of that vicious group can hold their annual conference in the Mansion House, which is a symbol of freedom and representative democracy. I would like to think that until they reject and renounce violence and accept a political solution with the rest of us they would not get that venue or any other venue in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can. One of the points made by Deputies was about the trade union conferences and this reminded me very vividly of attending a trade union conference in the King's Hall, Belfast, and the having to travel back for the election of mayor in Drogheda.  I let it be known that I would arrive at 7.20 p.m. and would take a taxi down to the courthouse to vote in the election.  During the day I decided to go on the earlier train.  Lo and behold, somebody rang in from Drogheda to say there was a bomb on the line south of Dundalk.  I was lucky that I had come on the earlier train and the fellow I came to vote for was elected, otherwise the other person would have been elected.  This emphasises the point that people use these tactics in all sorts of situations. People who place bombs on the railway lines of those who ring in at all times of the day and night with false alarms add to the inconvenience of people.  Further along the Border, the British Army closed a number of roads for so-called security reasons.  They created quite a lot of craters.  There was an outcry from people particularly on the south side of the Border because the road was closed but the same people might turn a blind eye to a similar situation on the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McGahon, Deputy D. Ahern and my colleagues know, in Louth County Council, of which all three of us are members, we have cross-Border committees and we frequently meet with our opposite numbers in Newry and Mourne and elsewhere along the Border for the purpose of trying to improve the infrastructure, tourism and facilities in the interests of people on both sides of the Border.  At the same time this <Col N="1078" /> essential and important work is being torpedoed by these irresponsible people who are acting in the so-called name of the Irish people.  They certainly are not representing me or any of the people in Drogheda or in the constituency of Louth.  I think they should have got that message clearly during the last elections in both the Euro election and in particular the general election in County Louth. They will get that message again during the local elections.</P>
    <P>Many of the people engaged in subversive activity are hiding out in places like Dundalk, Drogheda-and other towns on the south side of the Border area. They take refuge on the basis that they cannot be touched in those areas and they use them as a base for carrying out attacks on the railways, for example.  I served in the Army for longer than most Members of this House and from all the military training I have ever received I cannot see for the life of me what military value there is in blowing up a railway.  This tactic was used successfully, of course, during the last World War but the Allies were trying to stop the Germans from shifting war equipment and weapons which would have helped to the defeat the Allies.  The only thing that the railway line from Dublin to Belfast carries is people &mdash; people going to their work, people on business, people going to visit their friends or to visit people in hospital, either North or South, in Belfast, Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalk.  These are people who have not got cars, ordinary working people &mdash; for example, old age pensioners who have free travel and cannot afford any other form of transport.  These hobos are attacking these people.</P>
    <P>I join with my two colleagues who referred to the connection between smuggling and subversive activity.  I have no doubt that exists, none whatsoever.  I think one is synonymous with the other; one is supportive of the other.  It is true that through smuggling that they get the money to finance subversive activities. That is why I hope that at some future date we will achieve harmonisation of taxation and move away from the differential between North and South so <Col N="1079" /> that we would at least be able to eliminate that activity.  Hopefully, that will reduce the level of income of these &ldquo;boys&rdquo; who want to disrupt our country.</P>
    <P>I joined in with the trade union protest at Oriel Park.  The railway colleagues came from all over the country, from Kerry, to join in that protest.  Our trade union colleagues, North and South, and indeed from the UK, also joined that protest. I was very proud to be there to join in the condemnation of the bombing.  I was disappointed at the level of public support that turned out.  In fact, many more had turned out for the H-Block campaign, when the shoe was on the other foot.  Not as many turned out in Dundalk for this protest which in my opinion was more important than any H-Block campaign.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon referred to the question of employment, but I think &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; is probably the better word. In County Louth we have the highest level of unemployment in the Republic. Dundalk has the dubious honour of leading that chart, as Deputy Ahern, Deputy McGahon and I know.  That did not happen by accident.  Employment did not just go out of Dundalk; it left for a number of reasons.  Employment was not provided in Dundalk for one very important reason, because foreign employers were not prepared to come to Dundalk. Many of them came as far as Drogheda and stopped there; and they made quite clear the reasons that they would not go to Dundalk.  The people of Dundalk have to realise that is the situation.  The tourists have not come to Dundalk or to the Border areas for the same reasons.  I was talking to international visitors yesterday in this House and they think there is a machine gun or a bomb under every wall, in every bed, in every house and under every railway track along the Border. Their concept is that we spend all our time killing each other on the Border. The international press have given these &ldquo;boys&rdquo; more publicity than they deserve.</P>
    <P>We also have to bear in mind the cost of troops, North and South.  Security costs millions and millions of pounds which <Col N="1080" /> could be better used to get jobs for the town of Dundalk, County Louth and the Border areas.  The money could be better spent than spending it on anti-subversive activity.  We have to think of the families of those who work on the railway.  I live beside the railway.  The trains go by all night and very often I think of the mothers and fathers, and the wives of the men who have to drive the trains and work on the railway.  I am sure they worry, as I do, about them and wonder if they will be home for breakfast in the morning.  That is the type of thing we in County Louth have to put up with.  I am glad to join with my colleagues on this occasion, as I will on every other occasion when there is a motion calling on us to be unanimous in our condemnation of this bandit land activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very significant that this motion has attracted all-party support; but I somewhat disappointed to see one Deputy communicate some criticism of the peace train initiative and suggest that this may have contributed to an increase in the number of threats to the line.  The peace train was a remarkable event representing a spontaneous expression by ordinary people of their opposition to the repeated attacks on the North-South rail link.  In the early days of the organisation of the peace train the ambitions of the organisers were quite modest.  It was only after the announcement of the peace train, when members of the public began to ring in to express their interest in it, when representatives of all the political parties and members of various sporting and cultural organisations began to express their support, that this initiative gathered momentum. Therefore when it came to the day itself we were not talking about one peace train but two.  Indeed, given the response of the public it would have been possible to fill a far greater number of trains with people who wanted to express their opposition to attacks on the line and their support for the continuance of the North-South rail link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also signficant that a large number of public representatives and sporting <Col N="1081" /> and cultural personalities participated in the event and provided sponsorship.  This certainly helped to make the event a success, but the real champions were the members of the public who participated to express their opposition to the attacks on the line.  The real heroes are not necessarily those who stayed overnight in Portadown, which after all was nothing more than a symbolic gesture but which however did succeed in highlighting the affairs, but rather the people who get on the train every single day of the week and who cannot afford the luxury of staying overnight in the presence of the international media in a railway station in Portadown.  They have to go about their day to day business as best they can and try to get to their destination on time without having to trudge off the train with their luggage at enormous inconvenience at either Dundalk, Newry or Portadown in order to avoid the bomb threat against the line.</P>
    <P>When this motion was tabled after that event it appeared as if the peace train may have had some limited success as the number of attacks on the line lessened somewhat.  Whatever hopes we might have had were well and truly shattered on 23 February with the planting of a bomb at Newry station and in the hotel where the ICTU women's conference was taking place.  The question has been asked as to what effect the passing of a motion by Dáil Éireann will have on the IRA.  It is fair to say that it is quite likely that the IRA will not pay a great deal of attention to a motion passed by Dáil Éireann.  Indeed, there may well be a temptation for people who are antidemocratic, such as the IRA, to consider it macho to be seen rejecting a motion passed by Dáil Éireann.  But the significance of this motion, which has received all-party support, is that it gives public expression to what we know the people want, which they themselves have expressed at every given opportunity, be it the peace train or the peace movement in the seventies or the signing of the book of condolences following the Enniskillen massacre.  On all those occasions people showed that they are totally opposed to <Col N="1082" /> violence from whatever quarter and to the Provisional IRA.  All they want to do is to live in peace and get on with their lives.</P>
    <P>There is a temptation when talking about an issue like this to paint a caricature of the IRA and present them as being somehow subhuman.  However, it is a fact of life that the IRA are a product of the thinking in this country.  In passing a motion such as this it is very important that we bear this in mind.  At every opportunity the Provisionals seek public support for their activities.  They have exploited their own prisoners, the Birmingham Six and every single issue in an effort to gain public support and acceptance that what they are doing is in some way legitimate.  I do not think they should be given that opportunity.  Neither should they be given the opportunity to say, because additional towers have been erected and certain roads have been closed, that this in some way legitimises attacks on the railway line.  This is the kind of ambiguous thinking which has given rise to the Provisional IRA and to circumstances in which there is some measure, albeit limited, of public acceptance of their activities.  We must oppose their activities and reject them.</P>
    <P>This motion is very important in that it expresses our view on the issue.  It is also important because the rail line, which is of importance to the economy of the area, symbolises the need for continued co-operation between North and South and for continued dialogue and understanding.  Anything which goes against that, such as public statements by politicians suggesting that there is less than tolerant attitude among the people of this island, will contribute to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise at the conclusion of this debate, as one of the signatories to the motion, to support it and make a few observations.  I thank the Whips of the parties who agreed to my suggestion that we should debate this motion before the Easter recess.  It is important that we should write into the record of the House, the seat of democracy in our State, our <Col N="1083" /> unanimous condemnation of the activities of the Provisional IRA in disrupting the Belfast-Dublin rail link.  It is important that we should record our demand for an end to attacks on that rail line.  The debate represents an important event, all the more so in that we have all-party agreement to the motion.  It is also important that we recognise the debate as part of a campaign that is slowly emerging and developing.  I am referring to the campaign of democrats across our community, North and South, to publicly stand up and unambiguously challenge the activities of Sinn Féin and the IRA, as has been happening in recent months.</P>
      <P>The singular, central important act surrounding the peace train was the fact that people from all walks of life, of all political persuasions and with different perspectives of the way forward in terms of achieving peace in Northern Ireland, were unified in one thing, in facing up to the people who peddle violence and say to them that their activities were not acceptable to us as democrats.  There is no doubt that it is a feature of the political lives of those who are concerned and committed to the furtherance of democracy here that we should try to bring forward a view that exists among us all, our abhorrence of the paramilitary existence and to the use of violence.  We can confront those people in elections and put them in their political place, we can speak about them on platforms at public meetings but there is always the frustration about the extent to which we are being surrounded by their nefarious activities and not being able to stand up and protest loudly and in a more unified way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was significant that we were able to bring on the campaign from the peace train to picketing the annual conference of Sinn Féin which was held in the Mansion House in Dublin as another manifestation of our public opposition to their political philosophy and activities.  I agree with Deputy Barnes that it is a curious thing, to say no more, that the facilities of the Mansion House are made available to the people who argue for the so-called <Col N="1084" /> concept of democracy at one level and perpetrate a violent denial of it on another.  That is something that must be addressed and I have no doubt that it will be considered by Dublin City Council in the near future.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I had the honour of seeing a preview of the excellent television film made by RTE about the Guildford Four, centering on the character of Mrs. Sarah Conlon who was present at the showing.  That remarkable film will be shown on RTE on Monday evening and I recommend watching it to all Members who are concerned with the campaign against violence and the need for the democratic process.  Sarah Conlon showed, in the face of unbelieveable adversity, incredible strength, strength that exists throughout the community in Northern Ireland and amongst those who travel daily on the rail line.  She was approached by the so-called green cross and by the people who said that her cause was a political one, but she turned to them and said that had they not planted the bomb her husband would not have died in prison, her son would not have been locked up for 15 years and deprived of his youth and early manhood.  Her belief was that the instigators of the problem facing the Conlon family were the IRA.  She had the strength to say no to their double-edged hand when they extended it to her at the time of her troubles.  That type of strength must be brought into debates in the House and outside when we are dealing with issues like the bombing of the rail line and the activities of the IRA.</P>
    <P>We must be clear and unambiguous in our opposition to the activities of the IRA.  The campaign started by people concerned about democracy in the face of the attacks by the IRA on the rail line is a beginning by us all in our efforts to oppose the activities of those people.  The trip by peace train, the picketing outside the Mansion House and the stating in this debate of the clear and unambiguous views of Members of the House represent a start in the campaign.  There is no doubt <Col N="1085" /> that that campaign will continue.  Eventually, we will face down the activities of the terrorists.</P>
    <P>This issue first came to my attention most directly when a number of train drivers, some of whom are constituents and some of whom are acquaintances, told me that they could not stand the strain any longer.  They explained that they had, in the face of unbelieveable pressures, written to Mr. Gerry Adams, so-called Member of Parliament for the people of West Belfast and President of Sinn Féin, requesting a meeting.  Those train drivers, as workers, wanted to bring to his attention what his associates were inflicting on those who drove the trains on that line.  They never received a response from Mr. Adams, a Member of Parliament for the people, as he describes himself.  He refused to meet them, but two members of the so-called National Executive of Sinn Féin met the train drivers in Dublin.  They listened to their case and said that regard would be had to their plea and their difficulties.  However, they pointed out that Sinn Féin, and the IRA, have their own agenda, their own responsibilities, as they call them.  That meeting took place late in 1989 and events subsequent to it show that Sinn Féin and Mr. Adams have no regard for the plight of the workers, those who use the rail link and their families and the other people who are concerned with that rail link.</P>
    <P>We must bring this campaign further. There is the issue of the inter-connector which we have walked away from a little too easily.  It also represents an important economic feature in the co-operation between the two communities North and South.  We should be looking for the restoration of the connector as another serious declaration to the Provos that they cannot seriously bomb their will on the communities North and South.  I should like to commend the police and the Army personnel involved in keeping the line clear as far as possible north and south of the Border.  This point was referred to when The Workers' Party visited Army GHQ in Dublin and it brought home to us the important role <Col N="1086" /> being played by the Army, particularly by the bomb disposal squads who risk life and limb in trying to dismantle some of the vicious devices planted on the rail line on our behalf.  There is no doubt that the Provos are deaf to democracy.  They will not have any regard to the fact that the House is unanimous in stating that their campaign of terror should and must end. Consequently, the onus is on us as democrats to continue the campaign.  We must ensure that our voices are heard often and unambiguously in condemnation of their activities and for peace and democracy on the entire island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a coincidence that we happen to be talking about cross-Border trading following the important motion that has been unanimously carried.  This debate results from the announcement made at the EC Court which effectively said in a statement &mdash; not a judgment &mdash; that the 48 hour restriction imposed by the Government some time ago is illegal. This is only a declaration, it is not a judgment.  Later in the year the judgment will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody in Louth or in the Border area was foolish enough to believe that the 48 hour rule on cross-Border shopping trips would become a permanent fixture. At best it was only a temporary measure but it helped in a small way to reduce the level of unfair cross-Border trading &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;. It is not the fault of the business community or the unfortunate workers in the <Col N="1087" /> immediate Border area that this position exists.  The fault, I would submit, rests with successive Governments who, by raising customs and excuse duties far in excess of those applying in the UK and Northern Ireland, have made business and trade uncompetitive in the South, and particularly in Dundalk and the Border towns.</P>
    <P>Let us take a few examples of price differentials: in petrol there is a difference of 98p per gallon, beer £1.20 per six pack, cigarettes 23p per packet, wine £1.40 per bottle approximately, different brands of whiskey £4 per bottle and in the case of television sets and other electrical goods more than £50 per set on average.</P>
    <P>We voted for the Single Europe Act because we were conned into believing that we would have tax harmonisation by 1992.  Now we are being told that the Government cannot afford to apply this measure as it would cost in the region of £500 million per year.  How much is it costing now not only in financial terms but in terms of jobs and business and factory closures?  We only want fair trading, and I emphasise this because for many years the balance was in favour of the Republic.  During that period people on the other side of the Border suffered very severely because of the tax differential. The only way this problem can be dealt with is through a fair trading arrangement, and the only way a fair trading arrangement can exist is if we achieve tax harmonisation so that traders and people in business, on both sides of the Border, can operate.  This was the object of the Single European Act.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government, irrespective of the short-term cost, to find ways and means before 1992 to ensure that fair trading can exist by achieving tax harmonisation.  Nobody has put down the facts and figures and quantified that for us in this House, for the business community or for the general public.</P>
    <P>We heard earlier about the problems of the subversive activities in the North and in the Border area which were affecting very substantially the employment <Col N="1088" /> position and the economy of our State. This is another area where we are being hammered and this is one of the reasons the level of unemployment in County Louth and in other Border areas is the highest in the country.  Deputy McGahon said earlier that the unemployed rate was 34 per cent but I think it is even higher. At a recent function held in London for people from Dundalk 600 young people turned up and it is expected that that figure will increase to 1,000 when the next Dundalk function is held in London.  If all those young people were living in County Louth the level of unemployment would be substantially higher and the level of poverty would be even greater.</P>
    <P>I want to establish what the Minister and the Government propose to do in the short term.  Has the Minister any other alternative plans?  Is he examining alternative ways of ensuring that in the short term &mdash; and until we achieve tax harmonisation &mdash; some measures will be taken to protect the remaining jobs and to stop the unemployment spiral, particularly in the north Louth area?  What can be done?  I do not know the answer.  I am sure the Government have considered that question very seriously and that they felt this would be only a short-term measure.  However, it has probably lasted longer than anyone anticipated.  It is not our intention in County Louth to destroy business activity, particularly in the Border areas.  We must encourage the Government to achieve tax harmonisation on excise duties so that we will have fair trading.  In the long term this will not only help to restore the level of employment in north Louth and in the Border areas, but it will help to achieve the policy of all parties of a united Ireland by peaceful means at some future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my constituency colleague, I query the 48 hour rule and the Minister's views on the opinion that was handed down yesterday.  I represent Dundalk where I was born and bred.  The 48 hour rule introduced in 1987 was the first recognition by a Government of the serious Border problems that started 15 <Col N="1089" /> years ago.  Governments have been criticised down the years for not doing enough for the Border areas, and to a certain extent, rightly so.  In 1987 a number of senior people in Fine Gael acknowledged that they would have introduced the cross-Border restriction if they had thought it would succeed. Unfortunately, this opinion from the European Court now puts that 48 hour rule in jeopardy.  If we live within nine miles of the Border on the land frontier zone exemption and if four people travel across the Border by car, they are entitled to take £110 duty free goods across the Border.  Where I live people said that the 48 hour rule would not have an immediate effect on cross-Border trade between Dundalk and Newry.  It did have an effect and that is acknowledged by most people, including Deputies on the other side of the House.  In 1987 I was stopped on the streets of Dundalk and asked to congratulate the Government and the former Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, for introducing that rule.</P>
      <P>I had an opportunity to read the Opinion handed down yesterday.  This Opinion acknowledged the problems in the Border areas &mdash; I think the phrase used was &ldquo;unquestionable problems&rdquo;. The person who handed down the Opinion criticised the European Commission for not having tried to come to some agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff in that proceeding.  I think he felt that not enough negotiations. had been entered into before the court action took place.  Perhaps there is a glimmer at the end of the tunnel in that regard and it will be possible to bring in alternative arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree entirely with my constituency colleague that the ultimate answer in regard to cross-Border trade is the equalisation of VAT &mdash; the Minister has acknowledged on many occasions that he intends to equalise the VAT rates as much as possible come 1992, and he took the first step towards this in the budget &mdash; and the abolition of excise duty, which would help dramatically.  If the 48 hour rule is ultimately abolished when the judgment is handed down it will not have <Col N="1090" /> as dramatic an effect as people may think, particularly as the economy in the Republic is in a far better state of health than it was prior to 1987 and the economy in the North and England, which has an inflation rate of 7 per cent, is not in as good a state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 48 hour rule, as it came to be known over the past number of years, was introduced in the 1987 budget to correct the very substantial distortion and deflection of trade that had arisen on the land frontier between the North and South of Ireland.  As Deputy Bell said, mainly as a result of the differences in tax rates, large numbers of people crossed the Border every day to avail of the cheaper shopping prices in the North.  On the basis of surveys conducted at the time by Customs and Excise staff it was estimated that some 3.6 million shopping trips were made by residents of the Republic to the North of Ireland in 1986.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly this had many serious economic consequences.  It was estimated that people returning from trips to the North imported goods to a value in excess of £300 million in 1986.  This represented a huge loss of trade to the economy, including the Border areas.  There was also a significant loss of tax revenue to the State which compounded the severe problems of the public finances at that time.</P>
      <P>The success of the measure can be assessed on the basis of the dramatic falloff in the number of residents making one-day shopping trips to Northern Ireland.  A survey by Customs and Excise staff in December 1987 found that in one day only 4,000 persons passed through the customs crossing at Carickarnan after a same day visit to Northern Ireland.  This represented a reduction of some 78 per cent on a comparable day in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pattern is similar when other pre-and post-48 hour regulation survey results are compared for other dates &mdash; for example, June 1987 was down 77 per cent on June 1986 and March 1988 was <Col N="1091" /> down 94 per cent on March 1987.  One-day coach trips to the North almost disappeared following the introduction of the 48 hour rule regulation.  On a day in December 1986 over 220 coaches travelled North with shoppers from the State. On a comparable day in December 1988 only seven coaches made the trip.</P>
    <P>The curtailing of what was largely an artificial movement of pre-48 hour rule traffic thus played a very significant part in the subsequent improvements recorded in both the public finances and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>The Irish regulations, which, in our view clarified the position by drawing a valid distinction between genuine and fiscal travellers, that is, those whose sole reason for the journey was to avail of travellers' allowances, was challenged on the grounds that they infringed EC law. The matter then followed the usual procedures in such cases and culminated in a formal hearing before the European Court in Luxembourg on 21 February last.  The Irish defence, prepared by the Attorney General's office in consultation with Senior Counsel, based its arguments on the major distortion of trade involved, the artificial nature and scale of the abuse and the failure of the Commission to respond to requests made by the EC Council of Ministers in 1985 for the Commission to look into the feasibility of making a distinction between &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; and &ldquo;fiscal&rdquo; travellers.</P>
    <P>The legal arguments in the case now fall to be considered by the full court and a formal judgment will not be available for possibly two to three months.  I do not propose to comment, therefore, on these legal aspects or to speculate on the final outcome.  As I have already indicated, the opinion given by the Advocate General is not binding and, of itself, does not call for any action in relation to the 48 hour rule which remains in operation.</P>
    <P>While the Advocate General's Opinion proposes that the court should find against Ireland on the legal grounds it nevertheless stresses the serious difficulties with which Ireland was faced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The opinion states, and I quote: &ldquo;Everyone agrees that the problems with which Ireland is specifically confronted under the exemption arrangements are serious&rdquo;.  It is also notable that the Advocate General has raised the question as to whether the stance adopted by the Commission has prevented solutions being found which could have forestalled these court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Pending the formal judgment of the court, the Government will be considering all the options available should an unfavourable ruling for Ireland be given.  I do not propose to anticipate the outcome or to go into the possibilities at this stage, but one course of action which might be taken would be an approach to the Commission seeking a derogation which would recognise the enormous problems which Ireland faces before indirect tax rates are approximated throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>The Commission have recognised the problems facing this country in the whole area of tax harmonisation and, following the case which I made last year in the EC Council, is at present carrying out a special study on measures that might be taken to assist us.  I should stress that the Government have a positive attitude to tax approximation, as I indicated with the VAT and excise reductions that I introduced in this year's budget.  We are prepared to play our part in the approximation process.  The objectives in mind can be achieved only with a fair sharing of the burden of adjustment as between the member states.  Pending approximation being achieved, we must have regard to the economic realities for the economy and the Border areas.  This is why the Government took the action they did in 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In dealing with the lack of library facilities in the Carlow Regional Technical College I will also be dealing with the library facilities in regional technical colleges in general.  Last March a collection of facts <Col N="1093" /> were published in a document entitled <i>A National Scandal</i> which dealt with the facilities in libraries in VEC colleges.  Perhaps the term &ldquo;a national scandal&rdquo; is slightly strong language.  The term &ldquo;a national shambles&rdquo; might be a fairer description of the library facilities in these colleges.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I have the utmost admiration for the regional technical colleges.  The Carlow Regional Technical College has done a tremendous lot of good for the town and the students and has given a new aspect to education. In criticising the library facilities in the regional technical colleges I am trying to help them attain the high standards they should have.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to three aspects of the library in the Carlow Regional Technical College.  The Higher Education Authority and the Library Association of London, who seem to be the standards authority, recommend one staff member for every 200 students.  When the 15 regional technical colleges are taken together it works out at an average of one staff member for every 536 students. In the Carlow Regional Technical College there is one staff member for every 600 students and the Waterford Regional Technical College seems to have hit the bottom of the pile with one staff member for every 900 students.  I know we are talking about the ideal situation and that ideals cannot always be reached, but the recommendation is one staff member for every 200 students.</P>
      <P>The cream of the universities, Maynooth, has one staff member for every 85 students and Trinity has one staff member for every 73 students.  I know that Maynooth and Trinity College have been in existence for many years and it would not be easy for the third level colleges under the VEC to reach their standards.  However, there is a terrible gap between Trinity College, which has one member for every 73 students, and Waterford Regional Technical College, which has one staff member for every 900 students.  I am talking about third level colleges.  I am not comparing third level with second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> Clearly the staffing of the libraries in the regional colleges is not up to standard. There are three staff members in Carlow Regional College library.  If we were living up to the standard we should have nine.  They have to be able to help the students who come in to do research work; they have to be able to do research work themselves.  If there are three instead of nine there is obviously room for improvement without even reaching the ideal situation.  Allowing for the fact that the regional colleges are much newer than the other third level colleges, the ideal number of books is 35 per student. Carlow has 18,000 books and a population of about 1,800.  If they were to follow the standard of 35 books per student they would have 66,500.  That is the ideal but there is a big gap between 66,000 and 18,000.  There are lots of other figures I could give but we would only get mesmerised by too many figures.  I am just pointing out the extremes to show that the library facilities at third level are not adequate.</P>
    <P>UCC is established a long time, with 6,900 students and a total of 448,000 books, 75 per cent of them on display at any given time.  The total VEC studentship is 29,000, which is roughly four times the number in Cork; yet the total number of books for VEC colleges is only 359,000 &mdash; less than Cork University. I am not just talking about Carlow but the total number of VEC colleges.  The balance is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>The big problem, which I have left until last, is the number of seats per student. The ideal seating accommodation should be one for every four students; obviously all four students would not be in at any given time.  Carlow has 76 seats in the library for 1,850 students.  Ideally they should have 460 seats.  Again they might not be able to reach the ideal but to have just 76 for 1,850 students is a complete sham.  These are not primary or second level students.  They are students who are doing diplomas and degree courses.  In this modern age third level students have to do research.  They have to be able to go in and sit down and read and have <Col N="1095" /> access to reference books.  If there is room for 76 to sit down and another 1,800 who cannot go anywhere, they have to overflow and take books out into the corridor, sometimes into the canteen, and there is chaos.  It is indefensible that it has got to this stage.</P>
    <P>The students and the librarians have made their case before this.  The staffing is wrong; the number of books is wrong, and the seating accommodation is blatantly wrong.  I hope the Minister will accept that there is a serious problem.  It is just not enough to talk about knocking a wall here or there because there might be some funds coming from Europe.  The problem is such that new library facilities are needed.  To a certain extent we are trying to use Mickey Mouse facilities for major third level educational buildings, and it is just not good enough.  We must have the staff; we must have the equipment and we must let the students know that if they are going to third level colleges we are prepared to give them the facilities.  There is no point in the public or the employers or anybody else expecting that these students can compete with those in places that have far better facilities. I hope the Minister will have some definite views on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Browne for his contribution and apologise for the absence of the Minister who, unfortunately, cannot be present in the Dáil tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the difficulties regarding library facilities at Carlow Regional Technical College and the Department are at present considering the best possible way in which this and other problems in the regional technical college can be overcome.  It is pertinent to recall that the Minister recently announced a capital programme amounting to £72.5 million for developments in the third level sector of education.  This programme, which will be funded on a pound for pound basis by the EC, includes, <i>inter alia</i>, a programme of enhancement for the regional technical <Col N="1096" /> colleges.  This regional technical college programme will put particular emphasis on the provision of library, computer science technology, hotel training, staff and lecture facilities.  Discussions are at present taking place between the Department of Education and the regional technical college authorities regarding this enhancement programme. Carlow Regional Technical College is included in these discussions.</P>
    <P>As the consultations are ongoing, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position at present to give more detailed information.  The Deputy, however, may rest assured that the Minister for Education is fully cognisant of the difficulties being experienced in Carlow and will bear their position in mind before the programme is finalised.  The educational importance of library facilities, particularly in a third level institution, goes without saying.  Everything will be done within the available resources to ensure that the best facility possible is provided in the regional technical college at Carlow.  I will bring to the Minister's attention the points that have been made here this evening by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In fairness, how could that be given as an answer to a serious question?  I am not blaming the Minister of State, but surely that is not an answer to a serious problem that the Minister has known about for a long time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that while discussions are ongoing with the various regional technical college authorities it is not possible for me to pre-empt their outcome.  The problem is not particular to Carlow but applies to regional technical colleges. all over the country.  I take the point that the situation is serious.  I can assure the Deputy that our Department, and especially the Minister, are working with all haste to find a solution to the problem.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the contribution of the enterprise development programme to industrial policy objectives.  The programme has been especially designed to encourage middle and senior managers and professional people in private industry and in the public service to set up their own businesses.</P>
      <P>To date over 540 managers have started companies under the programme. The total number of persons employed in IDA assisted EDP projects at the end of 1989 was 3,114.</P>
      <P>Arising from an internal review of the programme by the IDA in 1987 its objectives have been refined.  The key elements of the revised strategy are the concentration of resources on increasing the number of internationally trading &ldquo;star&rdquo; companies emerging from the programme and the taking of State equity in all start-ups.  Particular attention is now being given to the development of new businesses by tapping into the skills and resources available in the academic community.</P>

      <P>I am aware that certain difficulties have arisen in relation to credit terms being demanded by a major retailer from its suppliers.  I understand that negotiations have taken place between the parties concerned and that agreement has been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> I do not consider that it should be necessary for me to become involved in negotiations on credit terms between suppliers and individual retailers &mdash; this is not my function.  However, if it is found that there is an abuse of a dominant position I will not hesitate to take whatever steps are open to me to put an end to any such abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to the introduction of legislation to give effect in domestic law to provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  I am satisfied that this new legislation will provide for free and fair competition in all sectors of industry.</P>

      <P>The remit and powers of the National Development Corporation are established by the National Development Corporation Act, 1986.  I have no plans at this stage to seek an amendment to this legislation.</P>
      <P>I am on record as stating that I believe there is a need for NADCORP to become more developmental, while retaining a long-term commerical remit.  An important objective would be to integrate NADCORP's operations more fully into the central focus of industrial policy.  For example, I have suggested that NADCORP might consider concentrating more heavily on a small number of sectors of strategic national importance, which may be considered high risk.  Such sectors would include the indigenous electronics and software sectors in which NADCORP have already become involved.  I believe also that NADCORP could underpin the efforts of the State promotional agencies in national programmes such as linkage, company development and small enterprise development.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any information supplied to the High Court that AGF would in fact pay £25 million.

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement giving details of our trade with South Africa from 1987 as prepared by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>In overall terms our trade with South Africa increased from £47 million in 1987 to £68 million in 1988 but fell to £39.8 million for the period January-November 1989.</P>
      <P>As regards our exports to South Africa over the period, food and live animals is by far the largest single sector.  Exports of food and live animals increased from £19.3 million in 1987 to £31.8 million in 1988.  The figures for January-November 1989 show a significant decrease in this sector to £5.9 million.  I am advised that the reason for the fall in these exports is that other markets, mainly in Europe and the Middle East, were available to beef exporters.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside these food exports, our export trade with South Africa has been relatively static at £24.3 million, £28.4 million and an estimated £25 million in the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, respectively. In the same period our total worldwide exports increased by some 55 per cent.  I would also point out that our total trade with South Africa represents less than 0.5 per cent of total EC trade with that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the import side, mineral fuels (coal) accounted for the major proportion of imports.  Again imports, excluding coal, have been relatively static at an average of £6 million for each of the years 1987, 1988 and 1989.  Imports of coal have grown from £1.4 million <Col N="997" /> in 1987 to over £4.9 million in January-November 1989.  I am advised that such <Col N="998" /> imports were made by private companies in Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>if the clothing industry is at risk because of (a) sterling versus the punt, (b) Third World imports into the EC; his views on the alarming conclusions of the recent European report; his views on the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The clothing industry has been facing the challenge of increasing imports from low cost sources for some time.  This situation has been exacerbated recently by the exchange rates movements <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK, our <Col N="999" /> main competitor.  However, while the punt/sterling exchange rate, which is largely outside our control, has adversely affected our competitiveness, it must be acknowledged that despite recent increases in our interest and inflation rates they continue to be considerably lower than those of our main competitors.</P>
      <P>Because of our longer term commitment as members of the EC to the phasing out of the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) in the context of the Uruguay Round negotiations, it is inevitable that imports from low-cost sources will continue to increase.  However, since the phasing out of the MFA is conditional on the strengthening of GATT rules and disciplines over a time frame yet to be agreed, the industry should be given the opportunity to continue its process of restructuring to enable it to increase its competitiveness and to exploit market niches where it has the advantage of quality, design and quick response to customers' needs.</P>
      <P>I can assure you that Ireland will be seeking to ensure that whatever transitional régime is put in place after 1991, when the current MFA expires, will allow for the necessary restructuring of the clothing industry to continue.</P>
      <P>The Europen report studied the implications for the Irish clothing industry of the completion of the Internal Market and the longer term phasing out of the MFA.  It concluded that the challenges would be particularly important for smaller firms who will face new difficulties in their efforts to survive and expand.  The findings of the Europen report are being taken into account in the ongoing refinement of the strategies for the development of the clothing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, a wide range of measures are in place and are being implemented to address the weaknesses identified in the sector, which include lack of scale, inadequate management skills, lack of attention to marketing and lack of finance.  While the support agencies play an important role in helping the industry to develop and expand, in <Col N="1000" /> the final analysis much of the initiative rests with the industry itself to exploit new markets and to be competitive on the home market.  I am confident that, while there will be significant difficulties to overcome, the Irish clothing industry can meet the challenges ahead with the assistance of the strategies being pursued.</P>

      <P>Since the entry into force of the Single European Act, the pace of decision making by the Council on the Community's internal market programme has accelerated considerably.</P>
      <P>At the end of February last, 145 of the 279 proposals currently contained in the programme had been fully adopted.  This, together with partial adoptions and proposals on which common positions had been adopted, represents agreement of approximately 55 per cent of the programme.</P>
      <P>While this progress is satisfactory, the Community cannot afford to become complacent.  The Irish Presidency, for its part, is determined to maintain the momentum built up in recent years and to bring the Community closer to the reality of a Single Market without internal frontiers.  Indeed, at the informal Internal Market Council being held in Ireland on 24 March 1990 we have scheduled for discussion the fifth review on the implementation of measures necessary to achieve the Single Market. This report will be fully examined with a view to providing whatever further impetus is desirable to the pace of progress.</P>

Following further investigations my Department were able to backdate the claim to April 1989, giving a further £400.20 of arrears.  The claim was made late but a good cause was established and accepted.  The cheque for £400.20 issued on 6 March 1990.</P>
      <P>Ongoing payments of disablement pension are made by periodic payments at four week intervals.  Arising from the investigation into the late claim there was a delay in putting the periodic payments into operation with the result that normal payments commenced only from February 1990 leaving a payment outstanding in respect of the period from January/February.  A cheque for the amount concerned, £110, has been issued to the claimant.</P>

      <P>The mortality figures to which the Deputy refers did not take appropriate account of the age structure of the counties or county boroughs nor the age structure of the national population.  The relatively high rates indicated for the areas referred to by the Deputy primarily reflect the age structure of the population rather than an increased risk of cancer mortality.  Accordingly, no special investigation is warranted.</P>

      <P>Proposals made by the European Commission for compulsory nutritional labelling of foodstuffs were recently considered by the EC Council but a majority of the member states were not satisfied as to the need for such a measure.</P>
      <P>However, the Council recently reached a common position on a proposal for a directive which makes nutritional labelling compulsory where a nutrition claim is made.  The proposal also lays down detailed rules as to the information to be included where nutritional labelling is provided.</P>
      <P>The 1980 report of the Food Advisory Committee on nutritional labelling and claims recommended that nutritional labelling of foodstuffs should be encouraged but did not advocate compulsory nutritional labelling as such.  Consumers are becoming more conscious of the relationship between diet and health and are demanding additional information on product labels to enable them to make informed choices.  I welcome this move on the part of consumers and should add that the industry has been quick to respond to the demands by voluntarily providing nutritional labelling in many cases.  This nutritional labelling will have to comply with the detailed rules laid down in the aforementioned proposed directive when it is adopted and implemented in the member states.</P>
