    <Title>Convention on Wetlands: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Convention of Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Water Fowl Habitat, done at Ramsar on 2nd February, 1971, as amended by the Protocol done at Paris on 3rd December, 1982, and by the extraordinary conference of the contracting parties to the Convention at Regina, Canada on 28th May to 3rd June, <Col N="344" /> 1987 &mdash; copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 9 March 1990. </P>
    <P>Ireland ratified this convention on 15 November 1984 and the approval of the Dáil is now sought to amendments agreed, subject to such approval, at the Extraordinary Conference of the Parties to the Convention held at Regina, Canada in May-June 1987.</P>
    <P>The amendments concern the financing of the work of the convention and provide for contributions by all 52 parties on the basis of the United Nations scale. This would involve the payment by Ireland of 0.18 per cent of the budget agreed for the three years 1988-90 or 770 US dollars per year.  This is in line with arrangements for contributions to other such conventions to which Ireland is a party.</P>
    <P>The convention originated at a conference held in France in 1962 under the joint sponsorship of IUCN &mdash; International Union for Conservation of Nature and National Resources &mdash; ICBP &mdash; International Council for Bird Preservation) &mdash; and IWRB &mdash; International Waterfowl Research Bureau.  Following many years of preliminary work, a further conference was held at Ramsar, Iran, in 1971 and the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat was adopted.</P>
    <P>The convention was signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland on 14 February 1975.  A protocol to provide for amending the convention was agreed in Paris in 1982.  Ireland signed the Protocol on 30 June 1984 and approval to ratify is now sought in addition to approval on the ensuing amendments.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the convention is to secure the designation by each contracting state of at least one wetland in its territory for inclusion in a list of wetlands of international importance for waterfowl &mdash; and the commitment of each contracting state to a policy of protection and management of the designated wetlands and of formulating and implementing planning so as to promote the conservation of designated wetlands <Col N="345" /> and, as far as possible, the wise use of wetlands in its territory.</P>
    <P>Ireland designated the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve for inclusion in a list of Wetlands of International Importance as required by the convention when depositing its instrument of ratification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order, the conversation in the lobby is intruding into the Chamber and disrupting the speaker in possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Fourteen additional sites have been added to the list by Ireland since then, i.e. Raven Nature Reserve, County Wexford, Pettigo Plateau Nature Reserve, County Donegal, Slieve Bloom Mountains Nature Reserve, County Laois, the Owenduff Catchment, County Mayo, Lough Barra Bog, County Donegal, Owenboy Nature Reserve, County Mayo, Knockmoyle/ Sheskin Nature Reserve, County Mayo, North Bull Island, Dublin, Rogerstown Estuary, County Dublin, Baldoyle Estuary, County Dublin, Clara Bog, County Offaly, Mongan Bog, County Offaly, Raheenmore Bog, County Offaly, and Tralee Bay, County Kerry.</P>
      <P>The amendments adopted at the Regina Conference concern the financing of administrative and research services to the convention.  It was decided that IUCN should provide administrative services to the convention and that the IWRB should carry out any necessary research.</P>
      <P>On 24 June 1988 the Government authorised the Minister for Finance to move a motion in Dáil Éireann seeking approval to the amendments and to arrange for acceptance by Ireland of the amendments following Dáil approval.</P>
      <P>I therefore request the approval of the Dáil to: (a) the ratification of the 1982 Paris protocol to the convention which provided for amending the text of the convention, (b) the amendments to the convention proposed at Regina, Canada in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome this motion and, indeed, <Col N="346" /> we support enthusiastically the fact that this country is a contracting party to the Ramsar Convention.  In this country there are 52 known such sites and in the whole island, including Northern Ireland, there are 61 identified or designated sites. Yet, since we ratified the convention in November 1984 we have designated only 15 of the 52 major known wetland sites as wetlands of international importance. While the 15 sites that have been designated are all important sites in their own right, many of the more important sites in terms of their physical size and concentration of internationally important wild birds remain undesignated and are often threatened.  If we accept the fundamental ecological function of wetlands as regulators of water regimes and as habitats supporting all kinds of flora and fauna, especially wild fowl, we must extend designation, protection and management to all these international wetlands within our own borders.</P>
      <P>Our neglect of these areas and often our ignorance of their ecological importance have in recent years resulted in major encroachment and destruction of all or parts of highly important swamp-lands or wetlands on this island.  This has happened to an alarming degree all over the developed and undeveloped world. We have often forgotten that such areas constitute places of high amenity and recreational value.  We have forgotten all too often that wetland habitats are international resources, because the wild birds that inhabit them are usually migratory birds which move across several national boundaries in a life cycle that is truly one of the great marvels of natural life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alongside the Ramsar Convention we have the 1976 Wildlife Act, excellent legislation on nature conservation, yet its provisions have proved more aspirational than real because the Wildlife Service do not have the resources to enforce their protective measures.  We have the EC Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds of 1979.  This directive obliges each EC member state to protect several species of wild birds.  Twenty-nine such species are found on this island.  Under this <Col N="347" /> directive we are obliged to establish special protection areas to maintain the populations of these birds at an appropriate level, yet we have only designated 15 such areas which must leave us close to being in breach of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The other major gap in our policy is that while we have designated the wetland sites, that is all we have done and there is no follow-up in terms of protection and management of the areas.  I would remind the Minister of Article 4 of the Ramsar Convention, paragraphs 3 to 5:</P>
    <P>3.  The Contracting Parties shall encourage research and the exchange of data and publications regarding wetlands and their flora and fauna.</P>
    <P>4.  The Contracting Parties shall endeavour through management to increase water-fowl populations on appropriate wetlands.</P>
    <P>5.  The Contracting Parties shall promote the training of personnel competent in the fields of wetland research, management and wardening. </P>
    <P>We do not fulfil any of those obligations. We are also reminded under Article 6 of the Convention that:</P>
    <P>By designating a wetland for inclusion in the List, a Government explicitly recognizes its international importance and obliges itself to ensure that its national planning is formulated and implemented in such a way that conservation of the listed wetland is promoted to the fullest. </P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all of these obligations under the Ramsar Convention, under EC Directive 79/409 and under our Wildlife Act, 1976, we find a dump right beside one of the designated sites, the Rogerstown Estuary in North County Dublin and one of the most important habitats in these islands for Brent geese.  The dump is clearly contaminating this most important site.  This is a perfect example of what happens when we have no protection or management and an uncoordinated or insensitive planning permission <Col N="348" /> policy which takes no account of the wildlife interest.  Take, for instance, what happened in County Wexford in the Raven Nature Reserve.  The Minister allowed limited shooting of Greenland white fronted geese some months ago. This was outrageous and rightly caused a national outcry.</P>
    <P>We welcome the motion but these conventions and our participation in them are useless unless we honour them in the letter as well as in the spirit.  We must never again have blots on our policy like the Rogerstown Estuary site and the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve licence to shoot.</P>
    <P>I would like, finally, to pay tribute to the Irish Wild Bird Conservancy, a national voluntary organisation for the conservation of wild birds in their habitats. This voluntary organisation has done more nationally to awaken public awareness to what is happening to our wetlands and the need for urgent conservation and protection of each of the areas, than most of our official agencies. I have a recent publication issued by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy.  It is an excellent publication which sets down the importance of our wetlands, their location what is happening and what we might be able to do to protect them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter of convention was brought before the Whips last week it was the Government's intention that it should be formally moved in the House without debate.  I felt so strongly about this issue that I believed it required a short debate.  The whole issue of wetlands and their use gets scant attention here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways we are the envy of our European partners in that we have an opportunity to preserve and expand our natural habitats.  On the Continent of Europe wetlands in many instances have been drained for intensive farming.  In <Col N="349" /> the notion of the green Presidency of the EC, it should be a priority for us to look at our resources and try to maximise and preserve them.  Our European partners, particularly the Dutch, are trying to recover wetlands which they drained for agricultural use, by artificial means.  On the one hand we have intensive farming and food surpluses being produced in the EC and on the other there is increasing pressure on countries like ours who have yet to adopt intensive farming practices, to destroy more and more of our natural habitats.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out, the original convention at Ramsar in Iran under Article 2 obliged each contracting party to designate suitable wetlands within its territory for inclusion in a list of wetlands of international importance.  The convention places further obligations on the contracting parties in relation to the management and research of those areas. Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Convention says:</P>
    <P>2.  Wetlands should be selected for the List on account of their international significance in terms of ecology, botany, zoology, limnology or hydrology.  In the first instance wetlands of international-importance to waterfowl at any season should be included. </P>
    <P>Article 3 paragraph 1 says:</P>
    <P>1.  The Contracting Parties shall formulate and implement their planning so as to promote the conservation of the wetlands included in the List, and as far as possible the wises use of wetlands in their territory. </P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the first area included in the list of designated areas once Ireland ratified the Convention was a site in Wexford.  The decision of the Government on 30 August 1984 to designate Wexford Wildlife Reserve for inclusion in the list was very welcome. Since then 14 other sites have been included, including a site in Wexford at Raven.</P>
    <P>In relation to the nature reserve at Raven I appeal to the Minister to take <Col N="350" /> note of the fact that there is great controversy about that site.  Part of the beach at Raven has been fenced off and rights and privileges afforded citizens of Wexford for generations are being denied. There is tremendous hostility there now. I appeal to the Minister to take note of and to bring to the attention of his colleague the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Daly the growing anxiety in Wexford about that.  As Deputy Connor said there are many other sites which need the protection of this convention now.  The Minister is about to receive a detailed submission from the Wexford section of the Irish Wildbird Conservancy to designate within the county of Wexford a south coast national park for sea birds. The six sites in the south County Wexford coastline which are rated to be of international importance for sea birds include Lady's Island Lake, Tacumshin Lake, the Saltee Islands, the Cull-Killag, Keeragh Islands and Bannow Bay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion before the House and I intend to support it.  This motion gives us an opportunity of debating, albeit for a very short time, this important issue.  I should like to make three points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the Ramsar Convention puts an <Col N="351" /> obligation on Ireland to list sites of international importance.  Since 1984 Ireland has listed only 15 such sites although the Irish Wildbird Conservancy have identified 61 sites which meet international standards and should be listed.  The question which arises, therefore, is when will this country list the remaining sites.  I have in mind in particular the Shannon Callow site has been identified as one the House the problem of the possible extinction of the corncrake.  The Shannon Callow site has been identified is one of the areas where the corncrake could survive.  This country's record in listing sites compares very unfavourably with the records of other countries.  For example, Denmark &mdash; a country which we very often want to emulate in economic activities, even though it does not obviously have as many wetlands as Ireland &mdash; had by May 1988 listed 27 Ramsar sites in accordance with the Ramsar Convention, a record which is much better than our own.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make relates to the protection of those sites which have been listed.  Much concern has been expressed that, although sites have been listed they are not being adequately protected.  For example, smack in the middle of the Rogerstown Estuary is a Dublin County Council dump which is polluting the estuary.  The point was made previously by Deputy Connor in regard to the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve that permission was granted by the Government for the limited cull of Greenland white fronted geese, a species for which this country has an international responsibility to protect.</P>
    <P>Third, it would be a mistake to confine our attention to those sites which are of such international significance that they would come under the Ramsar Convention. There are many wetland sites which are of regional significance and which would not be sufficiently large or important to be included under the Ramsar Convention.  I am thinking in particular of the Booterstown Bird Marsh in my constituency which is of great significance to the southern part of Dublin <Col N="352" /> but which is under threat.  The Minister and the House will be aware that a large compensation claim &mdash; in the order of £12 million &mdash; was lodged yesterday by a developer for the St. Helen's Lands in respect of a road reservation which is to run through those lands.  It is intended that that same road will run right through Booterstown Marsh.  This will effectively destroy this small bird marsh which is of considerable significance to the Dublin area and of great importance to people.</P>
    <P>In addition to listing sites which are of international significance under the Ramsar Convention and taking whatever steps are necessary to protect those sites, it is important that attention be given to the smaller sites.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us specifically when the Government intend to list the remaining sites and the further steps they intend to take to protect those sites which have already been listed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>: This motion is of particular significance to County Wexford. The Ramsar Convention is only one of four conventions to which Ireland is a party.  This convention was established in 1971 with the objective of conserving wetlands for wildfowl, etc.  The contracting parties to the convention declared their interest in saving wetlands within their jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention requires each contracting party to designate at least one wetland for inclusion in a list of wetlands of international importance for wildfowl. Ireland has designated a number of such areas.  The first area to be designated, in August 1984, was the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve.  Since then something like 14 or 15 sites have been included in the list, including the Raven Nature Reserve in Curracloe.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out, the Raven Nature Reserve has become very controversial in the past couple of months.  As public representatives we have attended a number of public meetings at which people expressed concern at the proposal by the Office of Public Works to rail off part of the sand dunes at the Raven Nature <Col N="353" /> Reserve and take from people traditional rights they have had for many years.</P>
    <P>Up until recently there were 110 hectares in the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve. I was pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on his last visit to Wexford a couple of weeks ago included another 84 hectares in the reserve.  This was a very welcome move for that area.  This reserve is of particular significance in that it provides a winter feeding ground for some migratory wildfowl species, including the Greenland white fronted goose. The reserve is a nature reserve under the Wildfowl Act.  It is interesting to note that 50 per cent of the world's population of the Greenland white fronted goose spends the winter in Ireland and 40 per cent of them spend it in the wildfowl centre in Wexford.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to go into details on the problems I should like to discuss, particularly in regard to the Raven Nature Reserve.  I support Deputy Howlin's call that the Wexford branch of the Irish Wildbird Conservancy submission &mdash; I sent very detailed correspondence on this submission to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly &mdash; should receive favourable consideration by the Minister.  People in County Wexford who are involved with the Wexford section of the Irish Wildbird Conservancy believe their submission meets the criteria laid down in the Ramsar Convention.  I request the Minister to look favourably at this submission.  If the submission meets the criteria laid down by the Ramsar Convention the Minister has the power to include these areas.  It is essential that the Minister does this both in the interests of the people in the areas of south County Wexford mentioned by Deputy Howlin and for the preservation of the sea birds in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I welcome this motion and recognise the importance of it.  In the short time available to me I should like to stress the main purpose of the convention, which is written in very stirring language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention makes a very profound <Col N="354" /> statement which has ramifications far beyond the convention.  It says: &ldquo;The Convention recognises the interdependency of man and his environment&rdquo;. It should be stressed that that is the key to many matters on the environment which we will discuss in this House.  The convention considers the fundamental ecological functions of wetlands as regulators of water regimes and as habitats supporting a characteristic flora and fauna, especially water fowl.  It states that wetlands constitute a resource of great economic, cultural, scientific and recreational value, the loss of which would be irreparable.  Third, it deplores the progressive encroachment on and the loss of wetlands now and in the future, and we have seen many examples of that. It recognises that water fowl in their seasonal migrations may transcend frontiers and so should be regarded as an international resource.  Finally it says that they are confident that conservation of wetlands and their flora and fauna can be ensured by combining farsighted national policies for co-ordinated internationalisation.</P>
    <P>That is all very stirring stuff, but I am sorry to have to introduce a note of partisan politics into this matter which I think, in many ways, should be inappropriate. It has to be said that this measure is too little and too late.  We only have 15 sites designated out of 61.  We should also look at how long it has taken us to get to this situation.  This Convention in Ramsar was drawn up in 1971. It was ratified by us in 1984.  It took 13 years for this country to ratify this convention.  That is an absolute disgrace.</P>
    <P>We improved a little bit.  The Regina convention in 1987, which amended some of the provisions of the original convention, is now being ratified and it has taken three whole years to do this.  I know things move slowly but they should not move that slowly and the parties in the House who were in Government over those years should examine their conscience and ask themselves why it has taken so long for these important measures to be ratified by this Parliament. I hope if we have something of <Col N="355" /> a similar nature in the future that it will not take us so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies for their contributions and for their acceptance.  I want to cover the various points made by the Deputies</P>
      <P>Initially, Deputy Connor referred to the areas to be designated.  In relation to that we propose to designate further wetlands as resources permit.  Most of our major peatland sites which are owned by the State will be designated in due course.  We have 68 nature reserves and have designated 15.  There are about ten other sites which are suitable for designation in the immediate future and it is a matter of ensuring that the sites comply with the criteria laid down in the Ramsar Convention.  We do not think it wise to designate sites unless we own them and have given them statutory protection under the Wildlife Act.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to management. I want to stress that the nature reserves are managed by the staff of the Wildlife Service in accordance with an agreed management plan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the Shannon Callows.  This is a large area in private ownership and we do not designate unless we own the site and can give the statutory protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could implement the environmentally sensitive areas scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important wetland site and may be included in areas designated as environmentally suitable under Directive 1760 of 1987 which is being administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Howlin and John Browne referred to the Raven in Wexford which is one of the 15 sites which has been designated.  This beach has been fenced off by the local landowner, Lee Strand Co-op, from whom we bought additional land lately.  The Minister has sought an <Col N="356" /> injunction against Lee Strand and has been granted a temporary injunction and this matter will be settled in the courts.</P>
    <P>We are at present in the process of preparing regulations in respect of the Raven Nature Reserve and have run into problems with the local users who will be fully consulted in the matter.  Part of the reserve is a public beach.  Therefore, we must take full note of public usage and this will most certainly be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the Wexford Harbour Wild Fowlers Association and to the Greenland white fronted geese in County Wexford.  The number of birds allowed to be killed was 450.  This number was not specified in the Open Season Order.  It is not possible to do so under the Wildlife Act, but the number has been agreed and accepted on a voluntary basis by the shooting syndicates and Wexford Harbour Wild Fowlers Association who have agreed to this.  The open season for Greenland white fronted geese in County Wexford was from 1 April 1989 to 1 January 1990 inclusive.</P>
    <P>While hunting of the Greenland white fronted geese was allowed throughout County Wexford the main areas were the north and south slobs, Waterford Harbour and Cahore.  The allocation of geese was 300 out of the 450 to the north slobs indicating that these syndicates have a traditional once a fortnight shoot.  The balance of 150 was allocated between Wexford Harbour Wild Fowlers Association who have a system whereby members phone in bag returns for the previous week and two geese are allocated to each member.  Foreshore permits issued to the general public for County Wexford include a condition that weekly returns of white fronts shot be made to the Wildlife Service.  Policing and monitoring of the goose shooting was carried out by three County Wexford wildlife rangers and members of the research staff who gather valuable information from the shot birds.  The shooting fraternity appreciated the possible consequences of non-adherence to what had <Col N="357" /> been agreed with them and were fully co-operative in complying with our requirements.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been reached with Lee Strand regarding the purchase of additional land but negotiations are proceeding in relation to a leaseback arrangement of the land in question.  It is hoped to finalise the purchase and the leaseback within weeks.</P>
    <P>I hope I have outlined all the points that were raised.  Other matters raised by the Deputy will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Daly. It is obvious that the House agrees that we should designate further areas.  At the expense of repeating myself, let me say that while 15 areas are designated it is hoped to designate a further ten areas in the foreseeable future.  Of course, it is important to remember that these areas cannot be designated under the Ramsar Convention unless they comply with the criteria.  However, I said in relation to other sites which could be designated as environmentally sensitive, that this can be done under Directive 1760 of 1987 which is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their co-operation and assure them that the Department and the Minister will do everything possible to have further areas designated, and will look at other areas that have been suggested.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said on this Industrial Relations Bill already and I do not propose to delay the House too long.  The ranging discussion on this Bill demonstrates the tremendous interest on <Col N="358" /> all sides of the House in this new industrial relations legislation.  When one realises that we go back 84 years to find the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, it is not surprising that it should invoke discussion.</P>
      <P>We must all accept that over the years there were calls from the public for new legislation dealing with strikes and picketing. Criticisms arose mainly because of lightning or sudden strikes.  While much emphasis is placed on this proposed legislation in relation to a strike ballot, I advise the House that strike ballots have been a feature of industrial relations and trade union regulations since the 1906 Act.  While it was true that many sudden and lightning strikes happened for which no mandate had been secured from the members involved, statistics will show that such strikes scarcely ever arose because of wage or working conditions. More often, indeed very frequently, factors relating to discipline, sudden dismissals, sudden changes in work rules and decisions taken very suddenly and generally without prior discussion, were the cause.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the aspirations of this new legislation which aims to curb that type of sudden and what has often been described as irresponsible strikes which bring confusion and hardship to the ordinary citizens who are not involved, there are two sides to the equation.  A strike to be valid must be the result of a majority decision by secret ballot conducted within the rules of the union.  At the same time something else is required, the employers must demonstrate a greater sense of responsibility and of greater sensitivity to the impact on workers of sudden dismissals and sudden changes of working conditions without prior discussion.  We cannot hope to achieve in this legislation the total elimination of these unsavoury disputes purely through the secret ballot unless the employer demonstrates a degree of responsibility in certain instances to avoid situations that can spark off damaging and in many instances unnecessary disputes causing hardship to the community and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The proposal to seriously restrict secondary picketing will raise many questions. The provision in the legislation that in the main secondary picketing is illegal may give an employer the idea of transferring under another name to another premises and, under the other name, carrying on his business which he is debarred from doing by the picket.  That will give rise to very serious doubts in the minds of workers and could destroy some of the confidence that would be built up under proper legislation in regard to picketing.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has taken steps to discourage the formation of new unions.  We have the unenviable reputation of a proliferation of trade unions due to easy approval by the Department to groups, small groups, and very frequently fragmented groups, who sought to set up a new organisation, often in direct conflict with their former colleagues. Many of the disputes and much of the conflict and uneasiness in working class areas and on the factory floor arose from a fragmented internal trade union representation.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the reunification of the ITGWU and the FWUI.  This is a source of great strength and confidence for the future of the trade union movement and their capacity to give the highest level of service.  I hope that the new aspirations regarding the level of service to trade unions will be related to research into education because that is what is required to meet competition from the EC and elsewhere.  A responsible, integrated and united trade union movement is one of the greatest advantages that workers can have in ensuring that their future wages, conditions and other aspects of their working lives are kept abreast of the general trends throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the commission, the aim of which will be to ensure that conflict and unrest in the industrial area are kept to a minimum.  It is difficult to envisage the damage done by disputes to industrial relations in existing industrial and commercial structures <Col N="360" /> and it also affects our image in relation to foreign investment coming to this country.  The unification of the trade union movement and the proposals here &mdash; with some exceptions on which I will comment later &mdash; will add to that image. In regard to industrial relations and outside investment, the trade union movement is kept too far away from the early negotiations involved in the setting up of foreign capital here.  It would be much more advisable to have a total involvement right from the start of the trade union movement which will at any rate, immediately after a decision has been made by a foreign investment company, become involved.  They should be totally involved from the start which would guard against future misgivings or uncertainties in relation to the conditions set out for employment within the industry.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 11 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of doubt any action taken by an employer in the health services to maintain life preserving services during a strike or other industrial action shall not constitute action calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action for the purposes of subsection (2). </P>
    <P>I am not worried about problems which may arise for the trade union concerned, my worry is that the section will damage the position of the persons about whom the Minister is concerned.  I speak with some experience in this field and I can categorically say that over the years when it was felt necessary and justified to take industrial action relating to a section of the health services, the point of paramount importance to those going on strike was the safety and security of their charges.  Fortunately, such people have rarely resorted to strike action but when they did, without pay or reward, their sense of responsibility to their profession or service generally dictated that no hardship was caused.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to point to one instance but my concern is that when a group of health workers, through their trade unions, regrettably feel they have <Col N="361" /> to take strike action and sit down to discuss the situation arising from their duty to care for those towards whom they have a responsibility, they could point to section 11 (3) which clearly outlines that the employer can take any action he thinks necessary.  I am worried that the workers concerned could say that the responsibility was taken from them by legislation and passed to the employer and that, therefore, they do not have continued responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>The second worry is that an employer protected by that statutory legislative authority and power could well say in negotiations that he was less worried about the impact of a dispute because he had legislative power on his side and that he could staff any institution, hospital or service.  Staffing a health serice is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job during a period of dispute, it is a complex and responsible matter.  It means staffing an institution for 24 hours every day, seven days every week and 52 weeks every year.  One would have to be part of the internal structures to realise the difficulties involved for people being brought in suddenly instead of relying on the traditional responsibility and humanity of the people who are disposed to take strike action in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Before this legislation is passed I hope that the new commission &mdash; in which I have tremendous confidence &mdash; will be used in the event of a threatened strike to find a basis for continued co-operative services between the staff and their employer.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted for many years that workers in the health service should not take strike action.  It was hinted from many quarters that they should not be allowed do so.  I would like to point out that up to 1946 it was generally accepted among hospital staff that there was a hidden prohibition against strikes, that if you went on strike for a day your pension prospects would be lost.  There was every truth in that.  From the time of the passing of the 1906 Act to the forties that was a major deterrent against strikes in the health services.  The possibility of getting a pension was destroyed.  Amending <Col N="362" /> legislation had to be introduced in the fifties to remedy that position.  If health service workers had not got the right to strike, their condition would be deplorable, and I have evidence of that.  Up to the forties, therefore, there was little or no intimation of strike action because of the responsibility role and the position with regard to pensions.  In 1946 special regulations had to be introduced to provide for better conditions for health service workers because of &mdash; and these were the words that were used at the time &mdash;&ldquo;the deplorably low rate of wages&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Managers and employers during those years did not, under the disciplined conditions of employment, keep wages in line with those enjoyed by workers in a trade union organisation.  Therefore, it was incumbent on these workers to adopt a degree of militancy in order to secure justice.  I say that in order to demonstrate that in some instances where the employer sees that the worker is constrained in relation to taking industrial action he will be less forceful in ensuring that his wages, conditions of employment and so on are kept up to standard.  I have fears that this section will react unfavourably on the services to which the Minister is endeavouring to give greater protection. The section should be either withdrawn or massively amended.  We should ensure that there is a continuation of health services during a strike.  Heretofore this has been very well honoured by the responsible and disciplined nature of the staff who were obliged to take strike action.  The new commission should be given the responsibility of ensuring, during a period of strike in an important service such as the health services, that the necessary machinery is in operation so that there can be co-operation between the people in dispute and the employer rather than endeavouring to legislate.  One of the most difficult things to do is to legislate for industrial relations.  Often ill-timed legislation can make a situation worse rather than improving it.</P>

      <P>This Industrial Relations Bill is to be warmly welcomed.  First, I <Col N="363" /> congratulate the Minister and the social partners involved in bringing the Bill to this stage.  I congratulate the Minister, in particular, for the way he engaged in consultation and did not lose sight of his commitment nor intention to reform existing legislation.  The commitment was given in 1987, with that now recognised successful formula for recovery, the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It was essential in 1987 that Government and social partners worked together in a responsible and constructive manner and it was this forum that brought about much needed change.  This Bill is a product of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the economic changes in this country in recent years and the challenges facing this island in the years ahead, existing legislation &mdash; the Trade Dispute Act, 1906, the Trade Union Act, 1941, and the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 and 1969 &mdash; was somewhat confusing and needed updating and improvement.  On the other hand, the country has experienced a magnificent recovery over the past three years.  The process of recovery has been difficult and indeed carried its own problems.  Recognition has to be given to industrial production during this period which has sustained its best performance ever.  New levels of prosperity reached 10 per cent growth or more in volume, there was a renewed flow of investment and good export performance, with the lowest recorded level of days lost through strike action.  This was achieved with industrial peace.  Noone disagrees with the general feeling that we are in a period of relative industrial calm, with an optimistic picture for the future.  I suppose that begs the question, why change: why not leave things as they are?  However, in a period of industrial relations calm, with an improved economy and good indicators for the future, economic forces will bring a certain sense of realism.  With the partnership of Government and the social partners already in place with the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> is it not the right time to develop industrial <Col N="364" /> relations and introduce appropriate legislation?</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the setting up of a labour relations commission, for the procedures of the commission, for the funding, staffing and, in particular, the industrial relations officers and advisory service which is in line with the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations published in 1981.  They recommended that a new system of industrial relations should operate within a framework.  The labour relations commission will have responsibility for a wide range of functions. Their main aims will be to promote good industrial relations, to prevent disputes and encourage resolutions, including the provision of a conciliation and advisory service and to draw up codes of practice.  This new dimension will prove a valuable service and will definitely help develop industrial co-operation between employer, employee and trade unions.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I do not wish to go into detail on the Bill as we will have that opportunity on Committee Stage. However, section 22 encourages trade unions to enter talks to amalgamate. Whether successful or not, grants will be available.  This will assist in negotiations taking place between unions contemplating joining together.  In the recent past we have seen amalgamation and rationalisation.  This section will encourage further amalgamations or mergers to take place.  I would particularly highlight the section.  Section 14 refers to the provision of a secret ballot before strike action or industrial action takes place. This is a democratic right and is a very important part of the Bill before us.  It will remove any interference of peer or colleague pressure from an individual and will allow people to make their own decisions in a proper democratic manner.</P>
    <P>Section 11 contains a welcome provision to restrict picketing to the place where the employer works or carries on business.  It puts in place an orderly control on picketing.  In regard to the secondary picketing provision in section 11 (2), we could probably go a little further. It is recognised in many other countries that secondary picketing is unlawful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> However, as I have said, we can look forward to a further debate on this section on Committee Stage.  In section 11 (3) the Minister makes provision, in the case of actions taken by an employer in the health services &mdash; the previous speaker referred to same &mdash; to maintain life-preserving services during a strike or industrial action and I appreciate the Minister's concerns.  I believe there are other essential services where this could be developed further, for instance, water supply, sanitary services, gas, electricity and other such services which are still related to the delivery of health services, especially when we see the development of health services in primary and community care in the community.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to clarify this later on.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on too long.  As I said, I hope to participate on Committee Stage but I do not want today to pass without participating in the Bill because I believe it is very important legislation. This legislation puts the structures in place and updates the 1906 Act.  I believe that this Bill will greatly assist the development of industrial peace, as we have seen over the past three years.  The consensus and partnership of Government and the social partners, the compromises made, the commitment to reform and putting in place a framework for industrial relations are of national importance and will help the continued success of our economy.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank all the Deputies for contributing to this Second Stage debate. I also wish to thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who have been in the Chair for long periods of the debate.  We have had some four weeks of debate with some full days and some fairly long evenings. The Whips Office tell me that as Second Stages go, we have had probably more speakers on the Bill than on the Finance Bill, which says something about the importance of the Bill.  That is no more than I expected when we launched this <Col N="366" /> Bill in the first few days of December last.  The Bill has been published four months and we have had discussions, letters from trade unionists and employers in their individual capacity and representing their organisations, which shows the interest there is in industrial relations.</P>
      <P>Industrial relations are not the most written about subject, except by the practitioners, but it affects people's lives in a great way.  We talk most about industrial relations when there are difficulties, strikes, disruptions and inconveniences, but in recent times we have not had them to the same extent as we have had in some periods.  That is the way it has been since the foundation of the State.  There have always been peaks and valleys in industrial relations but the day-to-day business goes on and people who are involved are always equally busy whether they are union members, union activists, union officials, employers, personnel managers or the various structures of the State that are there to try to handle it.  In a debate on industrial relations we want to commend all those people, the social partners, the employers, the trade unions and the institutions of the State that work in this area, people in the Labour Court, in the conciliation service, in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Rights Commissioners and the trade union officials, the members of FIE, members of the Irish Personnel Management Institute who work at trying to resolve the problems and make life easier for everybody involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank, in particular &mdash; because this legislation has had a long-playing run &mdash; my colleagues in the Department of Labour who have spent about 23 years working on this Bill.  Needless to say in some cases almost the same officials have had to deal with it for that long through all of the Ministers for Labour there have been since the Department was founded.  I think every Minister for Labour has had discussions about discussions and I suppose I am doing the same at the end of Second Stage today. Hopefully with the co-operation of the House, and judging from what people on all sides have said, I think there is a <Col N="367" /> willingness in this House to see finally a Bill on the Statute Book following on the Stages ahead of us.</P>
    <P>In thanking all speakers, and I hope to go through their contributions in some detail, I want to thank in particular the Deputies who did a great deal of work and research, not least, the Opposition spokespersons.  I want to pay a particular tribute to my colleague spokesman for the biggest Opposition party, Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I thank him for his contribution and his support in general and the views that he outlined on the <i>Programme for national Recovery.</i> Needless to say the points that he raised and asked us to look at in detail have been noted and we have already started on that process since he spoke two weeks ago.  I wish to thank Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan of the Labour Party, who outlined his views at some length.  I also wish to thank Deputy Pat Rabbitte, Deputy Pearse Wyse, Deputy Roger Garland, who represented their respective parties, and all other Deputies who contributed.</P>
    <P>There has been support from across the parties but the differences are on the detail of the Bill.  An area of difference mentioned by the speakers this morning was the whole question of picketing.  A number of Deputies have asked me to follow what happened elsewhere and ban secondary picketing altogether.  Other Deputies asked me to look and see where we can minimise what we are doing. Interestingly, nobody asked that we stay where we are and I anticipated that some people would have asked that we leave things as they are, but nobody in the course of the debate actually asked that the position stay as it is.  That satisfies me in so far as I believe that the legislation already there is extremely confusing. Court cases and court action had surpassed events and what was in our legislation, and it was only a matter of time before the courts would have probably amended our laws for us if we were not to move ahead in the life of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Almost all speakers agreed with the proposals to increase the membership of trade unions and to stop the splintering <Col N="368" /> and multiplicity of unions.  One or maybe two speakers disagreed and said &ldquo;small can be beautiful and that we should not do this at all and it may be the wrong way to go&rdquo;.  I cannot agree with that point of view.  If union members pay their fees they more and more demand a service which is not just about wages and conditions but about extra benefits for themselves in areas of insurance, pensions, occupational health, advice on what is happening on the European and world scene.  They want to be kept up to date on what is happening in the Social Affairs Council.  They also want to know what the ETUC are doing, and what the UNICE are doing on a European front. Quite frankly a union comprising 200 or 300 members who are paying £1 a week membership, who are trying to run a premises and employ full-time staff or part-time staff cannot do it and cannot service the union in that regard.  I agree with the theory that small is beautiful but it will not provide a service for the unions. Despite all our efforts to assist unions and the proposals and recommendations made urging rationalisation and amalgamation, we still have 69 trade unions, 20 of which represent fewer than 500 workers.  A handful of trade unions represent about 85 per cent of workers with the remainder representing the other 15 per cent.  I am sure if we were to allow trade union members to speak in this House for a few hours that they would make it clear that what they want to see is this House assisting in bringing down the number of trade unions in the State. However, this is a slow process.  I would not pay too much heed to the fact that during my term of office the number of trade unions has been reduced from a figure of 91 or 92 to 69.  During that time there has been much rationalisation but it remains an extremely slow process.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the Bill has resulted from an exhaustive consultation process with both the Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Bill mirrors and reflects the proposals put to both <Col N="369" /> sides and also contains inputs by the parties which I felt were worthy of acceptance. The Bill is not the ideal from the point of view of either the Federation of Irish Employers or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but when I began this process three years ago I was quite clear that I would not be able to achieve complete consensus and agreement.  On the advice of my advisers I spent some months reading the files in my Department. Having been a member of a trade union since 1969 and being well aware of what happens I knew that my task was not an easy one.  I do not enjoy reading files well into the evening but I must say that I got some pleasure out of reading the files from 1965 onwards, which clearly showed just how difficult it was to obtain consensus.  I soon came to the conclusion that perhaps there should be a Minister with responsibility to come up with proposals on industrial relations as there had been ongoing discussions at the Cabinet table for over 24 years.  The fact is no one could obtain complete agreement.  It had proved impossible to get consensus or to bring a Bill into this House which had the total support of the employers and trade unions.  It was just not possible to do that. It never will be possible to do so, nor has it been possible to do so anywhere else in the democratic world.</P>
    <P>In relation to legislation, and I have introduced four or five Bills in the House, it is normal practice to introduce a Bill first and then discuss amendments. However, this Bill is unusual in that the social partners did not discuss the contents of the Bill but rather the principle has been thrashed out.  It has also been thrashed out by the courts over the past 25 years.  In fact, and all parties in this House must accept responsibility for this, the courts have ended up thrashing out the legislation enacted by this House.  It was most unsatisfactory that the legal profession and the courts had to do the job that we should have been doing.  That is an important point.  We are now able to discuss this matter in a calmer climate because there is industrial peace at present.  It is the parties involved who have ensured this and nobody else.  As Deputy Hillery mentioned, the law is <Col N="370" /> extremely important in that it sets down the framework in which collective bargaining takes place and I am happy that the proposed legislation provides a balanced and effective framework.</P>
    <P>I would now like to comment on some of the issues raised.  As regards the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission, Deputies raised the general issue of its relationship with the Labour Court. Deputy Rabbitte said that he felt the proposal could lead to some confusion and that the Labour Court might be downgraded.  I do not believe Deputy Rabbitte believes that but just in case he does I want to make it absolutely clear that there is no question of downgrading the Labour Court.  In fact the opposite is the objective.  It is my aim to enhance the role of the Labour Court and to turn it once more into a court of last resort as envisaged by Seán Lemass in 1946.  I see the two bodies as entirely separate but complementary to one another in achieving a new approach to industrial relations.  The increased competition which we face in the Single European Market requires that both management and workers devote all their energies to an approach based on co-operation with the objective of maintaining existing jobs and creating new job opportunities.</P>
    <P>As regards liaison between the commission and the court, section 26 (2) requires the commission in passing on a dispute to include in its report information on the issues in dispute, attempts made to resolve the dispute and any other information.  Such a report could be supplemented by a direct presentation verbally to the court, if necessary.  Therefore the advantages of both the court and the commission will remain following the putting in place of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the points made by Deputies about a possible right of initiative by the court itself, similar to the one contained in section 18 of the 1969 Industrial Relations Act.  This is a point which I am prepared to examine further and will give consideration to an appropriate amendment on Committee <Col N="371" /> Stage.  Deputy Mitchell and others made the point that there is benefit to be gained by using that process.  Deputy O'Sullivan also spoke at length on this matter.  As I said, I will be prepared to consider such an amendment as it is our objective to improve the Bill if possible.</P>
    <P>The question of how the functions to be performed by the commission will be carried out was also raised.  What is involved here is that the functions of conciliation and advice will be carried out by specified and designated staff of the agency and the remaining work will be carried out by other staff.  The board of the agency is to be a part time one and I see the role of the board members as a supervisory one.  They will not be involved in the day to day work of the commission.  In response to Deputy Rabbitte who asked how six people will do all the work, the role of the board members will be a supervisory one with the staff of the commission being separate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also raised the question of access by those workers at present covered by conciliation and arbitration machinery to the Labour Court.  I do not have a hard and fast stand on this issue but it is an issue which is not under my direct control.  The same goes for access by staff covered by conciliation and arbitration to rights commissioners.  If there is to be access by such workers to rights commissioners and the Labour Court this is a matter for the parties to the schemes of conciliation and arbitration and if the parties agree on a new approach I will facilitate them.  This can be done in an entirely flexible manner by varying the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised the establishment and operation of the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission.  Our approach to dispute settlement and resolution has been of a fire brigade nature. Interventions up to now have tended to patch up the difficulties knowing well that trouble will erupt again at a future date. This has been the way for generations. We only deal with the difficulties and the companies when there is a dispute.  I do <Col N="372" /> not think I will be expected to give any examples and if I did I am sure I would be accused of singling out a company.</P>
    <P>However, I am sure all Members are aware of the type of companies that in recent decades have been continually on the agenda because of disputes.  There are some files that are never off the desk of the Minister for Labour, irrespective of the party the Minister belongs to. Those files go back and forward and we have the same merry-go-round year after year.  If one looked at the files of 20 years ago one would find that the same companies were involved then.  At that time there was a different Minister involved, different Labour Court officials, different conciliation services, different union members and officials and different personnel officers.  On that basis there must be something wrong with those companies.  We will have to look at that problem not only in the context of fire brigade action.</P>
    <P>I have heard and accept the analogy of putting a patch on a tube knowing that it will not last.  That analogy has been used in this debate by many Members.  There are firms which come to the conciliation service in the Labour Court on a regular basis and it is often clear that the problems are of a permanent and lasting nature which need to be addressed in a more fundamental manner than merely patching up the present immediate difficulty. That is what the Labour Relations Commission, and their advisory service, are all about.</P>
    <P>I see the advisory service as a small group of experienced professional people who will use an approach which will target firms which have continual and recurring problems of an industrial relations nature.  I am referring to those that give the country a bad name and cause all the difficulties for the employees and the establishments concerned.  I see the usefulness of the services in their independence and in their impartiality. I see these advisers arranging industrial relations audits by complementary bodies, such as the Irish Productivity Centre, and I would expect the advisers to use such resources where necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> They will be in a position to give advice to whatever organisation or establishment that seek their help or are in difficulty.</P>
    <P>As regard the resources to be given to the Labour Relations Commission I accept that the body will have to have adequate resources.  It is not the practice to write the budget of an organisation of that kind into the legislation, to mention the number of staff that must be employed or the grade and structure of that staff.  In the course of the debate some Members asked how many clerical officers would be involved.  I should like to assure the House that I accept that the Labour Relations Commission will have to be properly staffed and have adequate resources.  The House will accept that those issues were debated with the Department of Finance before the legislation was passed to the Cabinet, as is appropriate in the preparation of any legislation, and when proposals for this legislation were being put forward, officials of my Department visited the Labour Relations Agency in Northern Ireland and the ACAS in Britain.  We studied their operations in great detail. The Labour Relations Agency were found to be a more relevant model from our point of view.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the welcome which Deputies gave to my proposals on codes of practice and I believe they have an extremely important role to play.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the issue of the Minister reserving power to make codes of practice but I believe it is better if the codes come from the Labour Relations Commission, following consultation with the interests involved.  I say that for two reasons.  First, we will have strong professionals on the commission.  That body will consist of two ministerial appointees, who have to be properly qualified, two representatives from the Federation of Irish Employers and two from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Those organisations see the commission as a very important body and I have no doubt that as time passes they will prove their worth.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court, which has stood the test for 44 years, has always consisted of people who were very able and of a high <Col N="374" /> professional status.  The House will be aware that the Minister does not select the members of the court.  The names of the members of the court are put forward by the social partners and the Minister rubber stamps their recommendation. That system has operated since the inception of the Labour Court and it has worked well.  I do not think the Minister should be telling such professional people how to do their job.  It would be better if they were left on their own.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies prefaced their remarks by saying that they did not want their comments to be taken às being against me.  I did not take the remarks personally but I agree that it is wrong to give any Minister too much power in his own right. Everything should be done in consultation with the social partners rather than giving the Minister power to bypass them.  Industrial relations is a delicate matter and depends on the climate in industrial disputes.  The codes of practice will be a matter for the Labour Relations Commission and in my view that is the best way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the issue of the use of pendulum arbitration in Canada as well as cooling-off periods and Deputy Carey called for an industrial relations model on the lines of that of West Germany. Such suggestions are worthy of examination.  All outside models are worthy of consideration but my view is that we cannot transplant industrial relations systems either in whole or in part from other countries.  To do so would be a recipe for disaster.  We must attempt to create systems and procedures which suit the needs and objectives of our own economy and that is what we are doing in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in the Bill.  We must take into consideration custom and practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan gave me the benefit of his considerable experience this morning and I appreciate his suggestions.  I have also had the benefit of the views of previous Ministers and Opposition spokesmen.  Their views will be given careful consideration.  We must follow on from our own experience and the judgments of experienced people.  In the <Col N="375" /> Irish context we have plenty to go on in regard to industrial relations.  There is not much unploughed ground in the Irish industrial relations field.  Nothing has happened in any other country that has not happened 100 times over in industrial relations terms here.  That may be the reason we have so much written material and publications of one kind or another on industrial relations.</P>
    <P>We received advice from all sides, practitioners, former Ministers, those involved in management, people with experience of boards of companies, personnel managers and the academic point of view from Deputy Hillery.  There is no doubt that we have had a lot of advice from those who have knowledge of industrial disputes.  In fact, we were given the views of those who have been on the picket line, and they were equally important. Members have had sufficient experience of industrial relations to be able to help me put together a Bill that will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>As regards the powers I have taken in section 38 to refer disputes to the commission or the court, I would like to emphasise that this is no more than a formulation of existing arrangements. Section 24 of the 1946 Act has been used for this purpose although it was not drafted with this end in mind.  Section 24 was used because a section such as the new section 38 did not exist.  I have left section 24 on the Statute Book because I believe it could be useful for the purpose for which it was originally intended, which was to enable a report to be prepared on the employment conditions of any particular class of employees.  Section 24 has been used for a different purpose but it is a useful provision.  I am clarifying the matter by inserting section 38 which supplants the old section 24.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to some points that have been made about trade disputes and trade union law.  Again I would emphasise that my proposals here amount to a balanced package after exhaustive consultations with both sides. My proposals are aimed at protecting the rights and interests involved.  I would like <Col N="376" /> to put on the record what has happened from May 1987 &mdash; onwards when, in a seven month period, we were discussing the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> There was much discussion as to what would be contained in an industrial relations Bill.  I have studied the record in detail.  Then, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in November 1987, one of the last items written in at the insistence of both sides of the social partners was a clause stating that we should have discussions and debate on industrial relations.  Those discussions started immediately after Christmas 1987 and continued throughout 1988 with the most senior officials in the Congress of Trade Unions and their affiliated unions. Points of clarification were dealt with as they arose.  There were discussions with trade union officials outside of Congress who wanted to have points clarified, and with trade union officials who were following the debate but wanted to be involved in the detail.  I was at all the conferences, whether IMI or any other. I met with individual trade unions, individual delegations etc.  I note that Deputy Rabbitte is now in the House.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could say that was <i>sub judice</i> and get away from it. Deputy Rabbitte made an excellent speech, though lengthy, it was extremely useful.  It covered many of the points we are taking extremely seriously and are looking at in great detail.  However, the point I would take issue with, though I think the Deputy raised it for some other reason, is his saying that in some way this Bill could have passed the trade union movement without their noticing it.  All I will say to that is that if there was ever a Bill that was discussed as much with the people concerned as this Bill has been I would like to read the files on it.  There were seemingly endless negotiations and discussions by all interests involved.  I might argue some of the other points on Committee Stage but the only one I would argue with in principle is that the Bill could have passed without notice of the entire Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the 69 affiliated trade unions, their general secretaries and their executives.  In addition to the various conferences I addressed during the formation of this Bill, there were two &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programmes on the subject and many discussions.  I cannot accept that anything in the Bill could have passed anyone unnoticed.  If it did, it also got past me but I find that hard to accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt I had to make that point because we have had so much discussion on it.  The question of a positive right to strike was raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, I carefully studied this aspect when I took office in March 1987 and I concluded that the best hope for success was to pursue the immunities line.  I am not saying &mdash; as I think Deputy Rabbitte and other Deputies said &mdash; that perhaps one could argue the other line but to get anywhere we have to take the immunities line.  I have to say that the trade union side were less than enthusiastic about a positive right to strike and I think this resulted in some degree from a fear of the unknown.  The fact that this Bill is <Col N="378" /> now before the House is I think an indication of my decision in 1987 and an indication that what I have put into this Bill are practical and pragmatic proposals.</P>
      <P>While dealing with the issue of a positive right to strike, in all fairness I should pay tribute to the work done by Deputies Kavanagh and Quinn as Ministers for Labour and as my predecessors.  They did an extremely large amount of ground work in the early eighties which was of considerable help to me in framing the present proposals, otherwise I would have had to go through much of that work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the issue of union rationalisation.  Unions need to be well funded and able to cater for the needs of members.  This presupposes a reasonable membership base.  Again, I struck a balance here as we must be careful not to unduly affect workers' rights. This is a question of setting reasonable minimum standards.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wyse felt that the proposals of the Commission on Industrial Relations should be implemented.  Looking at the matter objectively, there could be considerable difficulty in implementing the type of detailed mandatory disputes procedures recommended by the commission. It must also be borne in mind that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were not party to the commission's recommendations.  Merely to include all that was contained in those recommendations would have opened up again the entire debate on the commission's recommendations.  There was some discussion about including far more detail but if all that detail were written into the legislation it could prove to be unhelpful in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised a number of questions on the provisions relating to picketing.  In particular, the Deputy gave the impression that the 1906 Act was being completely repealed.  Of course, that is far from the truth.  The fact is that the 1906 Act is being re-enacted with amendments to give it a presumption of constitutionality, a presumption it does not have as an enactment of the British <Col N="379" /> Parliament.  That we have got the balance right is probably borne out by the fact that I have been criticised on the employers' side for not being more radical in my amendments to the 1906 Act but that goes back to the balance we spoke about earlier.</P>
    <P>On the picketing provisions, I have again struck a balance between the rights and interests of both sides.  This is clearly emphasised by my proposals on secondary picketing.  On the one hand, I could have banned secondary picketing, as has been done in the United Kingdom, but I believe this would totally tilt the balance in favour of employers.  Throughout the debate, and again this morning I have been asked to consider banning secondary picketing but I disagree with that point of view.  It is not one on which I am open to change.  On the other hand, I could have left the unsatisfactory position where the rules covering secondary picketing are laid down in conflicting decisions by the courts, as I mentioned at the outset.  What I did was to take the middle ground and set down what I believed to be a reasonable and constructive approach to secondary picketing, that is, that it should be allowed where a secondary employer directly assists a first employer to frustrate or break a strike.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that the Bill does nothing to deal with picketing at multi-business locations such as shopping centres, ports etc.  That is not the case. The present very broad wording &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; is being changed and I am attempting to ensure that in future picketing will be at the employer's place of business. However, because of the position in relation to private property rights and the need to avoid trespass on private property, there may be circumstances where it will not be possible to picket directly at the employer's premises. Where disputes arise affecting one employer in a shopping centre, an industrial complex or industrial area, it should be possible to secure agreement that the picket be placed on the individual's private business rather than at the entry to <Col N="380" /> the complex which is what causes the difficulty.  It is necessary, however, to provide a saver for situations where this turns out to be neither practical nor possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the saver has the effect of vetoing the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not believe so. If the provision is too tight we can run into the difficulty of taking the whole complex out.  It has been the good practice of trade unions not to try to take out industrial sites.  I cannot think of a recent example where an individual dispute has closed down a complex.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell also referred to the question of inter-union disputes which will no longer be covered by the definition of trade disputes nor enjoy the immunities provided by the legislation.  This development has been welcomed by most Deputies.</P>
      <P>With regard to secret ballots, workers have a democratic right to be consulted before being asked to take industrial action.  This provision is one of the most important in the Bill and practically all Deputies who spoke on the Bill agree with that.  Many speakers have detailed the case for secret balloting as have people on the picket line, personnel officers, trade union officials and so on. Balloting might cause inconvenience and some difficulty but so do disputes.  We are talking here about the democratic right of people to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised the issue of the involvement of non-union members in secret ballots.  Section 14 only applies to trade union members.  The Deputy also raised the possibility of the supervision of secret ballots by officials of the Department or the Labour Relations Commission.  This would be totally out of step with the philosophy of the Bill.  It would not be appropriate for the commission to supervise secret ballots.  I would suggest that in implementing the ballot provisions consideration might be given by the unions to some form of independent supervision.  I thank Deputy <Col N="381" /> Kavanagh for his constructive suggestions but the supervision of balloting is something that should be left to the unions.  If we wrote into the regulations how balloting was to be conducted we would effectively undermine the right of trade unions to carry out ballots.  The Deputy also refereed to the Employer Labour Conference, and of course that can remain.</P>
    <P>With regard to the all-out picket of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, this procedure made a major contribution to industrial relations and the provisions of the Bill are designed to take account of the all-out picketing policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This policy has been effective and deserves support. Deputy Rabbitte outlined the advantages of what happened arising from the maintenance strike in January-February 1969 and the improvements since then.  I agree with the Deputy.  As the Deputy said, this is an issue on which we are anxious not to tilt the balance.  We have had long discussions about the legal and practical issues here but as this is an area which I am anxious to get right I will consider any points or suggestions the Deputy wishes to make.  Naturally enough all the knowledge is not on our side.  We spent considerable time on this issue however and we have tried to get a balance.</P>
    <P>More general issues were raised by other Deputies.  I listened carefully to Deputy Mitchell's views on a further programme for national recovery and I accept that that would be a good thing for the economy but we must not have a further programme for national recovery just for the sake of it.  We cannot have a programme at any price.  The various interests must, as they did on the last occasion, sacrifice the ideal for the possible in the national interest.  Future industrial relations must reject the purely adversarial approach.  This we have tried to do in legislation brought forward in relation to manpower, FÁS, safety at work and so on.  We must reject the narrow concept of collective bargaining. One of the by-products of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was a <Col N="382" /> widening of the concept of collective bargaining. Such bargaining now includes social and economic policy issues in general, employment, taxation, social welfare legisalation, education and so on. That is the modern concept of collective bargaining.  The change at national level must be mirrored in individual firms.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies raised the issue of worker participation and I agree that worker participation should not be regarded just as an ideological issue but as an issue of practical common sense. Employers and workers must together face the competition of the single market. There are detailed arrangements in place in the public sector and further proposals are expected in 1990 from the European Commission.  I have already initiated discussions with FIE and ICTU with regard to progress in the private sector.  The move towards progress is not a matter for legislation but it is something in which I should be involved.  Employers and employees realise more and more that they are in the same boat.  Management realise that they must inform employees about profits, production targets, marketing, major changes anticipated and so on, and workers for their part must take an interest in more than the annual wage round.  If the workers and the employers in individual firms do not consider the real issues, competition in the single market may put them all out of business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes spoke about the Labour Relations Commission and said that we must also have the right climate for success.  The Deputy spoke about part-time workers and their exploitation and acknowledged that they would be dealt with under another Bill which we will work towards introducing later on in the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan said that he would bring forward amendments.  I have covered most of what the Deputy said.  I covered most of Deputy Rabbitte's suggestions and I thank him for his suggestions and proposals which we will examine.  I thank Professor Hillery for his contribution making the point that the law is not an answer to industrial relations, and for his suggestion that we <Col N="383" /> have to try to minimise conflict.  Deputies Durkan and Fergus O'Brien spoke about the necessity to require votes with regard to all disputes and I agree with them. Deputies dealt at length with the workings of the Labour Relations Commission and I have already dealt with those points.  Deputies also spoke about the need for the information for employees and about the conflicts that arose through lack of information.  We need to have discussions on that with both FIE and ICTU to try to come to arrangements on this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pearse Wyse spoke about personnel officers and the training they require for management generally.  A lot of the points he made arise from the management advisory report commissioned by me in 1987.  Deputy Stafford supported the Bill and Deputy Jacob spoke at length on the clarification of injunctions.  Deputies Browne and Cotter referred to their various experience in regard to the different issues.  I thank them for the points they made, particularly those in relation to voting.  Deputy Ferris made some suggestions, which we are examining and also proposed some amendments.  Deputy Gilmore spoke about the all-out picket and the structures in the Bill in regard to the Labour Court. I dealt in some length with the points Deputy Rabbitte raised in regard to the Labour Court and how the structures will not be affected.</P>

      <P>I dealt with the issue of the advisory service and small unions.  Deputy O'Shea referred to the voting position.  Deputy Garland gave us an insight into the difficulties involved.

      <P>Deputies McGrath and Carey spoke about the West German scene and access to court.  I am prepared to look at amendments on the access to court provision. A number of Deputies raised good arguments on this point and I will look at appropriate amendments.  Deputy Higgins spoke about the United States trade union movement.  As I have outlined already, we have to work on our own basis.  Deputy Kavanagh referred to the ballot procedures and the intimidation aspects.  Deputy Seán Barrett spoke about profit-sharing for employers.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan who has been in the House all morning for his overall support for the Bill and the advice he gave.  The Deputy spoke at some length about the provisions in section 11 (3) of the Bill which deal with health services.  This issue was also referred to by other Deputies.  There are existing obligations on health service workers in regard to their duties.  This section only re-emphasises the position for the avoidance of doubt.  The wording of the section is quite specific and refers to the preservation of life.  The Deputy put across one side of the argument very well but there have been instances where life could have been put in danger.  I have discussed this issue at great length with the people involved in the health services. Such cases, where life has been put in danger, have to be looked at.</P>

      <P>I thanked the Deputy for his advice earlier on.  I know Deputy Rabbitte made a similar point on this issue.  I will look carefully at what the Deputies have said.  However, I remain to be convinced by the Deputies because of the horrific examples to the contrary that I know about.  I am not going to be <Col N="385" /> emotive and spell out those instances but I will consider the matter carefully.  I could very easily prove what Deputy Moynihan has said to be wrong by giving example to the contrary but I accept, as he said, that the procedures are normally followed.  It is difficult when legislating to ignore serious breaches.  We are not just arguing a point; we are debating instances where people could die. Between now and Committee Stage I will consider the points made by the Deputies. I have met some of the people involved who have outlined fairly gruesome and unbelievable details about what happened.  I will not ignore what the Deputies have said.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moynihan made that point.  We are not on Committee Stage but I should like to ask the Deputies how we can deal with that on one side and with the trade unionists who ignored what was an unwritten, but a very clear, obligation.  What happens when people walk out the door and leave patients with no emergency care whatsoever? Patients are the most vulnerable people in our society.  I do not think leaving this provision out totally would resolve the problem because some people will ignore the obligation which is there and this may have very serious consequences. Without being over-emotive I do not think I could leave this section out of the Bill.  The instances I referred to happened only recently and these people may do the same again with the result that people may die.  I would feel an ultimate responsibility for those people.</P>

      <P>As regards the essential services, including the health services, which were referred to throughout the debate, as I have said before, I hope codes of practice will be drawn up by the commission to cover minimum levels of pay in strikes.  We have to try to achieve this voluntary approach.</P>
      <P>This Bill aims to provide a better framework for industrial relations in the nineties.  Our approach must be one of consensus, of providing greater information to employees and involving employees more in the working of their enterprises.  All of this pre-supposes a new approach by managers and workers to industrial relations problems.  I hope this Bill will stimulate and aid that change.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and, in particular, the spokespersons for the different parties for the work they put into their Second Stage speeches and for the suggestions they put forward.  I can assure them that I am thoroughly examining every point they made.  This is an important Bill and I want to get it right.  The 1906 and the 1946 Acts are the only pieces of legislation in this area and I am anxious to get things right in this Bill.  I will, therefore, be prepared to consider with an open mind whatever amendments Deputies put forward on Committee Stage.  Subject to the legal and parliamentary advice I get, I will be as accommodating as I possibly can; I will listen carefully and analyse the discussions.</P>
      <P>I want to thank all the speakers who, over the three or four weeks of this debate, have contributed on Second Stage.  I look forward, with the co-operation of the Whips and my Opposition colleagues, to getting on with Committee Stage at an early date.</P>

    <Title>Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Bill, 1989: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should emphasise that what is proposed is an enabling measure simplifying the procedure for promulgating superannuation schemes for teachers.  I can assure the House that there will be no change in the statutory functions of the Minister for Finance, in that all schemes made under the Act as amended will continue to require the consent of that Minister.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that there will be no diminution in control by the Oireachtas since the revised procedures provide that any scheme made under the Act must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the provisions of the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, which provide that before they can come into statutory effect, all superannuation schemes for national and secondary teachers made under that Act must be confirmed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It provides that schemes will now be laid before each House and have immediate statutory effect, unless within 21 days on which either House has sat, a resolution annulling a scheme is passed, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>The Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, empowers the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to prepare superannuation schemes, in relation to any particular class or classes of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The classes of teachers in respect of which superannuation schemes have been prepared and effected under the Act are national teachers and secondary teachers, including teachers in comprehensive schools.  I should mention for the information of the House that <Col N="388" /> vocational teachers are not superannuable under this Act.  Their superannuation terms are governed by schemes made under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980, for which my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has responsibility.</P>
    <P>As matters stand at present under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, each and every superannuation scheme made under that Act, including schemes which amend or revoke previous schemes, must be laid before the Oireachtas and be confirmed by resolution of each House.</P>
    <P>By their nature superannuation schemes are very complex in form.  Since 1929, when the principal scheme for secondary teachers was drawn up, a total of 32 schemes have been made and effected under the Act.  These schemes comprise a principal scheme and 18 amending schemes covering the superannuation provisions of secondary teachers.  The national school teachers' superannuation provisions are contained in a principal scheme, made in 1934, and 12 amending schemes.  Deputies will appreciate that given the large number of schemes involved, any amendment to the teachers' superannuation code is a technically complex matter.</P>
    <P>The last statutory amendments to the national and secondary teachers' superannuation schemes were made in 1972. Since then, the superannuation benefits of teachers have been improved in line with improvements which have taken place in the public service generally. These have been implemented by my Department on an administrative basis, in advance of the making of the necessary statutory schemes.  I can assure the House that all teachers who have retired have been given the benefit of these improvements as they were implemented.</P>
    <P>Work is currently proceeding in my Department on the drafting of the necessary schemes which will have the effect of updating on a statutory basis the superannuation terms of both national and secondary teachers.  Six schemes in all are involved covering the superannuation <Col N="389" /> entitlements of teachers themselves, their spouses and their children.</P>
    <P>The procedures now proposed will simplify the making of these schemes and any future schemes which might be made. The Bill will enable the Minister of the day speedily to give statutory effect to changes in the teachers' superannuation code.  These simplified procedures are in line with those obtaining for public servants generally.  For example, until 1976 the superannuation arrangements for civil servants were contained in various Acts dating from 1834; amendments to the civil service superannuation code were made by amending legislation.  Then in 1976, the statutory basis for the code was changed to enable the Minister for Finance to make schemes, amending the superannuation terms of civil servants, and having these schemes confirmed by the Oireachtas in the simplified manner now proposed for teachers.  Similar statutory provisions were introduced for local authority employees &mdash; including vocational teachers &mdash; under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Defence Forces, the requirement of a positive resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas to confirm their pension schemes was changed in 1975.  In the wider public sector, semi-State bodies for example, the revised procedures are now standard.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of superannuation generally, I have received representations from trade unions representing teachers who are particularly anxious that improved pension provisions would be introduced by way of amendment to the existing superannuation provisions to allow for early retirement by teachers obtaining a pension that would be <i>pro rata</i> to the contributions they made.  This is a very useful and intelligent recommendation from the teaching unions in that such retirements would allow for the recruitment of young teachers.  As we know well, there is a considerable problem of unemployment among well trained young Irish teachers <Col N="390" /> who have recently been educated either in the national school training colleges or in universities, and these young teachers are having to work overseas in education and frequently outside education thereby not putting their talents, their education in the skills involved in teaching to good use here or elsewhere.  That is a great waste.  One way of creating opportunities for employment for such young teachers would be early retirement.</P>
      <P>There is also a worry expressed by many in the teaching profession that because of the low level of recruitment of new young teachers into the profession in the last while, the age profile of the profession is rising.  While it is extremely important in any school to have teachers with lengthy experience in education it is desirable also to have young teachers, to have a mix in the staff room and in the classroom.  Both complement one another.  The danger at the moment is that because of the restrictions on recruitment that have been introduced, for financial reasons that we all understand, and the worsening that has taken place in the pupil-teacher ratio, we see very few opportunities opening up for young teachers.  The result is that it is possibly less easy for the Minister, or any Minister, to introduce innovations in that younger teachers recently out of training college are more likely to be receptive to innovations than people who have reached the stage of their lives where changes are not what they welcome. Unless we have an injection of new blood into the teaching profession to carry out the educational reforms which are necessary if this country is to keep pace with its competitors in the educational world of 1992, the world of free mobility of people and capital throughout Europe, these reforms will be more difficult to make than they ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I am hopeful that the Minister will be able to give an indication that she will improve the prospects for early retirement to allow more young teachers to be recruited.  I acknowledge that there is another way of doing this, <Col N="391" /> and from the point of view of all concerned, it would be a better way, namely, to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  I am sure everybody in this House would ask the Minister to do this as soon as she can and would seek to influence the Government to have that done.  I am anxious that this be done at primary school level where I am aware of classes of 40 or more being taught by one teacher in what is supposed to be a child centred curriculum. In addition there is a reasonable case to be made for the introduction of superannuation provisions to make early retirement more attractive.</P>
    <P>Another matter in the field of superannuation that has been brought to my attention is job sharing in teaching.  I have received representations from a number of teachers who are anxious to share their jobs.  These would probably be married people with family responsibilities who wish to spend more time exercising those responsibilities and would be able to do so if they could share their job with another teacher in a similar situation.  I understand the idea is that if teachers were working half time they would qualify for half the pension entitlement and their contributions would be adjusted <i>pro rata.</i> However, at the moment, I understand that within the superannuation scheme such arrangements are not possible. It would appear on the face of it at least not to involve any additional expenditure to introduce such an improvement. I hope the Minister will be able to deal with that in her reply.  It is related to the subject matter of this Bill which is superannuation.</P>
    <P>In the Teachers Superannuation Act, 1928, the word &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; includes a person who was a secondary teacher on 1 January 1927 and ceased to be such a teacher after that date before the passing of the Act.  It also includes a person who was formerly a teacher and while he was a teacher was appointed to a pensionable post in the Civil Service, etc.  The interesting thing is that that is not a definition of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; at all.  It tells you that &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; includes certain main categories but it does not tell you all of those <Col N="392" /> who are composed in the definition of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo;.  I would like to ask a few questions about this because we should have a definition of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill which we do not have.  For instance, does this include staff who may be recruited as teachers' aides in special schools?  Are they covered by superannuation? It appears they are working in the classroom, they are not qualified teachers in the conventional sense but it has been decided and is well established practice that teachers' aides are allowed to and do play a very useful role in special education.</P>
    <P>If we move, as I think we will and as it is the policy of the Department of Education to move, towards integration of the handicapped into the ordinary classroom, for it to be possible for the class teacher to cope with the additional responsibility of having a child who has a learning disability in the ordinary class, a teacher's aid, as well as the teacher, may have to be appointed in the conventional classroom. I visited a primary school in Harrow, London, in the last few months to look at the way they coped with the integration of a handicapped child in the primary school.  There was a class of around 25 pupils of whom one had a handicap, so in addition to the class teacher there was a special teachers' aide whose responsibility it was to look after the handicapped child but to join in any other activities as well to give some additional help to the teacher.  If we are going to proceed with the integration of the handicapped in the ordinary class system, we are going to see much more of that sort of thing in this country.</P>
    <P>Are such people covered by superannuation or will they need a separate superannuation scheme?  If they are not covered would it not be sensible to use this legislation to insert a definition of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; which would include such people, giving them the right to be covered by a superannuation scheme made under the legislation?  It might not be the same superannuation scheme because a variety of schemes are made under this, not all being the same, but at least it would enable them to be covered <Col N="393" /> for superannuation if they are not already covered for it.  I ask the Minister to refer to that possibility and the possibility of having a definition of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; which encompasses all those who work in the classroom whether in special schools or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Another question I would like to raise concerns the transferability of pension entitlements.  The principal Act makes it clear from the quotation I have already given that it is possible to transfer pension entitlements from the teaching profession into the Civil Service and that is obviously very necessary from the point of view of the recruitment of inspectors from the teaching body.  However, there is no reference in the principal Act to transferability into other parts of the State sector.  As the Minister is aware, an extensive scheme of transferability of pensions rights for semi-State bodies has been evolved and to the best of my knowledge most of the State companies have become members of this transfer scheme. Somebody moving from the ESB to Bord na Móna take their pension rights with them.  I think there are one or two exceptions to this rule.  One or two bodies have not for some reason subscribed to the scheme.  Do the schemes made under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, involve transferability to these schemes in the scheme of transfer I have referred to in the wider public service?  Is it possible for teachers to move to a private company have a pension scheme and to transfer their pension rights into the private scheme?  Can their rights be converted from being rights under a public service scheme into pension rights approved for tax purposes by the Revenue Commissioners in the private sector?</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that because these are private sector schemes the Minister has nothing to do with them.  To qualify for tax relief for pension contributions they have to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners, which means the Minister for Finance has control over what private schemes are recognised and what are not.  If the Minister wished to insert transferability as <Col N="394" /> between the private sector scheme and this scheme, her colleague, the Minister for Finance, has the power to do that.  It is desirable that teachers be able to carry their pension rights into private employment. For example, some teachers, especially commerce teachers, who wish to go out into business to work in a company should be encouraged to do that by pension transferability.  Equally that should apply in the opposite direction, and people who have the relevant qualifications who have been working in pensionable private employment should be encouraged to transfer into teaching. One way of allowing that to happen would be through a scheme of transferability. Does such apply here?</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech, a very truthful speech, reveals quite an appalling situation in terms of the accountability of the Department of Education to the Oireachtas.  The Minister, to her credit, made no effort whatever to gloss over this or to conceal it, and I compliment her for that.  Under the law, as it stands, a superannuation scheme may not be revoked or amended other than by means of an order approved by the Dáil. However, the Minister said that the superannuation scheme for teachers had been extensively revoked and amended during the seventies and eighties and that it had never come before the Dáil.  She admitted &mdash; again to her credit &mdash; that her Department, even for their own purposes, have not drafted the alternative amendments, let alone introduced them in the Dáil.  The Department have been operating a new system of superannuation without statutory authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that, although I was not involved with this matter at any stage.  I was about to say that there were Coalition Governments of different compositions and a single party Government of the Minister's party in office throughout this period so I am not making a party point.  It is highly unsatisfactory that the law should be <Col N="395" /> ignored by a Government Department and that is what happened because these superannuation changes were made by administrative actions in defiance of the law of the land.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that the improvements in superannuation were not eminently desirable and I am not criticising the changes.  However, I am criticising the fact that the Department of Education, under several Ministers, broke the law in introducing amendments to the superannuation scheme without complying with the clear provisions of the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Department of Education had a problem with drafting legislation but it seems they had.  Of all Departments they are more shy of the Dáil and Seanad, in terms of legislative proposals, than any other Department. They are very meticulous in answering parliamentary questions about other functions in relation to the Oireachtas, they provide a very effective form of accountability but, in terms of introducing legislation to statutorily justify, underpin and enable them to do what they are doing, they seem to want to ignore the Oireachtas.  That is not good enough.  Indeed, if anybody were to have challenged the superannuation schemes and taken a court action to, for instance, challenge the deductions made from their salaries to contribute to the superannuation schemes, and if these deductions involved a matter referred to in some of the administrative changes which Ministers made without the sanction of the Oireachtas, I believe that the superannuation scheme would have been struck down as illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regularly in this House we prescribe fines of £10,000 as a penalty for breaking the law and yet we have evidence that a Government Departments have been doing just that.  It is not satisfactory.  I am glad the Minister has brought it into the open and my comments are not a criticism of her because she has revealed it publicly.  However, she has not indicated when she will do anything about it.  Given that the Minister made such a startling <Col N="396" /> admission, she should have been able to state that the relevant new regulations will be introduced by the end of this year &mdash; or at some specific date.  It is not good enough to come in here and say that her Department have been breaking the law and will continue to do so and that she cannot say when it will stop.  I hope that the Minister will be able to go a bit further in response to this debate.</P>
    <P>Specific changes are recommended by the Minister in this legislation allowing her to make amendments to superannuation schemes by means of laying an order before the Dáil which will take immediate effect unless it is annulled rather than having to come in with a specific proposal and having it approved. I have no objection to that beyond one point which I will raise later.  It would be wrong to pretend that the reason superannuation schemes have not been made legal is that the Minister had to get the approval of the Dáil.  The fact is that the Minister admitted they had not even drafted the changes yet so the Dáil is not the obstacle, it is the responsibility of the Department.</P>
    <P>There should be an in-depth investigation as to whether there is proper statutory authority for many of the things that go on in education at present.  I have called in this House on a number of occasions for a comprehensive education Act which would put our educational system on a proper statutory basis.  I acknowledge that it is a mixed system involving publicly provided education and denominationally provided education with public support.  I do not want to change the system in any material way, just to provide a proper statutory basis. Is there statutory authority for not just the superannuation payments to teachers but the payments to teachers themselves? Is there any legislation which enables the Minister to pay the salaries of teachers in private educational institutions?  Is there any law under which she does this?</P>
    <P>I have been inquiring into the position concerning second level education as distinct from vocational education.  There is no such problem in the area of vocational <Col N="397" /> education because the Vocational Education Act, 1930, is comprehensive and provides very full statutory authority for virtually everything that is done.  The relevant seminal legislation for the payment of secondary teachers &mdash; and for secondary education generally &mdash; is the Intermediate Education Act, 1878.  I have gone through the Act carefully and it provides the Minister with authority to operate examinations, to set subjects in examinations and to pay the salaries of civil servants responsible for looking after secondary education.  However, it does not provide statutory authority for the Minister for payment of salaries.</P>
    <P>If such a gap exists &mdash; although I hope the Minister will be able to say that it does not and that my concern is not well founded &mdash; it should be quickly filled because we cannot afford to have our system of education challenged as not having an adequate statutory basis.  I asked the same question on the position in regard to national teachers.  Prior to the 1928 Act there was statutory provision for the operation of a pension scheme for national teachers.  Indeed this dates back to an 1879 Act for improving the position of teachers in national schools which contains extensive provisions in section 3 and other sections for superannuation.  While that legislation provides for superannuation it does not seem to provide for payment.  It provides for residences for teachers but it does not provide for payment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Because you do something subsequently on an assumption that it is legal you cannot infer that it is.  I am not a practicising lawyer, nor do I intend to become one.  At the same time you cannot say in matters of law that if you have superannuation and statutory authority for it that, by reverse logic, you have statutory authority for payment.  I do not think that is the way courts would <Col N="398" /> look at it if it was put to them.  I think they would say you must have statutory authority for the payment and for the superannuation.  There is statutory authority for superannuation and there is statutory authority for payment so far as vocational teachers are concerned but is there statutory authority for payment in regard to national and secondary school teachers?</P>
      <P>National and secondary school teachers are employed in private institutions. They are not employees of the State; they are not civil servants.  The State pays them but they are employed by institutions which have private management. That applies to national schools as well as secondary schools.  To pay the salaries of somebody else's employees is something for which one would require authority.  Obviously you have authority to pay your own employees but in the case of secondary and primary teachers you are talking about paying salaries of people who are not your own employees.</P>
      <P>Of course it is desirable that we should have the present arrangement.  I am a supporter of our present system in that it has a mix of different types of education. I am a supporter of denominational and multi-denominational education.  We need to have options in every area so far as possible.  We should not force people into strait-jackets as happens in the United States.  The system should operate on the basis of a clearly established statutory authority.  I ask the Minister to answer my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to raise one technical question with the Minister.  A new subsection (5) is being inserted in the Principal Act, under section 2 of the present Bill.  It says that a superannuation scheme may be revoked or amended by a subsequent superannuation scheme made in the like manner as the original scheme.  The existing superannuation schemes have all been made under the Act of 1928 and the provision &ldquo;in the like manner&rdquo; in that case is an affirmative motion in the Dáil. It would appear that the meaning of the new subsection (5) is that in the case of any amendment or revocation of an existing scheme made prior to today, <Col N="399" /> under the 1928 Act the existing procedure, that is an affirmative motion in the House, would apply.  My understanding is that that is precisely what the Minister wants to avoid.  She is seeking to have a situation where it will be possible to make amendments and revocations by order &mdash; the passive rather than the affirmative form of order making &mdash; but it would appear that the new subsection (5) does not achieve that objective, if I am reading it correctly, because it refers to schemes made in the like manner as the original scheme.</P>
    <P>If that is the case and the Minister wants to ensure that any future amendments can be made by the 21 day order procedure, as soon as this legislation is passed she will have to introduce a complete new set of superannuation schemes under this legislation.  I do not think that is what she intends.  Certainly if her Department have been unable to produce amendments in a form that is satisfactory for changes that have been made as far back as 1972, she will hardly want to introduce a whole new set of superannuation schemes simply to be able to avail of the provisions of this Bill from the point of view of subsequent amendments. That is a technical query.  If my assumptions about this matter are valid we may be wasting our time with this legislation because we will not achieve what we are seeking.  Apart from raising these queries, I have no objection in principle to this legislation but I would like to hear the Minister's answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I became spokes-person on Education, this is the first legislation that has been introduced in the education area.  I would have preferred to see a longer Bill but having read the Bill and checked with the teachers' unions, I have no problem with it.  It seeks to bring the procedures for teachers' pensions into conformity with the Civil Service Superannuation Act and, as I said, I have no problem supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton dealt with some of the points I had intended raising and I will not waste the time of the House going <Col N="400" /> over them.  The Minister will be responding to the points made by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>There is one area regarding pensions on which I would like to lay particular stress.  One of the Labour Party Deputies put down a Dáil question recently on the provision of a pension scheme for school caretakers.  I understand that the maximum number of school caretakers was 350 but the number is now down to 250.  I also understand that school clerk typists have a pension scheme and therefore it is grossly unfair that school caretakers who carry out very important work in our schools and receive salaries from the Department of Education should be excluded from a pension scheme.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that and see whether it is possible to introduce a provision in that regard in a Bill like this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton dealt with the definition of teacher and said it is not altogether clear.  He also dealt with the transfer of pensions.  This is an area that will become more important as time passes.  The practice where a person spends a lifetime in a particular career is diminishing to a large extent.  My generation were a lot more concerned about the permanent pensionable job than the present generation seems to be.  There are reasons for that.  In my day if you got a good leaving certificate it virtually guaranteed you a job that is not the case now.</P>
    <P>As a national teacher who has been on leave of absence since 1987 when I was elected to the Seanad, I believe a break from teaching gives one a better perspective. If one is at the coalface all the time there is a tendency not to see a lot of significant points because of the pressure of the day to day teaching in the classroom.  If teachers could spent time in industry, for example &mdash; this is something to which Deputy Bruton alluded &mdash; it would be a help to them.  People who went through secondary school, teacher training and directly into the school environment would be helped by exposure &mdash; for the want of a better word &mdash; to what happens in industrial concerns, commercial life and so on.  That is very important. We should be flexible and provide for <Col N="401" /> people to do this.  Leave of absence is available, but that does not carry pension rights during the time people are away from teaching.</P>
    <P>Another area that needs looking at in the general context, and which relates to pensions more or less in the same way as to school caretakers or clerk typists, is the situation in national schools where teachers have responsibility for providing supervision for the children during the lunch hour break.  This has the effect of keeping teachers on the job during the lunch hour.  I believe it is good to get a break from the school environment at some stage during the day.  It is to the benefit of everybody when that happens. It relieves people from the pressure of being in-house if they can go away and have a meal in a relaxed atmosphere. They will be all the better for it.  The Minister should look at the possibility of providing extra staff in this area.  Again, there would be pension implications for these ancilliary staff.  Deputy Bruton dealt at great length with this and I do not intend going over the same ground again.</P>
    <P>However, with regard to pensions, I believe that teaching has become a much more stressful occupation.  I found in the later years of my teaching career that I was more physically and mentally tired in the evenings when I had finished work. This has a great deal to do with a subject which I have raised with the Minister on a number of occasions: the question of school discipline.  Corporal punishment has been abolished.  It has gone and it will never come back, but the fact that no effective sanction has been put in its place has had a detrimental effect on discipline in schools.  I am not underestimating the difficulty of coming up with a workable code of discipline which allows teachers to come to grips with what is a deteriorating situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important area.  With the growing number of emotionally disturbed children in our schools, which is creating a much more stressful atmosphere, job satisfaction and morale among teachers is much lower now than it was during my teaching lifetime, which goes back over 20 years.  The idea of reducing the eligibility limits for full gratuity and pension among teachers is something we need to look at because of this stressful environment.  However, in terms of getting the service right in general I believe school welfare officers are vitally important for the pupils who are causing stressful situations for the teacher in the classrooms and, more importantly, preventing effective and efficient teaching going ahead.  Whatever legislation follows this Bill should be brought in in the context of providing a pension scheme for ancillary staff.</P>
      <P>The areas dealt with by Deputy Bruton regarding an education Act and the legalities of a lot of what has happened since the founding of the State regarding the statutory basis for circular letters and other communications from the Department needs looking at and I ask the Minister to refer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, and staying to the subject, I have no problem with the Bill before us.  It is an enabling Bill which will move us into an area where we have <Col N="403" /> further developments in the pensions scheme.</P>

      <P>I found Deputy Bruton's remarks very interesting.  Although he is not a lawyer and none of us is, thanks be to God &mdash; we have had enough of them on various other Bills &mdash; he honed in on a point that is quite touchy.  The Minister said in her statement that the Department have been proceeding daily for 18 years totally ignoring the Acts which exist.  There are not that many education Acts in existence but whatever exists has been totally ignored for 18 years, since 1972.</P>

      <P>That is very good, Minister.  It is worrying when a matter such as this is raised as Deputy Bruton has raised it.  Whether there is a statutory basis for the payment of teachers is something that never struck me before, but it raises the whole question of an education Act and the need for clear statutory lines for what we are doing as well as a clear philosophy of education, which we do not have.  We have one education Act, as <Col N="404" /> Deputy Bruton pointed out, the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  This is absolutely excellent legislation and is still absolutely flexible and bang up-to-date.</P>

      <P>The good old days, as they say.  This is an excellent Act which is still not outdated.  The problem seems to me that this Act is being phased out by the Department or by the Minister. Chief executives officers are not being reappointed and there is a whole stack of vacancies and in a series of ways they are being run down.  There was a policy to amalgamate some VECs but that seems to have been dropped and there is now no policy; it is just a matter of drifting along more or less ignoring them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that we introduce some legislation which the Department will adhere to as the way in which they have been ignoring us is a negation of democracy.  This phraseology is now used in every Bill.  Since I first came into this house, when this negative phraseology has appeared in legislation I have put down amendments seeking to change it.  I have argued that if a Minister wants to change something they should lay the regulations before the House when we would have an opportunity to say whether we agree with them or want to throw them out.  The practice is that if no one introduces a resolution seeking to annul them within 21 sitting days they are passed.  As I understand it, a resolution seeking to annul regulations has to be introduced in Private Members' time.  We have not yet had an opportunity to avail of Private members' time.  Therefore I <Col N="405" /> have had no opportunity since last October to bring in a resolution seeking to annul regulations.  Other Deputies in the House who may wish to bring in such a resolution find themselves in the same position.  I would be quite happy if the Bill stated such a resolution may be brought in in Government time, but as the Bill stands it is a negation of democracy in that Deputies are not allowed to exercise their right to bring in a resolution seeking to annul regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of tantalising the Minister, whatever about encouraging her.  I encourage her to make it easier for Deputies to bring in such resolutions.  Because of the difficulty individual Deputies face, I have, as I said, attempted on other legislation to introduce wording similar to that used in the 1928 legislation which is more democratic. At that time if a Minister wanted to change something by way of regulation they had to lay those regulations before the House.  However, they need not now come before the House.  I hate to see this stipulation being removed from legislation as I believe it should be inserted in all legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where does the difficulty lie?  It is a very simple matter to have them dealt <Col N="406" /> with on the Order of Business when they can be dealt with in one or two minutes. If a Deputy wishes to oppose the regulations they can outline their reasons for opposing them.  I do not see any difficulty about inserting a provision stipulating that no superannuation scheme should come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by a resolution of each House.  This is done regularly in the House and it does not take any more than one minute or two.</P>
    <P>I am just wondering whether someone went through all the legislation to see if this positive clause is contained in any other legislation and is making an attempt to have it removed from all legislation to ensure that the other negative procedure is adopted which is, as I said, much more undemocratic.  Therefore I wish to oppose this change, as I do not think it is necessary.  Since 1972 the Department have ignored the Oireachtas and they consider that the best way to keep ignoring it is to carry on regardless unless someone wakes up and goes to the trouble of seeking the support of other Deputies for a resolution seeking to annul regulations.  That is most unlikely to happen in respect of these regulations but it is quite possible that it will happen in respect of regulations made under other legislation.</P>
    <P>In some cases the regulations made under legislation are even more important than the legislation itself.  Such regulations control the way in which people act and have to be adhered to.  We are gradually reaching the stage where we will be governed by regulations which, if not adhered to, could result in the imposition of fines or terms of imprisonment, yet these regulations can be brought into being without ever having to be passed by this House.  If individual Deputies or the smaller groups wish to change them they have to go through this difficult procedure.  Therefore I object to the change proposed in the Bill for the simple reason that it is a less democratic procedure than the existing one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to find that <Col N="407" /> the Act governing teachers' superannuation and pensions goes as far back as 1928.  I note that the Minister in her speech pointed out that a total of 32 schemes have been effected since that time and that there have been 18 amending schemes.  It is hard to believe that so many changes could have taken place. Perhaps what is needed is a new Bill similar to the one introduced in respect of vocational teachers back in 1980.</P>
      <P>I want to dwell on two specific points. First, in relation to the retirement age, under the present Act a national teacher can retire at the age of 55 on full pension, whereas a secondary school teacher cannot retire on full pension until they reach the age of 60.  It is an obvious anomaly and I do not know why it exists. Primary teachers can retire on full pension at 55 years of age while secondary teachers cannot retire a full pension until they reach 60 years of age.  That is crazy. The least the Minister might do is to introduce an amendment to correct that anomoly.  In fact, the Minister should go a lot further and take into consideration the stress and strain teachers must endure in classrooms.</P>
      <P>We have a new ball game since the age limits were introduced in the regulations in 1928.  A high percentage of teachers, primary, vocational and secondary, suffer severe mental stress because of present day demands.  They are working in a different type of society.  Some allowance should be made for teachers to enable them retire at an earlier age.  I understand that in the public service those with onerous jobs, such as personnel in the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps, have an option to retire as early as 40 years of age.  Members of the Garda Síochána have the option to retire as early as 50 years of age but a secondary teacher must have 40 years' service in a classroom and be 60 years of age before being entitled to a pension.  That is ridiculous and the Minister should do something to rectify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago when the voluntary retirement scheme was introduced there was an avalanche of applications from <Col N="408" /> teachers in the three sectors, primary, secondary and vocational, and while many teachers in the primary sector were allowed to avail of the scheme only a handful, if any, of secondary teachers were allowed to avail of early retirement &mdash; I understand that only one or two secondary teachers were allowed to avail of that scheme.  I should like the Minister to give us details of the scheme.  That speaks for itself because those who were opting for early retirement would be taking a sum that would be a lot less than they would have received if they had remained in service until they were 60 years of age and had 40 years' service. They were prepared to suffer a financial loss because of the pressure that they and their families were being subjected to. Teachers in their droves opted for that scheme.</P>
    <P>All Members recognise that teachers are subjected to great pressures.  The pace of life has speeded up and contributory factors such as the elimination of corporal punishment have added to the problems that have to be faced by teachers.</P>

      <P>I was expecting a little poetic licence from the Chair but I will not dwell unduly on the issue.  I am anxious to make the point that the stress and strain in the classroom has increased considerably.  The regulations determining superannuation and retirement should be changed accordingly.  They should not be left as they were framed in <Col N="409" /> 1928.  That is a clear message and an understandable request.  Those who are subjected to exceptional strain should be given special consideration.  I am a secondary teacher and virtually all Members in the Chamber are teachers, with the exception of Deputy John Bruton.</P>

      <P>We recognise the difficulties involved.  We have seen the pressures increase in our time as teachers. The teachers' job has become immeasurably more difficult in recent years and we should do something to introduce some sanity in regard to superannuation and retirement for them.  The clamour for voluntary redundancy speaks for itself.  There should be an option to retire at an early age without teachers having to retire for health reasons.  Any doctor will give a teacher a certificate to the effect that they should retire on health grounds.  Teachers can make a case for mental strain and being overburdened.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to raise concerns teachers' entitlement to pension rights for service abroad.  I do not know if that is covered in the amendment referred to by the Minister but I doubt it.  Three months ago when I tabled a parliamentary question concerning that issue I was told that such service would not be recognised.  A teacher with service in what is known as an underdeveloped country, such as the African countries, Nigeria and so on, will have that service recognised for pension purposes. However, a teacher with service in Britain, or West European countries, will not have that service recognised for pension purposes.  That is discrimination.  It appears that we are out of touch.  It is my view that we are in breach of EC Regulations in regard to that.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to be able to accommodate my colleague who has made the speech I intended making.  That is another bit of ciall ceannaithe I have learned &mdash; that it is not wise to allow another Member in before you.  I feel like Oisin i ndiaidh na Féinne.  I have 32 years' teaching experience and I am glad to be able to report that I am not a burnt out teacher, a phrase that is quite common today.  It appears that there are many burnt out teachers.  However, if political fate so decides that I will have to go back to the classroom, I do not think I will have any major psychological or other upsets.  I would still enjoy the challenge of teaching.  There are many people who do not enjoy that challenge.</P>
      <P>Those of us who entered the teaching profession 30 years ago faced a completely different set up.  There were lines of desks in the classrooms and I should like to tell the Minister that, despite all the changes, I managed to keep lines of desks in my room.  Some teachers could not adjust to the child centred curriculum with children talking and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was very difficult to adapt to that change.  I have patience but I found it difficult to adjust to the noise in the classroom. While there is noise in the classroom it is hard to think that people are working and it is doubtful if the same <Col N="411" /> amount of work is taking place.  I can accept readily that I am obviously causing discord.  I accept that children can enjoy learning at their own pace and trickacting around the place but I do not know whether it is a great idea.  I will not go into detail in case the Leas-Cheann Comhairle tells me I am rambling.  It all leads to a complete change of scene.  The whole concept of discipline has changed. Thirty years ago if I told somebody to sit down I was assured of obedience.  I have to admit &mdash; and this is probably why I am not burned out &mdash; that I was teaching in a lovely paradise called Bennekerry in Carlow.  I can assure the Minister that this is a very good school.  In case my deputy here would get any leeway with the Minister about the legality of paying salaries, for goodness sake he has not a hope of getting back the salary he got for the past 30 years; if there is anything wrong with it please ignore him.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: While I was sitting here starving I decided that the following qualities would be invaluable to a person standing in front of a class at present.  He would want to have the bravery of a lion tamer, the skills of a psychologist, the stamina of a marathon runner, the appeal of &ldquo;Zig and Zag&rdquo;, the patience of Job and the skills to teach.  Anyone who possesses all those qualities would be well qualified to go in. Times are changing, it is a difficult and tough time.  We are discussing superannuation but it is of no benefit if one does not continue teaching until retirement age.  Many teachers are genuinely burned out, they cannot cope at present, they do not want to retire on disability as they may not qualify for superannuation and they would like to opt out.  It is unfair <Col N="412" /> to them and above all &mdash; and this is probably more important &mdash; it is unfair to the pupils they are teaching.  Children get a chance of going to school once and they get a chance of doing an extra year at second level and if they have a teacher who cannot cope &mdash; as there are people in other professions who cannot cope &mdash; who is highly strung, has lost interest and feels that the children nowadays are no longer the type of children he set out to teach he should be given the option to resign.  I know that money is involved and I can accept that no matter where the Minister's heart is, her purse strings are tied.  It is so serious that it is beyond the question of the personal interest that teachers may have in early retirement.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have children and who walk around can realise that there are certain teachers who have gone beyond their endurance and if they could they would opt out.  That is something the Minister should seriously consider, not only for the sake of the teachers but for the sake of the children.  That would mean that we would readily agree to the scheme being introduced by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not want to talk about large classes, etc.  As Deputy O'Shea said if one is innocent enough to walk into the House on a topic that deals with education in a broad sense, one could be here for a number of weeks because we are all experts.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the effect that teaching has on many of the older teachers who entered in a different era and who would like to continue teaching as they were, but times have changed and they find they are not able for it.  As a result, children under their care are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  That is my one request and one message to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Before I reply to the various points which were raised I wish to set out again the context of the legislation and emphasise again what I said in the opening sentence.  This is an enabling measure, simplifying the procedure for promulgating superannuation schemes for teachers.  Put against that context the <Col N="413" /> Bill before us is, of course, a relatively easy matter.  It did evoke, as does any education measure or announcement of any kind or even a whisper, a very lively debate.  That is to the credit of the House and it is clear evidence of the standing of education within the country that the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; is enough to set off frissons throughout the system and so it has been here in the House.  With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I know I will be straying beyond my brief too in answering the points which were raised so I preface my comments by saying with your permission I propose to answer some of the points which were raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá cead agam.  Go raibh maith agat.  The Deputy Leader of Fine Gael and spokesman on education, Deputy Bruton, pointed out that there should be an early retirement scheme which would be commensurate with the contributions and bearing in mind the desirable mix of teachers of age profiles within schools, both experience and youth and vigour together, it made for the ideal staff profile within a school.  He spoke of the difficulties of qualified young teachers obtaining positions.  In that context I will be returning to the whole question of early retirement, which ran through all the contributions, but I would like to point out that this autumn there will be 250 new jobs in primary schools and more in post-primary schools in accordance with the arrangements made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the vote last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the issue of job-sharing.  This is a question that has been talked about very much in schools. It is a question that comes up frequently. While it is easy to visualise how it could be done in some schools, with subject teachers in a second level school I do not know if it would increase the serenity of the students to have a teacher changing and there would be time tabling difficulties. It is a point that has been put to <Col N="414" /> me and it is one with which I would have a measure of sympathy.  The Deputy asked if a superannuation scheme could be tailored, because it should not have any financial implications, to the needs of job-sharing.  That is something that could be looked at.  The Deputy referred to the definition of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; and also referred to teachers' helpers in classrooms, or various such appellations, particularly in the integration of handicapped pupils of varying degrees into the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; classroom.  As the Deputy is aware, that has been one of the ongoing tenets of education and one in which we in this country have been to the forefront. During the six months Presidency of the Education Ministers one of the resolutions which we hope to pass with the European Commission is the strengthening of the integration of handicapped pupils into classrooms.  For the purposes of this Bill, teachers are defined under the regulations but it is something that will come up as developments occur in education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is strictly for the definition as laid out under the 1928 Act when such desirable innovations had not taken place.  The Deputy asked about the transferability of pension entitlements, as exists in the Civil Service and in semi-State and private industry. This scheme is confined to an enabling measure.  One way or another, Minister for Finance approval would have to be obtained for such a desirable initiative. The Deputy referred to the long delay and the fact that the position has been highly unsatisfactory since 1972.  It would be wrong of me to dwell on that matter in any greater detail.  The Deputy has made his statement and in my speech I have made my statement in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> The Deputy referred to the question of drafting legislation and why the Department are so shy and modest in the legislative arena and he said that it would have been open to anyone to have taken court action to challenge any of the various changes in the superannuation scheme.  The point I am making, which is not a point of principle, is that all the changes were improvements.  The Deputy referred to the introduction of an education Act.  The primary review board are considering that.  I, too, have been giving some thought to that.  Under that heading the Deputy asked if we had the right to pay teachers.  I am sure Deputy Browne, Deputy O'Shea and I agree that not alone have we the right to pay teachers, but that we should pay them more. The Intermediate Education Act, 1878 and the National School Teachers Act, 1879 will be considered in my consideration of an education Act in the broadest sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to section 2 (5) and I do not accept the interpretation that the Deputy puts on the words.  It is a technical matter and perhaps it is a drafting matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> Deputy O'Shea spoke about the need for broader education Bills and that will come into the general debate on the need for an education Act.  The Deputy also referred to the need for a pension scheme for school caretakers.  That is not embraced by this Bill.  The Deputy also referred to transfers and I dealt with that in dealing with Deputy Bruton's point.  I accept that it is a good thing for teachers to have a break from the classroom and to plunge themselves, not necessarily into leisure, but into different types of work. Exposure to other professions and the option of mixing with other types of people can give a teacher a different perspective on his work and a teacher will be refreshed going back into the classroom to the benefit of both the teacher and the pupils.  As a result of such break, teachers often change long held notions. The Deputy also referred to the supervision of the school playground and the fact that teaching is now more stressful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred also to the need for a school discipline code and his party have put down a motion to be taken in Private Members' time with regard to school discipline.  At the moment I am in consultation with parents, teachers and management on this issue.  There are diverging views between parents, teachers and management on the issue of school discipline and we are seeking concensus in this area.  School discipline is a difficult matter because we must have regard to the varying needs of children and the different personalities of teachers in varying environments and so on.  A code of discipline depends to a large extent for its success on the interaction between child and teacher.  At the moment we are trying to reconcile different points of view on it.  Deputy Bruton also referred to the need for school welfare officers and that issue is also included in the Private Members' motion, so in time we will come to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla worried about 18 years of non-implementation and praised the VEC Act of 1930 as being very flexible and a good education measure and suggested that its powers were being eroded.  I assure him that they are not. <Col N="417" /> The Deputy said that they opposed this Bill because of the lack of time which he and other members of his party were given to raise the matters in relation to this in Private Members' time.  That is a broader issue.  The Deputy stated his objection not in the particular, but in the general sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy suggested that there should be an early retirement scheme for teachers and said that it would be of enormous benefit not alone to the teachers but to those following.  The Deputy said that over the years the strain in this job has increased greatly.  He also referred to teachers' entitlements to have service abroad included in pension entitlements here.  This will be addressed within the European context in relation to the comparability of qualifications. This matter will be cleared up in the 1992 context.  Deputy John Browne spoke of his 32 years as a teacher.  He looks happy and the ravages of it have sat lightly on him.</P>

I, too, remain happy about teaching after all my years at it and if the electorate decided, I would happily go back into it with the benefit of having been in this House and having been exposed to other traumas and challenges. The Deputy felt that there was a genuine need among a specific number of teachers who felt that they had unwittingly stumbled into the wrong job and found the strains and stresses too much.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not in a position at this time to give the House the exact details of his proposed announcement?  Is he not concerned by the fact that there are hundreds of people around Ireland at the moment who have put in applications to the Department, and many others who are considering submitting applications so that they can pursue a career in fishing?  The situation appears to be that there is a total standstill within the Department and that no licences are issuing at present.  The result <Col N="420" /> is that there are many people around the country who are hoping to make a livelihood in the fishing industry but who are being deterred by bureaucracy and are, consequently, confused.  Could the Minster tell the House at this time what the registered GRT is with the commission; the problems there are between the Irish Government and the Commission in relation to this; and if, in fact, he will be in a position at all to issue licences under the present system?</P>

      <P>I would also like to remind the House and the Deputy that the management of fisheries, and particularly the conditions under which new entrants will be allowed, raised problems of equity and efficiency.  As the Deputy knows, there are conflicting objectives with stocks now under pressure.  An open door policy is no longer possible.  It is important at this stage to find a balance between protecting the livelihood of those already in the industry and those new entrants who could add to the growth of the industry.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Casualties such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and, more recently, the <i>Tribulus</i> have highlighted Ireland's vulnerability to threats of marine pollution.  Ireland's location close to Atlantic shipping lanes and our volatile climate expose us to the possibility of having to deal with marine casualties. Our experience in recent years has made us acutely aware of the dangers and costs to the environment and the economy, through damage to the fishing, aquaculture and tourism industries of casualties at sea.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to preventing pollution and to responding with an immediate and efficient clean up operation to deal with any pollution which arises.  We have, unfortunately, gained some practical experience in recent years and have used this experience to streamline and tighten up our response to marine emergencies.  A first priority is, obviously, the protection of life on board stricken vessels.  Response agencies, however, also take measures to prevent pollution and are in a state of readiness to deal with any threat of pollution which may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine have <Col N="422" /> taken over administrative and operational responsibility for threatened pollution at sea.  A marine emergency action plan is being put in place in my Department.</P>
    <P>The plan is being used on an experimental basis and has worked very well during emergencies such as the <i>Yarrawonga,</i> the <i>Toledo</i> and the <i>Tribulus</i> over the last year or so.  I was particularly gratified to witness the ongoing response to the casualty involving the bulk carrier, the <i>Tribulus</i>, which averted a possible threat to our south-west coastline.  I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the dedication and expertise of the response team who worked over long periods, often through the night, in appalling weather conditions to subdue and control the threat of pollution from this particular casualty.</P>
    <P>With regard to the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> casualty, the total cost arising from this incident was £1.75 million, of which £1.31 million was spent on the clean-up operation and £0.44 million on the removal of oil from the ship.  As attempts to reach a settlement on the insurance claim were unsuccessful, civil proceedings were issued.</P>
    <P>In view of this, it would not be prudent to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply about the dangers of pollution on the south and south-west coasts.  Would he not agree that the practice of some bulk carrier owners of coming into Irish territorial waters with a crippled carrier and selling that carrier as a wreck, thereby causing major pollution to our coastline, is completely and utterly unacceptable to the Government?  To elaborate a little, that happened.  The transaction was for a nominal sum and we were left with a mess off the south coast.  Have we taken any steps to prohibit that type of practice in the future?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Priority Question No. 3 and Oral Question No. 44 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have on hands approximately 600 expressions of interest in relation to mariculture undertakings. The processing of these, some of which would be of a very tentative nature, is at various stages.  The regional distribution of these applications is very broadly as follows: east 40, south east 35, south 150, south west 100, west 100, north west 150, and central 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the process involved in the assessment of and final decision making on licence applications is rigourous and can take some time to complete.  Applications are assessed from the various technical perspectives by the relevant experts in my Department.  In the case of signficant finfish projects, this process includes assessment of the environmental impact statement which <Col N="424" /> promoters are statutorily obliged to submit and to make available to interested parties.  In addition, consultation takes place with relevant interested parties, including, among others, local authorities, fisheries boards, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. All objections made are thoroughly investigated.  Applications are then submitted for my consideration.</P>
    <P>This is a time consuming process which places a high demand on scarce administrative and technical resources.  The Government's environment action programme which announced allocation to my Department of £200,000 in 1990 for additional staff and resources has as its objective the bringing of all projects fully within the licensing and control regime at the latest by the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>I would note that in the past a number of projects went ahead on an informal basis in advance of formal licensing procedures being completed.  I have now instructed that this practice be discontinued, and officials of my Department will be pressing ahead with the task of licensing existing operations as soon as possible as well as coming to grips with most existing applications and any new ones which may come to hand.</P>

Can he guarantee the House that in the course of processing all future applications the 1981 fisheries legislation will be applied rather than the 1959 fisheries legislation which is the older Act?

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> My Department do not directly grant-aid the aquaculture industry.  Grants are provided by BIM in non-Gaeltacht areas and by Údarás na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  Grants are also available from the European Community.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these grant schemes has been and remains the promotion of the development of the aquaculture sector with a view to creating employment and growth, particularly in regions where other opportunities are limited.</P>
      <P>The number of grants paid by BIM to salmon and trout farming projects in the period 1979 to 1989 is 55, totalling £1,852,585.  It is not BIM practice to publish details of grant aid to individual projects. Údarás na Gaeltachta grant aided projects at a total of £4,148,061 over the same period.  Grants by the European Community to the sector through the FEOGA programme in 1989 alone was over £1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This policy has, to date, been highly successful in meeting the objectives and targets for the Irish finfish industry and Irish aquaculture development as a whole.  Total employment has now <Col N="427" /> reached 2,100 jobs and output has grown to a value of £30 million.  It is planned to increase employment to 3,500 by end 1991 and to bring output to over £70 million.</P>
    <P>The return to the State on investment in an industry can usefully be expressed as gross value added per State pound invested.  An ESRI study published in 1988 reveals a return for aquaculture of £2.80 per pound invested.  This is four times better than the average for indigenous industry.  The comparative cost per job in fish farming is also appreciably lower.  The ESRI report concluded that compared with other sectors State investment in fish farming is very productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>Current legislation with regard to lifejackets is contained in the Merchant Shipping (Life-Saving Appliances) Rules, 1967 and 1987, which require fishing vessels of 40 feet in length or over and pleasure craft of 45 feet in length or over to carry a lifejacket for every person on board.  In addition all such vessels are required to carry a number of lifebuoys, depending on the length of the vessel.</P>
      <P>It would not be a practical proposition to make the wearing of lifejackets obligatory at all times.  For example, the type of lifejacket currently in use can restrict movements on deck on a fishing vessel, and could become entangled in deck machinery.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the impracticalities and dangers which would be associated with the compulsory wearing of lifejackets at all times my Department have on many occasions impressed on all seafarers the importance of wearing life jackets when they are in distress.  The Merchant Shipping (Musters) Rules, 1983 also provide for the inspection of lifejackets at crew musters and drills.  In addition, since 1 January 1985, all candidates for fishing vessel certificates of competency have been required, before taking the examination, to undergo a basic sea survival course which includes familiarisation with life-saving appliances.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Merchant Shipping (Passenger and Vessel Safety and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which, with the assistance of this House, I hope to have in place before the summer season, contains enabling provision in respect of the carriage of life-saving appliances on board small boats.  The requirements in respect of lifejackets will be reviewed when the Bill comes into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister put forward the same argument which was used 25 years ago in regard to car seat safety <Col N="431" /> belts.  He said it is not a practical proposition to have lifebelts for everybody going out in boats.  Is the Minister aware that every year a number of people are drowned in small pleasure boats and small open fishing boats around our coast within yards of the shore?  Surely something should be done to see that these people, many of whom are experienced fishermen but who have never been in a boat, should be obliged to take certain safety precautions?  Does the Minister seriously believe that the regulation which demands that such lifejackets be worn by people in boats 45 feet long is realistic?  They are big boats and such people would wear lifejackets only if the boat was in danger of foundering in very bad weather.</P>

Did I understand the Minister to say that the question of the provision of lifejackets would be reviewed only after the Bill has been brought before the House or is it his intention to include it in the Bill?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 17, 18, 26, 38 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I set up the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Review Group in August 1989 in order to establish a sound and equitable basis for processing sea fishing boat licence applications in the interests of existing fishermen and potential new entrants to <Col N="434" /> the industry.  This decision was widely welcomed by the industry.  I am pleased to inform the House that the report of the licensing review group was submitted to me last month.  I am studying this report with a view to announcing new licensing policies and procedures as soon as possible.  In the meantime, the embargo on the consideration of licence applications, including those referred to by Deputy Deenihan, continues to apply.</P>
    <P>It would be premature at this stage, pending detailed consideration, to comment in detail or to take a decision on the question of publication in advance of careful consideration by me of the complex issues involved.  I wish to mention, however, that the group have examined in detail the level of existing fish stocks and the existing capacity of the fleet as well as European Community requirements to reduce fleet capacity. The group have expressed serious concern about fish stocks and the impact on those stocks and on the viability of existing boats of allowing additional capacity into the fleet.  It has, accordingly, recommended, generally speaking, that new boats should be allowed in on a replacement basis only and that the degree of replacement required should be related to the level of over-capacity in each specific segment of the fleet.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention also that the number of applications on hand come to 220 and that the tonnage involved comes to approximately 15,000 tonnes.  This tonnage amounts to over 27 per cent of the existing fleet.  It would be entirely unrealistic to envisage that all these applications could be reasonably accommodated except on a replacement only basis.  I will be dealing with all these issues when I come to announce the new licensing policy to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The total allowable catches and quotas for 1990 were set by the Council of Fisheries Ministers at their meeting in December 1989.  The total allowable catches are based primarily on scientific advice on the state of each stock and the level of catch which is consistent with maintaining viable fishery and gainful employment for fishermen on a sustained basis.  The total allowable catch is, where national quotas are involved, allocated between countries on the basis of predetermined distribution keys which are a central element of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The toal herring quota for 1990 is 52,050 tonnes as compared with 44,810 tonnes in 1989 or an increase of 7,240 tonnes which was 6,810 tonnes higher than proposed initially by the EC Commission. The total mackerel quota, before taking account of bilateral <Col N="436" /> exchanges in either of the years concerned, is 70,550 tonnes in 1990 as compared with 69,280 tonnes in 1989 or an increase of 1,270 tonnes.  In addition, an extra 3,000 tonnes was achieved for 1990 by way of a bilateral exchange.  The cod quota of 2,450 tonnes in the Celtic Sea shows a slight increase in 1990 as compared with 1989.  I succeeded, however, in achieving an increase of 260 tonnes on the initial EC Commission proposals for 1990.  The total whiting quota for 1990 is 16,760 tonnes as compared with 17,470 tonnes in 1989 or a reduction of 710 tonnes.  In the case of whiting, I would point out that from an initial position of facing a Commission proposal for a 5,220 tonnes reduction, a reduction of only 710 tonnes was achieved by vigorous negotiations and invoking the Hague Agreement.</P>
    <P>It has to be accepted that there will be variations from year to year in the quotas for individual fish stocks having regard to the trend in those stocks and the need to protect the long-term interests of fishermen through proper conservation.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the total quotas available to Irish fishermen show an increase on 1989. As I have explained to the House on a number of previous occasions, I am fully satisfied that the arrangements I negotiated last December represented a highly satisfactory outcome from what were extremely difficult negotiations and were more favourable in Ireland's case than for most other member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>

      <P>The group will comprise representatives of my own Department, the Departments of the Environment and Health and Energy together with representatives of the ESB and the aquaculture industry.</P>
      <P>I regard this as an important initiative which should enable the debate on freshwater aquaculture to be moved forward in a balanced way, grounded in objective assessment of the impact of existing freshwater operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this initiative I expect to receive shortly the report of the working group on mandatory codes of practice for finfish aquaculture, which I established last year and which is addressing those aspects of fish husbandry which have a direct bearing on the environment.  My <Col N="438" /> Department is also formulating a systematic inspection programme for the industry using all available resources to ensure that existing standards and any new codes of practice adopted are fully observed.</P>
    <P>The Deputies are no doubt aware that under the terms of the relevant EC Directive, recently given statutory effect by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, prospective freshwater aquaculture operators must submit environmental impact statements to the relevant local authority when applying for planning permission.  This requirement in itself should serve to assure concerned parties that all likely environmental impacts of such operations are fully taken into account.</P>

I wonder if in fact the committee were thrown together without any detailed specifications in relation to the terms of reference and that in fact it was a reaction to the ongoing situation that arose between Dublin Corporation and the Departments of the Environment and Energy and the subsequent head-on clash between the Minister for Energy and the Minister for the Environment as an effort <Col N="439" /> to cool the troubled waters?  I think the group was put together to soften the cough of everybody and cloud up the situation and therefore I would like to get the exact details of the terms of reference.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 53 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>I received the final report of the review group on air-sea rescue services recently. The group were established in February 1989 to examine the structure and operation of the air-sea rescue services and to make recommendations to ensure a cost effective and efficient service to meet national and international requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group have examined in detail all aspects of the State's search and <Col N="441" /> rescue system including the possibility of European Community funding for the service.  The European Commission has not up to now been prepared to entertain such funding.  However, I understand that the EC Commissioner, Mr. Carlo Ripa de Meana, told the European Parliament that he would support the formation of a specialised fleet for sea rescue and that he would examine the location of such a service in Ireland in more detail and without delay.  We are awaiting clarification of the Commission's intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Ireland hopes to receive a large share of the IR£85 million approximately which was set aside by the Council of Ministers in November last year for fishery surveillance purposes.  Vessels and aircraft funded under that package may, of course, be employed to assist in search and rescue operations.</P>
    <P>Until the Government have had time to consider and implement, as appropriate, the review group's many recommendations designed to improve the search and rescue services, I do not propose to rush into any proposal for the establishment of a single European coastguard and rescue service.  Such a proposal would have to be carefully considered when views of the European Commission on the matter have been clarified.</P>
    <P>I hope to submit the review group's recommendations to Government as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not agree that air-sea rescue operations off our coasts is a controversial topic and that the report of the review group should be published soon? I am sure the Minister of State is aware that there is great concern in the fishing industry about the inadequacy of our air-sea rescue services.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to give us an indication of when that report will be published and if it will be made available to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I hope to be in a position, as I said, to submit this report to the Government shortly.  It will then be a matter for the Government <Col N="442" /> to decide whether the report should be published or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said in his initial reply, in relation to the location of a specialised fleet for sea rescue in Ireland, that he is awaiting a reply from the Commission.  The EC Commissioner made his statement to the European parliament following the submission of the report to the Minister of State's Department but I would point out that that is a matter for consideration in the longer term.  What we need to do in the short-term is provide a proper air-sea rescue service.  Is the Minister of State in a position to inform the House as to when the Government are going to make a decision on the report and if it is the intention to publish it?  It would be highly dangerous to use the EC announcement in an attempt to stall the making of a decision.</P>

Substantial progress has been made to date. I have to say that the owners have cooperated fully with my Department in eliminating the pollution threat and effecting repairs.  Therefore, I hope a decision will be made very shortly.  The extent of the pollution is very small.  Small amounts of bunker oil leaked from the damaged vessel and foams and skimmers were deployed to mop up the oil as a preventive measure.  Local fishermen were given an absorbent boom to protect their mussel beds in the bay.  Where the oil was washed ashore Cork County Council staff were quickly deployed to clean up oil debris and seaweed.  The position now is that the shoreline is clean and there is no oil on the water.</P>

      <P>The UK dumping proposals were discussed at a special meeting in London on 14 February last.  The UK indicated their intention to issue permits to dump by virtue of (i) and (ii).  Some other member states of the Commission questioned the scientific justification for the dumping. Ireland adopted the position that it would be obliged to object to any future proposals for the dumping of waste in the North Sea unless there was ample and concrete evidence of positive action to implement alternative methods of disposal on land.</P>

The Irish Government, in this year of all years, the year of the famous Green Presidency, have failed to support our European partners in putting pressure on the British Government to stop the dumping.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I intend answering Questions Nos. 19, 20, 30, 34, 48, 67 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already outlined my views in relation to the Coast Protection Act, 1963, when replying to parliamentary questions on 13 February 1990.  The question relating to the continued operation of the Act and the State contribution towards the cost of protection schemes, <Col N="451" /> will be considered in the context of the proposed review to which I referred in that reply.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of undertaking coast protection works, where progressive erosion by the sea is evident, there is the problem of damage to properties and sea defences caused by occasional or abnormal storms, such as occurred over recent months.  The Government set up a special Cabinet sub-committee, as an emergency measure following the persistent bad weather to report on storm damage.  Deputy Wilson is a member of this committee and he arranged for engineers from the Department to prepare a report, for the benefit of the committee, detailing damage caused to our coasts in recent weeks. While I cannot give any specific commitments, concerning locations referred to by Deputies in their questions, I can assure the House that the Government and the Cabinet sub-committee are determined to deal with this problem as equitably and speedily as possible.  Each coastal county's case for funds will be given every consideration by the committee.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose taking Questions Nos. 22, 23 and 29 together.  As the passenger vessel <i>St. Columba</i> is registered in the United Kingdom and as the fire on board the vessel occurred while it was within UK territorial waters, the accident investigation unit of the UK Department of Transport is the appropriate body to carry out an inquiry into the incident.  The UK Department of Transport has promised to forward to me a copy of the findings of its preliminary inquiry into the incident when this has been completed.  There has also been direct contact between my Department and Sealink on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by my Department, apply to vessels which carry more than 12 passengers to sea or on rivers, canals, lakes or estuaries.  Such vessels are <Col N="455" /> required to hold a valid passenger certificate and are subject to annual surveys conducted by marine surveyors of my Department.  Random inspections are also carried out in order to ensure compliance with various rules and regulations relating to life-saving and fire appliances and other safety equipment.</P>
    <P>Forty vessels now hold valid passenger certificates and steps have been taken to ensure that overloading does not occur on such vessels and that all vessels carrying more than 12 passengers hold valid certificates. Regular publicity campaigns are launched in conjunction with the National Safety Council and particularly during the summer bank holiday weekends in order to warn the public of the dangers of travelling on board unlicensed or overloaded passenger vessels. Increased liaison has been effected with local gardaí who now maintain an active presence at piers and at other passenger boarding points in order to ensure the carriage of the required safety equipment and to prevent overloading.  All reported cases of overloading are vigorously pursued. In 1989 alone proceedings were taken against the operators in 32 cases of reported overloading.</P>
    <P>Foreign registered passenger vessels operating from Irish ports are inspected by my survey staff at least every six months, under the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control.  The latter is an agreement between the maritime authorities of 14 European countries aimed at ensuring that ships comply with international safety, pollution prevention and other standards.  All deficiencies found during inspection are reported to the Port State Control Computer Centre in France.  In addition, vessels may be detained to rectify deficiencies, allowed to proceed to the next port where the deficiencies must be rectified or given 14 days to rectify the deficiencies, depending on their gravity.</P>
    <P>There are no specific provisions governing the carriage of children on board pleasure craft.  For the purposes of the Merchant Shipping Acts, children are treated as passengers for the carriage of <Col N="456" /> whom vessels must comply with the requirements already mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, both generally and from the Government statement in <Col N="490" /> the Seanad on the Adjournment last night, that last Sunday, the Twelve member states of the European Community had appealed on humanitarian grounds to the Iraqi authorities to exercise clemency in respect of the sentences on Mr. Bazoft and Mrs. Parish.  Numerous other appeals for clemency were made by friendly countries and by eminent figures, including the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  The Twelve appeal did not achieve its hoped-for result, and the following communiqué is now being issued:</P>
    <P>The Twelve members of the European Community are utterly dismayed at the execution in Baghdad of Mr. Farzad Bazoft.</P>
    <P>They had appealed to the Iraqi authorities on humanitarian grounds to exercise clemency and are profoundly disappointed that this humanitarian appeal was not heeded. </P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is no exaggeration to say that the world was shocked by the execution of a journalist working for a reputable newspaper, following a news story.  We are all even more shocked by the rapidity with which this barbaric execution was carried out.  There is a number of areas involved here, first the basic fundamental issue of the indecency and obscenity of capital punishment. There is also a clear issue relating to the freedom of the press which must concern all of us.  There is also a very disquieting issue in relation to what appears to have been a breakdown in the normal system of diplomatic contact.  It is ominous indeed that this barbaric execution took place so quickly in spite of strong appeals. That is something that must concern all of us.  We live in a world where we are increasingly interdependent and increasingly affected by each other and for one of the nations of the world community to act in this way must be deeply worrying to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the Twelve have now issued a statement.  I commend the Taoiseach and the Government here on arranging for that statement to be issued as quickly as it was.  It is important that those who support civilised values and decency in the conduct of nations and <Col N="491" /> people should make our view clear on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the communique which has been issued this afternoon.  I also commend the Taoiseach and the representatives of the 12 for the speed with which they made their plea for clemency.  There are fundamental principles at stake in what is taking place.  It is interesting that the Iraqi reply to the appeal of the Twelve and the two other appeals from prominent individuals and from Governments and organisations throughout the world was that they regarded such appeals as interference in the internal affairs of Iraq. I recall a similar statement being made by the Peoples Republic of China in relation to the condemnation of the massacre in Tianamen Square.</P>
      <P>Governments who seek to have diplomatic relations and live within the normalcy of diplomatic relations make a commitment to live within the tenets of international law.  If one is to say that appeals such as those that have been made in this recent most tragic case are interference, one is putting oneself outside the ambit of normal diplomatic activity.  In this case, it is warranted, for example, in relation to the Irish response as opposed to the communique issued from the Twelve, that Ireland should recall her Ambassador now for briefing. It is the minimum that should be required and it would also be an appropriate response for the Twelve.  No other considerations should stop us taking such action.  An appeal has been made and rejected.  We have witnessed a summary execution without any recognised legal process, without right of appeal, relying only on the discretion of the President to exercise clemency, and that appeal for clemency was turned down.  The death sentence has now been completed, tragically, the penalty being directed against somebody involved in his professional activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures involved here would fill one with abhorrence.  It is most important at this stage that, in the balance of diplomatic activity, the moral issues involved, the principles of international <Col N="492" /> law involved and the norms of diplomacy involved, should take precedence over any other consideration such as that of trade.  I strongly urge the Taoiseach to act in the manner I have suggested by recalling our Ambassador and by conveying his intention to act like this to the other members of the Twelve, so that we do not have a repeat of actions like this by any member of the world community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his response to my request and the request of other Deputies this morning to have statements in the House on this matter.  The execution by the Iraqi authorities of the journalist Farzad Bazoft is certainly the most final interference with a person's human rights that any state can engage in.  The Workers' Party, like other parties in this House are opposed to the death penalty irrespective of where or by whom the execution is carried out.  What is particularly appalling about this execution is that it would appear to have been done in order to use this unfortunate man as a pawn in some bigger game.  That kind of disregard for and abuse of human life appals all of us.</P>
      <P>I share the sense of shock and outrage felt by many people at this execution.  I do not know whether Mr. Bazoft was guilty as charged but there is strong evidence to suggest that he was only involved in legitimate activities as a journalist.  Even if he had been guilty, the offence could not be considered to merit the appalling sentence to which he has been subjected.  It is a great tragedy that the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war which led to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands and which to all intents and purposes is now over, has taken another life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that there are many other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere that engage in executions. Thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people who opposed the present regime in Iran were put to death in the most appalling practices.  The fact that these executions may not be able to grab the attention of the world press in the way the execution of Mr. Bazoft has does not mean that we should forget about them. I call on Iran, Iraq and other countries <Col N="493" /> that use the death penalty to abolish this barbarous act.</P>
    <P>I welcome the stand taken by the European Community as outlined in the statement the Taoiseach has made.  Perhaps our stance would be stronger, as suggested by Deputy Michael Higgins, and I hope that pressure will be brought to bear on the Iraqi authorities to stop these activities of executing their own citizens and the citizens of other states.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael Finucane gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the ongoing industrial dispute at the Anglo-Irish Meat Processors in Rathkeale.  The Deputy has ten minutes to present his case and the Minister or the Minister of State has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  I have raised many times what I consider to be a serious problem in my constituency. Anglo-Irish Meat Processors in Rathkeale was founded in the early fifties and was known as Shannon Meats.  The company are involved in the slaughtering of animals and the boning and canning of meat.  In late 1987 the company were taken over by Anglo-Irish Meat Processors Limited.  The takeover at that time also included 80 acres and plant and stocks.  It was a profitable venture at the <Col N="494" /> time of the takeover.  The factory is important to the area as it employes about 150 people.</P>
      <P>About 120 of those workers are currently affected by the industrial dispute which mainly centres around the slaughtering and boning activities.  As the workers are all members of SIPTU, the workers involved in canning are also involved.  The main issue is a bonus system which the company are trying to change to a piece works system.  The existing bonus system has operated for a considerable time and the workers have been pleased with the operation of this scheme.  The workers already lost concessions they had in the past such as service pay and Christmas bonuses.  It is interesting to note that during the peak killing period from August to December last year the bonus scheme operated effectively.  However, it emerged as a contentious issue again in recent times, when the employees in the slaughtering plant were on a two-day week and the management tried to establish the new piece work scheme.  This was opposed by the workers and hence the dispute which has been going on now for the past six weeks.</P>
      <P>Considerable hardship has been experienced by the workers.  The strength of feeling among the workers has been illustrated in that they have maintained a 24 hour picket outside the plant during the inclement weather of the past six weeks. I have been informed that recent discussions have broken down and it seems that senior management, particularly those in head office of the Anglo-Irish Meats Processors Limited, Dundalk, are being intransigent.  The people from the Rathkeale area have shown great solidarity with the workers because of the importance of the factory to the community and the agricultural hinterland.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to use his good offices to see if he can initiate a breakthrough in this dispute to enable normality to return to the Anglo-Irish Meat Processors Limited plant in Rathkeale.  I thank the Minister for his attendance in the House this evening to reply to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Finucane for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  He has endeavoured to raise it on the Adjournment for some days and during the time the Department have kept up to date with, I am sorry to say the lack of developments in this dispute.  I would not disagree with most of the facts Deputy Finucane has given.  As is normal in these disputes, we have received data from both sides.</P>
      <P>The dispute at Anglo-Irish Meat Processors Limited which includes, as the Deputy said, Shannon Meats Limited in Rathkeale, commenced on 5 February 1990.  The company notified the union, SIPTU, that they needed to restructure the bonus scheme which has not been altered for 15 years.  As the Deputy has stated, discussions took place throughout 1989 to try to make some movement on this issue.  I understand this bonus scheme was intended as an incentive for production achievements.  The company had been trying since late 1988 to achieve progress on this issue and had indicated they would remove the scheme from that date.  The union requested the company in January 1989 to refrain from removing the bonus scheme in order to allow discussions to take place.  I am sure the company believe that the discussions during 1989 did not progress at a satisfactory rate and the workers believed they were being asked to give too much.</P>
      <P>About 120 people are employed in the operations and I understand that not all are directly affected by the bonus scheme.  From discussions I have had I understand the number of workers involved ranges from 20 to 30 and the money involved ranges from £30 to £50 per individual, which is a significant reduction in weekly earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As no progress was made at the negotiations which took place during February, the Labour Court became involved in the dispute.  The proposals which emerged from the Labour Court conciliation discussions which took place on 7 February 1990 were rejected by the workers. A further conciliation conference took <Col N="496" /> place last week, on 6 March, but unfortunately this dispute has remained unresolved. I am sorry to have to report that very little progress was made at these discussions.  The conciliation officer involved endeavoured to find common ground but could not find any at that stage.</P>
    <P>I have been keeping in touch with developments in the dispute and I discussed the matter with my colleagues in the Labour Court conciliation service during the week.  The industrial relations section of my Department have been in touch with both sides but to date no substantial progress has been made.  I have not been waiting for action to be taken but have been pursuing this matter as far as I could.  Since I was last in communication with both sides they have made very little progress on which to build.</P>
    <P>As we are all well aware a prolonged dispute can have long-term detrimental effects and put jobs at risk.  The effects of this dispute will not be any different. I should like to take this opportunity to urge both parties involved in the dispute to enter into meaningful discussions.  Of course, the services of the court remain available to both parties.  I understand the difficulties which have been outlined by Deputy Finucane.  His constituency colleagues and people from the locality have also been in contact with me in regard to this dispute.  I want to assure the Deputy, so that he can assure the people involved, that the conciliation service and, in particular, the conciliation officer who has been involved in this dispute from the outset, will be available at short notice if there are any indications by either party that they want to enter into meaningful discussions.  I contacted the conciliation officer today and he has indicated that he will be ready to take part in meaningful discussions as soon as there is an indication from anybody that they wish to make some progress in this dispute.  I should like to see an early resolution to this dispute but discussions will have to be entered into first.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to ask both sides in the dispute to consider the hardship which may arise for the 120 <Col N="497" /> people employed in the plants and the effects the loss of these jobs will have on the business of Anglo-Irish Meat Processors Limited generally and the local community.  I urge both sides to return to the negotiating table.  I can assure the Deputy that the conciliation officer will be available at short notice to enter into discussions.</P>

The problem is that there is a two year waiting list for tonsil operations in St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.  I understand that 117 people are awaiting operations and that the consultant concerned can only operate on one or two patients per week.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal that young children in pain should have to wait for such operations. Very often the parents of these children stay with them until the early hours of the morning to ensure they are so exhausted they will fall asleep.  Their doctors are concerned about having to prescribe repeated courses of antibiotics in the first place and their teachers are concerned about the consequences of them missing school and the effects on their schooling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was not always the case in the Dún Laoghaire area.  Before the closure of Monkstown Hospital it was possible to get a tonsilectomy within a couple of weeks of being referred by a doctor.  The problem that has arisen is as a direct <Col N="498" /> result of the cutbacks in the health service. Monkstown Hospital was closed and was a huge loss to my constituency. On top of that the number of beds at St. Michael's Hospital has been reduced from 145 in 1987 to 95 at present.  This is one of the reasons why children like the one I have referred to have difficulty in getting in for operations because even if they are booked in somebody may come in on a casualty case and the bed may be taken up when they are due to have their operation.</P>
    <P>The third reason there is a problem in St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire is that the children's ward was closed about two years ago.  I do not think it is desirable that the only way a child can get into hospital to have an operation is if a TD manages to raise the issue on the Adjournment.  I certainly do not want to find myself having to raise repeated individual cases of children who are waiting for operations.  The only way this can be avoided is if the children's ward in St. Michael's Hospital is reopened.  There is a long waiting list for tonsilectomies. Most of the 117 patients are children and this is a direct result of the closure of the children's ward.</P>
    <P>Quite apart altogether from the effect on the waiting list of having the children's ward closed, it is undesirable that young children going in for an operation which is a traumatic experience for them would be put into adult wards.  I have spoken to parents with children who are going into hospital and who have told them that there will be a special children's ward, that they will have other children with them, an opportunity to play and so on and have found that the child is then admitted to an adult ward.  It is a traumatic enough experience for a child to have to go into hospital without having to meet the unexpected as well.</P>
    <P>For two reasons, therefore, I am asking the Minister of State to, first of all, examine the waiting list for tonsilectomies in the Dún Laoghaire area, specifically for St. Michael's Hospital and, as an immediate measure, to have the children's ward reopened.  There were 16 beds in that ward originally.  Even if it were reopened on a partial basis that waiting list could be reduced.  The necessary resources should <Col N="499" /> be provided to St. Michael's Hospital to enable them to do that.  It is not acceptable that we should have such a long waiting list and young children in pain, their parents worried about them, doctors having to prescribe repeated doses of antibiotics for them all resulting from the reduction in the number of beds in the hospital and the closure of the children's ward.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to reply to Deputy Gilmore on this matter.  I am aware that there are difficulties at present with the waiting list for children's ENT cases in St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>If in any individual case the patient or parents of a patient are concerned that their condition is worsening they should contact their general practitioner with a view to having the consultant review the priority attached to the case.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, recently met representatives of St. Michael's Hospital and discussed the present financial position of the hospital with them.  He has asked the hospital to review their service plan in the light of these discussions and to submit new proposals for activity in the remainder of 1990.  On receipt of these proposals, the Minister for Health and I will be examining the hospital's total service plan, in the light of the known needs of the hospital's catchment area.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that an extra allocation of £100,000 was made to the hospital sometime ago to assist with its financial situation.  As Deputy Gilmore has pointed out there is a total of 117 patients on the waiting list for ENT inpatient treatment.  These include 110 children and seven adults.  I should point out that sometimes when people go to their GPs and are referred to the hospitals they expect that they will then automatically be called.  In any case, after the referral there must be an assessment by the consultant who will prioritise based on the gravity of a situation and decide when that patient should be called for surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ENT surgeon post became vacant about four years ago when the then holder of the post retired.  The post is now filled on a locum basis by another <Col N="500" /> consultant who does two sessions per week, one operating session and one outpatient session.  In the light of the difficulties being experienced at present in the ENT service for children at the hospital, my Department will be paying special attention to possible strategies for improving the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to cutbacks in the health services.  Let me point out to him that this year the Government allocated £1.4 billion, 21.5 per cent of total Exchequer expenditure proposed for 1990.  This is the highest allocation for any Department and is proof positive of the commitment of the Government to maintaining a modern health care service for our people.  The Minister for Health also announced recently that two major initiatives are being taken.  One is the Dublin hospitals initiative under the chairmanship of Mr. David Kennedy, the former Chief Executive of Aer Lingus, who will be examining the totality of services in the Dublin acute hospital services, the admissions and the proposals for rationalisation and equalisation of services across the Dublin area where massive amounts of money are being spent, particularly in the acute hospitals. We also have a second initiative where Mr. Noel Fox and an efficiency audit group are examining the efficiency of all the acute hospitals in the country because we believe it is vitally important to give the best service possible and get the best value for money so that people do not have to wait very long for necessary services.</P>
    <P>I hope these two initiatives and the prioritising of particular cases by various consultants will ensure that people who need emergency treatment will get it quickly.  We will, as Deputy Gilmore has requested, review the whole ENT situation in St. Michael's.</P>

      <P>Over the 11 year period 1976-1986 my Department carried out investigations of the sea trout population.  The results were published in the Department's technical journals and elsewhere describing trends in population size and discussing evidence for relationships with weather and climate patterns.  While the factors responsible for the rapid decline of sea trout numbers off the coast of Galway and Mayo remain unclear, research carried out by my Department over the past two years suggests that the drought at a critical time of seaward migration by juvenile trout and kelts in the spring may have had a major influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take a very serious view of the impact <Col N="461" /> of the sudden decline in sea trout numbers and for this reason I allocated an additional £10,000 to foster specific research into the phenomenon under a number of headings which will test all the hypotheses which have been advanced to explain the decline.  Thirteen projects will be carried out by scientists of the Salmon Research Agency and the Fisheries Research Centre of my Department, together with research workers from University College Galway, Trinity College Dublin, and Queen's University, Belfast, all acting under the aegis of the Sea Trout Action Group.</P>
    <P>The list of projects or investigations to be carried out in 1990 are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to send to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>My Department are not taking any steps to artificially restore sea trout numbers. Research by my Department suggests that artificial restocking of sea trout is of arguable value.  A natural regeneration of sea trout numbers will take place when environmental conditions favour it.  While these conditions are not favourable such efforts are likely to be unrewarding.</P>

    <P>In attempting to trace the source various studies were carried out and inquiries were made to the authorities in countries, including the UK, from which the disease may have been introduced.

      <P>My Department assumed legal responsibility for Howth Harbour on 1 January 1990.  Since that date one engrossed lease has issued to a tenant on the West Pier for signature and sealing; one draft lease has issued to another tenant for his approval, and the Chief State Solicitor has been asked to expedite the issue of five other draft leases.</P>
      <P>The general policy is to lease sites to firms engaged in the fish and fishery related industries.</P>
      <P>An area of about 1.5 acres at the West Pier will be subdivided into industrial sites and allocated to firms engaged in the fishing industry.  A total of 31 applicants expressed an interest in these sites.</P>

      <P>There are significant differences between the North Sea and the Irish Sea.  For example, the Irish Sea does not have the pollution problems of the North Sea, which are caused largely by rivers and outfalls from the highly urbanised and industrial areas of northern Europe.  Secondly, nine countries border the North Sea, compared to just Ireland and the UK around the Irish Sea.  The conference mechanism is essential, therefore in reaching agreement between so many states.</P>
      <P>There are regular meetings between the Irish and UK authorities regarding the Irish Sea.  A group of scientists, working as the Irish Sea Study Group, are currently finalising a report which covers different aspects of the Irish Sea.  The report will be discussed at a conference to be held in October in the Isle of Man.  I believe that these arrangements are both appropriate and effective for the management of the Irish Sea.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent report from the International Maritime Organisation expressing concern about the condition of shipping vessels; if he intends to take any steps through the EC to curb the use of poorly maintained and badly manned ships using flags of convenience in European waters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The International Maritime Organisation, which is the United Nations agency with responsibility for safety of life at sea and the prevention of pollution from ships has on many occasions expressed concern about flag of convenience vessels which operate with below the minimum internationally accepted manning levels and safety standards. The organisation has urged member states to inspect as many foreign-registered vessels as possible which visit their ports and to detain vessels which do not comply with international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned, foreign registered vessels when in a port in the State or within our territorial waters must comply with the provisions of the following International Maritime Organisation Conventions; the Loadlines Convention, 1966, the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Collisions at Sea, the Standards of Training and Certification of Watchkeepers Convention, 1978, and most importantly the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, 1974, as amended in 1981, 1983, 1988 and 1989, known as SOLAS, which contains provisions concerning life saving applicances, stability, <Col N="467" /> navigational facilities, fire protection, construction, surveys, radio installations and the carriage of dangerous goods.  A set of 21 statutory instruments was executed in 1983 in order to give legal effect to the SOLAS Convention while a further set of 12 instruments giving effect to the First Amendments to the Convention was executed in 1985.  A set of 13 instruments to give effect to the Second Amendments will be enacted shortly.</P>
    <P>Marine surveyors of my Department apply the provisions of these statutory instruments when inspecting foreign registered vessels and have powers under the Merchant Shipping Acts to detain vessels which do not comply with the relevant requirements.</P>
    <P>Foreign registered vessels visiting our ports may also be inspected under the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control. This is an agreement between the maritime authorities of 14 European countries, including Ireland, aimed at ensuring that ships comply with international safety, pollution prevention and other standards, All deficiencies found during inspection are reported to the Port State Control Computer Centre at Saint Malo, France.  Vessels may be detained to rectify deficiencies, allowed to proceed to the next port where the deficiencies must be rectified or given fourteen days to rectify the deficiences depending on their gravity.  The computer facility is a useful instrument in procuring swift and accurate information on vessels.  Messages concerning, for example, ships with outstanding deficiencies sailing within European waters or concerning reports on operational violations within the region can be transmitted via computer terminal to any participating State within minutes.</P>
    <P>Under Port State Control arrangements each participating State undertakes to achieve an annual total of inspections corresponding to 25 per cent of the estimated number of individual foreign merchant ships, as distinct from ships movements, which entered its ports during a 12 month period.  During 1988 <Col N="468" /> for example, 246 foreign registered vessels were inspected while in Irish ports. Twenty-six of these were detained by my surveyors until deficiencies identified during the inspection had been rectified.</P>
    <P>The European Community has examined proposals aimed at the harmonisation of inspection procedures in member states.  However, given that all the maritime members of the Community participate in Port State Control arrangements which to date have proved successful in detecting and detaining vessels operating below international standards, within European waters, the European Community has not as yet seen the need to take any further measures.</P>

      <P>I will be dealing with this issue fully when I come to make a full statement on the adoption of a new licensing policy.  I will be taking every possible step to ensure to the maximum extent possible that the fish catch of Irish registered boats contributes to employment and development in this country.

      <P>The role of the French market in determining market prices as well as the amount of the ewe premium is of prime importance.  The prices quoted for lamb in France are influenced by several factors including the relative strengths of the pound sterling and the French franc.  The phasing out of the clawback of the variable premium on exports of British lamb to France, the price of lamb coming from other Community markets such as Ireland and Spain, and imports from third countries, all impact on the French market prices.</P>
      <P>There are no monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) applicable in the sheepmeat sector at present.  As part of the 1988-89 prices package, the Council of Ministers decided to phase out MCAs for all sectors where they apply.  This process will take place on a gradual basis with appropriate adjustments in green currency values to ensure that MCAs will be completely eliminated from 1992.  In these circumstances, it would be difficult to introduce a corrective monetary mechanism specifically for sheepmeat. However, the EC Commission has undertaken to submit appropriate proposals to the Council should monetary discrepancies distort the sheepmeat market.</P>

      <P>She appealed the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also considered her capable of work. The matter was then referred to an appeals officer, who decided that the claimant was not incapable of work.  Thus she was not entitled to the payment of disability benefit from 30 May 1989.</P>
      <P>The claimant subsequently submitted additional medical evidence which was referred to the medical adviser for evaluation and then to the appeals officer.

      <P>Payment of benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 25 October 1989 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>She appealed the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee in November 1989 who also considered her capable of work.  The matter was referred to an appeals officer in January 1990 for determination.  Following an examination of the papers in the case the appeals officer decided to hold an oral hearing in the case in order to allow the claimant an opportunity to present her case personally.  No date has yet been fixed for the hearing but the person concerned will be advised of the time and place to attend when arrangements are completed.</P>

I have made inquiries from the Mater Hospital who have informed me that this person has been put on the &ldquo;non-urgent&rdquo; waiting list for cardiac bypass surgery.

      <Quest>having regard to her replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 20 and 234 of 6 March 1990, if the committee appointed by the governing body of University College, Dublin decided unanimously to dispose of all or part of the Lyons Estate at Celbridge, County Kildare; if the decision to sell was taken by that committee or if any other committee was involved in the decision; if any of the property being sold was the subject of expenditure incurred between 1982 and 1987, with particular reference to stable yards and indoor training facilities for horses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The Lyons Estate is the property of University College, Dublin; the decision to sell a portion of the estate was taken by the governing body of the college, in accordance with the powers conferred on it by the charter of the college.  Arrangements for the proposed sale, including the consideration of offers for the acquisition of the property or any part of it, are matters for the college authorities to decide.</P>
      <P>It has been ascertained from the college authorities that a small element of the expenditure on facilities at the Lyons Estate between 1982 and 1987 was incurred on maintenance and minor works associated with the stable yards which are now to be sold.  I understand that the indoor training facilities for horses are to be dismantled and relocated on the part of the estate to be retained by the college.</P>
