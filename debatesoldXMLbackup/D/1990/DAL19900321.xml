    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree to the proposal to guillotine the Second Stage debate on this Bill.  I have received this morning a copy of what is purported to be an agreed statement between Government Deputies and PDFORRA.  I am glad to see these discussions are taking place and I am forced to the conclusion <Col N="503" /> that these discussions would not have taken place if this House had agreed to taking this Bill in the rushed way the Government first agreed.  I believe those discussions should take place but I cannot accept that this House should accept that all of the matters dealt with in this agreed statement should be dealt with outside this House and only by consultations between an outside organisation and a principal officer in the Department of the Environment.  I believe the result of any such discussions should be brought back in here so that this House can discuss fully what is intended in this Bill, and if we agreed to any regulations being made on the Bill, what the scope and nature of those regulations should be.  I am, therefore, opposed to the guillotine.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dick Spring on the same subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. (4) in relation to Second Stage of No. 6 of today's Order of Business we objected strenuously to the taking of this matter as the Government are proposing.  I will outline briefly my reasons for that as follows.  The situation seems to have changed dramatically since last Tuesday evening, given that two Fianna Fáil backbenchers had a meeting last night with PDFORRA. Whereas I think discussions were necessary as outlined by our spokespersons on this subject last Tuesday and Wednesday, I do not think the Government are going about their business in the proper manner.  The Minister for Defence should now come back into the House and make remarks which would obviously be contrary to remarks he made last Tuesday evening in the Second Stage debate.  We should start this debate all over again and we need far more time than has been proposed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that my colleagues on the Opposition benches take this view.  The Government are anxious to have this legislation reasonably soon. There is a sequence of events proposed <Col N="504" /> which we all hope will bring about a satisfactory state in regard to representation in the Permanent Defence Forces.  By 7 o'clock this evening, if the House agrees the Government proposition, Second Stage of this Bill will have received 23 hours of discussion, and we then propose to give a further considerable period, about 14 hours, for Committee Stage. Therefore, I do not think anybody can reasonably complain that the Bill has been rushed.</P>
      <P>We were anxious to try to get agreement from the Opposition Parties but it transpires, if I understand the position correctly, that the principal Opposition Party &mdash; Fine Gael &mdash; whatever about the other parties, are not prepared to enter into agreement for any conclusion of the debate.  If I am wrong please correct me but I understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This House needs to have all the facts and these discussion should be reported back to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Let us hear the Taoiseach without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position is that the Fine Gael Party are not prepared at this stage to agree to any conclusion.  They want the debate to go on and on and on until eventually it peters out.  We cannot accept that and it is not reasonable to ask the Government to do that.  In all 23 hours will have been given to Second Stage and a considerable amount of time will be given to Committee Stage.  This is all necessary because there is an overwhelming desire and necessity that this legislation is passed so that the position of representation in the Defence Forces can be got on with and brought to a universally satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the situation which has arisen the Minister should reconsider his position.  He has been requested to do so in a very limited way by the Opposition <Col N="522" /> as we were not given the right to speak. Yesterday an 11-hour marathon meeting took place.  We need to know what happened at that meeting in view of the fact that the background to the Bill has now changed.  I ask the Minister to make an immediate statement to the House on what happened yesterday, to give us the full facts, to have discussions with the Taoiseach, who is just leaving the House, and suspend forthwith further discussion on this Bill.  We have reached the level of farce.</P>
      <P>We on the Opposition benches are totally dissatisfied with the way in which this Bill is being handled.  The members of the Defence Forces are equally dissatisfied, and the Minister for Defence should now try to regain some of his dignity at this stage and start the whole business all over again.  Well he may laugh but the Army are not at all happy with the way he has been treating them in recent weeks. Yesterday he had to send two emissaries to talk to Army personnel to try to patch up a row.  Surely in the light of this the House should be given the full facts and be told exactly what happened.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle has any power in this matter or not but as this is such a serious matter he should, if he has such power, use it forthwith and suspend discussion on this Bill to allow the Minister to explain the matter to the House.  If the Minister is not aware of the full facts he should permit Deputies Kitt and Hillery, who were engaged in the discussions yesterday, to tell the House what went on.  It is unprecedented that such discussions should take place behind our backs.  The Minister will have to agree that things have gone horribly wrong for him.  He has time to put them right and he should do so. What was intended to be a harmonious change to a system of representation, which was agreed by the Army to be badly needed, has resulted in the Minister being at loggerheads not alone with the Army but with all Opposition Members. On matters dealing with the Army the House should be unified in its approach. This is a very sensitive matter; the security of the State is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> There is no doubt that we should give proper and careful consideration to any changes before we present a unified approach.  We should not do anything to upset the very important relationship that must exist between the Minister and the Army and between the Government and the Army.  This whole business has been ill considered from the beginning.  Last week the Minister was requested by Deputy Nealon to defer consideration of the Bill until the Gleeson report was published. I cannot understand why the Minister did not agree to that suggestion. Before Christmas the Minister was asked to act on what we all know will come out of the Gleeson report.  The Minister was requested to make a small interim payment to the Army.  Everybody would have agreed to that move because it is obvious that they are badly paid.  I have no doubt that the Gleeson report will recommend a change in the pay structure. The Minister has acted with undue haste and without consultation, that is until yesterday.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the problems he has created.</P>
    <P>Last week when Members approached the House they were accosted by members of the Army wives' association who were trying to make a point.  They asked the Minister to give consideration to the views of the Army before he put the Bill through the House.  There is no doubt that there is unrest and dissatisfaction in the Army.  Indeed, it was as a result of that that the House was chaotic on the Order of Business today. Surely the message has got through to the Minister by now.  Why is it that the Minister did not have proper and full negotiations with the Army before this unrest?  The Minister did not have to lose face but his capitulation yesterday represents an abject loss of face.  Indeed, that is why Opposition Members are clamouring for the Minister to start from scratch and produce a proper system. Why is it that the Minister did not have consultations with the existing pay advisory body?  The Minister could have used that group but he refused to do so.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate last <Col N="524" /> week the Minister acceded to point after point raised by Deputy Nealon.  We now have a silly looking mess.  His ill considered approach and unbelievable haste has resulted in the Army once again losing confidence in the Minister.  Yesterday's eleventh hour meeting surely represents a loss of face.  It represents a complete about turn by the Minister; a sign of a late conversion.  It has led to the creation of a very volatile atmosphere and that is not good for relations between the Government and the Army.  This business which last week looked bad looks one hundred times worse today. The background to the Bill has been changed and we have to say that we are not sure if we should believe the assertions the Minister made last week.</P>
    <P>The calls today to suspend the debate on the Bill pending proper consultations should be answered by the Minister.  We should have a proper discussion on this issue.  The Opposition parties should be able to get together with the Minister and agree on this whole business.  The House should be unanimous about the content of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister protested in a similar manner last week.  He spent the entire evening protesting and nodding his <Col N="525" /> head.  That was an indication that the Minister was not aware of all the facts relating to this business.  The Minister intended to use the single non transferrable vote system and when Deputy Nealon attacked him about that he capitulated.  What is the position after yesterday?  From my discussions with Deputy Nealon this morning I understand that the Minister has decided that an officer from the franchise section of the Department of the Environment will try to put together an agreed electoral system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also conceded on the decision he had made in regard to where meetings should take place between representative bodies. The Minister wanted meetings to take place only in military installations and I was in the House when he conceded on that issue.  The Minister has conceded on the good conduct rule for representation of the association.  Indeed, when we were discussing this privately last week we found it difficult to understand how any person could be a representative of the proposed organisation.  I understand that a member of the Army who has 12 years service can leave at any time without pension.  I understand that the Minister has decided that a representative under the Bill must have at least one year's service and that a member who is within one year of leaving the Army cannot be elected as a representative.  How many people are disqualified because of that? I accept that many people are disqualified under other headings but we do not have any idea of how many are involved.  The Minister has not given us his thoughts on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 states that members on active service cannot be representatives and that an association may not represent a member on active service.  I represent the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and I wonder if &ldquo;active service&rdquo; as defined in sections (1) (b) of the 1954 Act means that the Army personnel in the barracks across the Border cannot have representatives on the new association or cannot be represented by the new association.  I need to have that matter clarified.  Under the terms of the 1954 Act that seems to be the case.  In the definitions section a member is on active duty when he is part of a force which is engaged in activity against an enemy.  In the same Act, &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; is defined as including armed mutineers, armed rebels, armed rioters <Col N="527" /> and pirates.  At some stage during this debate, can the Minister define the position regarding the units working on the Border?  My own view is that they are on active service and, therefore, have no part in this whole process.  How far does that line run through the country?  How many other barracks and how many other units of the Army are in the same position?  We need to have those matters clarified and we do not have the definitions for them.</P>
    <P>I conclude by requesting the Minister once again to make a clear and unequivocal statement to this House and to tell us exactly what went on yesterday at the eleven hour meeting because a lot of talking took place.  We would like to know the spirit in which the talks took place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Were the talks acrimonious, because we are led to believe that last week the Army were not in a position to talk to the Minister in a friendly manner?  We need to know whether the background to the Bill has changed?  Is the Minister proposing in later stages to introduce new sections or amendments?  If so, we would need to know about them now.  Will the Minister then agree, as Deputy Nealon suggested to suspend the Bill forthwith?  Will the Minister sit down with Deputy Nealon and the other spokespersons and try to work out a common approach where reality can be introduced into this debate again so that we can try to patch up the differences between the Government and the Army which are extremely dangerous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the opportunity to comment on this Bill and I do so in the belief that the situation has changed dramatically given the events of last evening.  It is necessary to have some clarification as to exactly what is happening. We have had months of discussions, debate and speculation as to what was going to happen in relation <Col N="528" /> to the recognition of PDFORRA and granting permission to the soldiers to organise themselves.  Unfortunately, as things stand at present, the Minister for Defence does not warrant a great deal of credit for the handling of this matter.  I say that with major reservations because the Minister, in his political career has been an amazing politician able to bring about reconciliations and he has been involved in varied negotiations.  He has a long and very honourable political career but in relation to this particular episode, I am afraid we are sitting slap bang in the middle of a mess.  That is regrettable and is something which could have been avoided. I believe the events of last night are an explicit admission that things have been handled badly.  The Government seem to have missed the pass completely in relation to the wide ranging debate which has been taking place outside this House for the last number of years.</P>
      <P>Obviously one would have to welcome an agreement to recognise PDFORRA but &mdash; I have seen the statement and listened to comments made this morning on the radio &mdash; and it is far from clear what the Minister's intention is.  In relation to the statement issued by PDFORRA and two Fianna Fáil Deputies, one must ask if they were representing the Minister and the Government or were they acting as backbenchers off their own bat.  That statement conveyed the impression that the Minister is now prepared to recognise and consult with PDFORRA.  If so that begs the question, why are they being obliged to go through a torturous process involving backbench Deputies, and the Department of the Environment and not the Department of Defence?  Unfortunately, the manoeuvre of last evening has all the hallmarks of classic Fianna Fáil stroking.</P>
      <P>The association is now in a position to say it is being recognised and the Minister can save face by saying he never met representatives of the association &mdash; that would appear to be the position &mdash; while others have met the association on his behalf.  Not only is this a messy and dishonest solution but it makes absolute nonsense of the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> It is possible to argue that the two Deputies who met and negotiated with PDFORRA would have been guilty of an offence if the Bill we are now debating had already been passed by the House. Quite clearly this Bill, as has been said by numerous spokespersons, has to be radically altered before it is proceeded with.  I understand that the Minister proposes to make major amendments to the Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage when this House will have an opportunity to discuss very necessary amendments to a badly drafted Bill that does not help us, as legislation, to meet the challenge which this area puts before us.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is very unwise to proceed with this Bill in its present form.  Inevitably, any agreement reached will be reneged on.  The nature of the agreement is so tenuous and dishonest that it cannot survive any serious examination. It is absolutely vital that the Minister should come clean and say categorically, whether he is prepared to recognise the right of PDFORRA to exist and whether he is prepared to recognise and negotiate with them even at this very late stage.  Anything else is inviting members of PDFORRA to buy a pig in a poke and they would be very foolish to agree to it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have already put down an amendment to the Second Stage of this Bill in the following terms:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading until such time as&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  the constitutionality of the measures proposed in the Bill shall have been established;</P>
    <P>(b)  the substance of the regulations proposed to be made by the Minister is made available to Dáil Éireann; and</P>
    <P>(c)  consultations have taken place on all relevant matters between the Minister and all <Col N="530" /> interested parties to the Bill, including the democratically chosen Association currently representing members of the Defence Forces, the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association.  </P>
    <P>If it was not entirely clear to everyone why such an amendment was necessary before, it must surely be very clear at this stage.  The overtures between the Minister and PDFORRA, no matter how else they can be viewed, can only be seen as making many of the features of the Bill entirely redundant.  As we have already said perhaps the worst feature of the Bill is the position in which it places people who have been campaigning, perfectly democratically and legitimately, to establish an association.  That association is in place, it has 8,000 signed up members and it has a constitution which explicitly recognises many of the Minister' concerns. Its officers clearly are people who have the interests of the professional Army at heart.</P>
    <P>From my meetings with the representatives of the association I would say they are men of integrity and that they are concerned about many of the serious problems which face the personnel in the Army.  Unfortunately the Minister's reaction and the Government's failure to respond to the overtures being made by this association has led us into a very unhealthy situation whereas the elected officers of PDFORRA had been trying to do things in a very democratic, sensible and restrained manner.  At all times they sought the consent and agreement of the Government in setting up a representative association, which is the norm in other armies.</P>
    <P>Despite their long and detailed efforts over the past number of years they are in an invidious situation in regard to the Bill before us.  It looks like the effect of this Bill will be to outlaw the association as it now stands, to make it illegal and to make it a criminal offence for anyone to seek to recruit members to it.  This is a retrograde and regrettable step because the Bill places democratically organised soldiers in the position of being members of an <Col N="531" /> illegal organisation.  These people are far from being members of an illegal organisation: they are honest and sincere individuals who are serving this country quite often in bad conditions and circumstances. It is time we faced up to this. Not alone is the proposition which runs throughout the Bill absurd, but it is scandalous.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the Bill, I am convinced it will not pass the test under the Constitution.  For example, section 2 (4) of the Bill will be in clear contradiction of Article 46.3. of the Constitution unless the Minister can prove to the satisfaction of the House that his association will be in the public interest, while the association which have already been established, are not.  That section of the Bill makes it illegal for members of the Army to be members of PDFORRA. This begs the question; what will the Minister do if the 8,000 members of that association believe they have a constitutional right to belong to it and the Minister has no right to deny them their constitutional rights?  What will the Minister do if those 8,000 members refuse to resign from PDFORRA?  I repeat that these people who are serving our country are very reasonable and have been on a very orderly mission.  It is very important, even at this late stage, for the Minister to change in mid-stream and allow these people the recognition they are seeking. If this is not done we will end up with a totally chaotic situation.</P>
    <P>There are matters mentioned in the statement this morning which the Minister will have an opportunity to clarify when he is responding to the debate this evening.  He may be able to elaborate on the statement issued in regard to the meeting last evening between Deputy Hillery and Deputy Kitt and representatives of PDFORRA.  While I regard the framework for those discussions to be a little amusing to say the least, I believe that if the Minister for Defence wants to do business he should do it as the representative of the Government rather than send backbenchers who are not charged with doing business on behalf of <Col N="532" /> the Government.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate the proposals in relation to the ballot, what further discussions will take place and whether he will be meeting with the officers of PDFORRA.</P>
    <P>Given the reasonable statement made by the spokesman of PDFORRA this morning, in line with all the statements he has made both at meetings and publicly and for which he has been brought to task by his superiors, it is very important for the Minister to clarify that aspect of the statement which refers to the talks, including the structures, by which the members will be elected and the means whereby open and honest consultations &mdash; I have to ask what dishonest consultations are &mdash; can take place with all interested parties.  I have to assume that the Minister or those appointed people acting on his behalf will only be conducting honest consultations; I do not believe they will engage in dishonest consultations. Perhaps the Minister will avail of the opportunity, when he replies to the debate without interruption this evening to clarify why he did not go about his business himself.  As Minister for Defence he is charged by the Government and the Oireachtas to do this.  There is a very serious problem in regard to the Minister's failure to meet the representatives of the Army and the National Army Spouses Association.  Why, at this late stage, did the Minister see fit to send Deputies, for whom I do not have personal disrespect, to meet these representatives? The Minister and the representatives of the Department of Defence should have shown the courtesy of meeting with representatives from these organisations.  It is reasonable to assume that there are still problems behind the scenes, whether in regard to the command within the Army or senior officers.  Perhaps what we should be looking at in this very terse and curt statement issued after 11 hours of meetings is what is not said rather than what is.</P>
    <P>The questions in regard to the status of PDFORRA and their rights highlight the ludicrous nature of the Bill. Obviously the Minister would not attempt to court-martial the 8,000 <Col N="533" /> members of the Army, put them in jail or cashier them out of the Army, for exercising what they believe is their constitutional right.  Obviously these people know the Minister is trying to pass a law which is both enforceable and antidemocratic. I doubt very much if they are going to stand by and allow him to railroad them into an association which does not belong to them.  Central to their aspirations is the wish to have a major say in the structures of their organisation. As I said at the outset, they have gone about seeking this in a very orderly and civilised manner.  This warrants similar reciprocation by the Minister and Government to their request.</P>
    <P>Obviously I have grave worries about the constitutionality of section 6 of the Bill.  I should be very grateful if the Minister would, at the earliest opportunity this evening, lend his voice to those which have been raised in this House in regard to the constitutionality of section 6.  This Bill is doomed in its present format and if section 6 is passed as it is before us, I do not believe it will stand up to a constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>If we put the best possible construction on what has happened to date and the fact that negotiations and consultation in some form are now under way, the only sensible course for the Minister and Government to take is to withdraw this Bill in its entirety and come back to the House with a Bill which is properly drawn up and which reflects any agreement reached in the discussions which started last evening and lasted for 11 hours.  If this could be achieved it would allow for a very quick passage of the Bill through this House, which the Government seem intent on securing.  If the Minister takes the opportunity to follow from the discussion of last night and take the lead in discussions with the representatives of PDFORRA, I believe this House would allow for a very easy passage of a Bill which would reflect an agreement reached by both sides.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying this evening perhaps he will take the opportunity to clarify section 8 (3) which deals with the date on which the Bill will come <Col N="534" /> into operation.  Given that negotiations started two to three years later than they should have, I ask the Minister to clarify if there will be a different time scale for the coming into operation of the Bill.  If the Bill is passed in its present form it will certainly be subject to constitutional challenge and, given the winds of the Supreme Court at the present time to read into our Constitution far beyond what was thought possible a week or two ago, I suspect that they would quite likely find that this Bill infringes the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Obviously my efforts to seek a withdrawal of this Bill will fall on deaf ears, but in the hours available to the Tánaiste before he concludes, I would urge him to reconsider what is in the opinion of the Labour Party a shoddy piece of legislation which will not achieve what it sets out to achieve.  We would do a far better day's work if we were to go back to the drawing board.  Negotiations have commenced and I would urge the Tánaiste to take a lead in those negotiations himself and set about bringing a conclusion which would meet with the warm approval of this House.</P>

      <P>In view of the absence of up to date information regarding relationships between the Defence Forces and the Government and the determined refusal this morning to provide such information, I can only view the eleventh hour attempt at consultation with suspicion.  I question the relevance of this legislation though at this moment I have no option but to address the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>As a representative of the South Tipperary constituency living adjacent to Clonmel where there is a substantial presence of the Defence Forces, in Kickham Barracks, I am deeply interested in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the 12th Infantry Batallion on their commitment and loyal service not just in their local area but internationally in peace-keeping duties over the years.  Theirs is an honourable and admirable contribution. By their service they have earned for us as a nation much international praise and acclaim.  I must therefore remind the Tánaiste that this Bill is addressed to a most reliable, dedicated and responsible section of our society who cannot either by their record or by the very nature of their occupation be ever regarded as selfish, irresponsible or untrustworthy citizens.  The extent of our dependence on their work surely warrants a far more reasonable response from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is to provide for the establishment of associations for the purpose of representing members of the Defence Forces on remuneration and such matters as may be prescribed by the Minister.  We must remember that so great has been the dissatisfaction of the Defence Forces in the past couple of years on pay and conditions that in sheer desperation they have decided to snub the authorities and set up their own association, PDFORRA.  One would <Col N="536" /> have hoped that this Bill would have eased the unrest, the total dissatisfaction and the soured relationship between the Defence Forces and the Government. Unfortunately the Bill has done nothing in this regard; it has exacerbated the situation, leading to the present impasse and provides no hope at all of the future satisfactory and acceptable relationship.</P>
    <P>The PDFORRA who were forced to publicly clamour for, beg for, and demand proper conditions and acceptable pay rates are now trodden on yet again by the total lack of recognition of their wishes, their opinions and their views on the establishment of their representative association.  PDFORRA now have the support of more than 8,000 of the 11,000 NCOs and private soldiers and are preparing to hold their own democratic elections while the Minister for Defence claims his proposals for the representative structure in the Defence Forces meets all the demands of PDFORRA.  Nevertheless there is a fundamental difference over consultation.  A meagre attempt, apart from the 11th hour effort last night, was made by the Minister to provide consultations by the provision of a 50-page booklet to all the ranks of the Defence Forces.  This is not consultation, merely information.  The Minister should realise that consultation is necessary and desirable if a major rift is to be avoided.  Unless some move is made soon to break the impasse there could be two sets of elections in the Defence Forces in the coming months with the distinct possibility of the whole affair deteriorating into an irredeemable state.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I claim that this Bill is a lost opportunity to tackle and resolve a long-standing and bitter division which will have to be confronted ultimately. This Bill is an insult not only to the Defence Forces but to the Members of this House who are being asked to vote through a Bill without any knowledge of its scope or impact, and the Defence Forces are called upon to elect representatives to work in a totally unknown framework.  Furthermore, if the recently circulated booklet is the basis of this <Col N="537" /> framework, then ones fears and doubts are vindicated.  It is unacceptable that a member cannot be deemed eligible for election unless his conduct rating is not less than good.  Surely this leaves room for abuse and could be used to disqualify a potential candidate.  It is potentially dangerous and should not in any circumstances be accepted.  Further unacceptable sections include one that provides that a civilian who endeavours to persuade a member of the Defence Forces to join a trade union would be found guilty of an offence.  This is a total infringement of the right to freedom of speech and is so extreme that this section can only be considered a nonsense.</P>
    <P>Other areas of concern include the question of access to the media whereby all statements made by the representative body of the Defence Forces must be made at Army headquarter level.  I would also worry about the provision that all meetings must be held within the military installations.</P>
    <P>The Bill is far too restrictive and undemocratic.  It gives the Minister total and absolute control over the Defence Forces and eliminates the right of members to be represented in an independent way.  It is merely an attempt to railroad the constitutional rights of the members of the Defence Forces.  I find it unusual that, though prepared to allow our soldiers to go out with guns and risk their lives, the Government do not trust them to form their own representative association without imposing ridiculous restrictions.  Surely this is paternalism gone mad.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of the proposed representative association depends on whether it is fair.  Any structure which is not seen by the majority to be fair will not work.  The structure being imposed without sufficient consultation or communication will not be fair and ultimately will not work.  I am not satisfied that this Bill can provide the framework for an independent representative structure. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult now to respond to this Bill in the light of <Col N="538" /> developments in the past 24 hours.  One already found it sufficiently puzzling to deal with the reasons that a Bill as flawed as this one should have been advanced in the first place.  More specifically, it seemed very difficult to consider this Bill in isolation from the document circularised by the Minister to the spokespersons of the various parties and permanent Defence Forces representative groups.  One could only conclude that that document contained the essence of the regulations the Minister proposes to make.  That document is not before the House for debate but it has been widely circulated within the Defence Forces.  I do not know what its status is. When challenged on it by a number of Deputies the Minister seemed to suggest that it was an Army document distributed within the Defence Forces, apparently not necessarily having the imprimatur of his Department.  That is the document from which the regulations will derive and it gives additional serious cause for concern about the nature and provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may well have said it but until he introduced the Second Stage of this Bill he did not recognise the existence of PDFORRA.  No discussions took place between him and <Col N="539" /> the organisation established to represent the members of the Defence Forces.  That was the situation up to last night.  If it means that even at the eleventh hour the Minister has been convinced as a result of contributions in the House that consultation ought to have taken place and must take place, especially having regard to the constitutional doubts which have been raised about the Bill, I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I take from the Minister's remarks that the midnight discussions with two backbench Deputies in his party have his blessing or were, as reported in the news media this morning, instigated by the Minister.  It is important that the Minister should address that point.  Did he instigate the discussions that took place for some eleven hours last night or were Deputies Kitt and Hillery acting at their own behest?  I can hardly think that they were when looking at the contributions made by these two Deputies to this debate.</P>
      <P>I will confine myself to referring to the contribution by Deputy Kitt, the Daniel O'Donnell of the Fianna Fáil Party, who was obviously dispatched like Vera Lynn in wartime to sing the troops into harmony and agreement with the Minister. Deputy Kitt's contribution is extraordinary having regard to the fact that he is now the main bridgehead between the Department and the Minister on one hand and the 8,000 members of PDFORRA on the other hand.  Deputy Kitt stated:</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy McCartan when advocating the establishment of PDFORRA.  I can only describe such an approach by an elected Member of Dáil Éireann as reckless and irresponsible. </P>
      <P>This is from a man who apparently is the Minister's hope for successful consultations with PDFORRA, attacking Deputy McCartan for advocating, as he has done from the very beginning, the establishment of PDFORRA.  Deputy Kitt continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, the organisation of the <Col N="540" /> Defence Forces is a matter for Government. </P>
    <P>He continued in the course of his contribution to support entirely the stand taken by the Government, right up to the stage of recent answers in the House by the Minister of State to the effect that to recognise PDFORRA would be in conflict with traditional Army procedure. Deputy Kitt added:</P>
    <P>This is not just another issue, it is different and unique.  I had hoped that they would have waited for the Minister's proposal, allowed this legislation to evolve and the democratic process to unfold.  Careful consideration was required to provide for the setting up of these associations to give a voice to the members of the Defence Forces while not compromising the essential military systems of command and control. The Minister got the right balance. </P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan is a spokesman for the PDFORRA and he spoke today on their behalf.  He said he would wait for the outcome of the Minister's deliberations but I find it difficult to take that kind of thing when we are dealing with such a delicate and sensitive matter.  The same Defence Forces' representatives appreciate that one should not be involved in a destructive manner in this debate and it is difficult to accept that a TD would approach such a debate with this attitude. </P>
    <P>This is extraordinary coming from a TD who lost his beauty sleep last night in trying to bail the Minister out of a situation which everyone is surprised the Minister got into in the first place.  He inherited from his predecessor an extremely difficult issue &mdash; perhaps a difficult portfolio, having regard to the way this portfolio has been treated by successive Ministers through the years.  Most of us who have a very high regard for the Minister's particular brand of conciliation and reconciliation did not anticipate that <Col N="541" /> he would introduce to this House legislation which has compounded the errors of his predecessor.  On all sides of the House there is surprise that the Minister should have introduced such a shoddy, fatally flawed, provocative Bill that seems to make the situation worse and diminish the already low morale of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I speak from some direct experience of this.  It is not that I have a great knowledge of the Defence portfolio and it is not that I have taken the kind of interest I should in the welfare of the Defence Forces until recent years, in common, I suspect, with a great many Members of this House.  I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to attend at GHQ and at Collins Barracks with my colleagues in The Workers' Party to discuss some of these issues and to get a briefing, as we did very effectively and efficiently. I thank the Minister for any involvement he may have had in arranging it.  I found it most interesting in terms of the view the Army have of themselves, their role, functions, traditions, history and aspirations for the future.  I also had an opportunity to talk directly to some of the enlisted personnel and obviously the issue for discussion was the current dispute with the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>Even among the Defence personnel themselves &mdash; and they do not claim to be particularly knowledgeable about politics or day to day political events and they certainly do not publicly proffer any view on them &mdash; they expected that the present incumbent, the Minister, would have dealt with this matter and the mess he inherited in a more enlightened and conciliatory fashion.  They are genuinely appalled that the Minister would have sought to introduce a Bill which, as I interpret it, effectively seeks to suppress the organisation already in existence.  I can read it in no other way.  As I understand it, the organisation PDFORRA born in the circumstances we all know about is an illegal organisation under this Bill.  There is no other way one can read the limitations that are placed in the Bill. Section 2 (4) reads: &ldquo;A member shall not <Col N="542" /> become or be a member of a trade union, or of any other body... which seeks to influence or otherwise be concerned with the remuneration or other conditions of service of members&rdquo;.  That can only mean that if the very large or predominant number of the Defence Forces who are currently in an organisation other than the organisation the Minister proposes to set up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I take your point.  I saw a splinter of light there in the sense that the Minister now seems to be saying that it is possible for PDFORRA to emerge as the representative association after this Bill is enacted whatever the eventual form will be.  If that is the case it is very welcome, but we will require a great deal more detail from the Minister explaining <Col N="544" /> precisely how that will be allowed to come about.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused. We are all agreed on what is desirable, including the Minister, but it is not in accord with what is written in the Bill, which is the only thing I can go on.  That is the difficulty.  It is not that I am disputing the Minister's word or refusing to accept what he is advancing, it is just that unless the Minister, as a result of a cúirt an mheán oíche brings forward amendments to change this, it is very difficult to accept that anything is changed.  The situation is exacerbated by the fact that this document <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups,</i> is especially worrying because it predicts the form the regulations the Minister will bring in will take.</P>
      <P>The usual procedure in terms of regulations means that this House will have very little say about the content of those regulations.  The only document of which I know that can give us any inkling as to what the nature of the regulations will be, or what direction they will take, is the document to which I referred.  I still cannot believe, having regard to the manner in which it was distributed, and its terms, that the Minister would disown it and, therefore, it is a cause for concern that the regulations will be of such a restrictive nature that they will only exacerbate the provisions in the Bill.  The document is roughly equivalent to what the Minister has in mind in terms of draft regulations and it will then be too late for this House to effectively do anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious, but it is not in the terms of the legislation.  Like every Deputy in the House, I should like to pay tribute to the manner in which the Army have carried out their duties since the early days of turmoil and the foundation of the State and to the manner in which they have done the nation proud in their peace-keeping duties abroad.  I should also like to pay tribute to the role in these discussions played by the National Army Spouses' Association.  It is regrettable that things should have come to the stage where it was necessary for Army spouses to go out on the streets to canvass and lobby Members of this House, to picket the House and generally to perform the representative role which their menfolk were prevented from doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody acknowledges that Defence has been the cinderella Department but that does not excuse the fact that the last two Governments, in particular, allowed the morale of the Defence Forces to sink to such a low ebb. Members of the Defence Forces generally have a low rating in the eyes of the public and this is resented by their professional members.  Many members of the public see them as having a role to play in times of aid to the civil power, in times of disaster, when they have to clear snow off our streets or carry out essential duties during strikes by a decision of the Government.  As a trade union official I know how unpalatable it must be for <Col N="549" /> members of the Defence Forces who come from similar backgrounds and areas of the city and other parts of the country having to become involved in essential duties during a trade dispute without rancour between themselves and the official trade union movement.  It is a tremendous tribute to the Defence Forces and to the manner in which they carry out their duties and show their loyalty to the State.  It is regrettable in the extreme that they should have been driven as a result of their pay levels and other conditions to having their wives campaign for them on the streets of this city and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is especially excruciating for a single member of the Defence Forces, who subsequently gets married and starts to raise a family, to discover that he and his family have to exist on the kind of pay which he currently receives.  I suggest that every Deputy has had representations from Army spouses about this.  I know that that some members have been threatened with repossession of their homes by the Housing Finance Agency as a result of being unable to repay mortgages. Indeed, some members of the Defence Forces qualify for family income supplement.  Some members work side by side with members of the Garda in extremely difficult circumstances but are treated differently, not only in terms of pay but in the conditions that go with certain stints of duty.</P>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces have played a very laudable role in terms of Border duties over recent years but the only response from the House has been to discuss a Bill which seeks to make illegal the organisation which they themselves have founded to represent them in matters of pay and conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that we in this House should at all times seek to support the people who strengthen the institutions of our State.  The last line of defence any Government have in upholding order in the State is the Army.  I want to refer briefly to the important role the Army in this country have played in international activity over the last number of years and briefly sketch some of their <Col N="550" /> history.  The peace-keeping activities in which the Defence Forces have been very much involved go back to 1960 in the Congo where the mandate was to maintain peace.  This was probably the toughest mandate ever given to a United Nations force.  Between 1964 and 1973 our involvement in Cyprus was well recognised and there is still a small presence of 12 soldiers from Ireland in that area.  In the Sinai desert in 1973 we had a limited peace-keeping role when there was an outbreak of violence in that area. In recent times the Defence Forces have played a great role in regard to security measures and assisting the Garda in their role regarding Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1978 our Defence Forces became involved in UNIFIL in Lebanon and, as Deputies know, the soldiers rotate to and from that country every six months. The Irish Defence Forces have built up a tremendous reputation in peace-keeping activities, particularly in the Middle East. This was best exemplified in recent times by the Arab community who acknowledged the tremendous contribution the Irish contingent are making.  Some time ago, when Irish soldiers came under fire, there was a threat to the involvement of the Irish Defence Forces in UNIFIL in the future.  The Arab community made representations to the Irish Government and to the commanders of UNIFIL to ensure that the Irish presence continued. I would suggest that the contribution to international peace, and to the United Nations, in various parts of the world is the strongest motivating factor of any Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that when the Defence Forces came under fire in 1989 the Government agreed to continue our involvement even in the light of loss of life and of serious pressure being put on them because of indiscriminate action by a number of groups in the Middle East. Our involvement places the country in a good light in the international community. The Irish Defence Forces, particularly under UNIFIL, have helped to reconstruct communities.  They have a tremendous stabilising effect in the local <Col N="551" /> area in which they are involved but they do much more than just peace-keeping. They assist in bringing local communities together particularly in the Middle East.  They are involved in dispensing medical aid and in assisting communities to protect their schools from attack; they protect communities from being shot at, particularly by the South Lebanese Army in the Middle Eastern area.  They have protected schools and children admirably in recent times.  The local communities in response, recognise their involvement and have come to accept that the protection of their children from the threat of guerrilla activity has become part of the way of life at present.</P>
    <P>The disadvantage of our involvement is that many Army personnel are forced to go to places like Lebanon due to their frustration at the low level of Army pay. When you discuss their financial situation with Army personnel, many of them readily admit that they seek to go on international peace-keeping duties because of the inadequate level of remuneration at home.  It must be recognised, whether people like it or not, that pay is a contributory factor in people wanting to go to those areas.  That is a fact of life.  The Government could have saved our Army much embarrassment if, around the time they accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, the Minister for Defence was able to bring about a successful end to negotiations on Army pay instead of bringing the wives of Army personnel onto the streets.  That was regrettable and was a low point in the development of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister referred to a document that was sent to the various representative groups entitled <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups.</i> He indicated that this is a document from the Chief of Staff.  In the opening paragraph, headed Consultation and Representation: Government Proposal, the Chief of Staff indicated that: &ldquo;The documents accompanying this letter set out the <Col N="552" /> Government's proposals as issued by direction of An Tánaiste for a system of consultation and representation for all ranks of the Defence Forces&rdquo;.  That is not a letter from the Chief of Staff; it is a letter from the Minister for Defence, through the Chief of Staff, to the various Army personnel indicating what the Government proposals are.</P>

That clearly indicates that the Minister did not consult with the permanent Defence Forces but issued Government proposals in advance of any consultation taking place.</P>

      <P>Whatever the worries, the fact is that they are very good proposals for discussion, prepared by the Army general staff at headquarters.  The document is a basis for consultation and discussion which I hope will prove fruitful. I am going 95 per cent of the way with what PDFORRA want and that document goes 95 per cent of the way with what they want.  There are one or two differences within it but they can be ironed out by discussion and consultation. I have said that many times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is seeking to establish structures in the Army without any consultation whatsoever as regards what are being set up to do.  The Minister will have to accept that it is crazy &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; to have elections for some representative group enshrined in legislation, established by Statute, when these people do not know the terms of reference under which they are being elected.  It would be very wise if the Minister, in the course of his remarks this evening, would outline what amendments he will be introducing to enshrine in the legislation the precise terms of reference under which the elections will be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would want to outline it a little more clearly.  He has gone some way towards forcing elections on Army personnel, as I have said, with no say or direction and he has advised that they should meet every two months. <Col N="554" /> Many of the Army personnel will wonder what role they should adopt if the direction is not given in the legislation.  I look forward to clarification on that issue later in the debate.  As Deputy Rabbitte has said, consultation after elections is certainly no substitute for hard political action.  The Minister should set out, by consultation, in advance of elections what he expects the Permanent Defence Forces to do.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that there is no clear recognition that this new body will have the same professional approach as other representative associations involved in security aspects of the State, such as the Garda.  There is no provision for full-time staff in the establishment of this organisation.  On a parochial note, I am disappointed that under the proposals regarding officers' representatives set out by the Minister for Defence, no mention has been made of a representative of officer rank from James Stephens Barracks in Kilkenny, my own constituency. That is probably an oversight and something that I hope will be rectified in the course of the deliberations on this legislation. If the higher ranks of the Army are agreeable to the Government proposals as outlined, I think it would be fair to say, that they are out of touch with the reality of how privates and officers on the ground feel, that they have no involvement with the Gleeson Committee who are reporting on the various issues that have arisen over the past few months on pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>I think it would have been wiser if the Minister had declined to publish the legislation on the Defence Forces until the Gleeson report had been published. Part of the problems, the lack of consultation and the confusion that has arisen, could have been eliminated if the Gleeson Committee which the Minister had established were in a position to give their views on the problems of pay and conditions in the Army and throughout the Defence Forces.  I presume that many of the recommendations they will be making in due course could be enshrined in the legislation which will go through the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I suggest the Gleeson Committee will not be too complimentary on the attitude of the Minister and of the Government to the problem of pay in the Army.  The Minister is seeking to set up a permanent Defence Force representative association under the Defence (Amendment) Bill in advance of criticism which he may get from the Gleeson report for not having done so until now.  The Minister may be jumping the gun in relation to many of the important recommendations that the Gleeson report will make.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted, at present will not assist officers in relation to pay and conditions. I hope that the various special pay awards which were announced in December 1988 and which have yet to be completely implemented will not be the precedent for the inaction and sleight-of-hand in making a public relations stunt out of the very serious issue at the time. There is great unrest and dissatisfaction in Army circles in the way the special award is being implemented and the failure to implement it in full even at this stage.  I regret that Army personnel will have to go through various channels in order to have the Department of Defence deal with pay and conditions.  I suggest to the Minister that any Army officer or private should be able to get in touch directly with the Department of Defence in regard to pay and conditions rather than having to use cumbersome bureaucratic machinery to resolve such problems. We should not establish wholesale bureaucracy in order to prevent people getting information on their pay and conditions. We have a precedent for this in the Department of Justice and I think similar facilities should be afforded to Army personnel.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to know, and perhaps the Minister could refer to this in summing up, his policy with regard to promotions and overseas service.  I hope the Minister will be able to clarify what contribution the new structures will make to promotions, overseas service and conditions.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, discussions must take place in advance of elections for the new <Col N="556" /> structures that the Minister proposes to put in place.  If, after the elections, there is disagreement between the Minister and the Defence Forces, will he consider submitting that disagreement to conciliation and arbitration?  If the Minister is agreeable to do that, why not include the procedure for binding conciliation and arbitration in legislation?  I hope the Minister will respond positively to this point. I call on the Minister at this late stage to consult with the various <i>ad hoc</i> representative groups at present established in the Army and Defence Forces and avert further disagreement and embarrassment in relation to this matter.  In the context of discussions and consultations in advance of the elections I hope the Minister will be able to resolve any outstanding differences he has with PDFORRA of any other representative groups that he will meet from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this very important Bill.  Over the past number of years members of the Defence Forces have expressed their concern about the fact that they have not got a representative body such as the Garda Síochána have.  However I have to take umbrage at some of the comments made by members of the Opposition who have given the impression that this whole question has only arisen in the past 18 months to two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair to put on the record that in the period 1983-87, during the term of the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition Government, little progress was made in setting up democratic structures by such progressive-minded individuals.  There is a need in this day and age for a representative association in the Army so that members of the Army can discuss their problems with the powers that be.  The Army, Navy and Air Force are unique as they are the protectors of society, and their position is not analogous to the workforce in general.  Therefore we <Col N="557" /> would have to look at the setting up of associations in a different way from that in which we look at the unions in the normally accepted sense.  This has been a difficulty over the years in the setting up of representative associations in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>When we came back to power &mdash; and the Minister has made this clear, but some members of the Opposition have not been listening to what he has said &mdash; he and the Government saw the need for a change in the treatment of the Defence Forces.  The Taoiseach announced two major developments in July last: the setting up of an independent commission to look at the question of remuneration and conditions of service &mdash; and I understand the Commission are due to report in June of this year; the establishment of a new structure, and this is what the Bill refers to. PDFORRA which is an <i>ad hoc</i> institution formed by the Defence Forces is a good base for the new representative associations.  One of the problems they face at present is that effectively they are nothing more than a talking shop and have no legal basis.  I understand that the representatives of PDFORRA, who will stand for election, will be involved in the drawing up of regulations.  I also hope that PDFORRA will become a representative body to the benefit of the members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>What I cannot accept are attempts by members of the Opposition parties to spout misinformation.  In recent days they have attempted to mislead the public about what the Government intend doing.  It is unacceptable that the so-called responsible Opposition should attempt to misinform the general public and the Defence Forces about what the Minister is attempting to do.</P>

It is important <Col N="558" /> to state also that a fear is being put into the wives of Defence Forces personnel that it is quite likely they will be banned if there is an association such as NASA but this is far from the truth.  Their association may continue in existence if they feel this is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I first take up a number of the points made by the previous speaker, Deputy Ahern, about misrepresentation. At its best the Bill is rather woolly.  It is also enabling legislation.  I am aware from radio reports of the marathon session which took place last night and into the early hours of this morning.  However, I have to admit that I have not read the newspapers.  Like all other hardworking Deputies in this House I do not get the <Col N="559" /> opportunity to listen to the radio and I am not aware of what may have been said today.  I would agree that it would have been of help if the Minister had made a statement at the beginning of this debate today and clarified what exactly is going on.  I, for one, do not know what is going on and some of the things I may speak about here may have been thrown out or accepted last night.  Without putting the blame on anyone, though the buck stops with the Minister, we should be told what is going on.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Army who down through the years have stood by this country.  They have always been available and any time a problem arose, be it flooding, fire, a disaster or whatever, they were asked to step into the breach.  They have always done so willingly.  They have also given of their services abroad and some have paid the ultimate price.  We are all very proud of the Army but pride in itself is not enough.  We have to make sure that they get a fair crack of the whip. The fact that the wives of some Army personnel played such a leading role prior to the election &mdash; some of them even stood for election &mdash; is an indication things were not going well in the Army. It is good that legislation is being introduced, whether it is the correct one or not I do not know at this stage.  From the foundation of the State we have always had their support and we should do nothing that would result in our losing that support.  The Minister indicated earlier that he is holding discussions but it does not appear that these discussions are proving very satisfactory from the point of view of Army personnel.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect Army personnel to work for a pittance.  I believe that their claim for parity is genuine.  I also do not know how we can expect to maintain standards given the fact that education has improved.  Many moons ago people with a low standard of education could get into the Army but the entry qualifications have risen as the standard of education has risen.  If we want to attract people into the Army we will have to make it worth their while.  As I said, <Col N="560" /> we cannot expect them to work for a pittance; if we do we will not get people of the right calibre, and we do not want that.</P>
    <P>I would like to highlight one of the cribs of the Army which may or may not have been referred to.  Army personnel in the Curragh have full medical facilities free of charge but that is not the case for those who live at home.  While this aspect may not come within the ambit of this Bill, the Minister should take a look at it.  This is a longstanding grievance but it can be rectified at little cost.  The principle is more important than anything else.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with members on active service.  I am sure the Minister will clarify what is intended later but that section fascinates me.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>an association shall not represent, or have as a member of any governing or other body or committee of the association, a member who is on active service. </P>
    <P>I always thought that the members of the Army were on active service but perhaps there is a special definition of that term.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which may be introduced in two months' time, contains the word, &ldquo;may&rdquo;, in three places.  It states that the Minister may provide by regulations that an association for members of a specified rank or ranks of the Defence Forces may represent such members serving outside the State and concludes with the following words, &ldquo;as may be specified in the regulations&rdquo;. I do not know if the wording was prepared by senior civil servants or by the parliamentary draftsman, but I suggest that the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; should be used in its place.  We must bear in mind that the Minister may, if he so wishes, not do anything.  It does not make sense to include the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is the type of provision that makes one worry in a democracy like ours.  I am worried about what we will finish up with.  It states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" />  (1)  A person who is subject to military law shall neither endeavour to persuade nor conspire with any other person to endeavour to persuade a member to join a trade union or other body (other than an association) referred to in section 2 (4) of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person who is not subject to military law who endeavours to persuade or conspires with any other person to endeavour to persuade a member to join a trade union or other body (other than an association) aforesaid shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to the penalties provided for a contravention of section 257 of the Principal Act.  </P>
    <P>The punishment under that section is quite heavy.  Will the Minister accept that the section leaves the door open to all types of threats and fears?  A politician who in discussions with a member of the Defence Forces may suggest that he or she is entitled to be represented may find himself or herself having to serve a sentence in goal.  The Minister should explain that provision in the course of his reply.  It is my hope that it does not have the serious connotations that many people have taken out of it.  If it has, we are doing away with democracy.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that this is an appropriate time to let the Offaly farmers out of jail.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that we gave priority to introducing comprehensive round testing in 1987.  The establishment of ERAD to which the Deputy referred was a major factor in taking out reactors.  The fact that it was set as a target by the board of ERAD would ensure, to the maximum extent possible, with the co-operation of the farmers, whose co-operation is vitally necessary, and of the veterinary practitioners, that the level and incidence of reactors would be scrutinised in a very strict fashion.  All of those factors, plus <Col N="567" /> perhaps some others, would have contributed to the identification and removal of an increasing number of reactors.  I would hope that that level of action and success &mdash; if I may call it that &mdash; would in time, if not next year, the following year, result in a reduction in the numbers remaining in herds.</P>

Therefore, how can it now be said, after years of testing, that it is likely &mdash; these are the words of the ERAD director &mdash; that there are at least 10,000 such animals in this country every year that have not been identified?  From a veterinary point of view, how is it that on the first occasion on which animals are tested and a certain strength of tuberculin is used, if the disease is found to be present, the dose is doubled on the second occasion?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission's proposals on agricultural prices for 1990-91, in general, represent a continuation of the restrictive price policy which has applied since 1984. However, in the case of a number of member states, price increases are proposed because of &ldquo;green&rdquo; currency adjustments &mdash; in our case this would amount to 2 per cent for products other than beef, the maximum available to us. The corresponding increase for beef was obtained last year.  Furthermore, there should be additional benefits to Irish producers if the rural development measures which accompany the price proposals this year are adopted in a form which is suited to Irish circumstances.  Included among these measures are proposals for the buying up and reallocation of milk quotas, extension of the suckler cow premium to smaller scale milk producers, a premium for small scale producers of cereals and a special ewe premium from 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also worth noting that for the first time in recent years the Commission has not proposed an adjustment of intervention mechanisms, a device which in the past has served effectively to reduce support for products such as beef, cereals and milk.  Nevertheless, I am conscious <Col N="569" /> of the income difficulties facing many farmers and I intend to propose adjustments to the Commission proposals to help alleviate these problems.  I would hope that agreement on the package can be reached at the next Council meeting beginning on 26 March.</P>
    <P>It will be my objective to ensure that in spite of the proposed price arrangements, the overall result will be positive for Ireland and that taking account of &ldquo;green&rdquo; pound adjustments, the support levels in these sectors of main interest to us will effectively be increased in national currency terms.  The already agreed stabiliser arrangements and the GATT negotiations currently under way are significant constraints in the price negotiations. In the interest of securing effective improvement in producer returns, however, I will also be seeking a reduction in the payment delay for products sold to intervention as well as alleviation of the basic co-responsibility levies in the milk and cereals sectors.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the related rural development measures, it is my intention to strongly support the principle underlying the Commission's proposals, while seeking to have their operational details more closely tailored towards specific Irish conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I take this opportunity of welcoming the Minister back to the House.  Arising from the reply he has given, while we agree that any price increase to the farming community naturally affects price increases generally, there must be a balance.  Therefore, we submit it is unreasonable that prices should be reduced by 4 per cent.  Right across the board, in the livestock and sheep sectors, the dairying sector and more importantly, in the disadvantaged areas &mdash; whether severely disadvantaged or otherwise &mdash; such a decline in prices would have a detrimental effect on standards. Can the Minister say what measure he proposes to take to have the situation rectified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House will appreciate that the Presidency <Col N="570" /> compromise which I propose to table at the next Council of Ministers meeting is not something I can disclose in detail now before unveiling it to the Council.  To do so would be a total breach of the standard procedures.  I have given to the Deputy and the House a general outline of the priorities I will apply in that issue.  When the Deputy looks at my reply in detail he will see what I have in mind.  Even as the proposals stand, the result would be a positive development for Ireland rather than a negative development as some have implied.  It would take me a very long time to indicate how that is the case but that is the position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I have been kept constantly informed of the effects of the recent flood and storm damage through the local Department offices throughout the country and through Teagasc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flooding in certain areas of the country has been significant, involving hardship and inconvenience for very many farm families and rural dwellers generally.  It is not, however, possible to assess the full extent of financial loss to farmers until flood waters recede, which is now occurring but loss of fodder and livestock may not be widespread although significant <Col N="571" /> in some areas and for some individuals. Storm damage has been more widespread throughout the country and has had serious financial repercussions on some farmers.  It is, of course, possible to insure against this risk.</P>
    <P>There are no funds set aside in the EC Budget for compensation for economic losses suffered as a result of storm or flood damage.  The Community's emergency aid system exists largely to help victims where injuries or fatalities are involved.  It is from this 4 MECU budget line that the 150,000 ECU for Ireland will be drawn.  This aid will be administered by the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has played a useful role in helping to establish the real extent of the recent flooding damage suffered by farmers.  Teagasc will as part of their normal business advise farmers who have suffered flood damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9 and 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The milk quota system introduced in Ireland in 1984 did not make adequate <Col N="574" /> provision for small scale producers or new entrants into agriculture.</P>
    <P>Within the limited degree of flexibility to me under the Community regulations, I have made a number of decisions since 1987 designed to redirect any quota available towards small scale producers.  In 1987-88 I introduced a restructuring scheme restricted to producers below 50,000 gallons and of these the first priority category is confined to producers below 30,000 gallons quota.  I also assisted these producers by giving them priority under the schemes for the temporary leasing of quotas and the allocations of flexi-milk.</P>
    <P>In December 1987 I introduced a clawback system under which a percentage of quota transferring with a lease is retained in a national reserve, if the lessees total quota exceeds 50,000 gallons.  One of the main objectives of this scheme is to give small scale producers priority access to quotas becoming available for leasing with land.  The House will be aware that as part of the 1989-90 prices package I negotiated a reduction in the co-responsibility levy for small producers and the elimination of it in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Finally in response to my specific request at the price negotiations in April 1989, the Commission agreed to introduce a reserve pool of 11 million gallons for small scale producers and new entrants into agriculture.  This was consequently proposed by the Commission in August and finally adopted by the Council of Ministers in November 1989.</P>
    <P>I recently announced guidelines for the allocation of this 11 million gallons of quota free of charge.  I believe that these arrangements which have been approved by the Commission are fair and equitable taking into account the varied needs of priority category producers, co-operatives and dairies in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced, eight million gallons of the additional 11 million gallons are to be allocated to certain small scale producers with quotas below 12,800 gallons.  A further two million gallons are being made available to young farmers under 35 years of age with <Col N="575" /> appropriate training and educational qualifications.  The remaining one million gallons is being allocated to other special category producers who have suffered hardship because of inadequate quotas and the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal which I recently established will deal with these allocations.</P>
    <P>The quota allocations to young farmers will be 10,000 gallons.  This means that 200 young farmers will benefit from the two million gallons set aside for this category. The allocation of the eight million gallons to small scale producers will be carried out on a flat rate basis nationally subject to the constraints I have announced.</P>
    <P>The allocation of quotas to the successful applicants will be made before the end of this month.  Investigations will have been carried out before the allocations are made to ensure that only genuine bona fide young farmers with separate holdings, herd numbers and milking facilities will benefit from the allocations.  A lottery system is being used to determine the successful applicants from this category.</P>
    <P>In general, therefore, it is evident that since taking office in 1987 my concern under the quota system has been, where possible, to allocate additional quotas to small scale producers who would use them and not to grant them to larger quota holders who have already sufficient for their requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 23 together. Cattle numbers have increased from 5.62 million in 1986 to 5.9 million in 1989. This is expected to lead to an increase in production for 1990 and subsequent years.  The increase in numbers has been a policy priority for me since 1987 and the success of this policy is an important base for the expansion of our beef exports to Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Common Agricultural Policy Irish beef has free access to community markets.  It is essential that producers and processors exploit the potential of these markets to the fullest.  To compete effectively, we must maintain the high quality of our meat and develop the high value products which the European consumer wants.  We are fortunate that Córas Beostoic Feola, as the statutory body responsible for the promotion of beef exports, have built up impressive marketing expertise in this area.  Exports to member states on the Continent were higher in 1989 than in any year since 1986 and chilled boneless exports in vacpac form were higher in 1989 than in any of the previous three years.  Nevertheless, there are a number of factors, for instance seasonality, which militate against our maximising our potential for beef sales within the Community.  I am <Col N="579" /> having these studied as part of the major policy review which I have initiated with a view to developing more effective long term strategies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is reviewing the matter as he is not satisfied with the current position.  Is there a time scale on the review?  When might the Minister be able to report back to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put no time scale on it.  In regard to when I will report back to the House, as in every enterprise the industry itself will have the primary responsibility.  I do not want to suggest that any Government, here or elsewhere, can insist that industry will seek market outlets based on added value and vacpac. We will give every incentive.  I would expect that the review which is being done in consultation with the industry would conclude within the next few months, and then we will have an opportunity for full consultations with all concerned including the farmers who must produce beef for the market and process it in a fashion that will be acceptable to the consumer.  Those are the main priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister will not be making anybody do anything, does he not see his role as a facilitator, as the catalyst, and the Department under his guidance carrying that out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that that is the case, but he will appreciate that when it comes to patterns of production it is a matter for the producer.  I will certainly make representations to facilitate a reduction of the seasonality problem but, at the end of the day, it is the producer and the processor who guarantee whether their production and processing patterns can reduce that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must now understand that winter beef fatteners have never had it so bad for so long <Col N="580" /> and that is the reason they are getting out of production.  Is there any possibility that at the next price fixing review things will be so organised that farmers will get whatever extra benefit is available for winter feeding their cattle?  Are newspaper reports right or wrong when they indicate that it might be possible to negotiate the payment for intervention beef on a 30 day basis rather than the present 120 days?  Will that be passed on via the factories to cattle producers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a consequence of a specific commitment I got from the Council of Ministers arising from the unique importance of our beef industry, every means available will be canvassed by me to relieve short term problems. The Deputy will recall that last year we introduced a carcass intervention scheme which was successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask the producers concerned whether or not that scheme was a help to them.  If the Deputy is telling me it was not, then he is ignoring the facts.  I want to assure the Deputy that every opportunity available under EC schemes will be pursued by me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that an anomaly exists which stems from over capacity in the slaughtering area whereby small processors are discriminated against and seriously disadvantaged by virtue of the fact that they cannot qualify for any grant aid to update and extend their facilities and that this curtails the potential of those small firms to compete on the export market and open up new export markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the regulations to indicate that small processors cannot qualify.  It may be that the standards required are such that small processors are not able to meet them, but they are not excluded.  I am anxious to ensure that we have a measured approach <Col N="581" /> in relation to all and that small processors would be able to concentrate on, for instance, added value, vacpac and matters of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in his absence the food industry suffered an extremely severe setback.  I refer to the collapse of Ballybay Meats and the ensuing wild allegations and insinuations reported widely internationally.  The Department never took any steps to deal with those allegations and put people's minds at rest, and as a result the food industry got a very bad press internationally. It would not have been so bad if this had been confined within our shores.  The damage that was done is unbelievable and the Minister must take responsibility for that.  He should have dealt with it firmly and quickly but he failed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not looking for any understanding of my personal position but, as the Deputy will know, I was not in a position to deal with anything. Having said that, let me say that I and my Department regret the collapse of Ballybay Meats as much as anybody else in the country.  Equally I repudiate any suggestion that it is the responsibility of the Minister to get involved in explaining away allegations to the world at large. That is not the function of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">

However, delays in replying can occur when, for example, the information sought is not readily available or where further inquiries may have to be made to identify the precise nature of the problem.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that on every Order Paper there are written questions down to the Minister for Agriculture and Food which, on the face of it, seem to be dealing exclusively with constituency matters? On today's Order Paper there are 15 questions, 12 of them relating directly to constituency matters which could be more appropriately answered by letter. Is not the high frequency of these written questions, which at this stage is almost exclusive to his Department, an indication that the representations made by letter are not being dealt with properly and adequately?</P>

I acknowledge that there have been delays but part of the problem is the increase in the number of new schemes.  The problem of implementing these new schemes should be welcomed.

I appreciate the difficulty in the Minister's Department which has a very heavy workload of representations.  Will the Minister consider adopting the procedures which were put in place by his colleague in the Department of Social Welfare whereby written questions usually result in a telephone call with a commitment to a letter, with the withdrawal of the written question and a far greater level of efficiency?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Milk price supports in the dairy sector, such as the intervention purchasing mechanism, the export refund system and the various aid schemes for disposal of dairy products, do not take into account the size of the producer from whom the milk was originally obtained.  For control and administrative reasons, I believe it would be impossible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Agriculture and Food, I have ensured that small producers have always received <Col N="586" /> priority in cases of distribution of milk quotas under schemes operated within the EC milk quota system.  I have decided that of the 11 million gallons made available under the recent increase in quota, eight million gallons will be distributed to such producers.  The Deputy will also be aware that I negotiated the elimination of the co-responsibility levy in the disadvantaged areas and a reduction in the levy for small producers elsewhere as part of last year's price fixing agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Common Agricultural Policy in regard to blanket price support schemes takes no account of volume of production and always benefits the large producer to the disadvantage of the small producer and also to the disadvantage of the consumer?  Would he agree that the end result is that the fat cat gets fatter and the small cat goes without any cream?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the various schemes, such as intervention purchasing, the export refund system and aids for disposal of products, the Deputy's suggestion would not be practical or administratively possible as this would require those products to be manufactured and accounted for separately, depending on farm size.  That is not possible. The principal difficulty in aiding small producers in that way is due to the fact that milk price supports are applied at processor rather than producer level. A number of actions have been introduced and will be introduced at this year's price negotiations specifically targeting the small producer.  I have mentioned the reduction or elimination of the co-responsibility levy, which is effectively a price increase, for small producers. Other schemes have already been announced in great detail.  The Deputy can be assured that under all these schemes, disadvantaged areas payments, headage payments and otherwise, the small producer will remain a priority.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if some of the money now available for these schemes were to be <Col N="587" /> used directly to supplement the income of smallholders rather than to subsidise the price support schemes, we would have a better chance of keeping these people in high production areas and working on the land?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that since the introduction of the quota system in 1983 30,000 milk suppliers have ceased production, the vast majority of whom were small milk quota holders?  Would he not accept that the emergence in recent weeks of a third farming organisation, which specifically purports to represent those farmers most marginalised, the small milk quota holders and those with small holdings without a quota, is proof positive of the crisis at the lower income levels in agriculture?  What steps does the Minister propose to take?  The disadvantaged areas scheme is imperfect because it tends to benefit most the farmer who is up and running.  Would the Minister consider some form of direct income aid for those farmers in order to ensure their viability?  Their demise would mean the demise of rural society.</P>

I am not saying they are right or wrong but that is what they said. Therefore, do not misrepresent the position.  I think I had better send this to all the Deputies telling them all the action I have taken to help those small producers who were, as I said, unfortunately ignored.</P>

      <P>The question of whether it would be advantageous to promote the development of branded steak products is primarily one for the meat industry in consultation with Córas Beostoic agus Feola and the IDA.</P>
      <P>Córas Beostoic agus Feola provide a valuable service to the meat processing industry by assisting in market promotion and developments.  In the next few years the industry will also be able to draw on increased supplies of raw material from the expanding national breeding herd. This expansion has been underpinned by an attractive package of grants including the suckler cow premium, special beef premium and headage type measures. EC measures such as export refunds, aids for private storage and to some extent intervention provide a degree of support at market level.  Finally, the processing industry is assisted by selected direct grant aid from the IDA and FEOGA for eligible processing plants.</P>

Our Government have <Col N="589" /> failed to market Irish beef abroad as a distinctive product.  Why did the Minister not take that initiative on board himself? Will he agree that the seasonality nature of production affects the marketing?  Will he agree also that the total cattle numbers fluctuated very much, particularly between 1984 and 1989, and that we have a reduction of about 70,000 at present?

      <P>With CBF and the IDA the Department of Agriculture and Food are continuously supporting, assisting and encouraging the industry to get the maximum added value within the country.  The Deputy will recall that in reply to Question No. 10 the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, indicated the increased figures for exports of vacpac beef and boneless beef.  I think we are going in the right direction, but we are not entirely happy that the industry is going quickly enough in that direction. To that end the Minister said he had established a review body which will report to him in the next couple of months, indicating the direction in which the industry should be going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disappointment that Agra could not and did not feel they could continue that project.  They invested a considerable amount of money in research and development and in the purchase of the Polaroid plant at Newbridge. Following research by Agra and the IDA it was felt that the type of packaging and consumer rejection of the branded product concerned were the two main difficulties in relation to the project. Before they got too far into the project they decided to have another look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there was something radically wrong when the type of money he is talking about was spent on the project in Newbridge before the necessary R and D were carried out into the product and its acceptability to the consumer?  Is he aware of the developments in the meat processing area where there was primary, top class employment?  We are talking about vac pac, but does he agree that the employment in this area is now a yellow pack type of employment in the meat processing industry without unions, without proper rates of pay and very often on the edges of the black economy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in R and D, particularly market research, that the money was spent and before going into commercial production it was decided to call it off for the time being.  That was a sensible <Col N="591" /> approach.  Agra were quite open about their consultations with the IDA and the Department.  They said they had spent a considerable amount of money on research and development and their research indicated that this product would not be commercially viable on the European marketplace.</P>

In this case the risk involved was too great as was shown up by the R and D. There was no question of going headlong into commercial production without having the R and D done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

Will he accept also that there is a strong case to review the discarded strategy for the food industry in conjunction with the IDA in view of the many collapses that have been outlined in relation to Goodman, Agra and Ballybay and that a new food policy is required?</P>

      <P>This problem goes back to 1978 when the applicant had enormous difficulty with TB and brucellosis and his original quota was cut by about two-thirds as a result.  Will the Minister indicate whether the applicant will come within the terms of reference for an increased quota?  Has the Minister decided that all those who qualify for an extra quota will &mdash; as he suggested but did not clarify &mdash; get an equal amount of <Col N="597" /> gallonage?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments to the basic EC Structures Regulation (797/85) provided for a package of measures to curb surplus production, namely, set aside of arable land, extensification and conversion of <Col N="598" /> production.  Member states are obliged to draw up schemes to introduce these measures.</P>
    <P>The Irish scheme for the set aside of arable land was launched on 9 December 1988.  It provides for the payment of an annual premium to farmers who agree to set aside at least 20 per cent of their land for a period of at least five years.  Land which is set aside may be used for nonagricultural purposes, afforestation, non-intensive livestock grazing or let lie fallow.  A farmer who chooses the non-intensive grazing option may be paid half the full premium.</P>
    <P>Schemes to implement the EC extensification requirements are in preparation and will be introduced later this year. These schemes will involve the payment of annual premiums to participating farmers.  The use of alternative systems of farming as a means of achieving extensification is under consideration.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the third measure, conversion of production, must await finalisation by the Council of Ministers of the list of products to which conversion is to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is absolutely essential that we now start a campaign to convert farming from chemical farming to environmentally friendly organic farming? Would he further agree that it is essential that Government subsidies are introduced to help farmers because it will not be possible for them to switch immediately from chemical to organic farming? Would he agree that some schemes of subsidy is necessary in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware and this is a measure of the Government's concern in this area &mdash; that £450,000 was put aside in the budget for the promotion and development of organic farming.  I understand the Organic Farmers' Association have greatly welcomed this.  I understand also that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Kirk, made an announcement recently of specific grants from that money to deal with the <Col N="599" /> development of organic farming.  I want to assure the Deputy that environmentally friendly farming will be encouraged and promoted and we are continuing the drive against pollution which has been very successful in the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that rather than spending our money dealing with the problem of pollution that has arisen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we would be far better off dealing with the problem at source by devoting further funds to organic farming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that we are not spending our money on pollution; we are spending some of the money we negotiated with the European Community to guarantee against pollution, and I presume the Deputy would certainly want to support that.  It has been very successful, and the level of fish kills in our rivers, as a consequence of that specific action under what is known generally as the western package, has been reduced dramatically. If the Deputy suggests he is against that, I would be rather surprised to say the least.</P>

Is that included in the whole process of incentives for the change-over in agricultural production and marketing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be reviewing that matter in consultation with the Organic Farmers' Association with a view to planning a comprehensive policy. It has not been decided that all that money will be specifically used as grant aid.  The Deputy will appreciate that a whole range of policy review has to be considered, and that is being done with a view to seeing how the money can best be spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I had an opportunity during Question Time to check the papers for reference to the meeting between Deputies Hillery and Kitt and the Army but I failed to see any such reference.  Maybe it went on into the early hours of the morning or maybe it is a sign that these kinds of arrangements should not take place.  If we cannot get a report on it, even through the papers, we certainly will not know what is going on. This is probably not the right way to run the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning of my speech, one of the difficulties we have is that we <Col N="683" /> do not seem to know what is going on in this Bill.  If the Minister, even today, had outlined the position as it stands we might not have to say some of the things we are saying now.  I understand that the Minister has made a statement regarding the meeting last night and that the spokesmen have information we do not have.  I am not sure whether we are supposed to know what is going on in this Bill.  It is being rushed through the House but we intend to put down amendments to it.  Perhaps we are being kept in the dark.  I do not know the procedure but certainly if there are documents available we should all have got them so that we would know exactly what is taking place.</P>
    <P>It is a pity there is acrimony regarding this Bill.  Unfortunately the people in the Army feel they have to almost fight their way to establish their rights for representation. There are regulations concerning the Army going back to the 1800s.  The Army must have a certain line of discipline at all stages amd must obey orders.  I do not think that was ever in question but they should be able to represent themselves.  There will obviously be a long discussion between the Army and the Minister's office.  The process of conciliation and arbitration should be available to the Army so that problems can be sorted out.  We want no more argument and we do not want hassle with PDFORRA.  The Army must march in tune and it is very important that we do not put them out of step by introducing nitty gritty proposals which they are not happy with and which might make very little difference.</P>
    <P>If the Minister tries to impose his will on the Army it may achieve very little.  It may do a lot of damage and turn them sour and we do not want that.  If the disputes that arise could be referred to conciliation and arbitratiion they could be ironed out.  I think the Minister has already conceded the regulations.  There has been talk about holding meetings in Army installations.  I would suggest to him, when setting up a group, that they might meet in a hotel which would be much more comfortable than an Army <Col N="684" /> barracks which may not suit people who have to travel long distances.  That is something that, in this modern age, is slightly out of tune.  I am not sure why the Minister of State is shaking his head.</P>
    <P>There is also a regulation on good rating and as has been pointed out by my colleagues, a person whose haircut does not comply with the standard of the commanding officer might finish up without a good rating.  If such a situation could arise, it would be farcical that a person could be prevented from standing for election because he failed to achieve a good rating.  If, as accepted right across the board, somebody is fit to serve in the Army and is not asked to pack his bags and go, then he should be considered fit to stand for election.  All public representatives should defend that right.  Who can stand up and say he is perfect?  It would never do if that was the standard adopted for standing for election.  How many of us would get a good rating as TDs when it comes to standing for re-election?  We might be putting obstacles which should not be there.</P>
    <P>It appears this Bill is being rushed through the Dáil.  I hope this does not lead to difficulties and that amendments which should be considered carefully are not ignored.  I welcome the Bill in that it proceeds to give rights to members of the Army to have their own spokespersons. I appeal to Members to do nothing to worsen the position which should never have been allowed arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome the Bill.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are much aware that some five years go I initiated the discussion in this Chamber on the matter before us today. At that time, I was told in very positive terms by the then Minister and by a number of Ministers, that the Defence Forces did not want a representative body.  Indeed, that is on the record of the House and that was the position of all spokesmen and of successive Ministers. They said the Army did not want a representative body, but having spent 29 years plus in the Defence Forces &mdash; I am definitely the longest serving member of <Col N="685" /> the Defence Forces in the Oireachtas &mdash; I knew they would demand and get a representative body.  It is a proud day for me to welcome this Bill.  If the former Ministers, and in particular the previous Minister, had listened to the advice that was given by people like me, this mess that has emerged in the Defence Forces would not have arisen and there would not be this stiff opposition to some aspects of the proposals.  If both the Bill and the regulations had been circulated in the military establishments two or three years ago, they would have been more readily accepted.  The Defence Forces were misrepresented and the elected representatives took what the Department said in good faith, but a great deal of what was said was put across badly and was misleading in many respects, as emerged following the previous review. One has to accept that there is a great deal of mistrust in the Defence Forces about the whole political scene, and particularly what comes out of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army wives set up an organisation to get around the DFR regulations and then we saw the formation of PDFORRA.  On St. Patrick's Day I had the opportunity to meet with a wide variety of different ranks, officers, NCOs and men in a number of locations, particularly in the Border areas.  The general consensus was that they would welcome the main thrust of the Bill and the regulations, with certain reservations.  It was a matter of finding a way to unlock the impasse and I congratulate the two members of the Government party who took the initiative in that regard.  Someone needed to take the initiative because, under the Defence Force Regulations, the Minister could not give official recognition to an organisation which was not provided for in the Defence Force Regulations or in the Bill.  I would have proposed that the Minister leave the Bill in limbo, which he is entitled to do under section 8 (3), to allow for discussions either directly or indirectly with PDFORRA so that they could tease out the proposed regulations.  I assume that the regulations as circulated are proposed <Col N="686" /> regulations and not final regulations. There are certain aspects of the regulations that can be improved and changed without interfering with the main thrust of either the Bill or the regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill can be amended on Committee Stage and I will be suggesting a number of amendments to our own spokesperson.  I know that other members of the Opposition, and perhaps the Minister, who have listened to the debate, will welcome amendments to certain sections, in particular sections 2 and 6.  I do not think it is appropriate at this stage to start a discussion which can more appropriately take place on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of problems that have to be overcome.  One matter that came out loud and clear was the exclusion of the conditions of service from the provisions of the Bill.  The members of the Defence Forces feel that conditions of service have to be included in a much broader sense and that the terms of reference in the regulations and the Bill are far too narrow.  They are not, of course, suggesting for one minute that every time an order is given, be it a fire order or a command, people stop and question everything they are required to do.  That is not the intention but there are more aspects involved than just pay and allowances which need to be put right.</P>
    <P>It is an accepted fact that the Defence Forces have been neglected generally. While their living quarters and dining facilities in billets have been improved there is still a long way to go.  For instance, some Army barracks should have been demolished and rebuilt 100 years ago.  There is also the question of rationalisation.  It is recognised within the Army that there is too much overlapping and wastage.  Some units are not properly equipped and the transport service is a national disgrace.  I have raised that matter in the House but was told that there was no problem.  If there was an emergency tomorrow we would have to go to CIE to get buses to transport troops <Col N="687" /> as the transport service within the Army has virtually broken down.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the new representative body would want to talk about things like that but I respectfully suggest to the Minister that they should at least voice an opinion as they will have to deal with this matter on a daily basis. Not alone should we give them the pay and allowances they rightly deserve but also give them back their self-respect. The feedback we have been getting in recent times is that their pride and self-respect have been taken away from them. They have been told lies and been misled. At times they have been told that things were OK when everybody knew they were not and they have taken a constant hammering.  They must be free to voice their opinions.</P>
    <P>In many other European countries not alone are there representative bodies within the defence forces but also all-party committees within parliament made up of people who have served in the defence forces who know what they are talking about.  Unfortunately, I think the Taoiseach and I are the only two Members of this House whose service in the Defence Forces is worth talking about.  Therefore one can see that the Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public service do not really understand the feelings of the men who have to do 24 hour duty on the Border.  A former colonel in the Defence Forces who shall remain nameless, once told me that men do not do 24 hour duty and that I was wrong.  That is an indication of the level of ignorance even among former members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The real service, apart from the early days of the State, commenced in 1969.  I am aware, being a former member, of the extent of the security duty which had to be performed at a time when the Army was very thin on the ground and when the FCA carried Defence Force personnel on their backs in the Border area.  While reference is made to representation for members of the FCA in the form of Permanent Defence Force personnel serving with FCA units, there is no mention of <Col N="688" /> direct representation for members of the FCA.  We should bear in mind that most of the conditions affecting the members of the PDF also affect members of the FCA.  I suggest that provision should be made in the regulations to allow the representative body co-opt a number of experts or advisers to represent a category not generally covered by that body. There would be nothing unusual about this.  In fact it is quite common among trade unions.  I have run national groups within my own union and very often have found it necessary to bring in experts. Perhaps a special place could be found for women and members of the FCA of officer, NCO and private rank as they have a contribution to make and have much more experience of industrial relations than the members of the PDF. That is one of the problems that is going to be encountered.</P>
    <P>This is a new weapon for the members of the Defence Forces and there is no manual they can consult.  The majority of serving members have never been members of trade unions.  As I said, 99.9 per cent of them have no experience of industrial relations other than what they have learned from the newspapers, their families and friends.  Therefore we will have to be very patient.  They have waited a long time for this representative body. This is a very important step and it has to be thought out properly.  Above all, there has to be agreement between both sides.  There would be no point in asking the Army to operate under conditions they do not agree with.  We would be far better off having no legislation or regulations if we were to go down that road.  A big mess was made the last time. However the Minister seems to be handling the matter this time in a much more professional and understanding way.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters should be looked at.  First, I suggest that eventually there will have to be a second phase as, given the turnover of personnel particularly at NCO and private level, it is obviously going to be difficult to maintain continuity within the ranks.  I hope the position will improve and that serving members will stay longer now that some <Col N="689" /> of their dignity is being restored.  The second phase would be the setting up of some form of outside secretariat, in other words the representative body would be serviced by somebody recruited from outside the Army, such as a professional person or group of people who would be paid by way of contributions from the members of the Defence Forces or jointly by them and the Army.  As members of the public service will know there is not the same level of turnover or transferability in other sectors.  For example, many hundreds of members of the Defence Forces over a period of two years will have served overseas with the United Nations or other international groupings.  Many of these will have to go on courses while others will be transferred, go on the ticket, retire or leave the Army for one reason or another. Therefore to maintain continuity in the organisation the second phase should be the establishment of a full-time secretariat.</P>
    <P>I am also very interested in the question of conciliation and arbitration.  It is also the question I am most concerned about.  As I have pointed out previously, the members of the Defence Forces receive pay increases following the conclusion of negotiations carried out by the public service unit of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This unit negotiates with the Government of the day to work out an agreement for the public service and eventually this is passed on to members of the Defence Forces.  I have also pointed out and it has come out in this discussion that they have never been paid special increases unlike various other sectors within the public service whose union are able to negotiate such increases.  I am referring to national understandings and national pay agreements. The Defence Forces could not do that because there was no procedure under which they could put their case. There is no form of arbitration or conciliation for them and the Minister should give careful consideration to that.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that there is no professional expertise in the Defence Forces in relation to industrial relations. <Col N="690" /> This is a new ball game for them and that is why I welcome the suggestion that PDFORRA should have further consultations on the regulations and the provisions in the Bill.  I suggest, respectfully, to that group that they should consult with trade union representatives, preferably at Congress level, who are expert on conciliation and arbitration.  They will get only one bite at the cherry.</P>
    <P>Much of what I wish to say in regard to the Bill will have to be left to Committee Stage.  I can understand the reluctance on the Minister's part, and on the part of senior officials in the Department and senior Army officers, to broaden the scope of the provisions of the Bill.  They are afraid that to do so would create problems.  I suggest that the regulations should include a provision that the scheme should operate for a trial period of one year or, perhaps, two years.  The period should be based on the term of office to be included in the regulations. At the end of the agreed period there should be a positive review of the scheme and any changes considered necessary should be introduced.  There is no such thing as a perfect document when dealing with industrial relations and nobody knows that better than I do.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposals in the regulations for representation are reasonable. They are based on a 50:1 ratio which is the type of representation that exists within the trade union movement.  It appears to me that geograpically and by command corps and unit, every effort is being made to make the scheme as fair as possible.  There is no doubt that problems will arise.  For example, the problems of a married man with six children and those of a single person are very different. There is no doubt that conflicts will arise within the ranks because a married man is paid in a different way and his allowances are different from those of a single man but those problems will be sorted out as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider a point I wish to make in regard to the FCA.  In my view the FCA is the eyes and ears of the Permanent Defence Forces.  The members of that group are <Col N="691" /> the main link between the Army and the civil population and it would be wrong to exclude them from this whole operation. The Minister should make provision for the co-operation of a representative of the FCA.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative in regard to the Bill.  Many years ago an attempt was made by a famous FCA senior officer to form an association but not alone did he run the risk of being court martialed but he was almost excommunicated. It was considered that he had committed a mortal sin by making such a suggestion.  This is a proud day for me because I claim, whether other people agree with me or not, to be the person who initiated this campaign.  I am pleased that the changes will be made without a split being caused in the Defence Forces. If the Minister had not taken a step to the rear, perhaps an iompaigh thart or a seasaigaí ar ais, we would have been in trouble.  We were heading in that direction. It would be better if we delayed a decision on the Bill for a further period and reach agreement on all aspects of it so that we can soldier together on this issue, the political and the military.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill. I am interested in its provisions.  At the outset I should like to state that next month a new Army barracks will be opened in Cavan and I welcome that move.  I support the amendment, proposed by Deputy Nealon, calling on the Dáil to decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill until such time as the document entitled, <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups,</i> has been published generally and has been considered and debated by Dáil Éireann.  I support the amendment not because I am opposed to the Bill but because sufficient discussion had not taken place on the provisions of it.  The Minister has missed a great opportunity.  Now is the time to give the Defence Forces a full say in the running of their affairs.  Had the Minister approached this in a different way and entered into proper consultations with <Col N="692" /> the people concerned, the confusion that exists would not be upon us.  There is no doubt that there is a lot of confusion about the Bill.  It was apparent from the moment the Minister sat down after presenting the Bill and Deputy Nealon our spokesperson on Defence, commenced his contribution that the Minister was lost.  He realised that he has made a hash of the Bill.  He backed off.  He told us that there was no problem, a phrase he often uses.  I appreciate that he has solved many problems but he has many problems to solve in regard to the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are rumours circulating that negotiations took place last night between Government backbenchers and others.  The Minister should tell us if those negotiations took place.  Why is it necessary to have such hush hush meetings? The Minister is not clear on this issue.  We are entitled to know if talks took place.  Why are the Government adopting this attitude?  We have been told that the provisions in the Bill will give the Defence Forces the representation they desire and we have been asked to support them.</P>
      <P>The denial of the right to form an association contravenes the UN charter on human rights and Article 40 of our Constitution which deals with the right to form and join an association.  The Bill ignores the resolution of the European Parliament in 1984 which called on all member states in peace time to allow armed forces to participate in representative associations.  If that right had been recognised in time the formation of the Army Wives Association and PDFORRA would not have been necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill is a move in the right direction but an amount of work remains to be done on it.  I suggest that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted. Otherwise, the Minister will have to take on board a number of amendments. Many of the provisions of the Bill are unacceptable.  I am a long time admirer of the Defence Forces.  Many people, including Members of the House, see fit to criticise them and that is not right.  In <Col N="693" /> Cavan we have one of the oldest Army barracks in the country and the personnel there have had to endure very bad accommodation. A replacement is long overdue and I am pleased that the new barracks will be ready for occupation next month. The conditions under which the soldiers lived and worked in the Cavan barracks were very poor.  I am glad to say I was one of a number of people who campaigned vigorously for the building of an Army barracks at Cavan and I look forward to being present at the opening of that barracks in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have first-hand knowledge of the Defence Forces particularly in relation to Border duties.  In recent years that has become a very difficult task and personnel are daily putting their lives at risk. Many people may suggest they are off on another hike on a Border tour but it is fraught with danger.  Fortunately we have not had too many incidents but there have been a number and an incident can be sparked off at any time.  These men are prepared to lay down their lives to defend this country from undesirable elements that seek to disrupt the development of our country both North and South, and to bring about peace and unity.</P>
    <P>I recall, after we became a member of the United Nations, our troops being asked to go on a peace-keeping force to the Congo.  Again there were the people who would say it was a holiday for them but it was not very long until a number of their members had to lay down their lives when they were involved in an ambush.  People then began to realise this was not a picnic but that this was the real stuff and it did not deter subsequent units of the Defence Forces from continuing on a peace-keeping basis.  They are acknowledged worldwide for the manner in which they are prepared to face into their task and for being prepared to lay down their lives in the defence of peace. They also have the great ability to mix with the local civilian population, which is very important and is a tribute to our Irishness.  They are recognised as people who can deal with tricky situations and who can bring about a settlement where <Col N="694" /> others might create greater problems or further trouble.</P>
    <P>For that reason alone it is important that these people are given the recognition for which they have been striving for the past 70 years, since the foundation of the State.  It is sad to think that it took us until 1990 to do something about it. We had the formation of the Army Wives' Association.  I met those people. On the day the Bill was introduced in this House I had the pleasure of taking a number of them from Cavan-Monaghan to the public gallery where they could see at first hand what this Bill was about.  I can assure the Minister of State that they left this House very disappointed.  I told them all was not lost, that we would be pushing amendments.  I have met those people during the past three or four years since the association's formation.  I will admit that I was not fully aware of the difficulties experienced by the wives of those men in keeping their households together on unacceptably low pay.  It came to my notice for the first time that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul were regular callers bringing food parcels to people who were in desperation at weekends.  That is a fact of life.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions I have had to make representations to my own local authority in relation to arrears of rent not because such people were living beyond their means, not because they were wilfully spending the income they had.  Far from it; they were very frugal people, proud of their young families and trying to clothe them properly and schooling them but not having sufficient money at the end of the week.  It may be said that that is the story of many other people and I accept that, but, nevertheless, these people are in a different category and should be given a salary that would keep them in reasonable comfort without having to campaign and march to Dáil Éireann when they should be at home with their families.  I found they were genuine people who did not wish to disrupt anybody's livelihood but only to seek for themselves a reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>The formation of PDFORRA resulted from necessity.  When this Bill becomes <Col N="695" /> law, not in its present form I hope, but after it is properly amended, I wonder if the Army Wives' Association will be allowed to continue.  Having started their work these good ladies do not intend stopping when they have at last found a niche for themselves and find they can be of support to their husbands.  I hope they will not be outlawed.  Likewise, the position of PDFORRA is not clear.  In relation to people standing for election to the new association a good conduct clause will be invoked.  I understand a soldier's conduct rating is a matter of secrecy and that it is not knowledge that other members of the Defence Forces would freely have.  If a person puts himself forward for election and he is not accepted then, obviously, it will then be said that his rating was not sufficient to allow him.  That would cast a slur on him which would be totally wrong and unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 6 (2) if a person came to me to seek advice as to how a member of the Defence Forces should go about improving their lot and if I suggested that they join a union, that would be in conflict with the terms of this Bill for which I could face a term of imprisonment.  It is outrageous in this day and age that that type of thinking is still abroad and it is not acceptable.  These are points of which the ordinary decent members of the Defence Forces are aware and are annoyed about and wish to have straightened out.  Section 2 (3) states that:</P>
    <P>An association shall be independent of and shall not, without the consent of the Minster, be associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body. </P>
    <P>Again, the Minister will have the final say as to how these people conduct themselves. I think we should give them the recognition to which they are entitled and the Minister should not wave the big stick in that manner.  These are a number of items which are causing concern.  Others have been raised here by different spokespersons, all of which I can assure <Col N="696" /> the Minister are put forward in the most reasoned manner to ensure that when this Bill is finally enacted it will give the Defence Forces the representation they desire and also that it will give them something of which they can be proud. That is the least we owe them.</P>
    <P>In relation to other aspects of the Defence Forces and particularly the new barracks in Cavan, I understand that the travelling distance from their homes in Cootehill is 18 miles and that no transport service is being provided for the soldiers. This is a matter that should be examined. Those based in Cootehill and at present raising families and schooling them there do not wish to move home from Cootehill to Cavan because of the disruption to family life.  I suggest that the Minister make transport available to these people. Because of their present level of income very few have motor cars and if they have, and are away on duty, their wives would need the car for necessary household runs.  They could not bring the cars to the barracks and leave them there all day long, and certainly they are not two-car families.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to give those matters fair consideration, then we can bring about a Bill that will give the desired representation and that will meet with the wishes of this House.  The Minister will have to indicate at an early stage that he is prepared to do that or he may decide to withdraw the Bill and represent it in this House in the form in which it should have been presented in the first place.  I will conclude on that point in the hope that what we have said here will be accepted in the spirit in which it is meant and for the benefit of the people this House has supported since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a constituency which has probably the greatest concentration of Army personnel in the country.  I served in the FCA for a brief period and I know something about the Army from that level as well.  County Kildare has benefited by the Army presence for generations and some people from the towns in County Kildare serve <Col N="697" /> in the Army and in the civilian section of the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have taken issue with the Minister for Defence about the problems in the Army even though he is doing something about them.  These problems have existed for a long number of years.  As Deputy Bell said, Deputy Lenihan is the first Minister for Defence to do anything in this regard for the Army.  We might as well tell the truth about this issue.  Since I came into this House, and before that also, successive Governments never dealt seriously with the Army.  I believe we can all hold up our hands and claim blame for the problems which have arisen.  I am concerned at the lack of trust between the members of the Army and their employers, the Minister and the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>These problems did not arise overnight. As a pundit I can safely say that no matter what Government were in power before the June 1989 elections they were going to be pilloried by the Army, and it just happened that a Fianna Fáil Government were in power at that time.  I want to outline the reasons this happened. Before I came into this House I used to keep general election tallies as a hobby. In the postal vote in County Kildare &mdash; about 80 per cent Army and 20 per cent gardaí &mdash; the Fianna Fáil vote was never less than 55 per cent and on one occasion it was upwards of 76 per cent, but during the 1989 general election it was 11.5 per cent.  The majority of the votes for the Army wives' candidate from County Kildare in the general election came from the postal vote &mdash; the Curragh Army barracks and other barracks, and in one centre she got up to 90 per cent of the votes in the box.  There were 13 candidates in the Kildare constituency and people voted for every candidate on the ballot paper except the Fianna Fáil candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is enabling legislation which will allow a representative association for the Army to be established.  This is the first time any Minister or Government conceded that the Defence Forces should have any representation at all.  Within a short time of coming into power the <Col N="698" /> Government set up the Gleeson Commission. Since the foundation of this State the traditional approach by Governments was not to allow a representative association for the Army to be set up and to have their pay and conditions tied to the whim of the Minister or Government of the day.</P>
    <P>What happened to Fianna Fáil in County Kildare during the 1989 general election would have happened to Fine Gael and Labour if they had been in power.  The reason Fianna Fáil got such a hammering was that Army pay and conditions had gone to hell after 1981-82. Traditionally the Army in County Kildare voted for Fianna Fáil and they believed that when we came to power in 1987 we would do something about their pay and conditions, but we did absolutely nothing.  In addition, the famous pay rise did not turn out to be a pay rise at all. Anybody can be fooled once but it is a bit of a joke if they are fooled twice, and this is why this deep level of mistrust has now grown up between the Army and their employer, the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier this Minister for Defence is the first Minister to have done anything about these problems.  It is sad that there is such a deep level of mistrust between the Army and the Minister.  I have known Army officers and NCOs all my life and they have accepted levels of discipline and pay which people in other employment would not accept.  I think it is safe to say that never in the history of the State has morale in the Army been so low as it has been in the past three or four years.  During the general election campaign I said to a journalist friend &mdash; I asked him not to quote me at the time &mdash; that Fianna Fáil would take a hammering at the general election, that we would have to take it on the chin and that it was tough luck.</P>
    <P>It was very dangerous to allow Army morale to sink so low.  The blame for this must rest with successive Governments who did nothing about the problems in the Army for a long number of years and, in particular, the attitude taken by the civil servants in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Since 1983 junior ranking officers have made it their business to pass on to their superiors the level of discontent in the Army.  High ranking officers who came to me told me they were concerned about what would happen if something was not done to solve the problems in the Army. It is very disturbing to hear that sort of information.  If a public representative goes public about such a matter he is regarded as being a subversive.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate Deputy Bell who, long before there was talk about a general election, brought the problems within the Army to the notice of the public.  I was aware of those problems for a long time, and perhaps I should also have brought them to the notice of the public.  What is worse is that the civil servants had been made aware that problems had arisen by high ranking officers in the Army and people who were concerned about the Army.  These problems did not arise in 1989 or 1988; they have existed for a number of years.  Members of the Army were prepared to accept that times were hard and that they could not get great pay and conditions but when they were shoved to the bottom of the pile every time they were not prepared to accept that any longer.</P>
    <P>During the past year the NCOs and the officers have clubbed together to do something about their pay and conditions. I am glad that the present Minister and the Government have recognised the seriousness of the situation. Their first major undertaking when they came to power was to try to redress the problems which had arisen.  We, successive Governments and civil servants are to blame for these problems.  Traditionally the grandfathers and fathers of members of the Army served in the Army but due to cutbacks in recruitment, that closely knit community has started to break up.  Members of the Army have tended to marry younger than other sections of the population and have usually married girls whose fathers were in the Army.  The Army community is very closely knit and have great respect for authority.  These people never looked for <Col N="700" /> much.  They have lived in bad quarters and have been prepared to put up with their lot.  However, their dignity was being lessened and neither the Minister, nor anyone else cared about them. This is what has given rise to the problems which now exist.</P>
    <P>During the seventies and eighties they started to compare their pay and conditions with those of other sections of the security services.  I have often given lifts to Army personnel returning from a tour of duty in Portlaoise where they are standing side by side with gardaí on 24 hour duties, and I have heard them compare the pittance they were getting with that of their Garda colleagues who were on reasonable rates of pay.  The Department of Defence then gave them an extra few shillings a few years ago but taxed this and took a meal allowance out of it so it was an absolute joke.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the fact that this situation was allowed to develop over a number of years.  We have seen the heavy hand of bureacracy on the Army all the time.  Officers in the Curragh Camp could have told the Minister and the civil servants just how bad things were.  Long before that a report was compiled by a number of Chaplains about the terms and conditions of people living in Army quarters and how badly off people were. People went on their bended knees without making it public, to tell politicians and the Department of Defence that the situation had reached crisis level. Younger middle ranking officers knew it well and high ranking officers said that someone should do something before the situation got totally out of hand.  If a Minister had come in with these proposals seven years ago everybody in the Army would have been out in the streets clapping, but due to morale and trust breaking down in the past few years the good initiatives on the part of the Minister are not really appreciated.  What the Army are really saying is that there must be some snag.</P>
    <P>We have allowed things to go too far. It is a pity that these brillant initiatives were not taken a long time ago.  It is also a pity that there is this lack of trust on <Col N="701" /> the part of the Army personnel and that these initiatives are not appreciated.  The Army personnel are saying that there must be some snag.  They are trying to look at the fine print of the Bill, and with due cause.  They also say that if the Army Wives' Association had not existed and had not kicked up such a racket and cost the Government so many votes, nothing would have happened.  Let me be honest in saying that I do not think anything would have happened and it is sad to have to say that.  The Army have long been regarded as the poor arm of the Government and not enough attention has been paid to their problems.  The Minister is a man of political ability who has been able to move with different winds at different times within his own party, but let me give him a word of advice: if he thinks that it is enough to have the Gleeson Commission, to have this representative association, he is in for a very rude awakening.  That would have worked seven years ago.  Now we have stirred up a hornet's nest and unless it is kept under control we will never have that easy going situation that we have been privileged to enjoy in the past. People who are not in Army constituencies might not believe that what I am saying is correct but I can assure them it is.  I could have told them two, three or four years ago what would happen.  It will be a big job to win back the trust of Army people.</P>
    <P>In regard to the representative body, the question of accommodation will have to be looked at.  Some of the living quarters are a disgrace, not fit to house anybody. I know from another source that a report was compiled some months ago which advocated the need for an old soldiers' home at the Curragh Camp and that a considerable amount of work has been done on it.  It would cost the Department very little to go along with the idea as the buildings are there and they are not being used.  I hope the Minister will agree to the establishment of an old soldiers' home in the Curragh Camp.</P>
    <P>The question of housing Army people has been a vexed one for a long time.  The Army has been designated as a housing <Col N="702" /> authority.  A soldier, therefore who has served 21 years and comes out at the age of 39 taking his gratuity and who does not have enough money to buy a house of his own cannot get out of Army quarters or a house belonging to the Army. The Army then refuse to pay him his gratuity.  Kildare County Council will not consider him for a house because he is deemed to be living in a fit house and, second, they say the Army are a housing authority in their own right.  These people are referred to as overholders and are stuck there for the rest of their lives. The Army say it is a problem for the Department of the Environment; the Department say it is an Army problem and that has been the situation for many years in Kildare.  Despite repeated meetings between various TD's with the Departments this problem has never been satisfactorily resolved.  For a while Kildare County Council set aside a number of houses for Army overholders but this did not work and was more trouble than it was worth.  This problem should be considered also when the representative association gets off the ground.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with this Bill.  It is an enabling piece of legislation; but PDFORRA are reading all sort of things into it.  There are sections to allow the Minister certain powers and to make regulations for this and that.  If the trust that was there ten years ago was there today that would present no problems.  It is not there, however, and the Army think they will be screwed when the civil servants and the Minister get their hands on it.  I know the Minister, who has served in nearly all Departments and is the longest serving member of the Government, is doing his best, as are the civil servants. They must recognise, however, that there is now a different situation in the Army barracks around the country than there was ten years ago.  They are not going to take the kind of treatment they have been getting any more and we had better grow up and live with it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good one but the level of distrust concerns me.  I congratulate the Minister wholeheartedly on being the <Col N="703" /> first to take the initiative of setting up a review body, the Gleeson Commission and in putting through this enabling legislation to allow the setting up of a representative association.  I wish him well.  It is only through vigilance on the part of this Minster and of Ministers in the future that we will regain the trust that we enjoyed for many years.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I hope my colleagues who are also anxious to contribute will be afforded the opportunity to do so and that by 7 o'clock this evening the Government will have changed the dictatorial stance they have been adopting in relation to the passage of this Bill through the House.  This is an extremely important measure because it incorporates a major departure from Army tradition.  Because of this the House must get a full opportunity to debate it in detail and to make as constructive an input as possible at all Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy pointed out that this is an enabling Bill; that is the difficulty. We must look at the history of this matter.  Since 1987 the Fianna Fáil Government and subsequently the present Coalition Government have acted recklessly and irresponsibly in relation to the matter.  The position within the Army was regularly brought to the attention of the Minister and of senior civil servants but it was quietly ignored.  The general feeling among the powers that be was that the Army could not afford to protest or take to the streets and that they themselves could afford to sit quietly and do nothing about it.  Since the foundation of the State the personnel of the Army have been people of the highest honour and integrity.  In this instance the Government have failed to recognise men and women of honour and have treated them despicably in their attitude to the presentation of this Bill.  One would think they were a group of rebels or criminals judging by the way the Minister and his predecessor dealt with the <Col N="704" /> representative body who were attempting to make representations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Government have not recognised the genuine frustration throughout the Defence Forces.  The main failure here relates to the basic principle of honour: this Government have not recognised the honourable intentions at all levels of the Army from the privates to the most senior officers.  The Army distrust the Government and civil servants and they do not feel they can trust them in regard to the introduction of regulations in this House.  That is why they want incorporated in this Bill many of the proposals the Minister intends to bring forward in the form of regulations.  I can fully understand the feelings of the Army, given the history of the past couple of years.  We have seen Minister after Minister parading before various guards of honour across the country and seeing off our troops at Dublin Airport on their way to UN missions around the world where they have represented Ireland very favourably and received the highest commendations at international level.  The Ministers are the first to be seen to pose for photographs and television cameras but when it comes to doing something constructive they fail abysmally.  That sort of behaviour is to be despised.  Front and sham mean nothing; one must be judged by practical action on the ground. There has been too much sham and hypocrisy.  The result is a bad taste in the mouths of many people, particularly the privates and the non-commissioned officers.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss not to commend the spouses of Army personnel who went out and highlighted their case.  It was essential for them to do so if they were to have a decent standard of living for themselves and their children.  They have done an extremely good job in very difficult circumstances and in certain cases in the face of a certain amount of threats and subtle intimidation in the background. I commend their courage and determination in pursuing the case for the Army.  It was unfortunate that such a line had to be taken and that the Minister <Col N="705" /> did not respond positively before the spouses had to take to the streets.</P>
    <P>When one reads through this Bill section by section one finds recurring phrases such as &ldquo;the Minister may make&rdquo; or &ldquo;with the Minister's consent&rdquo; or &ldquo;as prescribed by the Minister&rdquo;.  Such phrases permeate the Bill.  A letter issued from the office of the Chief of Staff to each member of the Defence Forces specifically states that the documents accompanying the letter set out the Government's proposal as issued by direction of the Tánaiste.  The Minister and the Government are dictating terms in a way which does not suggest meaningful negotiations between the respective parties.  We are talking about decent people who respect the institutions of State and have always been the upholders and defenders of law and order, yet the Government treat them as if they were not to be trusted.  It is that suggestion of distrust on the part of the Government that is causing extreme difficulty.  It is fundamental to the security of the State and the Government must take a serious view.  They will have to do much in the years ahead to redress the difficulties that have been created as a result of their mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I welcome some movement since the initial publication of the Bill in that the Minister has agreed to two representative organisations rather than three as originally suggested by him.  We all know that there is a fairly straightforward division in the Army.  On the one hand there are the privates and non-commissioned officers and on the other hand the commissioned officers.  There are two fairly clear sets of people.  The officer ranks cover those at second lieutenant level right up to the Chief of Staff.  It is important that these two levels be properly and adequately recognised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to enter negotiations with the PDFORRA. I hope these will be real and meaningful discussions rather than the Minister's dictating to the PDFORRA the Government's decision and not teasing out what they want.  It is important that he should have parallel discussions with the officers. <Col N="706" /> Perhaps the Minister would advise the House as to whether that has been done or whether he proposes to do it.  It is important that everybody should be involved in these discussions.  The outcome should be brought before this House and incorporated in the Bill in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>Let me digress for a moment to refer to the FCA who have become very much the poor relation and not just of the Army.  They are a forgotten group, but they are very important within the community. There is a real need for the Government to start looking very seriously at the FCA and the type of accommodation the respective battalions have around the country, in most cases appalling, in which the personnel are expected to work in outlying parts.  It is also important to look at the transport facilities provided.  It is extremely important that the Government look at the recruitment of FCA personnel.  I know many of our young people have left the country and are not available to be recruited.  However, those in the country at the moment should be canvassed to become involved in the FCA because the danger is that there are other organisations out there who consider themselves above the law and who are actively canvassing and recruiting people.  Young fellows love the idea of adventure and being involved in some way or other with such organisations.  Rather than have illegal organisations recruiting these young people, it is vital that a conscious effort be made by the Government and by senior Army personnel to canvass them for membership of the FCA.</P>
    <P>We can talk then about overall accommodation, be it barrack accommodation and work facilities or barrack accommodation as far as housing is concerned for Army personnel.  Any of us who travel across the country and visit the various barracks find that in 80 per cent of cases the accommodation is substantially substandard and in some cases absolutely appalling.  People talk about corporation and county council housing and the appalling conditions relating to that.  Far worse <Col N="707" /> will be seen in some Army barracks than in some of the corporation and county council housing.  That must be addressed very quickly.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are an important institution of State and it is important that the Oireachtas and the Government give them the recognition and attention they deserve.  Since the foundation of the State the Army have served this country and the people very well at home and internationally.  We have a duty to recognise that and show our regard for them by providing the proper facilities, recognising the difficulties that have arisen and responding positively.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is proposing here this evening is not a positive or decent response to what is needed, and I can understand why there is such a reaction to this enabling Bill.  Basically it is just that, an enabling Bill.  We do not know the fine detail of the regulations that will be introduced by the Minister in due course.  It is extremely important that many of the regulations he is suggesting be implemented in the Bill, in order that there be confidence between the existing Department of Defence and Army personnel, rather than having regulations that can be changed or amended at any given time.  That could cause difficulties in regard to confidence with the Army. The reason for this lack of confidence is the entire history of the treatment of the Army in recent times by the Fianna Fáil Government from 1987 and by the present Coalition Government.  It is despicable of the Government to steamroll this Bill through the House.  It is more despicable that some of the Government backbenchers are supporting this line, knowing full well it is not acceptable among the Army personnel, and knowing from representations made to them from Army people within their respective constituencies that they are not happy with this position.  There is an onus on all of us to recognise the difficulties.  I hope that by 7 o'clock this evening the Government will have changed their minds on this issue.  As Deputy McCreevy said, we have the longest serving member of the <Col N="708" /> Government in the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, responsbile now for the Army. Deputy Lenihan has been well recognised for his ability to manoeuvre and to manipulate and solve everything.  He is famous for his &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;.</P>

I am sorry he is not in the Chamber at this moment, but maybe he is in an office somewhere where there is a monitor and he might begin to see the wisdom of changing the arrogant attitude being adopted by Government which is not his normal approach.  Usually he is a much more flexible, amenable type of person than is shown in the attitude he is adopting on behalf of the Government at the moment.  I suggest that he approach the Taoiseach and the other members of his Government and say &ldquo;There is a real problem here.  We need time to resolve this issue and to introduce considered amendments on Committee Stage so that we will have the best possible Bill passed by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted &mdash; but let me say I am delighted at the initiative taken by my two colleagues on this issue. Where the blame lies for much of the misapprehension must be stated here in the House this evening.  Very strongly I blame the history of the recent pay increase in the Army.  It was badly handled. It was not a pay increase, it was an extra allowance.  Expectations regarding it were blown up far too much and it is a severe disappointment not only in its presentation but in its final effects.  The orderly duty allowances, the prison allowances and the extra pay allowances that were granted were far too little far too late over a long time.  Deputy Michael Bell said in the House today that really since 1969 the major role of the Army has been appreciated.  Extra duties have been put upon them and equipment, but other items have not been kept up to date.  Previous to 1969 there was no political will whatsoever to give increased funds to the Army.  Only since then, when our constitutional position was in danger, <Col N="710" /> have we appreciated fully the Army's role.  The moneys increased tremendously in the seventies but that level of increase has not been maintained and neither have the standards during the terms of office of many and various Governments.</P>
      <P>Essentially this is about pay and conditions. I am not happy that a man with ten or 12 years' service in the Army is bringing home £150 a week out of which he is paying about £45 on a mortgage. I know this because I meet such men regularly when they have financial problems with regard to repayment of mortgages or county council loans.  I am not happy that such a man should depend on nixers at weekends for that purpose or look for extra duties over a period in an attempt to make up the shortfall in his wages.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with the initiative taken by my colleagues because the blame lies with the general staff in the Army who did nothing to allay any fears in regard to this.  They did not effectively campaign although I am aware of officers who are anxious to see this implemented. However, they are not given any support at higher level, they are told to sit in at meetings and not to say anything.  Very high ranking officers did not have the men's interests at heart, they created a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; position and reported that there was not a crisis.  I am delighted that the Minister, who is recognised for looking after the people in his Department, is interested in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are sending bank escorts all over the country but the banks are not contributing to the expenses involved.  I am delighted that new Japanese patrol cars have been supplied in some areas recently but many of the old landrovers are not roadworthy and are certainly not comfortable for the length of time officers and men have to travel in them compared to the police car in front of them, which very often dictates the speed at which they travel.  Any four-wheeled vehicle driven at over 55 miles per hour is unsafe because of its centre of gravity, the height of the wheels and the narrowness of the wheel base.  Some day there will be a <Col N="711" /> disaster in those vehicles.  Army escort vehicles should be up to the standard of Garda vehicles.  I see no reason for the banks not contributing to the protection of their money and this will cut down their insurance costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be asked to buy the vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not ask them to buy them but they should certainly pay for their use.  As a result of the Barna Gap robbery, escort vehicles were introduced but the banks were never asked to contribute to the cost of maintaining the men or the vehicles which are saving their face, money and insurance.  We should be told in the House why the banks have not contributed.  After all, I presume it would be a tax write-off for them but it would be of great benefit to the State and would supplement the soldiers' incomes.</P>
      <P>After so many years of non-action in the area of pay, many soldiers had built up an expectation in that regard.  They expected a decent increase but they did not get it.  The amount they got came too little and too late over a long period. There was an increase in Border duties and no consideration for the type of food they were getting.  Even on bank escort duties they had a mug of tea and a sandwich compared to the others who could dine in a hotel or a restaurant.  There was a feeling of being hard done by, certainly in relation to the type of food with which they were provided.</P>
      <P>I am not happy that the Army look after their own people when they are on exercise duties.  They do not get proper food although they are on duty for 24 hours and sometimes for 36 hours.  People may argue that the men are not serving all that time, but they have to be within 15 minutes of the barracks, which means that they cannot go for a drink or have a social evening with their wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern of the PDFORRA group and many other members of the Army was that no outside body would be allowed to give them the necessary advice in regard to negotiations, especially in <Col N="712" /> relation to pay.  There was a feeling that none of the Army people is trained to negotiate on pay and conditions.  They should have been allowed to seek the advice of an experienced body outside the Army, even if they were not affiliated to it.  They could get the advice free &mdash; or pay for it &mdash; but there is no reason for not allowing them to do so.  If they are to sit round a negotiating table they need their own personnel properly advised or trained in such matters.</P>
    <P>I have been disappointed over the last number of years at the number of privates and officers who left the Army after 21 years' service.  Indeed, many did not serve that long because they were not satisfied with conditions.  There is great goodwill towards the Army from politicians and the public.  I am aware of the outcome of the Gleeson report but it should be on a proper basis because they have not been properly paid for many years.  The departmental document contained a reference to the DFHQ about which nobody had ever heard.  It relates to the Department of Defence Headquarters.  I understood that free access to the media would be allowed but the document is ambiguous in that regard.  Will the Army be allowed to issue their own statement? Will statements have to be monitored? It states quite clearly that no matter of security, command or military discipline should be up for discussion in these matters.  They are concerned that there should be control over what their group should be allowed to say in regard to their negotiations.</P>
    <P>As I said already, there is great goodwill in this House towards the Army although there is also bluster and hypocrisy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <P>I would not say that.  I hope, when this Bill is passed, that the genuine talks will go ahead and that all the ambiguity feared by members of the Defence Forces will be cleared up before any proposals for elections are put forward.</P>
      <P>I hope there will be a reawakening of this House to the general staff in the Army.  It is as much their duty to look after the men as it is to be responsible to this House and to this Government.  They should be more enthusiastic about this matter, and be seen to be so, rather than playing the part which they have played for the last couple of weeks.  A certain amount of mistrust has built up and it is time to put that mistrust aside by showing an openness on both sides to have genuine discussions.  For the first time there has been recognition of this problem, albeit a little too late.  We should develop good relationships and ensure that the Army morale is improved and matters can be discussed openly.  After all, they are the experts in their own field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to hear complaints in various military institutions about delays of up to four and five months in getting shirts for people in the Army.  It amazes me to think they cannot even get those goods supplied.  I would re-emphasise that this Bill is about pay and conditions in the Army, and those conditions extend to vehicles, many of which are highly dangerous and should not be on the roads.  They endanger not only the lives of the soldiers but also of the public at large.  I hope commonsense will prevail <Col N="714" /> and I urge Members to think of the long term.  This matter is much more serious than many people realise, and they should not play politics with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity this morning's interruption has taken from the importance of the issue we are debating this evening but it is quite understandable in the circumstances.  The issue is very clear to most people at this stage. I suggest that we would not be discussing this Bill this evening were it not for two things: first, the election last year and second, the Army spouses.  The Army spouses played an integral part in the campaign to get recognition for the Defence Forces' fight for justice.  It is in this light that the Labour Party's amendment should be very clearly spelled out. It states that the constitutionality of the measures proposed in the Bill shall have been established; the substance of the regulations proposed to be made by the Minister be made available to Dáil Éireann and, very importantly, that consultations take place on all relevant matters between the Minister and all interested parties to the Bill, including the democratically chosen association currently representing members of the Defence Forces, the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association.  That is a very fair amendment and I hope the Minister will recognise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To rush through legislation of this nature has its pitfalls.  One of the pitfalls is that if this is not done properly nothing will be rectified.  There will still be the festering sore that has been there for a number of years.  Other Deputies have remarked that this problem has been ongoing for a considerable time, and that is true.  Anyone on the election trail last year who knocked on the doors of Army houses got the message very clearly: unless something was done these people were prepared to vote against the party in power and that is what happened. They did that very effectively.  The Government got the message very clearly and that is why this legislation is before the House this evening.  If it were not for <Col N="715" /> that election the problem would have gone on and the Army and Navy would still be working under the same conditions they had to put up with for a long time.</P>
    <P>Members of the House with experience in this area have spoken of the long hours of duty these people have to work and their low pay.  They compared their hours of duty with other people, such as members of the Garda who are much better paid and have much better conditions. The members of the Defence Forces have to endure this type of tedious duty and get very little remuneration.  For them the end of the road has come but because they were prohibited from voicing their protest, their wives came out and did a very effective job.  I give great credit to them because it was the one way the message could be driven forcibly home to any Minister for Defence or to any Government.</P>
    <P>Everybody has said the country owes a debt of gratitude to the Defence Forces, and that is true.  We are very fulsome in our praise of the Defence Forces when it suits us.  I live in a constituency where Army personnel reside.  Many of them have endured a number of hard years trying to make ends meet on very low pay.  I have had consultations with quite a number of them and they told me in no uncertain manner that they would watch the political parties to see who would endorse their demands.  It is very important that, in the House, full recognition is given to this matter and that a full debate takes place.  There is no point rushing through legislation while not really getting to the root of the matter.</P>
    <P>We have been told that conditions, pay and so on would be discussed and that is vital at this stage.  We can no longer divorce ourselves from Europe.  This point has been made many times and also applies to various other aspects of life in Ireland.  It has been said that we are all Europeans and we have to abide by the European model; yet we choose not to do so when it comes to the Defence Forces. That point has been driven home very <Col N="716" /> forcibly.  Those people sought better conditions and a very good arrangement was made with the people in Europe to ensure that they got their rights in this issue.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that last week in the House we discussed at length the Industrial Relations Bill.  We were told that what was needed was proper consultation between groups.  I can think of no better example where consultation should take place than between the Department and the Defence Forces.  Consultation is vital because any fears that exist could be expressed and allayed.  It is futile to say that two Fianna Fáil Deputies met the Army people, although I welcome any move on the part of the Minister or the Department to try to arrange consultation, but I would suggest that that is not the proper way to do so.  Hopefully the Minister will consider all the points that have been raised here this evening.</P>
    <P>We could discuss at length the various problems that exist.  We have heard examples of Army personnel on transport duty for banks, manning road blocks at all hours of the night and being called out in emergencies such as floods and fires, helping the Garda, fire brigades and so on.  For too long, all these things have been taken for granted and any Government that continue to take such matters for granted without making compensation will rue the day.  There has been a tremendous tradition of loyalty in the Army, but that loyalty has been exploited very well by previous Governments down through the years who have paid lip service to the Army.</P>
    <P>One thing that struck me very forcibly while I was on the election campaign trail was the huge problem in regard to Army housing conditions and the problems for the personnel of trying to live on their pay.  There were obvious major problems within the Army structure itself.  The message hammered out on the doorsteps was taken very seriously by most politicians. The ballot box results showed that people were no longer prepared to accept what they regarded as second class citizenship status.  I am delighted to be able to make some small contribution to the debate because I represent quite a <Col N="717" /> number of people who are involved in the Defence Forces.  I made a commitment that I and my party would do everything in our power to see that they got justice.  The amendment before the House tonight shows very clearly that justice can be done if the Minister is prepared to recognise the genuine fears being expressed and to recognise that there has not been adequate consultation with PDFORRA.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly any movement towards consultation, but I question the method and the way it has been done in this case.  It may not have been the proper way to do things, there could have been a better way.  Last week the Government took a dictatorial stance on the issue but there obviously has been a change.  I ask the Minister to go the whole hog, to accept the amendments that have been tabled and to come back to the House and show once and for all that this House is united in trying to get to grips with a problem that has gone on for far too long. People have suffered severe hardship. The Minister should indicate that the Government and the elected representatives of the day recognise fully the contribution the Defence Forces have made to our society over the years.  When the pomp and glory is taken away, what is left for the people who have gone out and risked their lives and limbs to safeguard our society?  More so today than ever, we need the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Finally, once again I ask that the Minister takes on board the various suggestions made by Deputies in this House and that what we are trying to do is to find genuine solutions to come to grips with a problem that has gone on for far too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first defence Bill that has been before this House since 1987 and it is the first really substantial defence Bill we have had since 1954.  In itself it is potentially a very significant Bill because it brings about certain changes in relation to the way things are done in the Defence Forces.  For that reason it is a Bill that needs very careful attention and very careful teasing out in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sir, I live surrounded by the Defence <Col N="718" /> Forces in the Curragh.  I am in contact with them every day in all sorts of different ways.  My father spent a great many years of his life in the FCA, so I have had that dimension to my life from as far back as I can remember.  In my experience as Minister for Justice I have seen the Defence Forces at very close quarters carry out the duties they must undertake on our behalf along the Border and in other places.  From all those contacts I am fully aware of and, indeed, admire, the professionalism of our Defence Forces and their dedication to their job. I admire they way in which members of the Defence Forces, when they go on duty, put behind them the many problems they have to cope with in their personal lives, family problems, perhaps, and the problem of trying to provide reasonable living conditions for their families.  I take some relative satisfaction from the fact that despite the slow rate of progress, we are making some inroads in a material way in dealing with living conditions for members of our Defence Forces.  It was a matter of some rejoicing in my own constituency to see that so many of the older parts of the living quarters in the Curragh Camp were being knocked to the ground because of their totally unsatisfactory nature.  We would all like to see a great deal more being done and we would all like to see a great deal more co-operation between local authorities and the military authorities to provide the kind of living conditions for serving members of our Defence Forces that we believe they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Bill we see that it has importance in a wider context than some of us had given it credit for.  It was all the more unsatisfactory, and indeed all the more incredible, that the Government should have tried to rush the Bill through the Dáil in the way they first proposed. My reaction on reading the Bill when it was published was that it said almost nothing about the central issues before us.  Everything of substance that the Bill provides for was to be done by regulation and we did not have any indication as to what was going to be in the regulations and, almost as significant, nowhere in the <Col N="719" /> Bill was there any indication as to when the Bill and the regulations would come into effect.  We were being presented with an unknown quantity and we did not know when it would come into effect.  I find that totally unsatisfactory because I do not think this House should be asked to write a blank cheque for any Minister, for the Tánaiste or any other Member of the Government.  We should not be asked to write a blank cheque for things that are not before us and I think it would be highly dangerous, and certainly most unsatisfactory, for the Legislature to be asked to provide for structures and procedures that have not been defined and for those structures and procedures to come into effect on a non-defined date.</P>
    <P>We can ask ourselves how the need for this Bill arose in the first place.  There are many factors involved but the proximate reason for having to have this Bill at all at this stage must certainly be what I can only describe as a sham pay deal at the end of 1988 &mdash; a dallamullog &mdash; that the Government tried to pull over the eyes of the Defence Forces in cracking up a pay deal to be an awful lot more than it was.  That created a great deal of discontent. It is understandable that it should have done so.  I think I am not going too far when I say the last Government and the Minister for Defence in that Government treated the Defence Forces with contempt in never giving them credit for what they were doing; in never recognising the difficulties they faced; and in trying to sell to them a spurious pay deal which was supposed to be the answer to their problems.  Indeed, many thought it was the answer to their problems until they actually saw what it amounted to in reality.  In a very real sense that attempt by that Government to pull the wool over the eyes of our Defence Forces led directly to the movement that we all saw in the last general election, the National Army Spouses Association who felt that even if their menfolk could not carry on the kind of campaign they felt they were entitled to on behalf of their families, it was up to the womenfolk to go out and campaign for them, which they did.  I <Col N="720" /> might add that it gave me some pain, as a candidate in the election and campaigning in a constituency where the National Army Spouses Association ran a candidate to see the shabby way the Fianna Fáil Party treated those people during the course of the campaign.</P>
    <P>None of us likes to see an opposing candidate competing for votes but we all have to recognise that people do not lightly get involved in politics and that the members of the NASA who got involved in the last election certainly deserved at least the same respect given to every other candidate.  I must say, and it pains me to say it, that they certainly did not get that from the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a shame that that should have been the case.  That is yet another strand built into the discontent which has led us to having this Bill in front of us today.</P>
    <P>During that campaign, and the many discussions which preceded it, it was clear there was a very strong feeling in the Defence Forces that their pay had got out of line with the pay of other people involved in the security of the State.  It is time we recognised clearly and specifically that we must establish a reasonable relationship between the pay of all ranks in our Permanent Defence Force and the pay of those serving in the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service.  Comparisons will inevitably be made between two groups working side by side on the same security duties.  We all know the differences there are between the pay and conditions of our Permanent Defence Force and the Garda Síochána, two groups who often find themselves serving side by side not only on the Border but on cash escorts and many other duties which maybe we take for granted or overlook.  I see them carrying out these duties regularly travelling between Portlaoise and Dublin.  This is one of the few occasions when our traffic code allows the overtaking of a convoy on the inside, and it is the one occasion when I feel we can do this with impunity as I know they are not going to move in on us.  As I said, we have to recognise and accept the fact when two arms of the security of the State work so closely together comparisons will <Col N="721" /> inevitably be made.  We should bear this in mind when dealing with the pay and conditions of our Defence Forces.  It was the failure of that spurious pay offer at the end of 1988 to do that in a straightforward and honest way that led to the discontent and worry which, in turn, has led to this Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Another reason was the refusal since that pay arrangement was made to engage in meaningful consultations with people who felt they were doing within the Defence Forces nothing more than extending and carrying on a remit they were given with the consent of the Minister and the authorities to talk about the pay and conditions.  It is my belief that there would have been less unease and worry if a more flexible, humane and understanding approach had been taken to the efforts of the people appointed by their peers in the Defence Forces, with the consent and approval of the authorities, to articulate their needs in relation to pay.</P>
    <P>It is a brave man who can draw a rigid line and say that is where the question of pay ends and the question of conditions begins.  One would not have to be a skilled trade unionist to know that there are great overlaps and that very frequently it is the overlap that causes the greatest difficulty.  I regret to say that it appears that up to now the fact that the Minister, the Department of Defence and the General Staff did not have that understanding of this crossover between pay and conditions led to what seemed to be a refusal to engage in sensible, constructive and meaningful discussions and is a direct cause of many of the worries people have today.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I meet serving members of the Permanent Defence Force day in and day out.  I meet them when I buy a newspaper or a packet of cigarettes, when I go to Mass and when I come out of meetings in my constituency. They are there all the time.  I also meet them when I go to the local football club. I hear what they are saying and the reasons for their disquiet.  Other Deputies know that the Curragh is not the only place where you have that kind of high <Col N="722" /> presence of the Permanent Defence Force in the community.  This is one of the things which made me sit back and pause in some astonishment when I read the provisions of section 6 (2) which states:</P>
    <P>A person who is not subject to military law who endeavours to persuade or conspires with any other person to endeavour to persuade a member to join a trade union or other body (other than an association) aforesaid shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to the penalties provided for a contravention of section 257 of the Principal Act. </P>
    <P>Does this mean that if I have a casual conversation in the lounge of a pub in Kildare town on a Monday or Saturaday night with an NCO, serving soldier or an officer in the Curragh Command, about the matters we are discussing here I am rendering myself liable to prosecution and making myself guilty of an offence in contravention of section 257 of the 1954 Defence Act?  If that is the case, I and Members of this House should be in jail many times over or should be fined heavily because there is no way we can regularly meet members of the Defence Forces without talking about matters envisaged in section 6 (2).</P>
    <P>I wonder if that really was the intention and whether they are not the braces which go with the belt that we are now deciding we might to be able to do without because, in legislative terms, we have caught up with self-supporting trousers. If this Bill is worded properly, that is what it will be.  However, I am not so sure that this will be done properly because a great many things are still open to question, although I have to say that since this debate started &mdash; fewer than 23 legislative hours ago, a good deal less than the Taoiseach tried to pretend this morning &mdash; there has been some evidence of movement which I take to be a welcome sign, but it is also an indication that the Minister had not properly thought out the provisions of this Bill before he brought it before this House and tried to stampede the House into passing it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> Both the Government Chief Whip and the Minister used their powers of eloquence and persuasion to try to get agreement to have this Bill dealt with quickly in this House but I am glad the rest of us resisted.  We would have been most unwise to allow this House to be gazumped into making rapid decisions on a Bill of this kind which was badly prepared.</P>
    <P>The signs are on it.  The Bill started off by requiring that all meetings of the associations for which it provides, or for which the regulations will provide, should be held in military installations.  It now appears that during the course of the debate the Minister let it be known that that is no longer a condition.  That is quite sensible but I ask myself, why in God's name did that ridiculous provision have to be put in the Bill in the first place?  I would assume, for example, that proper provisions will be made, as have been made in so many other places, so that members of these associations will have reasonable facilities to carry out their meetings.</P>

      <P>This is the bit of the iceberg that we cannot see.  The Minister should hold his soul in patience; I will deal with the regulations in a moment.  Surely provision will be made to give people time to carry out the duties they will have to do under the provisions of the Bill and/or regulations, whenever they come.  That would also mean that they do not have to meet in military installations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all we have to go on because the Minister did not come clean when he published the Bill.  Now it seems that he has moved from that position.  I am glad he has done so but he should not have been in that position in the first place.  He should not have started the battle from the bottom of that swamp in the first place.</P>
      <P>Second, it was apparently envisaged that the elections would take place using a single non-transferable vote, a new animal in Irish elections.  It now appears that the Minister believes that we could use a proportional representation system and that access is to be granted to an officer from the franchise section of the Department of the Environment.  I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in my opening remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, in military parlance, the Minister should not have started that charge from the bottom of that swamp.  Next we find that it was envisaged that any member of the Defence Forces with less than a good conduct record would be excluded from the possibility of being a candidate in the elections to these associations.  It should be remembered that military records are secret and the Minister is not allowed to divulge them to anybody else.  The military authorities are not allowed to divulge them to anybody but to the relevant commanding officer.  From the outset it was going to be difficult to explain why corporal &ldquo;A&rdquo; or private &ldquo;B&rdquo; was not going to be allowed to be a candidate but now it appears that the Minister has conceded on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> It appears that originally there was no intention that there could be any independent secretariat for these associations. We infer that &mdash; nothing was said about it specifically &mdash; from the requirements to have all the meetings in military installations and from the other provisions which state that the associations could have assistance from appropriate provision to be made by the Army authorities. It now seems that that condition has been taken away.  It was specified in the Bill that members of these associations could not belong to any other organisation, but it now appears that the Minister has conceded that these associations could be associated in turn with, for example, the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations.  It now seems that the Minister, who started off by saying that there had to be three associations, says he will be satisfied with two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to consultation. The Deputy should look at paragraph nine of my letter which deals with full consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Minister and the Government started off from a position where they did not want to reveal all their hand in the Bill.  Indeed, it was some little while after the Bill became available that a few copies of the booklet became available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was then that it all came out because it contained the real meat of the Bill.  The Minister, in the grand old tradition of the rigid quartermasters, was trying to ration the meat but we had to get more of it out of him.  We came back, like Oliver Twist, and said we needed more information and, gradually, we got it.  However, now we find that having been given the bread to go around the sandwich when the Bill was published we have now got down to the real meat.  I have to say that it is not very tasty meat. We are not going to have this sandwich and we are going to have to put a good deal more flavouring into it to make it palatable.  It now seems that we are to have consultations on all the matters that are dealt with in the substantial booklet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are agreed on most matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The real substance of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, is to be found in that booklet, but how do the Government propose to have consultations? They are proposing that they should do that by passing in the House regulations that would be proposed after consultations take place.  The original <Col N="727" /> framework of the consultations was far from satisfactory.  It appears that as a result of the debate in the House we are getting some improvements in the framework of the consultations.  Those consultations were to produce regulations. The Bill specifies how those regulations should be passed.  They would come before the House and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by the House within the next 21 days the regulation shall be annulled accordingly.  If such a resolution is not passed the regulation shall not be annulled.  That means that the House has no choice.  When a provision like that is used to bring regulations before the House, there is only one of two things the House can do: the House can accept them or reject them; it cannot modify them.  For the real meat of the Bill that is a totally unacceptable way of going about what we are doing in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the need for regulations. I appreciate the need for some elbow room for the Government and the other people involved to apply legislation that we pass in the House but there is no way I am going to allow legislation to be passed in the House where the real meat will be eaten by somebody else without any real reference to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Bill dealing with the Garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  We will be proposing very substantial amendments to write in substantial sections, or the equivalent, into the Bill but some matters will need to be dealt with by regulation.  I invite the Minister to go back to the procedure that was used in 1987 to pass the regulations for the treatment of persons in Garda custody under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  I speak from the position of the person who brought those regulations through the Houses of the Oireachtas. We did that in two stages.  First, we brought forward the equivalent of a White Paper into the Houses of the Oireachtas and that set out what I <Col N="728" /> believed we needed in the regulations. We had a debate on that and I undertook in both Houses to listen to the debate and to take on board any improvements or worries that the two Houses had.  I undertook to come back with regulations modified to take account of the results of that debate.</P>
      <P>My memory of that &mdash; I am sure other Members will agree with me &mdash; is that it worked extremely well.  We got a number of improvements made in the original draft of the regulations and the two Houses felt they had done a reasonable few days' work on the treatment of persons in custody under the provisions of the 1984 Act.  I heartily recommend that course to the Minister when he is bringing in regulations on foot of this Bill, regulations that will be a good deal less substantial than is his intention at present.</P>
      <P>I repeat that it is utterly unacceptable to get this House and the Seanad to pass a Bill when the real meat is in the regulations. If he does it that way and if the Government persist in doing it that way, they are storing up trouble for themselves. I would put this thought before the Minister and the Government.  We need certainty for a good while into the future in regard to the structures that will be set in place under this Bill because we are dealing here, as the Minister has reminded us time and again during this debate, with issues on our national security forces.  We want clarity and we want certainty and the less that is left to regulation and the more that is in the Bill the better that will be.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated his intention to build a conciliation and arbitration scheme into the provisions of this Bill. That is a very good thing.  If it happens after the elections that will be provided for here, that there is still subsisting disagreement on the structures that have to be put in place, will the Minister use the conciliation and arbitration scheme to sort out those disagreements?  I would like to know if that will be done and I hope the Minister will tell us when he replies to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some points in the agreed <Col N="729" /> statement which we got this morning from PDFORRA and two Government Deputies which I think need some clarification. I find this a most unusual procedure. I do not find it unusual on the part of PDFORRA because it is an organisation that is trying to have an influence on legislation quite legitimately, but I find it rather strange that the Government had to have two backbenchers to sort out this problem which surely should have been the job of the Minister himself and his officials.</P>

      <P>But it is pointed out in this agreed statement that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talks will include the structures into which members will be elected and the <Col N="730" /> means whereby open and honest consultation can take place with all interested parties. </P>
    <P>Does that mean, Sir, that these interested parties outside this House are going to discuss these important matters with a principal officer in charge of the franchise section of the Department of the Envoironment?  If that is what it means, then I think it is a mistake.  Those matters should be discussed directly by the Minister and his officials and his aides in the general staff with the representative parties outside, and then they should be debated here in this House.  I can tell the Minister and the Government now that we will not stand for things being brought in over the head of this House and being put into legislation effectively by means of regulations.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am asking that the Minister come clean and include on Committee Stage the maximum possible amount of the structure, procedures and specifications that will be put into operation in the Bill and that for that part of it which has to be done by regulation he adopt an open consultative procedure in this House where we will see the regulations in draft, make whatever suggestions for change we believe are required and then let the Minister redraft the regulations and come back to this House. He might also adopt the obverse of the procedure in section 7 and say that unless the regulations are approved by a vote of this House within 21 days they will not come into effect.  That would be a far more democratic and more desirable way of doing it.</P>

      <P>I agree with the last point made by Deputy Dukes regarding regulations being brought before the House, because we do not know what we are talking about until we see those regulations.  Like other Deputies I want to pay tribute to the Army spouses association who began this battle a couple of years ago with great courage and determination and against great opposition and snide remarks on their efforts during those early years.  As a result of their <Col N="731" /> efforts the Army people acted in a very responsible manner which eventually resulted in the formation of PDFORRA which is without authority but not illegal. There is no law against PDFORRA but they do not have authority.  They have the confidence of the enlisted men and NCOs but no authority to deal with issues with which they want to deal.  Great credit is due to the Minister and I am delighted that Deputy Lenihan is Minister at this critical time to take the right decisions.  Some Ministers for Defence in the past had rigid attitudes handed down to them which they accepted.  Unfortunately, it has been the experience for a long number of years that Ministers for Defence &mdash; if any former Minister for Defence is in the House he is excluded &mdash; appeared to have a fairly low level of qualification, and it was the least important post in the Cabinet.  Deputy Nealon is excluded from any comments or references in this matter.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that there has been a procedure in Cabinets for a long number of years that the Minister for Defence is a very minor post and the person appointed to that Department does not necessarily require any particular capabilities etc., and we have had some pretty poor Ministers for Defence.  I am glad that Deputy Lenihan happens to be in the job at this critical time because it needs a person with flexibility and authority to change the minds of some perhaps rigid staff people in the Army.  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, has had the courage to take this Bill on board, and I am glad that this representative body is here to stay and must be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of pay and conditions in the Army should be of vital concern to everybody and certainly to any Minister for Defence and to any Chief of Staff because pay and conditions affect the morale of the Army, both officers, NCOs and enlisted men.  It is a volunteer Army. People do not have to put up with these <Col N="732" /> poor conditions and in the end they do not stick it.  Deputy Davern made the point very clearly regarding their conditions. The result is that there is a very rapid intake and a very rapid outflow from the Army, which is a very costly affair as anybody who knows anything about it will understand; taking in men and training them and they are gone in three years because they cannot put up with the conditions.  There was a time when they remained on for 21 years.  It was a full-time job.  Nobody wants it as a job any more because it is not a job.</P>
    <P>The conditions as outlined by previous speakers speak for themselves, conditions on the Border where they see themselves lying out in the open ditches in far worse conditions than the gardaí in the area and on a much lower rate of pay. Everything about their status is twice as bad as the condition of the gardaí on the same job.  When Army personnel are sent to Portlaoise and other places they find the position is just the same.  They are on duty outdoors for three days and indoors for two days in far worse conditions than the Garda and prison officers.  The Garda and prison officers have their own associations who have fought for and got better pay conditions for them.  Members of the Army realise that their pay and conditions are not as good as those of the prison officers and Garda because they do not have anybody to speak for them. The National Army Spouses Association was the first group to speak out for them. I believe offices in the Army want a well equipped Army with good morale. Morale among the members of the Army is dreadful at present because of their bad pay and conditions.  In addition members have to do the same jobs over and over again because the establishments are not up to scratch.</P>
    <P>I have heard about these complaints over the years from members of the Army in my constituency.  When I visited the General Army Headquarters in Collins Barracks with other members of The Workers' Party two weeks ago I heard many of the same complaints and saw the conditions in the barracks.  I <Col N="733" /> heard some figures in regard to recruitment, the length people stay in the Army and the speed with which they go in and out.  It would be far cheaper for the Army to pay men decent wages and give them better pay and conditions so that we have a good Army which members will not want to leave.  When you spend all your time training men you do not want to see them leave the following year, which is what is happening at present.  It would be much cheaper to do a decent job.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great opportunity of injecting into the Army the morale which is lacking at present by giving them the trust and confidence that is necessary. I hope that, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle described it, the &ldquo;cuairt an mheán oíche&rdquo; last night is not just a dirty tricks brigade to persuade PDFORRA to put off the election they intended to hold next week.  They have agreed to put off the election and I hope that whatever promises they were given will be implemented and there will be no going back on whatever was agreed last night. It is vitally important that any promises they were given are implemented in order to hold their trust and confidence at this time.  I believe the Minister will do this but he has not given any indication at this stage that he will.</P>
    <P>Collins Barracks is being closed down and members are very concerned about where they are to go.  Apparently they will be put into McKee Barracks and Cathal Brugha Barracks.  Will that make their conditions any better?  These are the kind of matters a representative association will want to discuss.  I think there is only one new barracks in the country and the representative association will want to discuss where their members will be put.  This should not be put down as a matter of discipline or command which is excluded from discussions; this is part of what they will need and should be able to talk about.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he will bring in amendments to the Bill.  I hope he will do this, but he must understand that he cannot impose his form of representative body on the Army.  He should agree that they can have a <Col N="734" /> representative body who can deal with certain matters but not with others.  But you cannot then say, &ldquo;This is the kind of representative body you will have&rdquo;. According to the Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups document there will be elected to the committee of this body 124 privates and 105 non-commissioned officers.  Do they want 229 representatives on their committee?  Perhaps they do.  The document also deals with other procedures, methods of voting, etc.  On the first page of the document I note that the Chief of Staff is telling the members that the most important step is to conduct the elections and that once the elections are over full consultation will take place with the elected representatives on all aspects, including the electoral process itself, the voting system, structures and procedures.  I do not understand why the consultation should take place once the elections are over.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great opportunity at present to gain the trust not only of the NCOs but of the officers.  The officers in the Army have played a responsible role in allowing PDFORRA to develop. They understand the need for such an organisation and have acted very responsibly. The Minister now has the opportunity to gain their trust.  Perhaps the Minister needs to go over a few heads &mdash; I do not know what problems there will be in regard to structures.  It seems to me that the Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups document was prepared by the Chief of Staff and not by the Minister or his Department.  The Minister issued two and a half pages of guidelines on 20 February and the Chief of Staff produced his document on 2 March.  If I was an NCO or private in the Army I would be suspicious of a detailed document issued by the Chief of Staff about what kind of representative body the Army should have.  This does not seem to be the best way of going about things.</P>
    <P>I will be very interested in seeing the amendments the Minister brings in on Committee Stage and in hearing of the consultations he intends to have.  I do not <Col N="735" /> know if he officially sent the two Deputies to consult on his behalf or whether he decided they should have consultations first and then come back to him.  The Minister must be involved in the consultation process in order to make the decisions which are necessary at this time.  I hope the Minister will engage in the necessary consultations so that this Bill can be passed and the representative body formed.  It is very important that there is no confrontation.  The Minister indicated during his Second Stage speech that he is willing to be flexible on the issue.  Perhaps some important amendments will be made on Committee Stage, but it is vitally important for the Minister to consult with the people concerned before he brings in any amendments.</P>

      <P>This Bill has come about because of pressure first by the National Army Spouses Association and later by the establishment of PDFORRA.  The achievements of the National Army Spouses Association must be recognised.  For years the general public felt that all was well within the Army.  The Army was being glamorised in television advertisements and so forth and the public perception was that Army life was an easy option.  The deplorable working conditions of our Defence Forces, however, were brought home to the public with the emergence of the National Army Spouses Association.  The poor pay on which they could not sustain their families was also highlighted.  The National Army Spouses Association generally highlighted the lack of morale in the rank and file in our Army.  This is very serious and I cannot see this Bill, in its present form, doing anything to raise morale.  If the fears that were expressed here are not allayed, morale will be even lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> PDFORRA continued the work of the National Army Spouses Association. Without the combined efforts of both we would not have this proposal, incomplete as it is, before us today.  There is also the likelihood that we would not have had the Gleeson Commission set up to look at pay, especially pay in the Army.  I am sure the members of the Army will benefit considerably from the recommendations of that report when it is produced in the summer.</P>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed about the inadequacy of this Bill.  It does not deal adequately with the principal issues.  It leaves the establishment of associations to be dealt with by regulations to be made by the Minister. Despite the Minister's assurances we are being asked to vote through legislation without knowing its scope or impact, and that is very unfair.  The total proposal should be before us so that we can discuss it.  It would have been far better had the Minister consulted the people involved and then brought his proposals before us so that we would all have a chance to discuss the various recommendations. The way we are going about it now leaves too many questions unanswered. This is very dangerous because if PDFORRA are not satisfied with what is being offered we could have a very serious situation within the Army.  I welcome the initiative taken last night as an indication that from now on there will be proper consultation between the Department and PDFORRA and that they will be consulted at all times in regard to any proposals because, without their agreement &mdash; and they are a strong body with 8,000 members &mdash; the Minister will have trouble with this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Army needs a representative body to deal with their general conditions, pay and so forth just as the Garda have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>Most of the Defence Forces in Western Europe have their own independent associations and there is an umbrella organisation for all Defence <Col N="737" /> Forces in Western Europe called EUROMIL, as mentioned by Deputy Nealon.  If the Army had such a representative body with the agreement of PDFORRA they would be happy with that.  Much consultation, however, has to take place before then.  I appeal to the Minister not to railroad PDFORRA into accepting some structure they would not be happy with as that would be ineffective and would leave the Army in much the same position as they are in at the moment.  That is important because if there is disquiet and turmoil in our Defence Forces it would be bad for us as a nation.</P>
      <P>It is important for us as a nation to have a contented Defence Force who are happy to look after their country without having to waste their time and energy on issues like pay and conditions.  They should not have to do that.  They should be recognised and properly looked after. We have not done this in the past but now we have that opportunity.  I appeal again to the Minister to accommodate the wishes of PDFORRA as much as possible.  Hopefully the fears that have been expressed here in the Dáil will be allayed when they see the Minister's recommendations over the next few months.</P>

      <P>I will attempt to be as brief as possible.  If I have any extra minutes I would be delighted to extend them to Deputy De Rossa also.  One of the things we all welcome is the number of contributions that have been made, which will be a matter of support and some confidence to the armed forces. It is an indication of the interest and commitment that has been shown on Second Stage and which, I hope, will be responded to by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Member who spoke on Second Stage did not pay tribute to the tremendous contribution the Army spouses made out of their sense of desperation. They sent a clear signal to the community about how badly we treat the Army while seeming to attach glamour and even importance to it.  Indeed, in cases of emergency, even at community level, the first bastion has been and will continue to be the Army.  We all appreciate that.  It is, therefore, all the more incumbent on us as Members of the Dáil or the Seanad, who reflect the needs and priorities of our voters and the electorate in general, to respond fully to the demands of the Army and the Army Spouses Association who spoke on behalf of their husbands who were constrained with regard to the kind of pleas they could make for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Mac Giolla, I am delighted to be speaking to the Tánaiste as Minister for Defence and look forward to getting the kind of regulations and structures to allow those regulations to work fully, co-operatively and without prejudice to anybody.  I hope that after the fight that had to be put up for it we will make sure that the expectations of the members of the Army and their spouses will be fully rewarded and that we will not sell them short at this stage. I am also delighted that the Minister will be responding soon to another aspect of the Defence Forces, the exclusion of <Col N="739" /> recruitment within the Defence Forces. We are hoping to integrate in this Bill a level of participation which will allow people to communicate their needs and priorites through proper structures.</P>
    <P>It is unaccountable that in 1990 women are excluded from recruitment to the Army except in a very small way. Equality Bill, which I regret did not excluded from an area in which they could give most service to the State.  Following many communications from the Women's Rights Committee and the Employment Equality Agency to the Department of Defence, we received a letter on 29 April 1988 in which we learned that cadetships in the Air Corps and Naval Service are not open to female applicants and the Army and Air Corps apprentice schools are open to male applicants only.  This is 13 years after we introduced in the Dáil an Employment Equality Bill which I regret did not include within its parameters recruitment to the Defence Forces or the Garda. Because of interventions from Europe, the Employment Equality Act had to admit recruitment through the Garda force.  Unfortunately, in 1990, as we talk about equality in a cohesive Europe Ireland still continues obstinately, definitely and insultingly to exclude women totally from important apprenticeships in, for instance, the school of music, the cavalry, engineering, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  There is no practical reason for this.</P>
    <P>Various excuses have been given over the years as a result of lobbying by Members of this House and the various committees in the Employment Equality Agency.  The very conditions which pushed the Army spouses into picketing openly in cold and windy weather were specified in writing as a reason for the exclusion of women from the Defence Forces.  A letter from the Department of Defence dated 30 April, 1988 stated that much of the accommodation occupied by male personnel is substandard and for the foreseeable future, priority must be given to upgrading it.  Another reason given in the same communication was <Col N="740" /> that the right of recourse to the Labour Court provided by the Act and the powers of the Employment Equality Agency to conduct investigations would, if they applied to the Defence Forces, have implications for the maintenance of military discipline which would be entirely unacceptable.  This could not be countenanced by the Army and the Minister for Defence as it would carry the risk of jeopardising the effective exercise of military command and the proper discharge of the vital functions of the Defence Forces.  That incredible letter referred to substandard conditions, yet the rights were denied to members of the Defence Forces to fight their case and that was used as a reason for excluding females.  I wrote on behalf of the Women's Rights Committee and expressed shock at the fact such reasons should be put forward for the continuing exclusion of women from the Defence Forces and at the fact that men in the Army should have to live in accommodation that was considered not fit for women.  Our point was that if we wanted to give status and recognition to the important work being done by the State forces we should give them proper conditions of work and a proper standard of accommodation.  The Minister should give the most serious thought to the inclusion of women in the Defence Forces, now that proper structures are being introduced, so that no longer can such feeble and shameful excuses be given.  Otherwise we will find ourselves once again in the embarrassing position of being dragged through the courts of Europe.</P>
    <P>On 12 December 1988 we received a letter from the Social Affairs Commission which stated:</P>
    <P>In view of recent case law of the Court of Justice in similar areas, in particular the decision of 15 May 1986 in Case 224/84, Johnson <i>v.</i> Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Network is likely to recommend that such general exclusions should be revised. </P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to indicate on <Col N="741" /> Committee Stage that this exclusion is being lifted and that equal opportunity will be given to women.  I can let the Minister have a file of letters from disillusioned women who applied to join the Defence Forces or otherwise learned to their shock that this exclusion exists.  One of the other excuses given to us as a result of our many communications with that Department and with many Ministers of successive Administrations was that there did not seem to be any overt applications from women.  One must consider that if a woman's name was clearly identifiable she did not get an application form.  Even so, there was still a high number of applications.  I should be delighted to let the Minister have those letters.</P>
    <P>The hierarchical structures within the Army which have given rise to so much disillusionment, bad conditions and lack of right of reply are outdated, redundant and totally unacceptable.  Deputy Mac Giolla said there was a high level of waste because people were leaving the Army due to the denial of the right of expression.  We cannot afford that, either from the Army's point of view or from Ireland's point of view.  I know that the Minister will repair that matter within the regulations.  I hope the regulations could be issued in a White Paper for discussion by the House so that we could devise the best possible structures to allow for openness, participation and clear negotiating channels.  We must never again have the Army caught up in a situation in which morale is low and they do not have the status, much less conditions of pay, which give them the recognition they deserve.  The Minister is waiting and I have no time to give to Deputy De Rossa.  I apologise to Deputy De Rossa but it was important to sew that into the record.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the few minutes he has offered me.  I regret that what I have to say is to be confined to five minutes because I feel very strongly that the debate here today and on the previous day is crucial in relation to how we treat our Defence Forces, who have served us through thick <Col N="742" /> and thin, who are a credit to us internationally, who are loyal come what may, who have in all circumstances worked within the law as it exists and have never stepped outside the law even though they had very real and many grievances.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Bill we are discussing is so inadequate in terms of what is presented to us.  Nevertheless, it is a long way from the position which the previous Minister took when he said a representative body would not be in line with the maintenance of discipline in the Army, despite the evidence from virtually everywhere else in Europe that the opposite was the case.  An association exists in Europe called EUROMIL which represents one million soldiers in Europe. There are organisations in virtually all EC countries.  A resolution was passed in 1984 by the European Parliament pointing out that member states should allow their defence forces to form representative associations.  The Council of Europe in 1988 passed a resolution pointing out that it called on all member states of the Council of Europe in so far as they have not yet done so to grant professional members of the armed forces of all ranks the right under normal circumstances to establish, join and actively participate in specific associations formed to protect their professional interests within the framework of democratic institutions. Unfortunately, the form of the Bill presented to us here does not as it stands present a democratic form of representation for the Defence Forces.  I am pleased that the Minister in the past few days has moved to open up some avenues of consultation with PDFORRA and to consider the very real concerns they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was struck on a recent visit to Collins Barracks, organised through the good offices of the Minister for Defence, by the appalling conditions that many of our Defence Forces have to work under.  For instance, the catering corps have to scrimp and save from one meal to the next in order to provide a decent sandwich even to members of the Defence Forces on guard duty at night and long-term duty at weekends.  There is no doubt <Col N="743" /> that we have neglected to a large extent the needs of our Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister will accept many of the amendments which the Opposition parties in this House will be proposing on Committee Stage, and I would appreciate if the Minister would indicate clearly in his contribution here this evening what he proposes to do to meet the very real concerns that have been expressed here throughout this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of speakers in the debate on Second Stage of the Bill before the House is an indication of the importance of the Bill in the history of the Defence Forces and of the interest of all Members of the House in the welfare of the forces.  I thank Deputies for their contributions. The Defence Forces are the responsibility of Oireachtas Éireann and the legislation we pass here must be the governing factor.  This legislation has been introduced by the Government on the basis that there has been no legislation govening representative bodies in our Defence Forces.  Any bodies in existence or to be in existence did not have the legitimacy of legislation passed by Oireachtas Éireann. That situation has existed since the formation of the Defence Forces in 1922. We are now seeking to remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember that this had to be enabling legislation by this Oireachtas giving authority in consultation with the personnel of the Defence Forces to bring in structures that would be acceptable to them.  This is the path we have chosen to follow, precisely the same path that was chosen with regard to the Garda Síochána Act, 1977 which set up the Garda Síochána representative body structure within the Garda and was based on enabling legislation and subsequent regulations brought into being after consultation between the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities and personnel.  It is precisely the same pattern we are proposing to follow here to enable the Permanent Defence Forces to have suitable machinery available to them to give them <Col N="744" /> a representative voice in regard to their pay, allowances and other conditions of service.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.  In addition we are proposing to provide for a whole range of welfare activities that the Garda Síochána Representative Body have in their case, that such welfare activities would also be part of the remit of the proposed representative bodies within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In addition to all of that, as an entirely new measure we are bringing in conciliation and arbitration for the first time ever for members of the Defence Forces. A similar type of conciliation and arbitration is there for the public service at large and in particular applies to the Garda Síochána, an entirely new dimension which makes the representative body or bodies not just a body representing the personnel but a body who have the power, authority and statutory right to proceed to conciliation and arbitration where required.</P>
    <P>The detail under this enabling Bill will be filled in in consultation with those directly involved.  This approach is sensible and is on all fours with the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, and subsequent regulation.  Contrary to what has been alleged, the essence of the arrangement is an exercise in democracy subject to certain safeguards.  There is an important issue of principle at stake involving the armed forces of the country and it is clear that we must have a legislative framework within which these representative associations can do positive good on behalf of their personnel.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise a number of important points.  In the first instance it is necessary to identify representative officers, non-commissioned officers and privates and the obvious way to do that is by democratic elections.  We must have democratic elections first to provide legitimacy for the structures we are establishing under this legislation.  The first election will be conducted under the supervision of the principal officer in charge of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, thus obviating any suggestion whatever of <Col N="745" /> irregularity or vested interest, who will as a first step invite submissions from within the Permanent Defence Force, including PDFORRA, to determine a system of election which will find acceptance throughout the Defence Forces. This is the essence of the agreement reached by two of my Dáil colleagues, Deputy Hillery and Deputy Kitt, in discussions last night with eight representatives of PDFORRA.  The essence of the discussions between them was an agreement to participate in elections which would be supervised by the principal officer in charge of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment and, on that basis, they were agreeable to suspend any activities in regard to elections within their membership which they were proposing to have.  They saw the wisdom of having consultations now to have properly supervised elections in which they could participate and have a useful role.  That is the essence of what was agreed last night by the eight representatives of PDFORRA and two Deputies of this House.  I welcome that development as positive progress in getting elections off the ground without conflict or acrimony. It is a very positive and constructive step forward and we can proceed immediately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Of course structures will be involved and I will come to them in a moment.  I have no preference for one, two or three associations to represent officers, non-commissioned officers and privates.  It is essential, however, to establish by democratic process what the personnel themselves want.  In the case of non-commissioned officers and privates it seems to boil down to whether they want one association or separate associations. Either course is all right with me.  I emphasise that the duly elected representatives will be given every opportunity to participate in drawing up the new arrangements before the associations are established and before Defence Force regulations are made.  Clearly, that is the <Col N="746" /> best way to proceed if a system is to emerge which will have the confidence of the members of the Permanent Defence Force.  It is their confidence we need in the structures and the regulations.  Regulations have not yet been drafted, a suggestion was made that they should be embodied in the Bill but that would be the very obverse of consultation.  The purpose of the Bill is to bring in enabling legislation and after the election, the idea is to have detailed consultation and discussions. As a result of that the regulations can then be agreed between the Minister, the Department, the Army, PDFORRA and anyone else who makes submissions on the matter.  These regulations can then come before the House as provided for in the section for further discussion.  That progression makes sense.</P>
      <P>It is clear, from what I said, that there is no difficulty about the scope of representation as sought in various submissions to me.  The scope is agreed and there is practically 100 per cent agreement on that score.  By &ldquo;scope&rdquo; I mean pay, conditions, a whole range of welfare services and raising funds by way of subscriptions on the part of the elected representatives, if they wish to do so.  It also covers where they will have meetings and that is a matter for themselves.  They will also have direct contact with the media as an independent body outside the scope of any Army command.  On all issues raised by PDFORRA or in this House or outside it we can meet them fully.  All that remains to be settled by way of consultation prior to regulations are matters of detail.  I cannot talk here about every detail but obviously some can be worked out within the framework of what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework of the regulations will represent every point of view which has been expresed in the House but if anybody wishes to raise another I will be glad to hear it.  I welcome the start made last night in regard to a frank and free discussion. Consultations must take place in an atmosphere free from stultifying acrimony and controversy.  For that purpose the mechanism in section 8 <Col N="747" /> of the Bill will enable me to postpone the coming into operation of the Act so that the maximum possible time can be made available for discussion with PDFORRA and any other interested bodies.</P>
    <P>I will not name an operative date which would stultify the process of consultations and negotiations.  I will not implement the Bill until full discussions and negotiations leading to regulations have been put in place.  I will then fully implement the Act.  I want to emphasise that because it is the purpose of the mechanism in section 8 to which Deputy Bell referred.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the franchise officer of the Department of the Environment can start straight away.  We can prepare for an election side by side with the processing of this Bill through this and the other House.  This approach will help the democratic process to take place for all concerned in an open, co-operative and amicable atmosphere.  The outline of what is contemplated as a starting point is already known throughout the Permanent Defence Force and what will finally emerge within the ambit of the legislation will effectively be determined by members of the force.  In other words, this document issued by the Army authorities is very comprehensive and I want to pay tribute to it.  There are aspects of it with which I do not agree but it is not a final document, it was designed as the basis for discussion.  In my letter covering it, issued as far back as 20 February, I emphasised in the last paragraph that this document would be considered by Army personnel and would be subject to full consultation.  It is basically a discussion document, there is nothing of a regulatory kind in it although 80 per cent to 90 per cent of it will form the basis for regulations.  Other aspects of it in regard to details which were raised in the House are matters for discussion and negotiation.</P>
    <P>The administration of the association, such as secretarial staff and accommodation, are matters which can be fully discussed with the newly elected representatives.  It was suggested during <Col N="748" /> the debate that the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Bill regarding the position in a state of emergency or when members were on active service could be used in a capricious way by military commanders. This is not so as the state of emergency comes into force only on the making of a formal declaration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan and other speakers raised the question of the affiliation of an association to other bodies.  In that regard, under section 2 of the Bill such affiliation will be permitted with the consent of the Minister for Defence.  This provision provides flexibility and is in exact accord with the situation in regard to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The question of membership of professional and other bodies which may be essential or desirable from the point of view of the practice of a profession or trade was also mentioned.  Membership of such bodies would not be contrary to the provisions of section 2 (4) of the Bill. There has been criticism of section 6 (2) of the Bill which prohibits persons outside the Defence Forces from persuading a member of the forces to join a body other than an official association established by law.  In this case a mountain was made out of a molehill as there is no question of any spouses' association being declared illegal under the Bill.  That is nonsense.  Much of what was said about this was farfetched and hypothetical. However, as an earnest of my goodwill and bona fides I am willing to look at this section before Committee Stage in view of the misgivings which have been expressed about it although it is not germane to the whole thrust of the Bill.  I take on board the points that have been made in the House in this regard although I dispute that they apply to some of the far-fetched notions.  If people have these far-fetched notions I want to establish trust and understanding.  If necessary I will deal with that subsection accordingly on Commitee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of the regulation requiring confirmation by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas has been raised. The provision under section 7 of this Bill <Col N="749" /> is on all fours with section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>The system of election is one that can be worked out with the franchise officer, the principal officer of the Department of the Environment.  The type of election system, the constituencies, the numbers and the method of election will be worked out immediately, thanks to last night's meeting between PDFORRA, the Army authorities and other interested parties, with Mr. Sexton of the Department of the Environment, in order to get the first election off the ground in a totally aboveboard manner.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputies will look at this legislation seriously and not in a spirit of political brinkmanship or parliamentary games, as it were.  It is a bit above that. It is an enabling Bill concerned with the Defence Forces of the State and in that connection it is important, as with the Garda Síochána Bill of 1977, that it get around-the-House support and that there is public opinion here that emphasises that in this situation the Minister of the day has to be trusted.  Deputy Dukes made some remarks about the Minister having the right to do certain things by way of order and regulation.  Of course that is the case in any enabling Bill but in the last analysis I have brought in this measure with the authority of the Government and I did not do so just for the sake of bringing in a Bill.  Nothing has been done about this matter over the years but something is being done about it now.  I assure the House there is a serious purpose behind this Bill.  In that respect I am asking the House to have regard to the fact that they can have trust in me, acting on behalf of the Government and on behalf of you, the key House of the Oireachtas.  I will ensure that we <Col N="750" /> have supervision over matters of this kind within our Defence Forces and that our Defence Forces, for once and for all, will be rid of this corroding and eroding spirit of suspicion and mistrust that has appeared only recently.</P>
    <P>I would appeal in particular to the media to co-operate in this matter which is of such fundamental national importance that we just cannot play around with it.  This is a matter of serious intent and will be followed through by me with serious intent.  I assure the House that the fullest possible discussion will take place when the legitimacy of election has been accorded to the representatives of our Defence personnel.  I will have meetings day in and day out and will work out the detail of the structures that will be embodied in the regulations which will be placed before this House.  Those regulations will be honed and fine-combed with the utmost knowledge that this is a serious duty on my part and on the part of my officials to ensure that the personnel of our Defence Forces have machinery of consultation that can last and that will be enshrined in permanent legislation.  That, along with the findings of the Gleeson Commission which we have established and which will report next June on the aspect of pay and conditions, will mark a new dimension in the status and standing of the Defence Forces in our State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for significant improvements in our social welfare schemes and services.  It also introduces two major new schemes and a number of other important developments.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a very substantial piece of legislation.  It comprises seven parts and a total of 51 sections.  This makes it the largest Social Welfare Bill since the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which I also had the honour to put through this House.  In fact, it is the largest piece of new social welfare legislation in almost 40 years since the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which established the social welfare system as we know it.</P>
      <P>The Bill continues the Government's policy of sustained improvements in social welfare.  We have once again more than maintained all payments against inflation; given special increases to those on the lowest payments; introduced many improvements in existing schemes; introduced a number of major new schemes and services; and improved in many respects the effectiveness of the delivery of our services, including the new appeals system.</P>
      <P>Two years ago in 1988 we extended social insurance to the self-employed. This was an historic development in social security coverage.  Last year, we introduced a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands as well as other measures aimed at modernising and improving our social welfare system.</P>
      <P>This year, in a major piece of social welfare legislation we are introducing two important new schemes &mdash; a carer's allowance and a lone parents' allowance.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes provisions for a number of major and innovative developments in social welfare legislation &mdash; I have already mentioned the introduction of a new carer's allowance and a new lone parent's allowance.  The Bill also includes the provisions necessary to establish a new social welfare appeals system which will be a major development in the administration of social welfare schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other innovative measures being introduced this year include a special clothing allowance to help social welfare recipients provide for their children's school and winter clothing which will come into effect in September.  There will be a number of improvements in the means tests including, in particular, an exemption of income from the sale of a pensioner's residence in certain circumstances and an exemption of payments to persons who accommodate students of Irish during the summer months.  I would also like to mention changes which I am introducing in the free schemes and, in particular, the provision <Col N="755" /> under the free travel scheme for free travel for companions.  This will enable a companion to travel free with a recipient of disabled person's maintenance allowance who cannot travel alone.  This will be of major benefit to people in this situation and will be of particular benefit to the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>In last year's Social Welfare Act, I provided that the prescribed relative's allowance could be paid directly to the person who provides the care.  Now we are going further to provide for the first time for a separate carer's allowance. Despite the changes we are witnessing in society today, such as greater mobility for young people and increased participation by married women in the workforce, the family continues to be the strongest and most reliable source of care for elderly incapacitated people.  The majority of the elderly and the handicapped continue to be cared for at home living with their spouse or children or with another relative, rather than in institutions.</P>
    <P>This new allowance, which I am particularly pleased to introduce, represents a milestone in the development of our social welfare services.  For the first time in our legislation we are giving official recognition to the role of the carer who provides full time care for elderly people in the community.  Many public representatives and voluntary groups have stressed the importance of the work of those who care for the elderly and the need for this work to be recognised.  Such was the lack of recognition of these caring people, mainly women, that they have been referred to as the &ldquo;forgotten army&rdquo;. Their selfless dedication has been of inestimable value to the community over the years.  I am delighted to be able to recognise the dedication of carers with the introduction of this new allowance.</P>
    <P>Better living standards and improved health care have increased life expectancy for all of us.  The number of elderly people is increasing and will continue to increase.  Some of these will need full-time <Col N="756" /> care and attention.  Where possible, this is best provided in the home.  This is where carers have such an important role.  I am anxious that this role be recognised and that carers are supported and encouraged.  The new allowance represents much-needed reform in this area.</P>
    <P>The development is also in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The commission recommended that the prescribed relative's allowance be abolished and that carers should be entitled to receive a social assistance payment in their own right.  The new allowance will be £45 per week and some 8,000 carers are expected to benefit under the new scheme.  This compares with the existing prescribed relative's allowance of £28 which only applies to almost 2,000 caring relatives.</P>
    <P>For those who already had the prescribed relative's allowance, the new allowance provides an increase of £17 per week.  For others, it provides a new payment of £45 per week.  The greatest gains go to those cases where the carer was hitherto receiving no payment at all because of the various restrictions attached to the prescribed relative's allowance.  Such households can now benefit by the full £45.  In addition child dependant increases will be payable where the carer has children.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the House that many of the restrictions which apply to the existing prescribed relatives allowance will be dropped when the new allowance comes into force.  These provisions will be made by regulations.  For example, at present the allowance is not paid if the carer is a married person dependent on his or her spouse.  The new allowance will be paid in such cases, subject to a means test.  This represents a significant improvement in the position of a married woman, with a husband on a low income, who cares for an elderly relative at home.  The new allowance will also be paid in cases where the carer is not a relative and to people who are currently excluded because others are living in the house.</P>
    <P>The position of people at present getting the prescribed relative's allowance <Col N="757" /> will be protected.  That is what we call the saver clause.  If, due to the means test, a person getting this allowance would get a lower rate on the new carer's allowance, they will be able to retain their existing prescribed relative's allowance.  I believe that the introduction of the allowance will lead to a greater awareness of the important part played by carers in the care of the elderly.  It will also enable them to carry out this task by providing them with a secure and independent source of income.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing a new allowance for lone parents which will mean for the first time that there will be a single means-tested payment for all lone parents with at least one dependent child. The need for this scheme was emphasised strongly by the voluntary groups who participated in our pre-budget forum.  I would like to highlight a number of aspects of this scheme.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, it formally recognises that all parents bringing up children on their own face similar problems.  The ongoing difficulties being experienced by families in this situation are similar whatever the reasons for them becoming one parent families in the first place.  The objective of the social welfare system must be to address the income maintenance needs of these families.  It must treat all families in a similar manner whether the parent is a man or woman and regardless of the circumstances which originally gave rise to their lone parenthood.</P>
    <P>Currently, the needs of lone parents are catered for by six different schemes. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme also caters for a number of persons who cannot qualify for existing schemes.  It is a feature of the current arrangements that lone parents are categorised according to the circumstances which gave rise to their situation.  This arose partly because of the piecemeal development of the provisions for one parent families.  Originally, of course, we only had the schemes for widows.  In the seventies separate schemes were introduced for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoner's wives.  These were <Col N="758" /> considered innovative and progressive in their time and made a substantial improvement to the lives of many lone parents.  Last year I introduced for the first time new schemes for widowers and deserted husbands.</P>
    <P>The new scheme which I am now providing for in the Bill will streamline all existing social assistance payments for lone parents.  It will incorporate the existing schemes for unmarried mothers, widowers and deserted husbands.  Women receiving widow's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance, who have child dependants will also be covered by the new scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new allowance will, for the first time, provide a special means-tested social welfare payment for certain lone parents such as separated spouses, unmarried fathers and prisoners' husbands. Up to now the only social welfare payment available to lone parents in these circumstances has been supplementary welfare allowance.  I am sure Deputies will agree that the new scheme represents a landmark in the development of a non-discriminatory social welfare allowance for lone parents who are unable to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>The third major initiative for which provision is being made in the Bill is the improved social welfare appeals system. At present appeals are made to me as Minister for Social Welfare and are processed by my Department.  The appeals are heard by appeals officers who are independent in the exercise of their functions and have been recognised as such by the courts.  Nevertheless the fact that the appeals branch in administering appeals is linked with the Department has been the subject of criticism.  I am taking measures to separate clearly the appeals function from the Department by setting it up as a separate executive office.  This is in line with the commitments given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements appeals will be made direct to the chief appeals officer and the appeals office will deal <Col N="759" /> with all aspects of appeals.  I will be providing that in future claimants whose appeals are refused will get information about the reasons for refusal and will be encouraged to seek any additional information they require as a basis for their appeal.</P>
    <P>Appeals officers and the chief appeals officer will be appointed by the Minister for Social Welfare.  Individual appeal officers will retain the discretion to decide whether appeals are dealt with summarily or by oral hearing.  However, I am also providing that the Minister for Social Welfare and persons designated by him will in future have the power to direct that an oral hearing be allowed where they consider it warranted in a particular case.  The new appeals office will be a self-contained office headed by a director and chief appeals officer.  It will have its own manager and secretarial staff.  Its headquarters in D'Olier House will include private rooms for the hearing of appeals.</P>
    <P>Already the chief appeals officer has been appointed.  Work on the refurbishing of office accommodation will commence within the next few weeks. Preparatory and architectural work has already been completed by the Office of Public Works.  The new office will have its own self-contained accommodation and its own secretarial staff.  Consultation and hearing rooms will be provided and particular attention is being paid to the need for privacy for clients.  I am confident that the facilities will underscore the independence and separate nature of the new appeals office.  Regulations will be made to update the procedures in relation to appeals in line with the new developments and to prescribe the functions of the director and chief appeals officer.  I expect the new office to be fully operational by the late summer.</P>
    <P>The current system of appeals has many positive features in relation to simplicity, speed and accessibility which I have been careful to retain.  One such feature is informality, which provides a significant advantage over a more legalistic system in terms of providing the best <Col N="760" /> possible service.  The changes I am now making will maintain the independence of the appeals system and ensure that it is perceived to be fair and independent. They will also fulfil the undertakings contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with the social partners and in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The total value of the social welfare increases and related measures announced in the budget is £216 million in a full year and £100 million this year. Total social welfare spending this year will, as a result, increase to £2,764 million which is equivalent to £7.5 million for each day of the year.  That level of spending on social welfare is the highest ever in the history of the State.  It demonstrates once again our continued determination to protect and improve the position of those dependent on our social services.</P>
    <P>Among the measures provided for in this Bill are &mdash; an increase in general of 5 per cent in social welfare weekly rates of payment with special increases of up to 11 per cent for 16 different groups of welfare recipients, mainly those on the lowest payments; further streamlining of the rates for child dependants, reduced now to six compared with 36 in 1987, with an increase to £11 in the minimum weekly payment; an increase of 5 per cent in the monthly rates of child benefit; replacement of the existing prescribed relative's allowance by a new carer's allowance which will be payable on a means-tested basis to a wider range of persons providing full-time care and attention to pensioners; introduction of a new lone parents allowance for parents bringing up children on their own which will streamline all existing social assistance schemes for lone parents and which will include, for the first time, lone parents such as separated spouses, unmarried fathers and prisoners' husbands; measures to facilitate the establishment of the new social welfare appeals office; a major initiative to relieve those on low earnings of their liability for PRSI contributions while preserving their entitlements to benefits and pensions; improvements in means-testing which will exempt the income from the sale of a pensioner's home in certain <Col N="761" /> circumstances and the income received by Mná Tí living in Gaeltacht areas who accommodate Irish students; and new arrangements involving the integration of the redundancy fund and the occupational injuries fund with the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>The increases in payments are provided for in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill. The increase of 5 per cent generally in social welfare payments will more than maintain the position of all claimants, since the rate of inflation is expected to be around 3 per cent for the year mid-1990 to mid-1991.  The special increases for 16 different groups including the unemployed, widows, the elderly and lone parents reaffirm the Government's commitment to improving the position of those on the lower payments.  Ranging from 5 per cent in general up to 1 per cent, these increases more than meet our commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The main improvements in rates are: an increase of 5 per cent generally in the weekly rates of social insurance, social assistance and occupational injuries benefits; a 10.6 per cent in the personal rates of long-term unemployment assistance and single woman's allowance; special increases of between 7 per cent and 15 per cent in the rates for adult dependants of the unemployed and those on supplementary welfare allowance.  The new adult dependant rate for all of these payments will be £31 a week from July; an increase of £4 (8.2 per cent) a week for widows, widowers, deserted wives/ husbands, unmarried mothers and prisoners wives, under age 66, on social assistance (means-tested) pensions or allowances; 6 per cent increase in the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension; almost 7 per cent, £3.50 per week, for widows and deserted wives, under age 66, receiving contributory payments; an increase of 7 per cent in the personal rate of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance; and £3 a week increase in the personal rates for those receiving disability and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> This year the Government have again provided special increases for those on the lower payments who are the least well off.  Continuing our commitment to improving the position of the long-term unemployed, an increase of £5 a week has been provided for in the personal rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The further streamlining of rates of adult dependant allowance together with the increase in the minimum child dependant payment has substantially improved the payment for families depending on long-term unemployment assistance.  From July, a couple with three children will receive an increase of £9 bringing their payment to £116 a week. These latest increases will mean that the rate of payment for these families has been increased by almost 30 per cent since July 1986.</P>
    <P>This year, new categories have been included in the special increases.  An old age pension couple, both over age 66, will receive £106 a week, an increase of £6, while a widow under age 66 with two children will receive an increase of £5.20, bringing her new rate to £80 a week.</P>
    <P>This year we are continuing to streamline and improve the number of different rates for adult and child dependants.  I reduced the number of rates of adult dependant allowance for the unemployed to two last year.  This Bill provides that, in future, there will be only one rate for this group.  The new rate for an adult dependant allowance payable with all unemployment payments and with disability benefit will be £31 a week from July.  This new payment means an increase of £4.10, or 15.2 per cent, for adult dependants of those on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance and an increase of £2, or 6.9 per cent, for those on disability benefit, unemployment benefit or long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>This year I am again reducing the number of child dependant rates by increasing the lower payments.  In 1987 we had 36 rates for children.  Last year these were reduced to 12 rates and this year I am further reducing them to six. <Col N="763" /> The minimum payment which I introduced last year is being increased to £11 a week and the range of payments for children will now be between £11 and £15.</P>
    <P>The following examples illustrate the effect of the increases which apply from July next: A couple with two children on long term UA will receive £105 per week, an increase of £8, while a couple with four children will receive an increase of £10 bringing their payment to £127; a couple with four children on short term UA or Supplementary Welfare Allowance will receive £120 per week, which is an increase of £11.10, while a couple with six children will get an increase of £13.10, and a total payment of £142; a lone parent under 66 with three children on an assistance payment will receive an additional £5.20, giving a total payment of £93.50; a widow or deserted wife on a contributory payment with four children will receive a payment of £116 which is an increase of £5.10; an old age pensioner with an adult dependant on a non-contributory pension will receive a total increase of £4.40, giving them a payment of £79.50; a couple both over 66, and under 80, on a contributory old age pension will receive a payment of £107.20 which is an increase of £5.00.</P>
    <P>The monthly rates of child benefit are also being increased by 5 per cent from October.  Section 5 sets out the new rates. £15.80 will be payable in respect of each of the first four children and the new rate for the fifth and subsequent children will be £22.90.  A family with four children will receive an increase of £3 a month and their new rate will be £63.20.  The increase for a family with six children will be £5.30 a month and their new rate will be £109 a month.  About 470,000 families benefit from this scheme in respect of over one million children.  With its universal nature and the fact that it is paid direct to mothers, child benefit is one of the most effective instruments available to the State through which the important role of mothers in bringing up children can be recognised.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that child dependant <Col N="764" /> payments for long-term recipients will be continued up to age 20 where the child remains in full-time education.  Deputies will recall that I extended the age limit from 18 to 19 years last year.  Next year, the Government plans to continue these payments up to age 21 in line with the provision for widows and other lone parents.  The measure will take effect from September.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 provide for the customary increase in the earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable.  Again this year I am glad to say that the rate of social insurance contribution is not being increased.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the increase in the ceiling for employers and employees. The increase in the ceiling for the self-employed is provided for in section 8. From 6 April 1990, employees and the self-employed will pay PRSI contributions in respect of earnings up to £17,300 instead of £16,700 at present. Employers will continue to pay contributions up to a ceiling of £18,600 for workers with these higher earnings.</P>
    <P>The contribution rate for the self-employed will be 5 per cent from April 1990.  I am pleased to inform the House that the self-employed are now making a substantial contribution to the PRSI pension system.  Income from the scheme for the self-employed will be £62 million this year.  This is some 30 per cent ahead of the original target.  Until the scheme for the self-employed was introduced, up to 70 per cent of self-employed persons relied on means-tested payments in their old age.  They now have entitlement to old age (contributory) pension and widows and orphans pension on a similar basis to employees.</P>
    <P>The question of the coverage of the scheme to include invalidity pension at my request is being considered by the National Pensions Board.  I look forward to their report later this year.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the PRSI exemption for low paid workers announced in the budget.  From the beginning of the next tax year workers currently liable for Class A contributions whose gross earnings are £60 or less in a week will <Col N="765" /> be exempt from their share of the PRSI contribution, 5.5 per cent, for that week. The health and employment levies will continue to be payable by workers who do not hold a medical card.  The exemption means an increase of up to £3.30 a week in take home pay for workers who do not have any other deductions or levies.  Even though they do not have to pay their social insurance contributions, exempted workers will continue to have full entitlement to social insurance benefits and pensions.  It is estimated that over 50,000 workers will benefit from the exemption.</P>
    <P>The new provision, together with the improved tax exemption limits announced in the budget, will make a significant improvement in the take home pay for low paid workers.  Families on low pay will also benefit from the improvements in the family income supplement scheme which I will be announcing soon.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the reintroduction of the employer's PRSI exemption scheme.  Earlier schemes covered the 1986-87 and 1987-88 tax years.  The latest scheme applies to the 1990-91 tax year in respect of each employee taken on during the period from 23 October 1989 to 28 February 1990.  The exemption covers the employer's portion of the PRSI contribution only and is confined to workers who were additional to the employers workforce on 27 September 1989.</P>
    <P>At earnings of £250 the exemption can be worth up to £1,585 a year to an employer in respect of each employee. Latest figures in my Department indicate that about 700 employers will benefit from the exemption in the 1990-91 tax year for in the region of 1,000 employees.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill provides for an increase from £69 to £72 in the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the rate of pay-related benefit. The disregarding of a proportion of reckonable earnings in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable with flat rate benefits has been an essential feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1974.  The purpose of the <Col N="766" /> disregard is to take account, in the calculation of pay-related benefit, of the amount payable by way of flat rate benefit.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 to 16 provide for the new allowance for parents bringing up children on their own.  Section 12 sets out the persons who are to be regarded as lone parents.  It provides that the circumstances in which lone parents will be regarded as separated or unmarried will be set out in regulations.  It also sets out the rates of entitlement.  The amount of the allowance will depend on the number of dependent children and the claimant's weekly means.  The maximum weekly rates that will apply when the scheme is introduced will be £66.50 for a parent with one child, made up of a personal rate of £53 and £13.50 child dependant allowance.  An extra £13.50 will be payable in respect of each additional child.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 12 the existing widows non-contributory pension and deserted wives allowance scheme will continue to apply to women without children.  Sections 13 to 16 provide for various amendments to facilitate the introduction of the scheme and that the scheme will be brought into effect by way of a commencement order.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the new allowance will apply to lone parents who are bringing up at least one dependent child on their own &mdash; children can be regarded as dependants until they reach the age of 18, or 21 if they are in full-time education; satisfy a means test &mdash; the means test will be the same as that used for the widow's non-contributory pension and is designed to allow for a certain amount of part-time work; and are not cohabiting, that is, living with another man or woman as husband and wife.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to be able to bring this measure before the House. Apart from the major benefits it will provide to parents bringing up their children in what must be very difficult circumstances, it represents a major step for my Department in rationalising the number of schemes which cater for persons with similar needs.  The amalgamation of these schemes will enable <Col N="767" /> me to direct resources to more effective control of these schemes and to the pursuit of deserting spouses.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 provide for the new carer's allowance which I described earlier. Section 17 inserts a new chapter in the principal Act covering these allowances. It provides among other things for the circumstances in which persons will be considered carers, the rules in relation to means and the rates of payment.  It also provides for the making of regulations setting up the scheme.  The scheme is to come into effect by way of commencement order.  Section 18 provides for consequential amendments to the principal Act arising out of the insertion of the provisions for the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 22 provide for a number of legislative changes to facilitate the setting up of the new appeals office in line with our commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Section 19 provides that appeals will, in future, be made directly to the chief appeals officer who will also be the director of the new office. The section also provides for the transfer of some of the functions which currently reside with the Minister to the chief appeals officer.  An important provision here is that where the Minister considers that the circumstances of a particular case warrant an oral hearing, he may direct that the case be dealt with by way of an oral hearing.  Section 20 provides that the chief appeals officer may refer questions to the High Court.  Section 21 provides that the chief appeals officer shall have such functions as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 to 31 provide for the amalgamation of the occupational injuries fund and the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  The amalgamation of these funds was announced in the context of the publication of the 1990 Estimates. The amalgamation will take effect from 1 May 1990.  After that date, payments which at present come from the occupational injuries fund and the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund will be made out of the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The three separate rates of employer <Col N="768" /> contribution to the three funds will be aggregated to form a single contribution rate subject to a single ceiling.  I am pleased to say that there will be no change in the contribution rate on account of the amalgamation.  For the next tax year commencing on the 6 April 1990 the contribution rate for employers will continue to be 12.2 per cent.  The amalgamation will allow for easier administration, more efficient accountability and control, more secure financing and will ensure that social welfare payments in respect of employees will originate from one fund.</P>
    <P>Sections 23 to 26 provide for the relevant amendments to the legislative references to the occupational injuries fund and the redundancy and employers insolvency fund.  Section 24 provides for the transfer to the Social Insurance Fund of all moneys standing to the credit of these funds on 30 April 1990 as well as any investment income accruing after that date.  Section 25 provides that any outstanding contributions due under the Employers' Employment Contribution Scheme Act, 1981, will be paid into the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>Sections 27, 28 and 29 provide for the necessary amendments to references in the Redundancy Payments Acts and the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act.  Section 30 sets out the definition for this Part and section 31 provides that the new arrangements will commence on 1 May 1990.</P>
    <P>Section 32 relaxes a condition for the receipt of disability benefit after one year, which I consider particularly harsh in its application to some persons.  Under the present legislation a person who has been in receipt of disability benefit for one year is required to have 260 employment contributions paid and, in addition at least 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year for the payment of disability benefit to continue. Claimants in future may continue to receive benefit if they remain incapacitated for work without having to satisfy the requirement of having 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides for another <Col N="769" /> measure which I think will make an appreciable difference to older persons who have to cope with the death of a spouse.  It extends the &ldquo;after death&rdquo; payments to spouses in respect of whom an adult dependant allowance would have been payable but for the fact that they were receiving an old age non-contributory pension or a blind pension in his or her own right.  Under existing provisions, six weeks payment of benefit is made on the death of a social welfare recipient to the spouse for whom the adult dependant allowance was being paid.  Payments are subsequently treated as payment on account of any widow's or widower's pension which becomes payable.</P>
    <P>Sections 34 and 35 provide for a number of improvements in the operation of the means test.  Deputies will be familiar with the circumstances that form the background to section 35.  Many elderly persons are living in houses which have been their homes for many years but which are no longer suited to their needs and which they are no longer in a position to maintain.  Although they may be able to find something more suited to their needs or have the opportunity to avail of sheltered housing, they face the dilemma that, if they sell their homes, they may lose all or part of their pensions because the capital realised on the sale of the house will fall to be assessed as means under the rules for assessing capital. Faced with this situation it is understandable that an elderly person may hold onto their home, perhaps ending up in hospital or in institutionalised care instead of living out their lives in comfortable circumstances in the community. Representations have been made to me from time to time about such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides for regulatory powers to exempt the income derived from the sale of a pensioner's principal residence from assessment of means in certain circumstances.  This is something that Deputies generally will welcome because it is an important improvement.</P>
    <P>Section 34 of the Bill provides that payments received by persons living in <Col N="770" /> Gaeltacht areas who accommodate Irish students who wish to improve their fluency in the Irish language will not be assessed as means.  This provision will benefit the Mná Tí of the Gaeltacht areas who play such a vital role in fostering an interest among the young in our language.</P>
    <P>In regard to widows and PRSI contributions Deputies will be aware of the arrangements which are in operation for a number of years now which exempt widows and other groups from liability for the employee's share of the PRSI contribution.  When social insurance cover was extended to the self-employed in April 1988, similar arrangements were made for widows and other groups who were self-employed.  The exemption applies to recipients of widow's pensions (contributory or non-contributory), deserted wife's benefit or allowance, unmarried mother's allowance, widow's pension under the occupational injuries scheme and those receiving payments corresponding to a widow's (contributory) pension or to an occupational injuries widow's pension from another member state of the EC.</P>
    <P>In addition to the employee's share of the social insurance contribution, the exemption also covers the health contribution and the employment and training levy.</P>
    <P>In line with a Government decision taken last year in the context of expenditure reviews, I am proposing, in section 36 of the Bill, that those arrangements be phased out over the next three years.</P>
    <P>From 6 April next, widows and other persons affected who are employees will pay a PRSI contribution of 3 per cent increasing to 4 per cent in the year commencing 6 April 1991.  The full employee's social insurance contribution of 5.5 per cent will be payable in the year commencing 6 April 1992.  The health contribution and the employment and training levy will continue to be exempted.  I should also mention that <Col N="771" /> widows and other persons affected who are on low pay and who benefit under the PRSI exemption scheme I referred to earlier, of course, will continue to be exempt from their share of the PRSI contribution.</P>
    <P>I am proposing similar arrangements for those in this category who are self-employed. A contribution of 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent will be payable for the next three years respectively subject to the minimum annual contribution of £208 applicable to self-employed contributors generally.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of their renewed liability for PRSI contributions, I am also arranging from 6 April next for widows and other groups to be entitled once again to disability benefit at half-rate for up to 15 months duration in addition to their existing pension or allowance entitlement. Deputies will recall that the half-rate disability benefit entitlement was discontinued for widows and others in January 1988.  Widows and others on low pay who benefit under the PRSI exemption scheme will also be entitled to the half-rate disability benefit for 15 months.  I am happy that the new arrangements for widows and others represent a reasonable approach to this question and that they will be welcomed by widows in employment generally who are willing to pay PRSI again in return for the extra benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 37 exempts certain persons from the scope of the social insurance scheme for the self-employed.  I am proposing to exempt persons who are receiving occupational pensions on account of their late spouse and whose only other income is unearned income.  This is in line with an existing provision which applies to occupational pensioners whose only other income is unearned income. These pensioners have been exempted from the scheme all along.  Persons who live abroad and who are liable for PRSI solely because they have investment income in this country are also being exempted under section 37.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides that any moneys paid by way of supplementary welfare <Col N="772" /> allowance in respect of a period during which the claimant is awaiting payment of disabled persons maintenance or infectious diseases maintenance allowance, shall be treated as payment on account of the allowance in question.  Similar provisions already exist in respect of supplementary welfare allowance claimants who are awaiting payment of a social welfare payment whereby the health board may recoup the amount of supplementary welfare allowance from the arrears of the social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>A person, who as a result of an occupational injury or prescribed disease, suffers loss of physical or mental faculty, is paid disablement benefit by way of pension if the assessment of disablement is greater than 19 per cent.  In cases where the assessment is between 1 per cent and 19 per cent a gratuity is normally payable. However, if the period of assessment is for life or exceeds seven years the claimant may opt for either a gratuity or a pension.  In some cases the weekly amount of such pensions can be quite small and, therefore, I am providing in section 39 of the Bill for a gratuity to be paid in respect of all new assessments between 1 per cent and 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>In sections 40 and 41 I am providing for amendments to the pre-retirement allowance, the single woman's allowance and the orphan's, non-contributory, pension, to allow that the maximum rates of these payments will be payable to persons with means of up to £2.</P>
    <P>In regard to the family income supplement sections 42 and 43 provide for technical amendments to facilitate the adjustment of minimum payments and payments of uneven amounts.  At present family income supplement is payable in units of £1 and, where the amount payable is less than £1 a supplement of £1 is paid.  Section 42 provides that where the weekly supplement as calculated falls below a prescribed amount the supplement shall be payable at a rate equivalent to the prescribed amount.  Section 43 provides for a technical amendment to the rates payable under the various social assistance schemes to enable the <Col N="773" /> rounding up of payments.  These are technical improvements to the family income supplement which are necessary if we are to make some of the improvements in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Section 45 provides that any sum deducted from an employee in respect of social insurance contributions but still unpaid at the time of a winding-up under the Companies Acts will not be regarded as part of the assets of a limited company but instead will be paid to the Social Insurance Fund.  I regard this measure as a positive one as it will help to safeguard the entitlements of insured persons who become unemployed due to the winding-up of a limited company.  The section also confirms the preferential debt status of unpaid PRSI contributions in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Section 46 extends to public sector drivers and vehicles the provision that the amount of disability benefit, pay-related benefit or invalidity pension, payable for up to five years and arising out of a traffic accident, shall be taken into account in assessing damages for personal injuries.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be familiar with the vocational training opportunities scheme.  The scheme affords the long-term unemployed an opportunity to attend education and training courses at their local VEC and at the same time receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.  This scheme is now administered by the Department of Education but was originally piloted by my Department as the educational opportunities scheme.  The scheme is going well.  It is up and running in 13 centres with about 200 participants and is planned to progressively expand the number of centres throughout the country.  Section 47 is designed to ensure that persons who embark on a course under the scheme and later find out that it does not work out for them may resume claiming their unemployment payments at the long-term rate without serving waiting days when they return to the Live Register.</P>
    <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme complements the other initiatives in relation to education which I have <Col N="774" /> introduced for the unemployed.  The part-time education initiative allows unemployed persons to attend education courses without infringing the conditions for receipt of their unemployment payments. Last December I made regulations facilitating long-term unemployed persons to participate in second level certificate courses while receiving their unemployment payments.  I expect to announce details of a pilot scheme allowing the long-term unemployed to pursue third-level education courses shortly.</P>
    <P>A person convicted of fraudulently obtaining a social insurance payment is disqualified for receiving benefit for three months.  In section 48 I propose to bring the corresponding provision in relation to social assistance payments into line by reducing the disqualification period for these payments from six to three months.</P>
    <P>Section 44 provides for certain amendments to the provision relating to prosecutions. These amendments are necessary in the context of proposed alternative methods for making unemployment payments which I am sure Deputies will welcome.  Sections 49, 50 and 51 provide for technical amendments to the basic legislation.  Sections 49 and 50 are designed to simplify the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which sets out the rates of social insurance payments.  This is in keeping with my policy of simplifying the system so that it may be more easily understood by clients.  Section 51 provides that certain regulations will require the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures provided for in the Bill I am making a number of other improvements to which I would like to refer briefly.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements introduced last year into the footwear scheme, I am pleased that we are able to go a step further this year and provide a clothing allowance to help social welfare recipients to provide for their children's school and winter clothing.  The sum of £3 million is being allocated for this purpose. This scheme will come into operation in September and I will be announcing the details in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> I am continuing to improve the free travel, free electricity, TV licence and telephone rental schemes and to remove anomalies that come to our notice. Improvements being implemented this year are as follows: the free travel scheme will be altered so as to allow recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance who cannot travel alone to bring along a companion when availing of the free travel concession.  This will help physically and mentally handicapped people to utilise the free travel concession more. fully.  The detailed arrangements under which this measure will operate are being considered at present and the concession will be brought into operation as soon as possible this year; elderly pensioners over 80 years of age will be allowed to retain their entitlement to free electricity allowance when people come to live with them; invalidity pensioners who transfer to retirement pension on reaching 65 years of age will no longer lose their entitlement to the free schemes and free scheme entitlements will be extended to all social security pensioners of States with whom Ireland has signed bilateral social security agreements.  We have signed some already and others are in the pipeline and will be coming up over the next year or so.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are extending the national fuel scheme to households where a long-term social welfare recipient lives with someone on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance, and to smallholders receiving long-term unemployment assistance who are living alone.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the start of my speech, this Bill is a very important and in some respects an historic piece of legislation in those dependent on the State's support progress we have made in the past three years in improving and modernising the social welfare system.  In that short period we have introduced some of the most farreaching improvements ever seen.  We are conscious that social welfare recipients are among the most vulnerable sections of society and that legislative change can have a major impact on them. <Col N="776" /> Our overriding objective at all times is to safeguard and improve the position of those dependent on the State's support systems.  I am satisfied that we are achieving that objective through our policy of progressively raising and improving the standard of living of social welfare recipients and introducing new provisions to meet the changing needs of society.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill because:&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  it fails to fundamentally reform the Social Welfare system,</P>
      <P>(b)  it leaves the bulk of the low-paid in the PRSI net,</P>
      <P>(c)  it retains substantial anomalies and multiple means-testing based on gross rather than net incomes,</P>
      <P>(d)  it makes only a token gesture towards anti-poverty measures, and</P>
      <P>(e)  it totally fails to develop adequate educational opportunities and voluntary work options for the quarter of a million unemployed and their dependants.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there has ever been an occasion in modern Irish history when the Social Welfare Bill and its contents have been more central to more people than at this time.  I do not say that lightly. I say it because we are continuing into a period in which widespread long-term unemployment is an endemic feature of our society and will be with us, even on the most optimistic of job creation forecasts, until the end of the century. The view of unemployment as a temporary black spot in a person's life is no longer a reality.  For many people the quality of their life of necessity will be shaped by the quality of the social welfare system.  That is why this is such an important debate and why this Bill deserves the <Col N="777" /> closest attention of this House.  Fine Gael are opposing the Bill on Second Stage although we will do our best to produce amendments at a later stage, knowing the realities of the figures in the House, to improve the Bill along the lines we feel are important.</P>
    <P>In 1989 we produced a radical policy document, <i>Putting the Country First</i> which proposed a movement towards a just society.  That was before the recent Árd-Fheis.  It was part of a long tradition in Fine Gael going back to the sixties, one which I hope will be maintained and developed.  This included a basic income scheme, a single eligibility test with graduated entitlement to benefit, the establishment of one-stop welfare shops and more favourable treatment of part-time work, educational programmes and voluntary work options.  Fine Gael proposed major integrated reforms in the tax and PRSI systems.  It is always a little limiting to have to discuss the Social Welfare Bill in isolation because it operates in tandem with the tax system.  Much of the disappointment in relation to this Social Welfare Bill mirrors our feelings in relation to the failure to introduce substantial reform in the tax area which can have a radical effect on employment and employment creation.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also proposed, and will seek to have included in this Bill by way of amendment, the following reforms of the social welfare system: the reform of the supplementary welfare system, the possibility of rent and mortgage subsidy to the low paid and the exclusion of benefits for those over 25 years of age deemed to arise from living at home in calculating their entitlement to unemployment assistance, in view of the long-term nature of unemployment in our society.  I have heard in the past few weeks of individuals being paid figures as low as 20 pence and 80 pence.  Recently I heard of the offer of £8 per week in social assistance to a 30 year old man. That kind of treatment of an adult in a society which cannot offer him employment is unacceptable.  At a certain age people should have an entitlement to a basic minimum without assessing the <Col N="778" /> benefit they get from living in their parents' home.  It is offensive that a 30 year old man should have to depend on his father's goodwill for pocket money to get into town to sign on the dole or apply for employment.</P>
    <P>We also propose giving the option to applicants for non-contributory pensions to have their capital assessed on the basis of their actual income from bank and other deposits rather than insisting on the present artificial 10 per cent.  Obviously with the change in interest rates that becomes a variable.  There have been some welcome changes in means testing proposed by the Minister in this Bill and we hope he might consider on Committee Stage looking at this area as well.  While the Minister has repeated his indication of some gesture in the direction of additional back-to-school payments, I will be very interested to receive more details by the time we conclude this debate tomorrow afternoon.  It would help us in deciding our approach to amendments in that area.</P>
    <P>None of these measures is addressed, or sufficiently addressed, in this Bill. While we will endeavour to amend the Bill on Committee Stage we consider it so fundamentally flawed that we will oppose its Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the flagship proposal of this year's Social Welfare Bill, the much hyped carer's allowance, is a major disappointment. Its presentation by the Minister as an increase from £27 to £45 per week is, for the vast bulk of those who will qualify, a blatant sham.  The number of people who will see that kind of increase will be less than the current 2,000 who are in receipt of prescribed relative's allowance.  Some persons who currently qualify for the existing allowance would not qualify for a carer's allowance as a result of the associated means test.  The Minister has acknowledged that.  I know he is not proposing to take it away from those who have it, but it will mean that in future people who might have got a prescribed relative's allowance will not qualify for any assistance in the context of their providing care for others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> Regrettably, no new categories of persons requiring full-time care are included. This is a major flaw which I hope the Minister will be willing to look at.  We will be pressing amendments as we go through later stages of this Bill to remedy this.  It means that because of the expectations built up by the headlines arising out of the earliest announcement about this along with the announcments over the weekend and today, parents of adult handicapped people will be disappointed unless the Minister agrees to accept a Fine Gael amendment to include recipients of DPMA as qualifying persons for whose care the allowance will apply.  I know the Minister has had direct correspondence, as I have, from the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped who describe their bitter disappointment that no provision has been made for people, many of them now advancing in years, who are looking after and caring for people with a physical disability and a mental handicap.  I know that is also based on a misunderstanding on their part about even inclusion in this scheme because for most of them the means test makes it irrelevant for them. However, for some of them it might mean the increase of £6 to £14 which in effect is what most people who qualify for and most new recipients will be receiving, not the difference between £25 and £47.  In that category of person are some particularly deserving of a response and a group for whom the provision of care is particularly difficult. Added to the problems of age are, in their case, the problems of mental illness, disturbing and violent behaviour and the insecurity and anxiety about what will happen to those they are looking after when they pass on or are no longer able to cope.  I ask the Minister to look at that most sympathetically and to ensure that the needs of adults with disabilities are fully considered and that people are not for financial reasons forced to leave the care of their families to institutions, which would be the height of folly.  It is neither socially nor otherwise desirable.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in the Bill <Col N="780" /> broaden generously the categories of people who may now qualify as carers, and we welcome that.  It is a major change and the Minister is to be commended for it.  However, rigid means testing such as applied to non-contributory pensions means that anybody whose spouse is employed other than those on a very low wage indeed will not qualify.  For those on social welfare payments in their own right this will constitute a drop from all individual payments.  Therefore, for those who in their own right are on a social welfare payment at the moment there will be a drop involved.  For the person who may have to give up employment entirely to provide care and who would be single, the increases will be between £6 and £14 on average, depending on the kind of social welfare payment they are receiving.  The Minister must take responsibility for the misrepresentation of the presentation and the huge expectation built up.  He knows that all around this country there are people now anticipating sizeable extra support for the provision of care who are going to be disappointed when they examine the fine print, as some of us dealing with this Bill in the House have had time to do, and realise that unless there are significant amendments they will be entirely excluded.  For many others the benefits will be a tiny proportion of what they had expected.  The reforms could be wholeheartedly welcomed were it not for those drawbacks.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives no indication of a date when the scheme will commence.  The Minister must have some idea of this. He makes provision for regulations which will include means testing and the commencement date.  At the end of Second Stage he might be in a position to indicate whether it will commence this year.  We hope it will be as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I ask him to consider extending to a person who is in insurable employment the carer's allowance, as of right, without a <Col N="781" /> means test similar to unemployment benefit or disability benefit because the person will be vacating full-time employment, vacating a job to be taken up by somebody else, when the net cost to the State will be insignificant.</P>
      <P>There is a great problem with the treatment of the carer's allowance under the social welfare system.  That system is essentially an income support scheme and here we are moving into a statement of how we believe our society should respond to the needs of those requiring care, be they elderly or sick.  It is arguable whether this should be dealt with under social welfare at all, and whether it may not be more appropriate to a health brief. We are asking people to provide care in the best possible way, which is socially and humanly most desirable and economically most effective, that is, in their own homes.  Community care should never be treated as a cheap option and we should be prepared to invest in it and try to frame a scheme which fits in with the social welfare system.  Maybe the Minister has views on this broader issue.  If so he might be in a position to respond in some more detail when he replies to the debate tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to a related issue.  There are a number of organisations, including the Soroptimists, who are anxiously trying to provide facilities to give breaks to people who are providing care on an ongoing basis.  If we listened to our radio programmes over recent weeks we would have heard that for carers that is a very big issue.  Getting off every now and again can mean they will continue for a great deal longer to carry their burden.  It is a very valuable service.  It is not directly related to the Bill but, as a result of the budget, the Minister has charge of a couple of little funds.  He might consider the allocation of lottery funds to voluntary agencies he has under his control to beef up his initiatives in this Bill in relation to support for carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the categories have been so broadly redefined.  Nobody is now excluded; everybody is included who is providing full-time care &mdash;<Col N="782" /> excluded rather severely by the means test but included for consideration.  That is welcome.  It gets it on the map in a new way.  It is a title that allows people to understand immediately and awards recognition to people who are doing a very important job for us.  We will be pressing amendments on Committee Stage along the lines I have indicated. I ask the Minister to consider responding positively, particularly to the extension of the scheme to those on Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance.</P>
    <P>A matter that has been announced many times in the past but the legislative changes to implement it are included in this Bill, is the establishment of an appeals office.  We are concerned that it will be seen as merely a cosmetic change. I indicated this concern earlier to the Minister when his intentions were announced originally in relation to this. I know the concern is shared by the associations looking for welfare reform. The proposal in Part V of the Bill is disappointing in its scope.  The changes are disappointing and seem cosmetic because they do not provide for consumer representation.  This is in effect an internal reorganisation and lacks the independence which is an essential feature of the changes sought by the various welfare reform groups who have lobbied for years on this issue.  At some level it should include welfare rights representatives.  It should not be confined simply to social welfare personnel but should be open to others to be involved.  We will propose amendments to redress this on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will look favourably at them.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill makes inadequate provision for families with children. Perhaps this is one of its most disappointing features.  The Minister, when dealing with child benefit, referred to rationalisation of rates, etc., and I accept that he has done a great deal in that area.  However, in terms of the volume of support for people with families, it is grossly inadequate to meet the crisis they face.  Report after report has highlighted that families with children are bearing the brunt of the recession and are <Col N="783" /> over-represented among the poor.  Huge numbers of children are growing up in poverty.  The budget did not in any serious way target this group.  In particular, older children make adult demands on family budgets, their clothing, food and educational needs are at an all-time high.  The need for additional payments for teenage children has been identified by the ESRI, the CMRS, the Combat Poverty Agency and the national campaign for social welfare reform.  I am surprised that the Minister did not take on board such a body of well founded opinion represented by those groups.  I am confident that the Minister does not share the view of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors which the Taoiseach unfortunately expressed in the House last week.  I know that the Minister values the work done by that agency and respects the fact that they are a disinterested group motivated by the best of all possible objectives and desires to see our society become fairer.  We in Fine Gael believe that changes to include payment for older children would greatly strengthen the Bill.</P>
    <P>We welcome an increase in child benefit, the first since July 1986.  However, it is a minimal increase and does not make up for the fact that this increase has not been changed since Deputy Woods became Minister for Social Welfare.  The last time it was increased regularly was during the period from 1982 to 1986 when child benefit was increased at least every alternate year and, where appropriate, increased consecutively.  The changes this year do not make up for the failure to increase the benefit since that time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the drift started in 1982 has been continued by the Minister in relation to the date of implementation of this payment which will not commence until October 1990, which is, in effect, half way through the year.  That limits its value and of all areas in the Bill this is the one about which there is most disappointment. The failure to effectively target additional payments to families with children will mean that many of them will not significantly improve their <Col N="784" /> situation as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system continues to be hostile to work and suspicious of education.  It does not address this issue properly.  We suggest that the earnings disregard for means tests, unchanged since 1975, should now be updated to a figure of £30 as requested by some of the welfare agencies.  This would allow some element of part-time work.  It would accept that for many people full-time employment is not an option and that occasional part-time employment may be a reality and a means of getting back into the workforce.  The fact that pound for pound everything you earn involves a cut in social welfare militates against this. Although it may have been acceptable when employment was short-term it is out of keeping with a period when, regrettably, unemployment is all too long-term.</P>
    <P>Futhermore, the VTOS scheme should be expanded to cover all adult beneficiaries of long-term social welfare payment and should be extended nationally. It is entirely unacceptable that 200 places only &mdash; at the time of going to print &mdash; are available for the vast numbers of unemployed and their dependents.  We have highlighted this issue at Question Time.  We will continue to do so until the level of participation relates to a sufficient number, as we adjudge it, of those who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Training and education are closely related to long-term unemployment. The progress which the Minister made since 1986 in this area is grossly inadequate. In 1986 the Minister admitted that there were two pilot schemes only providing 30 to 60 places.  I am glad that the numbers have now increased to 240. In November or December the Minister announced regulations which would allow many more educational schemes to be included.  That is very welcome but we repeat the urgency and the necessity for the Minister to interpret it generously.  It is also the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that he is in a position to answer to this House as to how the scheme is being implemented, unlike the last <Col N="785" /> occasion when I asked a question and the Minister said this was a decision for local employment offices and that he would not be in a position to indicate how many were involved and what criteria were being used.  That simply is not good enough.  It is important that the numbers involved should be monitored to see if we are making progress and what effect it has on their long-term employment prospects.  We will continue to give very high priority to this area.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the emergence of a new sub-class in the social welfare system.  I refer to the recipients of disability and unemployment benefit. Last year, coming up to Christmas, I highlighted the situation of recipients of disability and unemployment benefit. Nominally, these are short-term benefits and the recipients are in the privileged position of being in benefit.  However, the reality is very different for them and their families.  They are now on the lowest rate of benefit, lower than long-term assistance rates and they are not entitled to bonuses or supplements.  The situation is critical for families who are dependent on long-term disability benefit.  We argued this at Question Time and I know the Minister's problems in relation to the fact that some of them have other incomes.  However, of the 20,000 people in receipt of benefit for between three and eight years and who have no other income the situation is critical and needs a response.  The budget worsened their position and they lag further behind all other benefits which have been increased.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to allow this group to qualify for dependent payments for children over 18 years attending full-time education.  I will table an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.  The definition of &ldquo;qualified child&rdquo; is being extended to cover virtually all categories of social welfare recipients apart from this group.  In the past two weeks I have been visited by a number of families because it is at this time that the sixth year students reach the age of 18 and their parents are stunned to find that their child is a non-person.  There is no <Col N="786" /> acknowledgment of them for tax purposes or social welfare.  They are cut off and, because their parents are in receipt of disability benefit or unemployment benefit, they cannot receive any support from supplementary welfare or anything else.  It is a very real problem for them.  It puts immense pressure on young people approaching leaving certificate.  Their families have had to stretch an already inadequate budget to cover their education and this puts dreadful pressure on them to give up school.  The Minister has gone a great distance in extending the child dependant payments for children attending full-time education to many categories and he deserves credit for the steady progress in this area.  I suggest it would not be a huge additional cost to include those over 18 years of age attending full-time second-level education.  I would ask the Minister to consider this to help people in this group.  There is an on-going debate on the reason people are on long-term disability benefit.  This Bill, which has marginalised these people even more, will not find solutions for this group.</P>
    <P>I would like to give a warm welcome to the lone parent scheme and the Minister is to be congratulated for implementing it.  As well as rationalising all allowance schemes for lone parents it removes the socially stigmatising terminology associated with some of the schemes.  This too is very welcome.  As the Minister identified, it is the end of a programme of change which included the creation of the widower's allowance last year.  The rationalising and streamlining of all the payments in the budget resulted in this scheme finally being established. It gives dignity to a great number of people and is the best possible example of an ideal social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of a group which to date have been in a no man's land in the area of social welfare &mdash; the category of single fathers.  They are now included under the lone parent's allowance and that is very welcome.  However, there is a glaring need to do the same in the area of contributory benefits for lone parents.  Some categories have been <Col N="787" /> entitled to a benefit while others have not been so entitled.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are very concerned that substantial anomalies remain in regard to old age pensions.  The Bill fails to address the issue raised for <i>pro rata</i> pensions to be awarded to pensioners with mixed contribution records.  In 1988 <i>pro rata</i> pensions were awarded to one group of pensioners with records of between five and 19 contributions.  This has created an obvious anomaly and injustice.  I know the Minister is kicking to touch by saying the matter has been referred to the National Pensions Board, but there is a limited life to that approach.  This issue must be faced, the economic cost fully assessed and justice done for pensioners who do not have time on their side.  This is an issue we propose to try to address on Committee Stage.  Obviously there are certain difficulties for an Opposition party putting down amendments which involve an additional charge, but I would be interested if the Minister would respond to this issue which we discussed to some extent at Question Time.</P>
    <P>One of the other major areas of failure in the budget is the issue of low pay. The PRSI exemption proposed by the Minister is of some value but to benefit a person would have to earn under £60 a week.  I suppose it would be of benefit to some women working part-time and their families for whom it would be an additional income, but it falls very far short of the Fine Gael proposal of an exemption from PRSI on the first £2,500 of income. This would be of benefit to all low paid workers and would be a far more progressive way of approaching the issue.  It would avoid the creation of a poverty trap.  We have already seen how exemption limits trap people who have a tendency to try to stay below the ceiling.  The exemption limit for equal payments has tended to trap a group of women who have tried to reduce their hours and income rather than go over the limit. That problem has always existed.</P>
    <P>There should be a general exemption which would be of benefit to everyone, <Col N="788" /> particularly those on low pay.  It would also help to provide extra employment for those in the low paid sector.  A special case is being made at the moment by the clothing industry who feel there would be great potential for extra employment in labour intensive industry if some of the burden of tax and PRSI could be lifted. We know the Government have indicated, in part of their internal dialogue with their Coalition colleagues, that they intend to look at this area in greater depth next year but I hope we can convince them to bring forward this review.  We will be putting down an amendment in this area on Committee Stage, proposing income and the Minister might get the Government to agree to this in the interim.</P>
    <P>We are a little in the dark in relation to what reforms the Minister proposes in the area of family income supplement. He referred to this in his speech.  If he could develop that a little more in response to Second Stage we might be more reassured.  The family income supplement is obviously another major element in this area as well as tax and PRSI.  There is also the issue of means testing and responding to the problems of people on low pay.  I would be interested to know the date of implementation of the PRSI exemption. Maybe this is referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum but I did not see it in the Bill.  Am I not properly informed or is it in the Bill?</P>

      <P>That is welcome.  I would ask the Minister to look again at means testing and the £50 exemption limit applicable to equal payments. Throughout the country welfare rights groups, women's groups and all of us have learned that the failure to index this payment has created a prison for women. Obviously if you are talking about a £50 income level you are talking about part-time employment but people are being forced to reduce their hours of work or <Col N="789" /> lose their social welfare dependent benefit which, following the increases in this budget, range from £31 to £39.  In effect, these people would be working for £11 or £12.  If there is an exemption limit it should be a realistic one and should be index linked.  This would bring the figure up currently to £65.  I welcome the additional changes in death benefit arrangements and in means testing in relation to the sale of houses.  The proposal to exempt certain payments to mná tí has been welcomed by some of my colleagues representing those areas and I am sure they will be referring to it later in the debate.</P>
      <P>Rural poverty has become a reality in recent years, never more so than this winter when prices for agricultural produce collapsed to an all time low.  The long term future of small farms does not affect the Department of Social Welfare but it does affect the Department of Agriculture and Food and, in a very big way, the EC who see the whole fabric of rural Europe being affected due to the difficulty in getting a decent standard of living for many people living on traditional family farms.  In so far as this proposal makes some gesture in that direction, we welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I continue to be concerned about the lack of drive in regard to anti-poverty initiatives.  The community development fund which we and the Combat Poverty Agency looked for has been addressed to some degree by the allocation of £0.6 million for community development projects, but regrettably this is in the Minister's own hands and is not being used in a way that acknowledges the role of communities in running their own affairs or their tremendous capacity to improve the quality of their lives, education, environment and employment opportunities. I wish to place on record the deep disappointment on this side of the House that this Government chose last year to turn down £8.5 million which the EC was anxious to have allocated directly to communities for their own development and under their control.  The best the Minister could do in response to that was to allocate £0.6 million, which he was <Col N="790" /> able to find in the Department, which is grossly inadequate and will be only a token gesture towards community development and will not in any way finance integrated development programmes. I would like to see this kept on the agenda; future opportunities for such funds should not be let slip by.  The Minister could not give an extra pound in child benefit per child per year but he could certainly find £8 million to effectively assist communities over a number of years in developing their funds.  Similarly I wish to express my disappointment that the funds for women's organisations are being held centrally and are not being allocated either to the Combat Poverty Agency or to the Council for the Status of Women.  I hope that situation will be redressed.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the extension of free travel to companions of a person receiving DPMA we regret that the scheme has not been extended to other categories.  We will be proposing amendments along these lines because, as is the case with other Deputies, this is an issue that has been coming up in correspondence to me from people who feel that free travel is irrelevant to them.  The Minister is conceding the point to persons in receipt of DPMA.  I think he should concede also in the case of other handicapped and elderly persons the right to have a companion travel with them if they do not happen to be married, as this right exists if they have a spouse.  It is creating a clear anomaly to confine this to one category of free travel beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I regret that changes in the schemes were confined to those over 80 years of age as this means that a very tiny proportion of senior citizens will benefit. While those in the 65 to 70 year old category seem generally to be fairly active certainly those over 70 would need some support and it would be a great help to them if they were allowed to live with their families without the loss of the support of the schemes.  Again I look for more generous interpretation of this reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the substantial contribution made to the PRSI <Col N="791" /> fund by the self employed.  I would be interested to know if he has any proposals to develop the insurance scheme further for the self employed in the area of disability and sickness benefits where they do not have cover at present but where the need crops up occasionally.  I know this would have to be negotiated with the representative groups but I wonder if any work has been done in this area.  I note that the Minister has made provision to pursue unmarried fathers in relation to the care of their children.  I am a little surprised that the Minister has the neck to introduce this measure in view of the fact that having announced his intention to pursue deserting husbands in the last Social Welfare Act not a single deserting husband has been pursued according to the reply he gave me.  He said he has not worked out how he will do this and is still discussing it.  While I welcome the declaration of intent in this regard I would prefer to see more substance in it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposal to integrate the occupational injury fund and the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund I would like to record that this has been done without consultation with the employers who had managed and established the funds and kept them extremely healthy.  They had ensured that the contribution level rose at a very modest rate in comparison with other social welfare funds.  I wonder how the figures will be arrived at in the future? The increases in contribution for occupational injury were based on actuarial valuations, on the needs and demands on the fund and the number of demands made in any year.  I wonder if the careful management of the fund that was possible in that situation will continue when it is integrated into the general Social Insurance Fund.  I am sure it is a nice windfall for the Minister and will help the Government to make the figures a little more palatable on this occasion.  Will there be as effective management of the fund as has been the case up to this? To date the employers were the total contributors and in years when there were no large drawdowns they could keep <Col N="792" /> contributions down; in many years there was no increase at all.  I know the fund was set up under legislation of this House but effectively a private group of individuals contributed to it separately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One recommendation of the Combat Poverty Agency is well worth taking on board and that is the need for people to understand the complexity of the social welfare system, the need to commence that process earlier than we do and to have education on social welfare included as part of the learning for life programme, etc. in our second-level schools and even from the earlier stages of education. It is a minor issue but it could be very important.  Social welfare schemes are complex enough as we public representatives have to interpret them day in and day out know, indeed as the Minister knows from preparing social welfare legislation annually.  It is vitally important that the average person understands the importance of what came to light at the Committee of Public Accounts, that was the whole question of whether contributions were being recorded and the need to keep track of your own social welfare number if you happen to stray over to Britain.  For instance it is important that people understand the need for proper records and for maintaining contributions, signing on for credits, etc.  All too often people only realise the importance of signing on when it is all too late.  This may not be central to the Bill and may not relate directly to <Col N="793" /> it but it is an important point and should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>We are opposing the Second Stage for all the reasons I have outlined and particularly because the social welfare system is more central to more people now than at any other time in our history.  It is vitally important we get it working right and will provide people with an opportunity to live with some dignity until such time as our society is organised in a way that it can offer them full participation in employment.  I do not believe this Bill will contribute substantially to that end.</P>

      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to respond to a Bill as the Labour Party spokesperson and I welcome the opportunity.  My records from 1 January this year show that I have dealt with 770 new cases in my constituency clinic, of which 30 per cent concern social welfare problems.  This is an indication of the importance of this Bill and the concept of the State caring for certain people who are unable to care for themselves.  It is also an indication of how complicated this area is and the need, as has been said by Deputy Flaherty, to inform people of their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to say how glad I am that Members of the Oireachtas are able to contact a specific section in the Department of Social Welfare, known as the TD inquiry section, about cases, the satff of which are most helpful.  This obviates the need to make personal or written representations in an effort to have difficulties facing people dependent on the State ironed out.  We act as a buffer between our constituents and the Department of Social Welfare on which they are very dependent and about which they know relatively little.  This contrasts starkly with the attitude adopted by some social welfare officers at local level, particularly when it comes to assessing eligibility for non-contributory entitlements. Not alone do they make it difficult for people &mdash; and I can quote instances &mdash; but they also express reservations about constituents consulting elected politicians. Often they go further and say that <Col N="794" /> there is no point in going to their local Deputy as he cannot do anything for them.  However, it is my experience that the opposite is often the case.  Without our intervention to inform people of their full entitlements and to tell the Department of Social Welfare what a person's means are, some of these files would get stuck in offices throughout the country with relatively little progress being made.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are to be welcomed.  They have been welcomed by bodies who have a non-vested interest, such as the Combat Poverty Agency, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors of Ireland and non-governmental agencies.  We also welcome the Bill and want to be constructive in our criticisms. If we believe that the Minister has not gone far enough we will be prepared to tell him so.  In particular we welcome the introduction of the new carer's allowance and lone parent allowance.  The Minister mentioned that in the seventies seven categories, who up to then had been disregarded, were brought in.  On this my first contribution to a Social Welfare Bill I wish to pay a special tribute to the memory of the late Brendan Corish and his Parliamentary Secretary, the late Frank Cluskey, for including special categories who had been neglected in the past, such as deserted wives, unmarried mothers, prisioners' wives.  The suggested new terminology of lone parent covers a multitude about whom we are all concerned but it is our experience that this category is widening as the days go by.  No matter how much we regret this we have to accept that this is what is happening.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out, as was done by the previous speaker, that because of the way the means test is operated the number of people who will qualify for these allowances is small.  In particular, the number of married women who will qualify for the new carer's allowance will be very small indeed.  In presenting this new carer's allowance the Minister pointed out in great detail that for the first time married women in the home will be eligible to receive this allowance. In the past married women in the home <Col N="795" /> were excluded from receiving the prescribed relative's allowance.  We welcome the fact that married women in the home will now be eligible to receive this allowance but because of the way in which the means test is operated very few of them will qualify.</P>
    <P>At present about 2,000 people are in receipt of the prescribed relative's allowance but I believe that the Minister's estimate of 8,000 as the number who will qualify is rather optimistic.  As I understand it, following a means test most married women will be excluded even though thousands provide in the home full-time care and attention for elderly incapacitated persons.  We on the Labour benches urge the Minister to look again at the means testing provisions and at the number of people who will be excluded from receiving from the State what is a small contribution in recognition of the work they do looking after elderly incapacitated persons.  If all those being looked after at home by their relatives, by married women in the home or by wives of their sons, were hospitalised or admitted to welfare homes, or long-stay geriatric institutions, the State would have to pay between £300 and £400 per week caring for these people.</P>
    <P>If the husband of a married woman is in receipt of more than £90 per week she will be excluded, even if she has no income.  At present under the law a woman is legally entitled to receive 50 per cent of her husband's income.  Therefore, in any means test 50 per cent of the husband's income will be taken into account with the result that these women, because they provide care in the home for an incapacitated person and are not able to fulfil any other vocation outside the home, will be excluded from receiving the allowance.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute to those who gave up full-time employment to care for elderly parents or relatives.  We expressed our gratitude to them for spending their lives at home looking after those elderly people by paying them the single woman's allowance.  The Minister should consider extending the scheme <Col N="796" /> applicable to Mná Tí in Gaeltacht areas to other carers.  The income to Mná Tí from accommodating Irish students is exempt.  I commend the Minister for that move.  We should do everything possible to encourage people to live in Gaeltacht areas.  In introducing that scheme the Minister has an opportunity to extend its provisions to those in receipt of carer's allowances.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the position of the wives of social welfare recipients.  It may happen that they will not be considered as an adult dependant of their husbands which will mean that they will receive less than the amount being paid in carer's allowance.  As far as I can see they are the only married women who will benefit under the carer's allowance scheme but it would be an extraordinary thing to remove a wife as a dependant to permit her to draw the carer's allowance if she is looking after an incapacitated person in the home.  The Minister must deal with that problem in a more formal way and I suggest that he should consider introducing a scheme like that under which Mná Tí benefit.</P>
    <P>I can see problems arising in regard to the equalisation legislation which permitted women to have an income of £50 per week before they were debarred as a dependant of their husband.  The Minister should make a gesture in regard to means testing in such cases.  I have been a public representative at different levels for many years but I cannot understand what one must do to prove means to some social welfare officers.  Is there a national set of guidelines for means testing?  I should like to quote a number of examples to highlight the difficulties public representatives face in regard to means tests.  The first example I should like to refer to is that of an applicant for a pension whose qualification number is V23809.  The man lives in a county council cottage which is situated on one acre of land.  Up to two or three years ago the man rented land annually and kept seven or eight cows.  When his health failed two years ago he was unable to continue, but his daughter, who at that time was residing in England, returned home and <Col N="797" /> acquired the cows.  She continued to rent the land and look after those animals.  I have an affidavit, sworn in front of a commissioner of oaths, to the effect that on 2 February 1988 the ownership of the seven cows was transferred to that woman who subsequently arranged to have the cattle put out on grass.  That affidavit was forwarded to the Department. We proved, through the sub-office of ERAD, that on 18 February 1988 the seven cows were registered in that woman's name.</P>
    <P>However, on 9 March 1990 the Minister's officials reckoned that man's means at £46.19 per week.  That man does not have a cow and I have all the evidence necessary to prove that, but I cannot convince the social welfare officer who is of the view that Deputies should not be advising their constituents of their entitlements.  How am I to deal with that problem?  We must remember that there are young people of 17 and 18 years of age who are unable to get work here but are anxious to stay at home.  They are means tested at anything from £29 per week down to the ridiculous sum of 5p. In some of their homes there is no other income than social welfare benefits while the families of others have what can only be described as a reasonable income. Those young people are being forced to leave the family home and live in a flat in order to convince the Department of Social Welfare that they do not have any means.  I am surprised that they are being asked to produce evidence that they do not have any means.  What evidence is required to show that a person does not have any means?  Is it not sufficient that a person should sign on at the local employment exchange, indicate that they are endeavouring to obtain employment and that they are not doing nixers?  I am surprised that the Department say to those people that they have not proved that they do not have an income.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that we are penalising those who after spending a period in England return home and seek to draw unemployment benefit?  Are they being means tested on what they earned in the previous 12 months in England?  If we are <Col N="798" /> to be awkward in the means testing for the lone parent and carer's allowances very few people will benefit under what appears to be a good scheme, one that we all welcome.  We have called for the introduction of such a scheme and have asked the Minister to increase the amount of the allowance from the miserable figure it was at.  I accept that the Minister raised the figure to £28 last year and that this year it will be up to the minimum social welfare level.  If the Department continue with their awkward system of means testing we will be inundated with representations from constituents. The Minister may find that he will have to establish a separate section to deal with queries under that scheme. There is a view throughout the country that all those who are caring for elderly people will benefit under the new scheme.  I had a letter recently from a person who is looking after two people and I have warned that person that because she is married she may not qualify for the benefit.</P>
    <P>I have had many problems getting some of my constituents their entitlements. A person with PRSI number 5092823J claimed disability benefit on 18 September 1989 but because that person did not give an explanation to the Department of incapacity until 21 September 1989, three days later, he was disqualified.</P>
    <P>People send in appeals which read, for instance: &ldquo;I am appealing against this decision because I am attending an orthopaedic surgeon in hospital&rdquo; and the Department reply, &ldquo;that is not an appeal because you have not told us what is wrong with you&rdquo;.  I respectfully suggest that a person would be unaware of what was wrong with them until the consultant had confirmed the illness or whatever. Eventually after long and tedious discussions the Department agree to accept it as an appeal pending receipt of the medical evidence.  People in some areas of the Department can be difficult while people in other sections are most helpful. Indeed, I have always found the Minister to be most helpful in these areas.  I have asked him, through numerous questions, <Col N="799" /> to let me have the various figures that have been used for means testing, for example, the £6 per week for people in the area of assistance schemes which precludes them from having anything more than that amount without being penalised. In other words there is a disincentive for them to do any odd jobs outside the home which might help them maintain their sanity.  The figure of £6 which was set in the seventies for the allowances for single parents and deserted wives depending on social welfare should have been index-linked.  If this were the case the figure today would be in the region of £30 but the Minister in his response to questions has said that he is devoting all the resources of his Department to increasing payments for those who qualify, still he makes it more difficult for people to qualify because of the limits which have remained static.</P>
    <P>The other figure that has remained static is the £50 under the equality legislation which was introduced on foot of EC legislation to ensure equal rights for women.  The intention was to have that £50 index-linked but this Government, in Opposition, objected and the figure has remained unchanged.  All I got from the Minister in reply to Question No. 42 on 12 December 1989 was that he would keep the matter under review.  Since then we have had a budget and a Social Welfare Bill and it has not been reviewed. That means that the women who are doing mostly part-time jobs, badly paid jobs, are locked into an income of £50 because their employers are now saying: &ldquo;If you get more than £50 your husband will lose you as a dependant&rdquo;.  That, then, becomes an excuse to underpay women who work long hours.  If we are to be progressive we should continue to look at these areas because, if not, we will be discriminating against people and that is dangerous because we will lock them into a position of being poorly paid. That also applies in several other areas where there are people who would normally do better were it not for the fact that certain limits are set by ourselves.</P>
    <P>Some of the other aspects of the Bill <Col N="800" /> are less welcome than the lone parent allowance and the carers allowance.  I have outlined my difficulties with those, for instance, the proposed increases of 20p a week in the child benefit scheme which is about 2½p per day.  This is a major change for the Minister in the sense that he has not touched this area for the best part of four or five years.  Effectively that benefit has been cut by 15 per cent in real terms over the last three years and, as a result, is grossly inadequate.  We will be seeking, through amendments on Committee Stage, to do something about this miserly provision of 2½p per day per child under the child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>There are three overall issues which form the background against which the Social Welfare Bill will be judged in general terms: first, there is the statistical reality of deep poverty in our country which nobody, not even the Minister, except the Taoiseach has ever disputed; second, there is the report of the Commission on Social Welfare which continues to gather dust on the Minister's shelves, and to which he has referred tonight, saying he is doing some of the things the commission recommended but he is really only tinkering with that major report; and the third, which is a most shameful one, is the fact that social welfare spending overall has been cut by one per cent of our national wealth since the Minister took office.</P>
    <P>Having regard to this background, the Social Welfare Bill, 1990 can be seen only as crumbs from the rich man's table.  We still have a long way to go before we can believe this Government care about anything and especially about the right of every citizen, to human dignity no matter how poor.  No consideration of the Social Welfare Bill can ignore the record of Fianna Fáil, in particular.  It is not surprising that they are very sensitive about their record and about the record of the Minister in certain areas in relation to the whole issue of social welfare, especially since 1987.  It is a period we have been analysing and we have had time to reflect on what has happened.  We have seen the overall cutbacks that have come into <Col N="801" /> force and the area of social welfare was not exempt from these cuts.</P>
    <P>Members of this House are generally fortunate enough to be employed, even if their mandate has to be renewed from time to time, making for non security of tenure.  However, we are gainfully employed and most of us, thank God, are in the whole of our health and do not have to rely on the social welfare system of payments that has been built up by the State over many years.  However, if we were dependent for any reason on social welfare &mdash; some of us were before we entered the Dáil &mdash; we would keenly appreciate what cutbacks in the area of social welfare can mean and what cutbacks by this Minister since 1987 have done to the social welfare system.  I will give a few examples.  Families in receipt of child benefit received no increase in 1987, 1988 or in 1989 but they are to receive 2½p per day extra as a result of this year's budget.  Individuals who need to claim long-term disability benefit now need 260 stamps, which represent five years constant employment, as against 156 stamps, the requirement in January 1987 when the Minister took office. People who have to claim unemployment benefit, maternity benefit, disability benefit or whatever have found that their required number of paid or credited contributions has also increased, from 26 to 39.  Widows, deserted wives, single parents or prisoners' wives have not been entitled to claim the half rate payment of disability benefit, maternity allowance or unemployment supplement since January 1988.  These are the facts.  They are unpleasant.  They have been brought to the attention of everybody in this House by various agencies.</P>
    <P>The new lone parent allowance will no doubt be subject to the same restrictions in these areas.  People who need dental or ophthalmic treatment must have 207 paid or credited contributions as against 156 contributions in 1987.  They need 39 contributions in the claim year as against 26 contributions in 1987.  We have all tried to promote the social employment scheme in order to get people back into the realm of work, to enable them be with <Col N="802" /> other people and enjoy themselves on a week on, week off basis.  The local authorities have used this scheme efficiently with the co-operation of the trade union movement.  I am pleased that the Minister has announced that a further 15,000 places will be made available this year.  However, as soon as the Government took office the allowance for single person participating in that scheme was reduced from £70 to £60.  There has been an increase in this year's budget for child dependants in that category.  Until then deserted husbands who availed of the social employment scheme were not paid the married person's allowance because they had no adult dependants in the home.  That was scandalous.  Lone parents who availed of the scheme in the past were treated as single people unless they had an adult dependant living with them.</P>
    <P>The allowance under the Teamwork scheme, one of the schemes used by communities, was also reduced by Fianna Fáil from £70 to £60.  People who were entitled to claim pay-related benefit along with unemployment, disability or maternity benefit under previous Governments have had their entitlements cut by Fianna Fáil.  The rates of 25 per cent and 20 per cent in pay-related benefit have now been reduced to 12 per cent and the floor for pay-related benefit has been raised to £68 per week.  This means that pay-related benefit has been reduced again.</P>
    <P>People in the social welfare category who require private rented accommodation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will have their entitlement cut by £1.50 per week.  Any improvements they get in this year's budget will be clawed back by the supplementary welfare scheme which is used at times to assist people to get private rented accommodation.  Those who received any benefits under the free fuel scheme will have the number of vouchers they receive reduced which effectively means a cut of £20.  I acknowledge that the Minister accepted the scheme and did not disallow two people in one home who qualified from getting at least one <Col N="803" /> payment, but a number of people have been excluded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty referred to the people who have been receiving long-term disability benefit and unemployment benefit who have not run out of credit and have been forced onto the dole.  These people are being excluded from the scheme even though their weekly income is lower. People who are permanently disabled will now need five years insurable contributions before they qualify for a pension. When Fianna Fáil came into office those people required only three years' insurable contributions.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement may have been promised that the Government would maintain the level of social welfare income in line with inflation and all the other terms used in their agreement with the trade unions, but they did not say they would make it more difficult for people to qualify for the same payments or for payments which would be index linked with inflation.  This is the Government's three card trick to maintain the levels, but in reality they are making it more difficult &mdash; and impossible at times &mdash; for some people to qualify for such payments.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the cuts which Fianna Fáil have implemented over the past three or four years.  Their history in this area is doubly scandalous because the vast majority of these cuts were made stealthily without proper public announcements.  Even as things stand at present, the cutting by stealth is still going on.  For example, a great number of people on social welfare who are looking forward to increases in July will not get them because they have been in receipt of alleviating payment arising from the implementation of the European Community Equality Directive.  Those alleviating payments are now being phased out again by stealth, even though when this Government were in Opposition they advocated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil have carried out stroke pulling gimmicks in order to confuse the public who later have to try to get support from their public representatives.  We are worried about the people in poverty traps who have been referred to continuously by many agencies.  The criticism of the Conference of the Major Religious Superiors of Ireland is fairly typical of the response by Fianna Fáil.  The Taoiseach said he was worried about the word &ldquo;Major&rdquo;.  He did not realise that the Conference of the Major Religious Superiors of Ireland were named under Canon Law and that they believe they have a social responsibility.  The Taoiseach is not the only one to have criticised these bishops who have a social conscience.  A Senator from the Fine Gael ranks was also critical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously people are very sensitive about the social welfare area. At times it is almost unpopular to talk about social welfare.  Some people say social welfare payments are so good they are a disincentive to work.  I would argue that point on the basis that many jobs are low paid.</P>
      <P>The Conference of the Major Religious Superiors of Ireland have pointed out that the cost of feeding, clothing and caring for a child varies from £19.60 per week for a child under the age of four years to £28.20 for a child over four years.  Almost 350,000 children in Ireland are being maintained in social welfare families or through social welfare payments.  Even after the increases proposed by the Minister in this Bill, the basic rate for a child under those schemes will be £11 per week.  Is it any wonder our children are under-nourished when the child benefit which is intended to supplement these rates and is an important source of income for mothers, as has been accepted by the Minister, has been frozen by Fianna Fáil since they returned to office or, to put it another way, has been cut in real terms by about 15 per cent?  The Conference of the Major Religious Superiors of Ireland point out these facts week after week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is bound to annoy anybody, even the Taoiseach, who does not want to hear this kind of criticism during his term as President of the EC where the whole concept of the Social Charter has been diluted.  The Social Charter started off with a wonderful commendation from the Commission and was strengthened in every way by all sectors in the European Parliament.  But when it came back to the Council of Ministers the concept of a <Col N="806" /> citizen of Europe, which would include the under-privileged, the sick, the old and people on social welfare, had been excluded.  The word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; has been included instead of &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I referred to this point last week when I was speaking on the protection of employees legislation.  Some employers resent it when people talk about a minimum wage or the need for legislative action to protect workers.</P>
    <P>At times we have to depend on old laws going back to the 1900s to make sure that people get some rights in this area. It is a difficult and uphill battle because it is becoming unpopular to talk about the rights of the underprivileged, as the major religious superiors have discovered. There may be hungry children in the Taoiseach's constituency.  He may not know but from the statistics it is obvious that there are such circumstances in every constituency.</P>
    <P>That Conference of Major Religious Superiors made a submission to the Minister before the budget.  They asked that social welfare payments be raised to the minimum recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, which was reckoned to be £60 for a single person or £96 a week for a couple.  They asked that the total allocation for social welfare be increased.  They asked that the use of inflation percentages as a basis for increasing social welfare payments be discontinued. The Minister has done that in some areas and I commend him for it. The conference asked for a reform of the family income supplement.  The Minister has now promised some reforms but we still do not know the details.  They asked for access to that on the basis of disposable income rather than on gross income.  Disposable income is what is coming into the home to feed and clothe the family, not what is available from the employer before the taxman gets his hands on it.  They looked for increased benefits for larger families and for full social welfare payments for the unemployed while involved in any form of education.  Again the Minister has responded to that.  His pilot scheme has been extended to ten or 11 centres <Col N="807" /> throughout the country I am glad that over 200 people are availing themselves of the opportunity to further their education without being disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit or social welfare.</P>
    <P>While welcoming whatever increases there were and the positive developments that were listed in the budget, the conference noted that the total amount allocated for social welfare was increased by only 3.6 per cent, which fails to keep pace with inflation; that where some categories have got larger increases percentagewise the overall increase in social welfare is only 3.6 per cent; that percentage of total budget allocated to social welfare has declined from 27.8 per cent in 1989 to 27.2 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>Many people were conned into believing that much more was being done for the people on social welfare.  When one analyses the nitty-gritty of what is happening in the various sectors, however, one realises that things could be a lot better.  The Conference of Major Religious Superiors say that this shows that despite appearances social welfare was not given the priority it deserved in the budget.  They noted that in the 1989 budget social welfare was increased by 3 per cent but that prices rose by 4 per cent during that year and that this year's increases mean that recipients can simply maintain their 1988 standard of living; that the depth of their poverty was just as bad as it was two years previously; that there is still a major gap between what social welfare recipients will receive after this budget and what was recommended by the Government-appointed Commission on Social Welfare; they deeply regret that there are no commitments in this budget to implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  They believe that this budget's social welfare provisions have been anti-family because increases in adult dependant and child dependant payments have lagged behind increases for the claimants themselves.  There is a graph available to prove the continuing deterioration in the dependant's section of what is paid by <Col N="808" /> social welfare.  That is a pity because the dependants in a family on social welfare are as important as the recipient.  In 1987 the dependants' percentage of the personal rate paid to the family was only 72 per cent which was low enough but, in 1988, it had dropped to 66.7 per cent; in 1989 it was further eroded to 61.7 per cent.  That is a continuing drop in the dependants' rates, and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors have referred to that.  They comment then:</P>
    <P>Poverty levels in Ireland are of crisis proportions.  Much of this, though not all, is due to the low levels of social welfare payments.  Originally the social welfare payments were not meant to be the permanent source of an individual's income.  Rather, they were seen as simply a means of tiding a person over until he/she got another job or recovered from sickness or other temporary setback.  This situation has changed drastically with the new reality of permanent unemployment for large numbers of people.  As a result levels of payment for the long term unemployed, for example, which originally were kept low to act as an incentive for people to go out and get jobs which existed now result in a major inequality in income distribution where jobs simply do not exist for the vast majority of the unemployed. </P>
    <P>They go on to say that as well as being inadequate in tackling poverty our social welfare system also marginalises and alienates social welfare recipients.  The way the system is structured forces dependency and prevents recipients getting involved in the activity of the community since they must remain idle so as to be available for work and no progress was made in this budget towards rectifying that situation.  They acknowledge that the Government in recent years have singled out the long term unemployed, particularly single long term unemployed for special increase.  However, they say, these payments are still a long way short of what is required to ensure that they are above the poverty line.</P>
    <P>No wonder the Taoiseach does not like <Col N="809" /> it.  They tell the truth as they see it, as the information is available to them, and they have professional people working in the field in constant consultation with the people in these categories.  They are not politically motivated.  They have a religious and social commitment.  I commend them for their work and support everything they try to do.  If agencies like that do not continue to carry out assessment of schemes that are designed for people on social welfare, then anything we as politicians on the Opposition benches do we would be accused of doing for political motivation.  They are not the only sector who have commented on this budget.  Threshold made a submission in which they said:</P>
    <P>The eradication of poverty is clearly far lower on the political agenda than the reduction of top tax rates, the easing of capital taxation measures like Capital Acquisition Tax, or the horse and greyhound industry.  While recent budgets, including this year's, have clearly taken on board much of the rationalisation of benefits proposed by the Commission on Social Welfare, they have failed to acknowledge with any real degree of urgency or an adequate financial commitment, the central thrust of that report, which was the gross inadequacy of basic social welfare payments. </P>
    <P>They go on to describe their attitude to the family benefits.  They talk about the long-term unemployed getting a mere £5 a week to bring them up to £52.  They mention in particular that those who are renting private flats have half of that increase clawed back through a downward adjustment in the health board rent allowance scheme.  There are very few Members of this House who have not some regard to local authority rents which are escalating.  Much of last year's miserly increase in social welfare payments has been clawed back by the county managers and much of these increases will also be clawed back by the local authorities.  The giving with one hand and taking back with two must not be disregarded by the Government or <Col N="810" /> the Minister for Social Welfare.  Social welfare recipients are treated the same as any income holders in spite of the fact that they are subject to delays in payment and extraordinary means testing.  The whole area of social welfare is so complicated that it needs great care and attention.</P>
    <P>Economists have said with some authority that there is every possibility we are facing into a period of sustained economic growth.  The recent medium-term review published by the ESRI heralded the possibility that within a few short years we will be making capital repayments on our debt rather than simply servicing the debt by interest payments. According to the ESRI, our economy could grow by an average of 5 per cent per annum for each of the next five years. By 1991, on the basis of present revenue and spending policies, we will be taking in more in taxation than we spend for the first time since the seventies.  This is a very rosy picture but one must question it.  Some would say it is too optimistic but, even allowing for some degree of optimism or pessimism, the likelihood is that our economy will grow.</P>
    <P>Who will benefit from that growth? Will the poor benefit?  Are the people covered by this Bill to be the beneficiaries? They will only be the beneficiaries if health, social welfare and education are the priorities, as they must be for any Government who would aspire to have a social conscience.  The authors of the ESRI review pose that question very well.  They say that the policy dilemma will be the reconciliation of the need for economic efficiency and the desirability of social equity.  That puts everything in context when read in conjunction with the budget speech of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have attempted over and over again to pose the same question in published documents and policies, questions in the House and speeches.  We have insisted that the management of our economy must be efficient and tough but must go hand in hand with a deep underlying commitment to the principles of social justice.  We have had economic <Col N="811" /> growth in the past two and a half years, more efficiency in the public service and throughout the economy.  Some of these statistics published recently in Dublin Castle prove that.  It has been built on the backs of about 100,000 people who have emigrated, on the backs of 250,000 people who are unemployed and on the backs of one million people who are poor, at the cost of increasing inequality and disadvantage at every level of society.  Side by side with the increasing efficiency of our economy we have witnessed in the past two and a half years an increasing polarisation of our society.  It is manifest in our two-tier health system, just as it is manifest in the virtual collapse of our public housing programme, the gradual elimination of free education and the dismantling of some social welfare schemes.  A more efficient economy coupled with a more unjust and less equal society is what we began to create in the short lifetime of the last Dáil, in spite of the purported economic upturn or the &ldquo;boom and bloom&rdquo; as the current commissioner described it in his day.  There is little evidence that equality and justice will feature as a priority on this Government's agenda.  We have heard nothing that persuades us that this Government are even aware of the importance of wisely managed and fairly distributed economic growth.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons the extent of poverty is so great and has grown larger in the past few years &mdash; high unemployment, low pay, an increasing number of people in part-time or casual work and an increasing effort, with a lot of success by some employers, to use schemes run by the Department to employ people and discharge them after six months, then taking in a new group of people.  There is a continuing movement of people employed for short periods who do not build up any social welfare entitlements or protection against unfair dismissal.  We are witnessing a new phenomenon.  Employers use employees temporarily or have <Col N="812" /> their work done by contractors or subcontractors. We have witnessed inadequate social support, charges for essential services, such as health services, and cutbacks in education.  All these affect social welfare families in particular.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest single cause of poverty is unemployment, which is directly related to social welfare.  The more people who are unemployed the larger is the demand which will be made on the Minister's budget estimate.  We link the two as being fundamental to each other.  The higher the level of unemployment the greater the social welfare needs.  The Labour Party have published detailed proposals in regard to this crisis. In many other areas that have been mentioned, direct action by the Government is essential and possible in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The Social Charter was recently signed but is now only a series of aspirations which are not binding on the Governments of member states.  Our Government have accepted the moral obligation to ensure that part-time workers are no longer exploited.  That will require some legislation which I hope will be introduced. Whether our neighbours across the water will take action is a matter for conjecture.  So long as this Government legislate to protect part-time workers, we will be satisfied.  Other areas requiring legislation are pay, sick leave entitlements, protection against unfair dismissal and so on.  All these entitlements which are normally there for full-time workers or workers of at least two years should be available to part-time workers.  We look forward to the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to link unemployment and low pay as a cause for social welfare intervention.  The FIS which is used for low pay is a social welfare scheme and has a direct bearing on recipients. Indeed, the Minister referred to it tonight with a promise that he would elaborate further on the new scheme of FIS which is linked to low pay for people <Col N="813" /> in employment covered by PRSI contributions. The FIS does not apply to recipients of social welfare but it applies to areas of low pay.  That is why I suggest that the Government's promised legislation in this area would protect people from some of the problems that are there for part-time workers.  We look forward to the Minister's announcement and elaboration on the FIS.</P>
      <P>The Government have an obligation now to examine the whole issue of low pay, legislatively speaking.  Employers can make use of the FIS, which is paid for by the Department of Social Welfare, to compensate people for low pay.  Therefore, it is obvious that legislation in that minimum wage area is necessary.  I know there will be resentment and reaction to it from the FII and other groups who represent employers, but this House must address itself to this area.  There has been a great deal of publicity lately about our poverty trap which results in some people on social welfare being better off than some people at work.  Right-wing politicians and some commentators have begun to draw the conclusion that the reason for this is that social welfare levels are too high.  I have refuted that because the real truth is that wages in many cases are too low.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred tonight to improvement in free travel.  First of all, free travel can benefit people only if the bus will stop.  Whereas in Dublin City when the buses are running they will stop at most bus stops, in the country express buses will not stop in any village that is not a recognised express bus stop.  People who would qualify for free travel would welcome the opportunity of going to Clonmel, Limerick or elsewhere, but if they are living in New Inn they have to get a car to bring them to Cahir to get a drive to Clonmel free on the bus.  They have to travel to Tipperary if they want to go to Limerick.  An anomaly about free travel is that it is available only if transport is available.  The Minister might use his good offices particularly for these people.  When they are standing on the roadside the express bus should stop and allow them to avail of free travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> I want to discuss discrimination against women.  If a woman over the age of 66 applies for free travel at the moment, by regulation she is obliged to submit her marriage certificate.  That is not required for a married man.  The only requirement for the married man is to produce his birth certificate to prove he is 66.  At the bottom of the application form is an instruction to a woman to submit her birth certificate and her marriage certificate. When I questioned this in the Department I was given the excuse that they wanted to ascertain that this woman did not qualify under her maiden name; they wanted to know her maiden name and that was why her marriage certificate was required.  The birth certificate has already provided the woman's maiden name.  Age is what qualifies a person for free travel.  Why is the maiden name sought?  Are we suggesting that all 66 year old women are now getting married? I do not know the reason but this is discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>Free telephone rental presents another problem in that people are sending in medical certificates for very serious illnesses and they are living with qualified applicants.  Decisions are being made in the Department without examining the patient.  A social welfare referee might look at somebody to decide whether the doctor's certificate is correct.  Medical certificates for very serious illnesses are being sent in and are being rejected by the Department's inspectors.  I do not know why.  If we have sight of some of these certificates and we have to respect confidentiality in regard to medical matters, why do we put so many people to so much trouble for £22-odd every two months for telephone rental?</P>
    <P>The free electricity that the Minister announced for people over 80 is welcome, but the number of people over 80 who will qualify is small because it is accepted that at over 80 they would need somebody to be with them.  If the age were set at 70 or 75 many more people would qualify for this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that his Department will now be pursuing for maintenance the spouse who has <Col N="815" /> absconded and reneged on his or her obligations to the home.  This applies to men and to women but particularly to men who leave their home, wife and children and are still within the jurisdiction gainfully employed.  Because of the total collapse of the free legal aid scheme it has become increasingly difficult for women to get into the family court to get a maintenance order against their defecting spouses.  The families were subjected to having to go weekly to a supplementary welfare officer, often in conditions where privacy was unheard of.  It was degrading, particularly where there was the trauma of a broken marriage.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to ensure that his Department will now take on the responsibility of ensuring that a maintenance order is made against the spouse if he or she is still in the jurisdiction.  That is a step forward.  If responsibility still lies on the spouse who has absconded, they should not be allowed to get away scot free and the State should make every effort to recoup its expenditure.  The Minister and some officers in the Department have confirmed that even if they were not successful the payments would continue to the beneficiaries.  That is welcome.</P>
    <P>In the context of the budgetary process, can we say the Government have started any attack on poverty even in the short term?  According to the Combat Poverty Agency and other reputable sources, there are still families paying tax on incomes of less than 60 per cent of the average industrial wage.  The Minister announced tonight an exclusion for PRSI employees on an income of £60 a week. That is a very minimum income, if one can call it that.  Under the social employment scheme it is only an allowance.  Still that is the low level at which we have set the exemption from PRSI.  That will create another low paid trap.  The gesture is most welcome but setting the figure that low will create anomalies and further poverty traps.  There are families still paying tax on incomes which are 60 per cent below the average wage.  They are quite poor families and the £10 or more <Col N="816" /> which they will pay in income tax is the reason they fall into a poverty trap.</P>
    <P>Solutions to poverty cannot be achieved by one or two isolated steps. Although the Minister has addressed some of the anomalies in the Bill they are isolated steps.  These problems can only be attacked by a concentrated and integrated programme of activity and the Minister and the Government should have such a programme extending over a number of years In 1992 the Community will supposedly be equal but unless we address this area many of our poor people will be even poorer.  The programme could be based on the twin principles of economic efficiency and social justice.</P>
    <P>Many families are suffering and need help to share in the benefits of the considerable improvement which, we are told, has taken place in the financial situation. We must do that if we are to alleviate the hardships suffered by many families over the last number of years. We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage regarding means testing and those whom the Minister has decided to exclude from means testing, such as the bean a tí in the Gaeltacht areas.  Perhaps he would do the same in relation to the carers' allowance; if he does not, an excellent scheme will be caught up in the whole odium of means testing and we will exclude many of the people whom we want to help.</P>
    <P>We will be tabling reasoned amendments in many other areas and I hope the Minister will respond positively.  There is goodwill in the House for developments in the social welfare area.  There is also goodwill in the new concept of not requiring people over the age of 60 to sign on as being unemployed and actively seeking work.  However, at that age we know that, unfortunately, they are unemployable. At least they will no longer suffer the trauma and stigma of signing as unemployed.  Of course there is a plus in it for the Government, which is possibly the only reason they put it in.  It will reduce the live register by about 7,000 people and we will then be told that unemployment figures are improving. The Jobsearch programme and others <Col N="817" /> will be used to give the impression that more people are at work.  If we link that to emigration &mdash; another scourge in our society &mdash; we will have done a disservice to the number of people aged 60 or slightly over who are not old enough to qualify for a pension but are being paid an allowance to stop them signing.  We welcome it for the beneficiaries but we hope the Government will not use the misleading figures which will arise from it as a credit for having addressed the numbers of people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply and to the tabling of amendments in the areas I have identified as needing to be addressed by the Minister in a constructive way.</P>

The fact that the Taoiseach is so out of touch with reality that he does not see the poverty around him does not make these figures any less valid.</P>
      <P>The harder the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare try to deny the figures, the more they prove themselves to be out of touch with the harsh realities of life for hundreds of thousands of people living in poverty in the last decade of the 20th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> These people are the innocent victims of Irish capitalists' rush to record profits. They are also the victims of a visible twotiered society.  It is clear that the policy of successive Governments has unashamedly given privilege to the wealthy and allowed the majority to make do with what is left.  It is socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor.  Let me remind the Minister of the basic facts.  In a country with a population of just 3.5 million, approximately one-third are currently living in poverty &mdash; 31.4 per cent of the population.  There are 240,000 people &mdash; or 18 per cent &mdash; registered as unemployed but these figures hide the real depth of unemployment because, at any one time, there are at least 40,000 people on work training schemes of one kind or another; 47,000 emigrated in the year to April 1989 or, if you prefer, 177,000 people have emigrated since 1980.  Many others, particularly women, are not counted because the lack of adequate child care facilities prevents them from working, even if they could find work. Of the 31 per cent of the population in poverty one in three people &mdash; 150,000 &mdash; classified as adult dependants do not receive a payment in their own right.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, women comprise the overwhelming majority of those, representing approximately 125,000 adult dependants.  They and their children are among the most vulnerable and oppressed by poverty.  In 1988 346,497 children were being maintained by social welfare. This startling figure means that 40 per cent of Irish children are living below the poverty line of a miserable £48 a week for an individual.  A figure of 277,000, or 30 per cent, of the Irish women live in poverty, on less than £48 a week.  Past Governments and Fianna Fáil politicians have often smugly claimed that unlike the United Kingdom we are a classless society.  The word &ldquo;class&rdquo; is hated by Fianna Fáil for the reason that they know that when a class dimension is recognised in Irish society it threatens their very existence.  Until recently Fianna Fáil have successfully cultivated a populist image, that we are all in the same boat &mdash; like <Col N="820" /> hell we are.  Let Charlie be the captain and all our boats will be lifted together on the rising tide of prosperity.  That is the cry.  The myth of a classless society combined with Fianna Fáils pretensions to be a non-ideological party became enshrined in their rhetoric until the Progressive Democrats came to lie so comfortably beside them in the nuptial bed of coalition.  The reality of Ireland is a far grimmer tale of national independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Who wrote the script?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the story of a society where class barriers are more ingrained and rigid than in neighbouring Britain. The impact of Government policy over successive years has significantly institutionalised class barriers and inequalities, to the extent that without a massive transfer of funds those at present trapped in poverty, along with their children and their children's children, will become even more deprived and marginalised. This is not a moral issue requiring prayer and faith in the market forces.  This is the indictment of deliberate Government policies of neglect on a grandiose scale. One way of demonstrating the extent of inequality is in relation to the distribution of income.  According to the 1980 household budget survey, the top 10 per cent of all households receive 29.9 per cent of all income while the bottom 20 per cent receive a miserable one-half of 1 per cent of all income.  That was in 1980 and the position has got worse since then.  That comparison starkly represents the degree of inequality in income in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The State supports a class of substantial proprietors.  A book published recently by researchers at the ESRI states that entrepreneurs are facilitated by a wealth of subsidies to their business concerns and a low rate of corporate income tax. The viability of that class is further assisted by the imposition of low rates of personal taxation relative to employees with comparable incomes.</P>

      <P>The State provides those people with a safety net, one that enhances the profitability of their position, which they can later bequeath to their family.  What does the State provide for those at the bottom of the class structure? Farmers with small holdings and poor quality land benefit from a substructure of State and EC supports. Unemployed members of the urban working class lack the dignity of a job and are increasingly forced into dependency upon the State.  In turn, industrial policies have focused on generating employment opportunities away from those areas in which the old indigenous industry was contracting.  Most working class families at the middle stages of the family cycle must rely on income earned by children residing within the household to meet their needs.  This doubly penalises the working class.  It maximises the family's tax liability and minimises the likelihood that children from such families will participate in second and third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research in Ireland has continually shown that opportunities for upward social mobility are extremely restricted. Children of middle class parents continue to enjoy a substantial advantage in access to more privileged occupations.  In contrast, long-term unemployment has become, in the nineties, a new category <Col N="822" /> into which those from working class origins may be downwardly mobile.  There is no mobility.  Fr. McGrail's reports would be worth reading by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years or so the State has tended to lower the support available to families with young children.  This has exacerbated existing class inequalities. At the same time new family problems connected with unemployment, poor housing, depreciating health services and so on are emerging.  Some 5.6 per cent of all households are headed by women who are in receipt of social welfare payments, as deserted wives or single parents.  There are housing estates in parts of Dublin where the percentage of single parent families is as high as 20 per cent.  The challenge that this presents is not merely financial but also calls into account all those who claimed to support the right to life in the 1984 constitutional referendum.  The silence of that former vocal lobby group is deafening in regard to outlining their policies on behalf of one of the largest groups in poverty, single parents and their children.</P>
    <P>Emigration provides a means of social mobility but only for those with skills and training.  Those with educational qualifications but unable to work in Ireland can search elsewhere.  Those without qualifications and who cannot find work remain unemployed in Ireland, England and Europe.  There is no social mobility for Irish unskilled labour anywhere in the world.  What the State can do to correct these frighteningly awesome statistics of human misery and what it is doing can clearly be seen in contrast.  Job creation on a massive scale is the single major means to eradicate poverty.  Education, which can break the vicious circle of deprivation and inequality of opportunity, is another important tool in this effort.  Social Welfare plays a crucial role but it is clearly only a means of alleviating the distress and misery of poverty and cannot be seen as a means of eliminating poverty itself.</P>
    <P>Where is the political will to ensure a greater distribution of the State's resources and so really eliminate poverty <Col N="823" /> from Ireland?  Does the Minister at Cabinet not fight for the elimination of glaring inequalities of opportunities that infect all spheres of Irish life?  Is it not his stated aim to tackle poverty?  What is the Minister doing to make this aim real?  There is little evidence that the Government intend to effect any fundamental change in the inequities of the Irish class system. Social welfare plays an important and commendable role in the alleviation of poverty through cash transfers and income support, eliminating up to 70 to 80 per cent of the gap between incomes and the poverty line.  Social welfare on its own without any fundamental interventions in jobs, education and opportunity, will at best keep people from starving.  It sustains the thousands of recipients in perpetual suspension, with no real prospect of social mobility.  They are left like suspended puppets to be manipulated by their puppeteer masters, the cynical politicians, trapped forever within the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>I have many problems with the Bill before us.  Having outlined at great length, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, how the poor are discriminated against and what steps the Government might take to fundamentally correct their status, let us look more closely at this dishonest attempt to convey to those in poverty that Fianna Fáil really care.  I will quote from the Minister for Social Welfare who stated in the Adjournment debate of 15 December 1989:</P>
    <P>Over the past two years the Government in co-operation with the social partners have tackled the economic problems facing the country and at the same time developed the social dimension. </P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that the third aspect of the threefold approach was:</P>
    <P>to ensure that the benefits and sacrifices are shared equitably across society. </P>
    <P>We all know who benefited and we also know who made the sacrifices.  The answer to that question could be <Col N="824" /> addressed to the trade union movement who will be letting the Government know quite soon when they get down to discussing the negotiation of a new programme for national recovery.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if passed, will see this Government spend, by way of Exchequer contributions, £100 million less than in 1989.  Is this the Government's considered response to increasing poverty? Not only that but</P>
    <P>total social welfare expenditures comprising insurance based payments funded from the social insurance fund and assistance payments which are totally Exchequer funded.  The Social Insurance fund is funded by the Exchequer, employees and the self-employed. The abridged Estimates show the Exchequer contributions to the SIF is a whopping 52 per cent less in 1990 than in 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now suggest what the Minister could have done with the money he has saved.  In case that was not bad news enough for those in poverty and the agencies with a social conscience, I will paraphrase the content of the Minister's speech.  The Minister was rightly proud of his success, and I give him credit for it, in stamping out fraud that resulted in savings of £30 million in 1989, a total saving of £100 million since 1987.  In 1990, he hopes to save a further £55 million from measures to control fraud and from reduced expenditure mainly on unemployment and disability benefits.  That comes to a saving of £155 million since 1987.  There is, of course, the added gain of £52 million, a once off payment, on the amalgamation of the occupational injury fund and the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  Now we are dealing with <Col N="825" /> a grand total saving of £207 million, but the Minister did not redistribute this money to those in genuine need.</P>
      <P>It is scandalous that there is organised fraud aided and abetted by many employers, but when a fraud is discovered, the resulting savings should not be taken out of the social welfare budget and returned to the general Exchequer. Instead, any savings made from the elimination of fraud should be retained for redistribution within the social welfare system to those in need.  If this were to happen the Bill would be able to address important areas highlighted by the Free Legal Aid Advice Centres (FLAC).  The case of Cotter and McDermott v. the Minister for Social Welfare is well documented and recorded.  It is a scandal that two unemployed women should have had to resort to the High Court which, in turn, had to refer this case to the Supreme Court, in order that the women be awarded their just entitlements.</P>
      <P>We in The Workers' Party not only want better levels of payment for people whose incomes are too low but we want far more than that.  We want the removal of all unnecessary obstacles to people taking up employment and the removal of the stigma attached to people who cannot take up or find employment.  We want the social welfare system to be positive, not punitive, we want it to be supportive rather than judgmental, which means major changes in attitudes and laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What sort of positiveness and supportiveness was forthcoming in the Cotter and McDermott case?  Why does the Minister prefer to drag people not only through the Irish court system but through the European courts as well?  I would ask the Minister directly to pay approximately 40,000 married women the estimated sum of £20 million he owes them.  The breakdown of that figure means payments in the region of £100 to £800 per married woman discriminated against between 22 December 1984 and 15 May 1986.  This discrimination emerged from the State's delay in implementing the EC Directive 74/7/EEC on <Col N="826" />&ldquo;Equal Treatment for Men and Women in the Matters of Social Security&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is £200 million Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I got from FLAC was £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Their figures are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that point.  During this period, the State continued to discriminate against married women in relation to rates of disability benefit, disablement benefit, unemployment benefit, injury benefit, invalidity pension and unemployment supplement.  Furthermore women who were unemployed between 23 December 1984 and 25 February 1986 were cut off from their unemployment benefit after 12 months compared with a cut off point of 15 months for men.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had inserted into the Bill the entitlement to benefit for these women I would have called this move progressive and positive.  If he had intended to redistribute some of the money retrieved from fraudulent abuse of social welfare and directed it especially towards people who were entitled to repayment of the arrears I would have congratulated him.  However, the Minister seems to have confirmed my next point, that he knows from computer files the names and addresses of married women and how much they would be entitled to, but he is not offering them their just arrears.  Instead, he says they should apply individually and then leaves them on hold while he forces FLAC back into the arena of the courts.  Only yesterday we saw the EC Directive being broken yet again by the Government's exclusion of part-time workers from full insurance cover by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill appears to ignore the spirit and letter of EC law, including the Social Charter.  We have read that as many as 26,000 part-time workers have been shown to be discriminated against in the European Court of Justice.  They are currently being <Col N="827" /> denied full PRSI cover and once again we see a situation where implementation of social welfare rights is being forced on the Government by the European Community. Article 10 of the Social Charter states that every worker of the European Community shall have a right to adequate social protection and whatever his or her status enjoy an adequate level of social security benefits.  It is a sad indictment of the Government that in the year the Taoiseach is President of the Council of Ministers, the Irish Government are once again found guilty of discrimination involving the social welfare code. According to the 1988 Labour Court survey approximately 26,300 people work less than 19 hours per week; of these 20,400, or 78 per cent. are women. Given the fact that more women than men are engaged in part-time work it follows that the exclusion of part-time workers from class A insurance has a disproportionate impact on women and on the face of it is discriminatory, which is the terminology used in the Dutch case. The burden clearly rests on the Department of Social Welfare to produce some objective justification for the continued flouting of the EC Directive on equal treatment for men and women.  I plead with the Minister not to allow himself and, by implication the name of Ireland, to be dragged again to the European courts.  He must resolve today to announce that part-time workers will be eligible for class A insurance.</P>
    <P>I would not like the Minister to feel that I do not welcome some of the commendable aspects of the Bill.  For example, I congratulate him for allowing a companion to travel free on the bus pass of DPMA recipients.  I had written to the Minister highlighting this anomaly as between the disabled and senior citizens. The spouses of the latter are allowed travel with them.  This is a small item but nevertheless it is important to recognise it.  I am delighted that the Minister has made this change and no doubt my correspondence helped him in making up his mind.</P>
    <P>I also support the extension of the free <Col N="828" /> electricity scheme to old age pensioners who have someone living with them. However, in order to qualify they must be 80 years of age or over.  What sort of concession is this?  I ask the Minister to reconsider his approach, broaden his horizons and enter the real world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should enter the real world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The insertion of a clause which would allow the recipients of free electricity units to have some other person in receipt of any social welfare payment live with them would be a big improvement.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the new carer's allowance but warn that no attempt should be made to coerce families, in particular the daughters of aging parents, into becoming cheap paid carers for the aged or disabled.  We must bear in mind that while many thousands of people, at tremendous personal sacrifice, give of their time to care for an aged or infirm family member, equally there are thousands more who are not prepared to make the same sacrifice.  I am therefore warning that the carer's allowance must not be used by health board personnel in an attempt to pressure families into caring for the elderly at home when in fact they should be in a hospital or nursing home.  I am aware of the trauma which many families go through in trying to have an elderly person admitted to a health board nursing home or hospital and, therefore, I seek reassurance from the Minister that he is not looking for a yellow pack Nurse Nightingale to facilitate his colleague in the Department of Health in cutting back the number of beds available in health board nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that carers are predominantly women and I am warning against the possibility of women being forced to leave employment to become carers.  An interesting fact is that the subvention per bed in a nursing home is almost on a par with the proposed carer's allowance.  This could be seen as a co-ordinated approach between the <Col N="829" /> Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare and I ask the Minister to tell us if there is a hidden agenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the incredible range of start up dates for various increases, I ask the Minister to tell us why, for example, mothers in receipt of child benefit have to wait until October for their increases while those in receipt of unemployment assistance and old age pensioners will receive theirs in July and while low paid workers with earnings of £60 per week or less will be exempt from PRSI from April.  Therefore, there is a variety of start up dates.  The National Campaign for Welfare Reform Group said:</P>
      <P>The Irish social welfare system is a mess.  Its payments are inadequate, it is unjust and inconsistent, it is complicating and confusing. </P>
      <P>I am in sympathy with them.  There should be a uniform start up date.  The system is complicated enough without adding further to the confusion.  It is wrong that people should have to wait so long after the increases are announced before they receive payment.  In some cases, having learned about the Minister's proposals last December, people will have to wait until October before they receive their increases.  I ask the Minister to agree once and for all to a uniform start up date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the many horrifying details to emerge in this debate is that so many people are trying to eke out a living on <Col N="831" /> incredibly poor incomes.  The Minister pointed out in his contribution to the debate on the budget on 1 February this year that the Government have decided to tackle the problem of low pay by exempting workers on low pay from PRSI contributions and that anybody earning less than £60 per week would be exempt. He went on to proclaim that as many as 50,000 poor unfortunates are actually in receipt of £60 per week or less.  If 50,000 people are in receipt of less than £60 per week there must be hundreds of thousands earning between £60 and £100 per week.</P>
    <P>Some person &mdash; I do not know who it was &mdash; had the audacity to say that we had turned the corner, that the rising tide was lifting all boats.  The rising tide of prosperity not only is going to leave behind 240,000 people without work but it is also going to leave behind hundreds of thousands of low paid workers who are not going to enjoy the life of prosperity being experienced by the already well off sections of our society.</P>
    <P>What the figure of low paid workers shows is the need for a safety net into which workers will fall in times of unemployment, redundancy and sickness.  The social welfare net, with all its shortcomings and inadequate rates of payments, can act as a cushion for many workers and their family members.  Earlier tonight it was stated that a few months ago members of Fine Gael were arguing that workers were better off on social welfare than in gainful employment.  If Fine Gael were arguing the point that it is a disgrace that so many employers were paying such miserable wages that left so many workers on wages that were only subsistence payments, that they were so low as to be on a par with the subsistence payments for social welfare, I might have agreed with that.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister who made the point in his speech on the budget in February that the disincentives to work faced by those on social welfare payments <Col N="832" /> had been greatly exaggerated.  He pointed out that only a minority of individuals are better off on social welfare payments than at work.  That should not be seen as a reason to suggest that welfare payments are somehow or other good.  Rather, it should highlight the very poor, dead-end, badly paid jobs that are on offer particularly to young people.  It should be said that 3 per cent of the 7.9 per cent of the people surveyed and found to be better off in receipt of social welfare payments were single people who were entitled to the lowest level of social welfare payments only.  That is an indictment of our employers.  Fine Gael would have been better off highlighting that fact instead of using greatly exaggerated, highly dubious statistics to prove the opposite.  Bad and all as low paid employment is, it is better than the horrible experience of drawing the dole or assistance or feeling humiliated by seeking assistance from community welfare officers.  The Fine Gael spokesperson on social welfare made a statement tonight which I should like to refute.  She said that the social welfare system is hostile to work.</P>
    <P>Against this background of poverty the level of increases provided in the Bill is totally inadequate.  It is most regrettable that the Government have once again pushed the date for their payment back to the latest possible dates.  The principle of increasing social welfare benefits in line with inflation would only be acceptable if the basic levels were adequate. The Commission on Social Welfare, and many other welfare groups, have said clearly that this is not so.  Even with the extra increase for the long term unemployed, many jobless will still be expected to survive on about £10 per week less than the 1990 levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  In addition much of the extra few pounds will be eaten up by inflation and increases in local authority rents.</P>
    <P>I would not like it to be thought that The Workers' Party believe there is nothing worthwhile in the Bill.  The new <Col N="833" /> schemes provided for in the Bill, such as the lone parent's allowance and the carer's allowance, are welcome but the small print of the Bill will need to be very carefully exmained on Committee Stage to ensure that they are genuine attempts to deal with the problems and that they are not unnecessarily exclusive or bureaucratic.  It is, for instance, regrettable that the new carer's allowance appears to exclude a person or persons caring in the home for mentally or physically handicaped persons.  I hope there will be a genuine attempt to make those schemes available to those who need them.</P>
    <P>The experience with the deserted husband's scheme, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1989, does not give grounds for optimism.  When that Bill was going through the Dáil 12 months ago the Minister indicated that thousands of men were likely to qualify under it.  To the best of my recollection he said that in the region of 9,000 men would qualify. However, the reality was different.  In the course of a reply to a question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on 22 February last the Minister said that at that stage only 468 men had applied for deserted husband's allowance and of those, awards were only made to 14 cases with 18 claims being rejected and a further 18 being withdrawn.  The Minister went on to say that a further 418 applications were still under consideration.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that 12 months from now we will not find that the fine sounding schemes provided for in the Bill are nonevents or are available only to a handful of people.  We need genuine schemes to cater for those in need and not window dressing to make the Minister's record look good.</P>
    <P>I should like to obtain clarification in regard to a number of provisions in the Bill.  The Minister proposes to increase from £69 to £72 the amount of weekly earnings that are disregarded in calculating the rate of that benefit.  In 1983 that rate was £36.  Is the Minister planning <Col N="834" /> some sort of progressive annual increase to do away with social insurance altogether? I am not happy with sections 13 and 14 which contain amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act to facilitate the introduction of new schemes.  Section 15 provides that the new scheme will be brought into effect by way of commencement order.  Where are the deadlines for implementation?  It is not correct that we should spend two days at least debating the Bill, make our comments in good faith and not know the deadline for the implementation of the provisions.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a similar point about the carer's allowance.  It appears that we will have to rely on the introduction of regulations for benefits.  It also appears that none of those regulations will be brought before the House for approval.  That is not a satisfactory way to deal with this issue.  It is unsatisfactory that there is no deadline for a number of schemes and the Minister should tell us when he proposes to introduce the benefits.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress the need for a deadline for the hearing of appeals. Under the new proposals to establish an appeals system certain people will be given authority.  We need to have some scheme whereby we would inform appellants that, having gone to the trouble of appealing, their appeal will be responded to within a reasonable period.  I suggest that that reasonable period should be no longer than of two weeks duration.</P>

      <P>There is another area to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention now that he has made that point.  One of the major areas of complaint about appeals, lack of information and so on is in relation to people approaching community welfare officers for help and having their requests refused.  There appears to be incredible confusion, judging from what Deputy Ferris has said, in understanding why people are rejected in this way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers time and again to local offices and to what he intends to do about the many such premises that are demoralising, dreary and oppressive.  Perhaps he would think in terms of, for instance, providing for fresh flowers to be put in these offices or for some nice prints to be hung on the walls by way of creating a more conducive atmosphere in which to conduct one's business.  I am thinking in particular of employment exchanges.  Incidentally I often wonder why these premises ever got that title in view of the fact that they do everything but offer employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare staff who deal with the public have a very trying job.  Recipients <Col N="836" /> of the services provided by these officers, by the very nature of their dealings with the area of social welfare, are often in need of encouragement, assistance and patience and it can be trying for both the officers and on the recipients that frequently tempers are frayed.  I would argue strongly for more mobility of staff within the social welfare services so that staff would not be placed in the one position of dealing with the public in the one place for a long time and whereby they can unfortunately be seen to alienate themselves from the recipients.  I would like some comment on that.</P>
    <P>Having seen in England what I regard as the ideal situation, that is, citizen advice bureaux, I submit that we develop similar facilities so that people requiring information, not only on social welfare but on a range of other Government and local authority related issues could go to a softly furnished, open plan, area in which the atmosphere is warm and inviting. When the Minister gets around to organising his one stop service he might consider very seriously having a look at what happens in this regard in Camden Town and perhaps take on board some of the excellent ideas that the citizen advice bureaux operate there.</P>
    <P>Both the Fine Gael and the Labour Party spokespersons made the point that social welfare is an incredibly complicated field.  If the Minister was unaided by his social welfare civil servants I do not know whether he could explain to a lay person the ins and outs of all the schemes.  Something should be done to familiarise people more as to their rights. Because of the complex legislation that exists it is not fair to expect people to understand how to process their claims. It is clear from certain schemes, for example, the family income supplement support scheme that people are not availing of their rights.  With that in mind perhaps the Minister would consider a role for the Department of Social Welfare with other Government Departments in the area of providing citizen advice bureau facilities.</P>

      <P>Secondly, I will refer to the Deputy who is now contributing and who was not here earlier.  He may have <Col N="838" /> been in Europe or elsewhere.  There was a reference to our captain.  I would refer to Deputy Byrne's captain.  At a time of massive unemployment, he has no difficulty in going on the gravy train &mdash; as his party described it for so long &mdash; and collecting his various expenses and his pay cheque in Europe.  He is getting a huge amount of money.  When he has a day off from Europe he comes back here, puts in a few hours and collects again. The public are well aware of this and all the shouting and roaring in the world about class systems will not hide the fact that two well paid jobs are being held down, one of which is extremely well paid.  In the other case I have referred to, the gentleman concerned took over £100,000 of taxpayers' money per year in free legal aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not acceptable to the public.  The Deputy is now holding down two jobs.  As captain of the fleet he should not be double jobbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne's final point was that there are very many schemes and that the social welfare area is very complex.  In my short time in the House this is one of the reasons that I have consistently paid tribute to our present Minister for Social Welfare because he has moved rapidly to change the areas where change could be <Col N="839" /> brought about quickly, for instance, in relation to the child benefit rates.  I was astonished when I came here in 1987 to find that there were 36 different rates with all the administrative difficulties etc. that that entails.  Now the Minister has rationalised that number to six but that was not without cost.  The Minister put the money down and we got rid of the need for vetting this, that and the other. This went some of the way towards sorting out the difficulties.  The Minister has done the same with regard to the long-term unemployment benefits, which have again been rationalised upwards, and in a number of other instances to which he referred tonight.  All these improvements cost money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne or Deputy Ferris said that because the cut off point for the payment of PRSI will be £60, people would not pay and very few of them would take it up.  This scheme will cost £8 million and if this is the case somebody will be getting a lot of money for nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only an estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as a good move and I welcome it.  The Fine Gael amendment moved by Deputy Flaherty made astonishing reading.  Fine Gael propose to vote against this Bill on Second Stage.  We should look at the Fine Gael record up to 1987 and compare it with the radical changes which have taken place since then.  The legislation introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, is a magnificent record.  The various Bills introduced by him can be examined during this and other debates and we can compare his record with the record of the previous Administration who were in office for four and a half years.  I did not think any member of Fine Gael would have the gall to voice criticism about the Minister's record in view of their record during their period in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> The old style social welfare Bills concentrated on the rates of payment and nothing else.  This Minister has taken innovative moves in every Bill he has introduced since 1987.  I would be quite happy to have a reasonable debate on any of those Bills with anybody.  Such a debate would show that there has been a very consistent and regular programme of improvements.  These improvements have not been of a once off nature; the Minister has had a positive programme of achieving certain objectives which are mainly contained in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and in representations made by various groups. The Minister listens to everybody who makes recommendations and acts on them.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously, the Minister has removed anomalies which existed for years.  I can refer to many initiatives taken by him, for example, the introduction last year of the <i>pro rata</i> pensions scheme which had been sought for years and which removed the anomaly in that area.  The Minister tackled this anomaly which had been ignored by Ministers during the eighties.  The Minister introduced a carer's allowance, a widower's allowance, a clothing allowance and allowed the elderly to continue to receive free electricity, which was a hardy annual.  People said this could not be done but this Minister did it.  He has also introduced a PRSI exemption for low paid workers and included the self-employed in the PRSI pensions scheme. I could continue to list the improvements he has made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the free travel facility for those accompanying a person receiving a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  These are all positive steps and no matter how destructive The Workers' Party want to be, I believe they must recognise that improvements have been made.  They cannot treat the public as idiots.  No matter what brainwashing goes on, these are facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who will benefit from these schemes are happy with these improvements.  It is important to note that the Minister has not confined himself to the easy options.  He has taken the initiative to rationalise the child benefit rates and other rates upwards and he is doing the same with the adult and child dependant rates in this Bill.  The improvements made by the Minister are completely in line with the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  It is heartening to see how much the Minister has done but there are other improvements which must be achieved. All this must be compared with the record of the previous Administration during their four and a half years in office.</P>
      <P>Several speakers referred to the Combat Poverty Agency.  Deputy Ferris said the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI were independent organisations which did not belong in the political arena.  The ESRI carried out a survey in 1986 and it was published in 1988.  This survey was a damning indictment of the treatment of the unemployed by the Administration at that time.  In fairness, Deputy Ferris's party cannot avoid the findings of that survey because they were involved in that Administration for most of that time.  Deputy Flaherty had a fierce cheek to come into the House tonight and say that Fine Gael will vote against the Bill getting a Second Reading.  Other speakers welcomed certain elements of the Bill and pointed to the good parts but Deputy Flaherty knocked the Bill from the time she came into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will always be improvements which can be made and issues which can be discussed.  I question the approach taken by Fine Gael to this Bill.  Deputy Ferris welcomed the general thrust of the Bill and pointed out certain aspects which the Labour Party want to change.  Like The Workers' Party they will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage. <Col N="842" /> As I said, there will always be areas which can be improved and I should like to refer to a few which the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to extend the free travel scheme which allows a person to accompany a recipient of the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  He should look at the position of people who should receive a disabled person's maintenance allowance but who do not because they are institutionalised or have to attend therapy regularly.  Such people do not receive that allowance and are, therefore, deprived of free travel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris stitched one or two cases into the records but I should like to refer to the case of a 24 year-old person from my constituency who is attending a therapeutic workshop in Dublin.  This person travels home from Dublin every two weeks and because he does not receive a disabled person's maintenance allowance and the Southern Health Board do not supply a free ambulance service, his family have to bear the travel costs.  This means that every two weeks his family have to hire somebody to accompany him from Dublin to Cork and back to Dublin or else a member of his family has to travel from Cork to Dublin to meet him and also accompany him on the return journey.  This costs his family a minimum of £92 per month.  His parents are getting older and they have carried out that job voluntarily for the past 18 years.  This young man should have a degree of independence which I believe a right to travel would give him.  I appreciate that there may be an element of health care involved in this issue and I ask the Minister to get together with his colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, to consider this matter so that the anomaly in this area will not be added to with the extension of the free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>The income limit of £50 before a spouse's social welfare entitlements are taken into account needs to be reviewed as it has been static for four years.  I have <Col N="843" /> been approached by quite a number of constituents who work in contract cleaning and who have been happy enough up to now because they have consciously stayed under the limit of £50.  Now, after long efforts the Labour Court has granted an increase of 15 per cent in their wages, but they cannot accept this because it would put them over the limit.  That limit should be reviewed to facilitate these people.  They deserve it because they work hard and they would not be out working if they did not need the money.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look also at the question of people on mixed insurance contributions.  The most familiar example of these is drivers or conductors with CIE who become insured at a modified rate on promotion to inspector. Many of these people are not entitled to a full pension.  Last year the Minister granted <i>pro rata</i> pensions to one particular group.  I would ask him to look also at this category, many of whom are in dire straits.  They have taken unto themselves a name that is very appropriate, DOAPs, (Deprived Old Age Pensions) and they should be catered for as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>I understand that the National Pensions Board are examining the whole structure of the existing contribution conditions for entitlement to pensions.  I understand also that extending social insurance cover to civil servants and public sector workers, with new modified rates of PRSI, would effect their position. Whatever happens in that area, these people deserve special attention, not least because they have given a life of service to a State enterprise, and very often all we do is to pay lip service to this group.  I would ask the Minister to look at their situation and try to facilitate them if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking I welcome the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. I have one argument against their findings and I might not get another opportunity to say this before something <Col N="844" /> happens in that area.  The commission have made a recommendation that people over 65, 75, 85 etc. should get increased allowances under different headings.  It has been suggested that that is not necessary and should be discontinued. I disagree strongly with this. People who have given a lifetime of service to building up this State should not be penalised because the Government are trying to equalise issues elsewhere. There is need for greater funding as people get older and have more difficulties. For example, they need extra heat and special care.  I would ask the Minister to note my disagreement at this early stage.  Because he is moving so rapidly on the commission's findings he might have caught up with that one before I have a chance to say more.</P>
    <P>In regard to alleviating payments, Deputy Ferris said it was scandalous that 2 per cent or 3 per cent was being clawed back on this.  The Bill which clearly showed that this payment was being discontinued totally in October 1987 is still in existence.  When Fianna Fáil came into office, the Minister, Deputy Woods, had to deal with that situation.  It is an indisputable fact that about £28 million had to be added that year or the following year to maintain that payment.  If it was wrong to suddenly cut off that payment in 1987 it is certainly wrong to cut it off in 1990.  I agree with the suggested method of phasing it out over a long number of years.  It is not correct to say that money was not made available because a minimum of £60 million has been paid in that area since Deputy Ferris's party suggested doing away with it. Deputy Ferris was factually incorrect and unfair to the Minister.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues were brought up but again it would be negative to concentrate on those only, because there are so many good things in this Bill that we should praise.  One point that Deputy Ferris raised showed the inconsistency of some of the members of his own party. He paid tribute to the Minister and said <Col N="845" /> there was tremendous goodwill towards the move whereby those over 60 would not have to sign on every week.  We welcome this.  This is in total conflict with what his colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, said down in Cork, and which was widely reported.  He said that in fact the Minister was throwing people on the scrap heap at the age of 60.  That was a heartless and unfair accusation.  I am glad that is corrected by the party spokesperson on social welfare.  It is a humanitarian move and we should pay tribute to the Minister for it.</P>
    <P>The content and context of social welfare Bills has been changed by this Minister. Previously they were just a range of payments.  Now there are 20 or 30 different items and on each occasion since 1987 we have had a minimum of six or seven new items included.  This year there is the extended travel scheme, the new clothing allowance, the extension of the vocational training opportunities scheme, the extension of the scheme for payments after death, the carer's allowance, a new appeals office and so on. I want to pay tribute to the Minister. Deputies on the other side of the House, can, by all means, outline areas of anomaly or things that the Minister can change but let them not be negative or destructive.  Above all let them not insult the Minister in a personal fashion.  That does nobody in this House or outside it any good.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the lone parent's allowance which the Minister has dealt with.  It is ironic that we can categorise, quantify, count and clearly identify every unmarried mother when benefit or anything else is being sought, but it is very difficult to identify unmarried fathers.  Until unmarried fathers are made responsible for their actions and made to contribute financially to the support of their offspring we will be in very difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>The day of the flighty young man must come to an end.  I refer to the type of man who could go out, live easy, take whatever benefits were available and then coolly walk away.  I appreciate that the Minister is taking on the enormous task of making fathers or husbands pay maintenance contributions. People will have to become more responsible.  Whether people decide to get married or stay single is a matter for their own discretion, but they must accept responsibility.  For too long the female of the species has suffered. That cannot be allowed to continue.  We will have to take whatever action is necessary. With modern technology it is possible to identify people and we should take whatever action we can.</P>
      <P>With regard to the carer's allowance, one of the important discriminatory factors was that the married person dependent on his or her spouse was not paid.  The new regulations will have a means test but it will be applied to all equally.  I welcome the change the Minister has introduced.  I appreciate that these will be fairly costly schemes to introduce but it is the right road to take. It is the human face of the State administration coming through.  There are many other areas in which we can make improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again commend the Minister on what he has done for lone parents by doing away with the various headings and bringing in one single heading.  Even for administrative purposes, it is beneficial. Various aspects of the Bill will be debated during its passage.  We can look at almost every item and see that there are millions <Col N="847" /> to be spent under each heading.  The total cost of the measures introduced is £216 million in one year.  That is a frightening figure but it is necessary to spend it and it will be well spent.  A total of £7.5 million is spent each day of the year.</P>
    <P>There has been some complaint about the increases becoming payable in July but administratively it would be very difficult to get this Bill through and to have all these items tidied up before an earlier date of payment.  There would have to be a gap.  It was funny to hear complaints from members of the parties in Government between 1982 and 1987 when payments were brought in from October. They have now been brought back to July.</P>
    <P>On the general increases, I am glad the trend the Minister started three years ago is continuing and that he is giving double or treble increases to the least well off. The Minister has a good record in this respect.  If some of his predecessors had given real increases of that magnitude all payments would be fairly decent today.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I would ask Fine Gael to reconsider their amendment.  I commend the Minister on the continuing progress being made in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can aptly describe this budget and Social Welfare Bill as areas of missed opportunities.  The poor do not benefit a great deal from either the budget or the Bill, despite appearances to the contrary.  The vast majority of people who were below the poverty line before the budget are still below it following the budget and the introduction of this Bill. The budget and the Bill fail to implement a comprehensive anti-poverty programme. There is no substantial widening of the tax base, no major redistribution of the tax burden, no concerted programme to tackle unemployment, no attempt to combat widespread rural poverty and no approach of any description to tackling emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> Emigration has been draining the lifeblood of our land for generations and it is clearly apparent in recent years that were it not for the emigrant ship and plane the Minister would have to contribute far more money in the Social Welfare Bill to meet the claims of the unemployed.  In drawing up this budget the Government listened to the articulate, well off and influential lobby who argued for an even larger share of the national cake for themselves.  It should be of paramount importance that all citizens be treated equally and fairly.</P>
    <P>A great opportunity to tackle poverty in a significant way was sadly missed by the Minister.  The present policy adopted by this Government will simply sharpen the divisions in our already deeply divided, two-tier society.  Responsible and deeply concerned groups who understand the divisions that have been developing in society in recent years have done a vast amount of research and provided policy options which could be undertaken by the Government but their submissions in regard to poverty and divisions in society have been completely ignored.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on our native Government that there are today more people living in poverty than there were in the seventies.  As we enter the final decade of this century it is estimated that more than one million people, or 31.4 per cent of our total population, live in poverty.  Surely this is a dismal record for any native Government.  Furthermore, 40 per cent of all the children in Ireland today live in households in which the income is below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for eliminating poverty has focused mostly on job creation and has proved a dismal failure. The jobs are not materialising, nor is there any likelihood that they will be created in the foreseeable future anywhere near the scale required to combat poverty.  The present Government seem to be content to have Ireland locked into a deeply divided two-tier society.  The <Col N="849" /> good news about all this gloom and poverty was that something could be done about it in the budget.  The economic indicators suggested the opportunity was there but, alas, there was no real evidence of a comprehensive integrated programme to eliminate poverty.</P>
    <P>The budget has failed to address the major socio-economic changes which Ireland is facing at the moment.  It has also missed the opportunity of creating the Ireland we want to develop as we move towards a new millennium.  We are at a time in history when the development of economic life could diminish social inequalities if that development were guided and co-ordinated in a reasonable human way, yet all too often it serves only to intensify the inequalities and in some places it even results in a decline in the social standards of the weak and shows contempt for the poor.</P>
    <P>On those terms this budget seems to have failed to grasp the possibilities of the true facts.  It has completely failed to widen the tax base and consequently the Government have no revenue from that source to alleviate the problems for the poor and the needy.  For single people the income tax changes benefited the higher earner substantially more than the lower paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill appertains to inflation, and these anomalies need to be addressed.  It is clearly evident that the total percentage of the budget allocated to social welfare declined from 27.8 per cent in 1989 to 27.2 per cent in 1990.  There is still a major gap between what social welfare recipients will receive after the budget and after this Bill has gone through the Dáil, and what was recommended by the Government appointed Commission on Social Welfare.  These social welfare provisions could be classed as anti-family because increases in adult dependant and child dependant payments have lagged behind other increases.  Increases for social welfare families are at a lower rate than increases for single people in the same category and the increase in child benefit for each of the first four children was only 75p per month or 2.5p per day per child.  These rates have been frozen since 1986.  What would 2.5p per day per child do for a family in any part of rural Ireland?  It would not buy even the cheapest lollypop.  This was a miserable, niggardly approach to a very serious problem confronting the poor and needy section of this community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poverty levels are of crisis proportions and social welfare payments are making a major contribution to those problems. When social welfare was originally introduced it was not meant to be a permanent source of income.  It was seen as a means of tiding a person over until he or she got a job or recovered from sickness or other <Col N="851" /> temporary setback.  This has changed dramatically with permament unemployment staring a large proportion of our people in the face.  The jobs simply do not exist for the vast majority of our unemployed.  Emigration is not and never will be accepted as a mechanism for reducing unemployment and poverty in a self-respecting society.  The country needs a new strategy to tackle the problem by other means.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that over 300,000 people have emigrated over the past five years. This is a shocking indictment of any country and it is something our youth will never forget.  Unemployment would be twice the present level were it not for emigration.  The biggest drain has been from the 15 to 24 year old group.  A breakdown of the 1986 census figures shows that over two-thirds of the emigrants come from this age group.  There is something fundamentally wrong with a society which seems to have no solution for their problems other than emigration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has failed totally to face up to the scale of poverty and social division in Ireland and the measures reintroduced are completely inadequate.  The Minister states that the new allowance for carers which he is introducing in this Bill broadens substantially the range of individuals who can qualify for payment when they give full-time care and attention to an incapacitated and elderly person and that it will mean for the first time that married women and people who are not relatives of the pensioner will be able to qualify for a means-tested carer's allowance.  Why does the Minister not include married women who are relatives of the pensioners and who are doing Trojan work caring for those incapacitated relatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who would be consigned to geriatric hospitals throughout <Col N="852" /> the country and would cost the Exchequer far more than if the Minister allocated the allowance to such people? I would like the Minister to spell out clearly to the general public what is stated under the heading &ldquo;Woods Publishes Social Welfare Bill&rdquo;.  I presume this is a new policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very vague about the sections of the community that will benefit from the home carer's allowance. I am amazed that he has not spelt it out more clearly.  It will be very interesting to see who will benefit.  Will the married woman who is caring for her mother-in-law or father-in-law qualify for this allowance?  The Minister has misled the public in this Bill.</P>

The present rate of home help payable by health boards to people who care for relatives or others at home is only 75p per hour in most areas &mdash; although it is £1.50 per hour in the Eastern Health Board areas &mdash; and it is ten years since it was increased <Col N="853" /> from the miserable sum of 60p per hour to 75p per hour.

      <P>Apparently huge anomalies exist in the method of assessing small farmers applying for unemployment assistance under the Social Welfare Act. These include the estimated value of cattle which have to be &ldquo;wintered&rdquo; and fed during the late autumn and the greater part of the spring, and this is in addition to deflated prices and the uncertainty of the market.  All these matters mean that there is a loss instead of an income when assessing the small farmer's application for unemployment assistance. The Minister should be big enough to face up to the matter and ensure that assessments on farmers who are keeping cattle in their herds during the winter because they could not give them away in the autumn are fair and equitable. Their social welfare payments should certainly not be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the children of small farmers apply for unemployment assistance at 18 or 19 years of age they are saddled with an assessment for board and lodgings of maybe £20 to £24 per week and are given a niggardly sum of £13 or £14 unemployment assistance.  Surely this is not justice to an under-privileged section of <Col N="854" /> the community?  The Minister should address those anomalies.</P>
    <P>There are also anomalies in regard to widows of old age pensioners who are debarred from the six weeks' posthumous payment if they are already in receipt of a separate old age pension.  This is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>Does this apply to the non-contributory payments?  I know the Minister referred to the contributory payments. I also want to refer to the free telephone rental applications which are dealt with by the Minister's Department. His attitude to those applicants is a disgrace. A person would nearly have to be a complete invalid before he or she qualifies for this allowance.  It is as hard to get free rental or telephone allowance for those unfortunate people as it is to extract teeth from a goose.  I guarantee that that is a very difficult job, indeed it is nearly impossible to extract teeth from a goose and it is just as difficult to extract the free telephone rental from the Department.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I have listened with interest for the last hour and ten minutes to two Cork Deputies, one from each side of the House.  Their wit and wisdom were entertaining and interesting. I am sure that Deputy Sheehan is pleased that the Minister introduced a number of welcome changes in the Social <Col N="855" /> Welfare Bill which he has been looking for over the last couple of years and which his Government did not implement during their period in office from 1982 to 1987.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to maintain all payments against inflation and to give special increases to those on the lowest payments.  I also welcome the number of changes in the social welfare area which will benefit the long term unemployed, the old and different sections which need to be looked after.</P>
      <P>When I was in Opposition I criticised the then Minister and over the last couple of years I have praised our Minister but also criticised him if I felt he deserved it. Last year I criticised the fact that he did not introduce a scheme for children of unemployed people when they had to go back to school in September.  At that time I called for a double weeks' payment of social welfare and I am glad the Minister has recognised the need to look after this area by introducing a clothing allowance. This area has caused major problems for people on social welfare payments.  When their children went back to school in September because of the cost of clothing and school books, they suffered undue hardship.</P>

      <P>This is an issue which has grave consequences for the development of Waterford and is one about which the Waterford City Council feel exceedingly strongly.  When we got word in 1987 that the decentralisation of a Government Department to Waterford was again a live issue the city council acted very promptly.</P>
      <P>I had intended giving some of my time to Deputy Deasy but when I did not see him in the House I did not ask for permission.  Can I have your permission for that too; a Cheann Comhairle?</P>

      <P>The city council immediately bought a site which cost £78,000.  It is not paid for and is being transferred to the Office of Public Works.  The city council had to increase the commercial rate in order to obtain the money to buy this site.  They did this willingly and indeed the commercial sector in Waterford responded because they saw how important it was to have a Government Department decentralised to Waterford. Between 1971 and 1981 Waterford lost its place in the national pecking order of cities &mdash; it dropped from fourth to fifth place &mdash; and this is a matter of great concern to us.  The Regional Development Authority in 1978 commissioned Dr. Michael Bannon of UCD to carry out a survey of the area with a view to finding a way to improve the situation in the service sector in Waterford.  It is often felt that Waterford is an industrial city but in fact its best days were when it had a thriving service sector.  This part of our city's economy is now very weak in comparison with the industrial sector which suffered a great blow in recent years with about 1,000 jobs losses in Waterford Glass alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city council have not been idle in <Col N="857" /> the interim.  Dr. Bannon made recommendations in terms of building up the service sector in Waterford city. For instance, he recommended that there should be an airport there.  The city council acted on this and in co-operation with the trade unions and the business sector the airport became a reality and is a continuing success in the city.  It has done a great deal for the region and for its development.  Another recommendation was that the shopping facilities in Waterford city needed to be improved and I am glad to say that at present an £18 million shopping development is under way. Another recommendation was that pedestrianisation be undertaken in the city centre, again something with which substantial progress has been made. Indeed the Minister for the Environment, in very recent times, commented favourably on what has been achieved in Waterford regarding pedestrianisation.</P>
    <P>The new regional hospital is also under way there.  I cannot stress too strongly how important it is that the jobs that will come from the decentralisation of a Government Department should come to the city.  It would certainly improve the construction industry in the short-term and the shopping development in the city which in so many ways is vitally important. Waterford has immeasurably improved its telecommunications service in the interim.</P>
    <P>In 1984 Dr. Bannon was asked to review the position and part of his review showed that between 1971 and 1981 the service sector employment share in the region had dropped from 9.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent.  Of 100,000 jobs created in the service sector nationally between 1960 and 1980, only 5 per cent came to the region.  We are here to plead the case for an immediate Government decision to decentralise a Department to Waterford because it is vital to our economy and to the whole plan that is so effectively developing in the city.  There is a great <Col N="858" /> deal of new tourism and leisure development investment in the city.  The importance of bringing a Government Department to the city cannot be over-stressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to thank Deputy O'Shea for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this matter. At the outset I have to say that I too am disappointed with the delay in confirming the decentralisation of a Government Department to Waterford, which obviously means that steps cannot be taken at present to identify and organise civil servants in readiness for that move. However, I am pleased that since the return of a Fianna Fáil led Government in 1987 the policy regarding decentralisation has been reactivated.  The previous Fine Gael-Labour Coalition did not have a policy of decentralisation and if they had continued in power we would not have seen a Government office in Waterford in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Many reports over the last number of years, particularly the Bannon reports to which Deputy O'Shea has alluded, have highlighted the total imbalance that exists in Waterford city as regards white collar versus blue collar workers.  Part of the reason for that imbalance has been that Waterford is the only county borough that does not enjoy full university status. Accordingly, Waterford in particular, and the south-eastern region in general, has suffered as a consequence.  In order to correct this imbalance Waterford should have been one of the first areas designated for decentralisation.  While I do not begrudge the decentralisation of Government offices to other towns or cities I believe the need for decentralisation in the south-east has been greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became a member of Waterford Corporation in 1985 tremendous efforts have been made to try to improve and upgrade the city.  Great strides have been made particularly in the city centre because of Waterford's designation for urban renewal.  It was enhanced even further over the last couple of years by the provision of extra grants to beautify the <Col N="859" /> city centre through the pedestrianisation of many areas, extra paving and lighting and also a more imaginative planning programme.  I point this out for the benefit of the Government to assure them that when the time comes to transfer civil servants, we will not experience the same problems that arose in decentralisation to other areas where it was difficult to fill the places allocated.</P>
    <P>A suitable site of approximately four acres is now available to Waterford Corporation and that could be quite easily transferred to the Office of Public Works within a matter of a couple of weeks, if required.  The lack of a suitable site was used previously as an excuse to hold up decentralisation to Waterford.  Most of the other regions in the country appear to have been favoured for decentralisation or are about to get Government offices, but again the south-eastern region appears to be losing out.</P>

      <P>I would also like to thank Deputy O'Shea for agreeing to share some of his time with me.  I do not think we are going to make any progress in Waterford by propounding party politics. Unanimity is the password of the day and we should all be seen to work together in highlighting the fact that in Waterford we are deprived where this type of employment is concerned.  We would like if the Minister could tell us tonight what Department will be transferred to Waterford; how many people will be involved <Col N="860" /> and when the movement of personnel will take place?</P>
      <P>We have had very lopsided developments in Waterford, as Deputy O'Shea has pointed out.  People feel there is discrimination against Waterford and the south-east in favour of other areas, in particular the midlands and the west. They would like to see this situation redressed.  Waterford has already lost out heavily in this type of employment.  The South-Eastern Health Board located their headquarters in Kilkenny rather than Waterford.  Recently we have seen a similar case where the local Ordnance Survey workers are being asked to transfer from Waterford to the central office in Dublin.  We would like to see this trend reversed.  I hope that this evening the Minister can give us some answers in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to put on record the success of the Government's decentralisation programme to date. Following on the implementation of phase 1 of the programme &mdash; by the provision of Government offices at Ballina, employing 200 staff; Cavan, employing 150; Galway, employing 200; Sligo, employing 300 &mdash; the Government decided in November 1987 to expand the decentralisation programme by undertaking the phase 2 stage.  The first part of this stage involved transferring 180 staff from the Department of Education to Athlone; transferring 140 staff from the Department of Justice to Killarney; and transferring 190 staff from the Department of Social Welfare to Letterkenny.  I am happy to report that works are well underway at the Letterkenny and Killarney centres while work at Athlone is expected to commence in the very near future.  The second stage of phase 2 encompasses a further five centres at Ennis, Limerick, Nenagh for a total of <Col N="861" /> some 900 staff of the Revenue Commissioners and further centres at Dundalk and Waterford.  No decision has been taken yet as to the Departments involved in relation to the transfers to Dundalk and Waterford, but it is expected that Waterford should cater for approximately 400 staff.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the Government's decision included the proviso that where State-owned sites were not already available at the proposed centres of decentralisation, sites were to be acquired free of charge from the relevant local authorities. As there was no suitable State-owned site in Waterford, the site was sought from Waterford Corporation. Following the inspection of various sites and negotiations with the corporation, a site on the Cork road was selected, a site of some three and three quarter acres comprised of an area owned by Telecom Éireann and an adjoining site owned by the corporation.  The corporation agreed to purchase the land from Telecom Éireann and to transfer it, and the area which they owned free of charge to the Office of Public Works.  The land owned by Telecom Éireann was acquired by the corporation in May 1989, the title was registered in the Land Registry in February 1990 and when the corporation is released from a restrictive covenant affecting part of the site, the transfer of the entire site to the Office of Public Works can proceed.</P>
    <P>A Department has not yet been selected for Waterford but when a Department has been nominated and their particular requirements determined, tenders will be invited from developers on the basis of a brief of the requirements. It is not possible at this stage to give an accurate forecast as to when the new offices will be provided but given the experience to date of other centres it is reckoned that the buildings should be completed within two years from the date of receipt of the brief from the selected Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud to speak on behalf of the nursing profession, who for far too long have been exploited, ignored and victimised.  They are given little or no credit for their contribution to the health services but have been forced to accept poor pay, poor working conditions, long and unsocial hours with little or no hope of promotion within their profession.  The employment of nurses is one of the scandals of our time, as is evident in the two hospitals in my constituency, St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question tabled by me to the Minister for Health, I have been informed that in St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, 48.3 per cent of the nursing staff are employed in a temporary or part-time capacity.  In Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, 43.7 per cent of the nursing staff are similarly employed.  This is nothing short of scandalous.  It is a betrayal of an honourable profession.  It is a mean, selfish device employed by the South-Eastern Health Board to curtail expenses and enables them to live within their limited budget.  However, I must ask why nurses should be the victims, the people on whom the very essence of our health services depends?  I must ask what percentage of the administrative staff in the South-Eastern Health Board or in the other health boards is employed in a temporary or part-time capacity?  I can say, without fear of contradication, that in no other group of health board employees is so small a percentage employed on a permanent basis.  Why should nurses be singled out for this unfair and unjust treatment?  I claim that for far too long the nursing profession has been taken for granted.  They are suffering from the Minister's indifference to their plight. They are expected to put the vocational nature of their profession before economic or other considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely to God we can do better for our nurses than offer them temporary or part <Col N="863" /> time positions, with all the insecurities and disadvantages that go with that.  We are giving them no recognition for their years of experience and we are ignoring their specialised skills in such areas as intensive care, cardiac care and above all we are casting aside the extent of the responsibility imposed on nurses by the very nature of their profession.  We must not overlook the fact that there have been huge cutbacks in the medical service.  The staffing situation is much tighter, causing the workload to increase and extending the amount of strain and stress borne by nurses.  I look forward to the publication of a report on <i>Stress in Nursing</i> but I must ask why it has not yet been authorised for publication?  Could it be that the contents are so true, that an embargo had to be placed on its publication so that the Department's neglect of the nursing profession could be cloaked?</P>
    <P>The dedication and commitment of Irish members of the nursing profession is acknowledged, not alone in Ireland but from Brisbane to Baghdad and from Luton to Los Angeles.  Throughout the merciless cutbacks when the plight of patients was highlighted, and rightly so, and the lack of accommodation was being constantly referred to, seldom, if ever, was a word of acknowledgment given to the heroes and heroines in the nursing profession who were constantly in the frontline of the crisis and working with a spirit of unselfishness while haunted by insecurity, battered by departmental and ministerial indifference and grossly underpaid but always putting the welfare of the sick, the aged and the handicapped before personal feelings or considerations.</P>
    <P>Many of our female nurses are the sole earners in their households and are willing to work overtime in order to keep their family together and at home.  With better conditions and more readily available employment for both spouses beckoning from abroad, contrasted with the insecurity of their positions here and the <Col N="864" /> indifference to their plight, surely this will eventually, if it is not already happening, lead to nurses being a scarce and rare commodity here at home.</P>
    <P>A major nursing crisis is predicted in terms of the availability of adequately qualified people, due to the lack of permanent positions offered and the inadequate recognition and reward for their services.  The rate of emigration among this profession is very high.  During the past three years alone 4,500 nurses have emigrated and they are valued and cherished in their chosen destinations.</P>
    <P>When are we as a nation going to learn how to value the invaluable within our society?  What nurse today can afford to buy a home of her own on the paltry pay she is offered?  Is it not unacceptable that a sister in charge of a ward, responsible for the vast amount of money spent in that ward and carrying a major responsibility, should receive such a paltry income?  I claim that the employment of nurses in a temporary or part-time capacity is going on for far too long and it is alarming that that trend is increasing.</P>
    <P>I am aware that five or six positions in St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, have been advertised but this is merely a drop in the ocean; it will do nothing to alter the imbalance but will still leave 43 per cent of the staff in each hospital working in a temporary or part-time capacity.  Something better must be offered and I plead with the Minister of State to extend the number of permanent positions being offered to a realistic and fair number.</P>
    <P>In relation to those working in a temporary or part-time capacity, I ask the Minister to ensure that they are given some recognition for their years of experience. It is unacceptable that a nurse working in a hospital for six years or more remains on the first point of the salary scale; incremental credit must be offered. If the Minister of State does not attend to this problem he will be faced with a national crisis due to the unavailability of nurses as those nurses will have turned <Col N="865" /> to other shores where their profession, skills and dedication get the recognition and rewards they deserve.  The nurses in St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, deserve far better treatment from the South-Eastern Health Board.  I trust that the Minister of State will give me some ground for hope in his reply this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to outline the current personnel-management arrangements which are applied by my Department in health agencies generally before I comment specifically on the position in St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, both of which are within the South-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>From the start of the current year we have found it possible to allow individual health agencies considerable flexibility in respect of their employment, provided it is applied within available financial resources and an overall approved staffing ceiling.  Principally, this permits local managers to respond quickly to changing service demand patterns by adjusting employment levels upwards and downwards in response to such changes in a cost effective manner.  This flexibility allows for a much better delivery of service.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that health services staffing is influenced not just by seasonal shifts in demand but also by the need to maintain a minimum staffing level at all times while allowing staff to avail of their entitlements in regard to sick leave, annual leave, maternity leave and, where possible, to appropriate career breaks.  These factors conspire to create an ongoing requirement for considerable levels of temporary staffing in the health services.  Such staffing is not an automatic indication of staffing difficulties but rather a reflection of the labour intensive nature of the health services and the need to maintain staffing cover at all times.</P>

      <Col N="866" /> I listened with great interest to what Deputy Ahearn had to say but as far as we are concerned, neither my Department nor the health service want to exploit, ignore or victimise any nurses.  I do not think that happens in any part of the country.  It is important that we have an adequate nursing complement.  I must point out to the Deputy that within the public sector the greatest number of requests for job sharing and part-time working comes from the nursing profession. This is due to the complexities of the nursing career, the long hours and the desire of many married nurses to maintain the security of the nursing career and the vocational satisfaction which it gives, albeit on shorter hours or on a job sharing basis.  This flexibility is of assistance in providing excellent care throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, I am advised by the South-Eastern Health Board who are responsible for the management of these hospitals that staffing levels there are kept under constant and continuous review. As part of this process and within the flexibility we have devolved to local managers, the South-Eastern Health Board now intend making significant additional permanent appointments in both hospitals. In the case of Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, interviews have recently been concluded and a total of eight permanent appointments will be made in the coming weeks.  As regards St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, I am advised that interviews will commence on 4 April next and that 13 permanent appointments will result.</P>
    <P>The effect of these measures will be to reduce whole-time temporary nurse staffing in Our Lady's Hospital from a current level of 12 to four and at St. Joseph's Hospital from a level 14 to one. The remaining whole-time temporary posts and the additional 16 locum and part-time staff employed in both hospitals are there to cover absences by permanent staff and for other specific <Col N="867" /> reasons.  Officials of the South-Eastern Health Board met the relevant unions involved, the INO and SIPTU, last week and communicated these decisions to them.</P>
    <P>As a confirmation of my earlier remarks as regards the need for such flexible employment, Deputies may be interested to note that among the reasons for retaining these temporary staff at present are the absence of five nurses on career breaks, three on maternity leave and one on long-term sick leave.  Other temporary, locum and part-time staff are employed to cover absences due to casual sick leave, annual leave and to meet fluctuations in demand.  It would be totally unreasonable to suggest that permanent staff who are temporarily absent should themselves be replaced on a permanent basis.  To do so would be to place an unsustainable demand on scarce resources and would lead to considerable displacement of returning and replacement permanent personnel.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by assuring the House that in relation to the position in the South-Eastern Health Board and in other health agencies, my Department monitor <Col N="868" /> staffing levels and their composition on an ongoing basis in consultation with the agency management concerned.  Where difficulties arise every effort is made to quickly address the situation in the context of the resources available and competing demands.  Total expenditure of £1.4 billion on our health services in 1990 is positive proof of the Government's commitment to ensuring that the best possible health service is provided taking into account that health has been allocated over 21.5 per cent of proposed budgetary expenditure this year.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this matter and her Oireachtas colleagues within her constituency who have also made strenuous representations to my Department on behalf of the staffs of both hospitals.  I hope my positive response is to the satisfaction of everybody involved and who has an interest in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 26 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The European Community is 80 per cent self sufficient in sheep meat.  The 20 per cent shortfall is made up from imports from third countries.  These imports are regulated under voluntary restraint agreements and are also subject to the general agreement on tariffs and trade. Lamb and sheep meat exports from all member states of the Community to third countries, amount to 8,000 tonnes per annum or 1 per cent of Community production.</P>
      <P>The revised regime for the sheep meat sector provides for the application of export refunds.  The Commission, has not yet considered it appropriate to fix export refunds due to the small volume of trade and the potential financial implications for the Community budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under GATT arrangements third country suppliers of sheep meat have free access to the Community market subject to a 20 per cent duty.  On the setting up of the market organisation on sheep meat in 1980 the Community negotiated agreements, with all the main suppliers, including New Zealand under which they agreed to limit their supplies in return for <Col N="604" /> a reduction in the duty to 10 per cent.  The agreement concluded on 25 September 1989 between the Community and New Zealand was a re-negotiation of that agreement and was the culmination of protracted negotiations which has an impact on other commodities and has implications under GATT arrangements. During these negotiations I was successful in ensuring maximum protection for the Irish producer while at the same time respecting our international obligations. Under the terms of the voluntary restraint agreement with New Zealand, Ireland and France have been designated sensitive zones whereby quantitative restrictions apply.  Under these arrangements New Zealand may issue voluntary restraint agreement export certificates up to a maximum of the agreed quantities. In 1989 the total volume of New Zealand imports into Ireland amounted to 30 tonnes.  As Ireland's production of sheep meat in 1989 exceeded 58,000 tonnes, the limited quantity of imports from New Zealand did not affect price levels here.</P>
    <P>In the overall Community context, New Zealand agreed to reduce its annual quota by 40,500 tonnes to 205,000 tonnes and within that quantity, for the first time accepted a ceiling on fresh meat exports. In return, the Community agreed to reduce the import levy from 10 per cent to zero.  The drop in Irish lamb prices experienced earlier this year has fortunately stopped, and significant upward swing on market quotations has been recorded during the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>I would like to point that as a result of changes in payment procedures for the ewe premium, advances totalling 60 per cent of 1990 premium will be paid this year in the whole country.  This is in addition to the balance of 1989 premium which will be paid in disadvantaged areas and the full 1989 premium in non-disadvantaged areas.  The overall value of these payments is estimated to amount to over IR£110 million.</P>
    <P>CBF will continue its vigorous efforts to promote the consumption of Irish lamb on domestic and European markets. Efforts will continue to ensure that the considerable marketing achievements in <Col N="605" /> securing a top quality profile for Irish lamb on continental markets are maintained.</P>

      <P>The progress made by the interim Bord Glas set up in April 1987 is referred to in the speeches made to the Dáil and Seanad during the Second Stages of the Bord Glas Bill, 1989.  I would refer the Deputy to volume 392, No. 5, columns 1327 &mdash; 1341, of the Dáil Official Report of 2 November and to volume 123, No. 15, columns 1693 &mdash; 1705, of the Seanad Official Report of 7 February.</P>
      <P>The statutory Bord Glas will shortly be appointed under the recently enacted Bord Glas Act, 1990.  The plans which that board will put into operation are, of course, a matter for the board itself to decide.  However, I have no doubt that the new board will be guided by the documents entitled A Programme for the Development of Horticulture and A Programme for the Development of the Seed Potato Industry published by the interim board and that it will regard the implementation of these programmes as one of its main tasks.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, these programmes envisage a combined domestic market share recovery and export expansion of some £60 million and the creation of 1,800 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>It is difficult at this stage to speculate on the implications for trade in agricultural products of developments in Eastern Europe and in East Germany in particular.  In the short term at least the opening up of markets in central and east Europe should increase opportunities for trade from Ireland and other Community member states and for technology transfers. Trade relations in the longer term will depend on the degree to which the agricultural economies of these countries develop.</P>
      <P>The Federal Republic has provided a valuable outlet for Irish agricultural products in recent years and, for instance, is now our second largest dairy export market in the Community after the United Kingdom.  I would expect that our experience and success in the Federal Republic will enable us take advantage of any opportunities to expand sales to East Germany, although trade opportunities with that country may be less than with other countries in the region.</P>
      <P>Outside of the trade issues to which I have already referred, the implications of German unification for Irish agriculture are obviously tied up with the application of the Common Agricultural Policy to a larger Germany.  Beyond saying that an expanded FEOGA budget would be needed in that eventuality it is too soon to speculate on what other changes might be required.</P>

      <P>All cheese manufactured in Ireland is subject to sampling and analysis for quality purposes by my Department. Export licences under the Dairy Produce Marketing Act, 1961, are not issued if there is any indication that the cheese does not meet the required quality standards.</P>

      <P>The position in so far as my Department is concerned is set out in Vote 32 of the recently published abridged version of the 1990 Estimates <Col N="612" /> for the Public Service.  In summary, the total gross Estimate for 1990 amounts to £305 million.</P>
      <P>I must point out, however, that this represents only part of the total amount which will be spent by my Department. In its capacity as intervention agency, it is responsible for very substantial expenditure on schemes under the guarantee section of FEOGA.  It is not possible to estimate at this stage precisely the total amount which will be involved under these schemes this year but I am circulating a tabular statement detailing the net FEOGA payments of £886 million made under a variety of headings in 1989. In addition, a sum of approximately £124 million was spent on intervention purchases of beef, dairy products and cereals in 1989.</P>
      <P>European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) Guarantee Section 1989</P>
      <P>The following table gives details of £886.153 million expended on schemes under the guarantee section of FEOGA during 1989.</P>

      <P>Specific measures to eliminate consumer confusion regarding the contents of dairy products and their competitors have already been adopted at Community level by the Council of Ministers in Regulations (EEC) 1898/87, which limited the use of dairy designations to products obtained exclusively from milk.  In its first report to the Council on the application of this measure, the EC Commission concluded that the regulation had been insufficient to eliminate consumer confusion particularly in the yellow fats sector of the market and promised to prepare further measures on this matter.</P>

      <P>Under the Community Regulations milk quotas are attached to the land used for milk production and normally can only be transferred when the land in question is also transferred by sale, lease or inheritance.</P>
      <P>However under the restructuring scheme which I negotiated in the Council of Ministers in 1987 I have provided that producers who are ceasing milk production may sell their quota to their co-operative or dairy for re-sale to priority category producers within the same area who require additional quota.  Small scale producers are the first priority under this scheme while producers who draw up development plans also benefit.  Approximately 40 million gallons of quota has been re-allocated to date to the priority category producers under this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 107 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal for a Council directive concerning the placing of EC-accepted plant protection products on the market is part of the 1992 harmonisation programme and is intended to set up a harmonised procedure for the authorisation of plant protection products.  In the case <Col N="618" /> of plant protection products already on the market when the directive would come into force, the Commission, in consultation with the member states, would establish a priority list for the review of these products.  In the review procedure, old active substances would be rigorously evaluated having regard to their potential effects on consumer and operator safety and on the environment.  Where products have been banned because of harmful effects in any of these ways, the framework proposed by the Commission could not lead to reinstatement of such products at national level.  Furthermore, decisions with regard to particular products would be made at member state level on the basis of complete data packages available on the products.</P>
    <P>As is normal in such cases, this proposal has been referred for technical discussion to a Council working party which is at present engaged in detailed examination of it.  There is no question of member states rejecting the principle of the proposal but the varying views on particular aspects of it are put forward in the discussion.  The report of the working party will be submitted in due course to the Council of Ministers which takes the decision on the adoption of the proposal as a directive in accordance with EC rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to the on-going Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations rather than to the <Col N="619" /> current EC negotiations on the Commission's proposals on prices for agricultural products and related measures for 1990/91.</P>
      <P>The GATT negotiations are conducted by the Commission on behalf of the Community on the basis of mandates agreed by the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>In relation to agriculture the Community's approach is that while it is willing to participate in negotiations to progressively reduce support to the extent necessary to achieve balanced markets and a more market oriented agricultural trading system, the fundamental principles of the CAP must be preserved. The Community is also seeking a readjustment of external protection in relation to cereals substitute imports and full credit for the various agriculture reforms since 1986 which have contributed significantly to improvements on world markets.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I have ensured that these points and the contribution which agriculture makes to the Irish economy have been continuously stressed in the discussions within the Community which have contributed to the establishment of the EC negotiating position and in discussions with Government and/or producer representatives both within the Community and internationally.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations, the US has proposed that all non-tariff barriers to trade should be converted into tariffs which would then be eliminated over ten years. I do not favour this approach and the Commission has also indicated that this would not be acceptable to the Community.</P>
      <P>Cereals substitutes enter the Community under arrangements agreed to in earlier multilateral negotiations.  The Community is seeking to modify these arrangements in the current negotiations and has indicated that it is prepared to consider elements of tariffication to secure this.  As there is an overall Community interest in securing increased protection against these imports, I can accept the Community's approach in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> My principal objective for the remaining period of the negotiations will be to seek to ensure that the outcome of the negotiations will not prevent the Community from continuing to support farming and rural areas generally and that farmers' incomes can be maintained at reasonable levels.  In its agreed negotiations position, the Community is firmly committed to meeting these aims.</P>

    <P>The Wildlife Act 1976 provides for the protection of specified species and their <Col N="634" /> habitats.  Species are protected by banning or limiting their exploitation in the wild.  It is also an offence to wilfully interfere with or destroy the habitat of a protected species.</P>
    <P>I have provided an extra £500,000 for the Wildlife Service for land purchase in 1990 for the purchase of peatlands and this will be used for the purchase of raised and blanket bogs.  The target for conservation of these land types is 11,000 hectares for raised bogs and 40,000 hectares for blanket bogs.  At present approximately 15,000 hectares of blanket bog is protected and around 1,000 hectares of raised bog.</P>
    <P>An extra 84 hectares of land was purchased recently to extend the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve, the home in winter of approximately 40 per cent of the Greenland white-fronted goose, 50 per cent of the population of which winter in Ireland. This extra land will help the population to stabilise and hopefully expand.  On the reserve disturbance of the geese is prohibited.</P>
    <P>Eighteen sites have been designated for the purposes of the EC Directive 79/409 on the protection of wild birds and further sites are being considered.</P>

While the Blackwater is included in the priority list of major catchments I cannot say at this stage when it is likely to be reached in the arterial drainage programme.  Accordingly <Col N="635" /> the question of providing funding does not arise at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only significant currency movement against the Irish pound in recent months has come from the weakening of sterling.</P>
      <P>In so far as exports are concerned, the recent appreciation in the value of the punt against sterling, while obviously a matter of some concern, does not represent a serious threat to Irish exporters generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competitiveness of Irish firms <Col N="642" /> exporting to the UK has improved considerably in recent years as a result of lower inflation, lower interest rates, improvements in productivity and reductions in some important costs to industry such as electricity and telecommunications. Total Irish exports to the UK, in 1989, increased by approximately 13 per cent on the previous year's figure.</P>
    <P>In addition, since up to 40 per cent of the raw materials used as inputs for our manufactured exports come from the sterling area, there have been reductions in the cost of raw materials, helping to offset some of the pressure on exporters to the UK.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, however, that in 1990 Irish exporters face a challenging year due to both the weakness of sterling and to more difficult market conditions. There has been a fall off in demand in the UK due to decline in consumer purchasing and this, coupled with the exchange rate position, will make the achievement of sales more difficult in 1990.  Nevertheless, CTT are still projecting a further increase of the order of 5 per cent in the value of Irish exports to the UK in 1990.</P>
    <P>The Government's pursuit of sound economic policies aimed at fostering a more competitive environment for Irish business and the availability of Córas Tráchtála's marketing support services remain, in my view, the most effective way in which the Government can assist exporters to compete in overseas markets.</P>
    <P>As regards imports of consumer goods, the House will already be aware from my remarks in response to Deputy Quinn on 15 February that Irish consumers are already benefiting from the reduced costs.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Research and Standards (Fire Safety) (Domestic Furniture) Order, 1988 (S.I. No. 336 of 1988), which controls the use of fire retardant materials in domestic furniture, was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 14 December 1988. A copy of the order is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The answers to the specific matters raised by the Deputy are as follows:</P>
      <P> (a)  In 1988 a Guide to the Order was issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce and was circulated widely throughout the industry; copies of the guide are available from the Department. Additionally, EOLAS held a seminar on Thursday, 15 March, to explain the contents of the regulations to the industry. EOLAS are now being asked to consider holding such further seminars as are considered desirable.</P>
      <P>(b)  A press release relating to the requirements for covering fabrics was issued by Deputy Michael Smith, Minister for Science and Technology on 28 February 1990.  Furthermore, an official notice will be published shortly drawing the special notice of the public to the availability in the Department and in offices of EOLAS of copies of the 1988 Guide to the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  Existing stocks of upholstery fabrics <Col N="644" /> bought by retailers before 1 March 1990, cannot be legally sold after this date unless they meet the safety requirements of the order.  The only exception relates to permanent covers on second hand furniture which can be sold until 1 March 1993, even though such covers do not meet the requirements of the order.</P>
    <P>(d)  The order applies to upholsterers in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. </P>
    <P>The enforcement of the order is a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all residents of the State aged 66 years or over.  The scheme also applies to registered blind persons over 18 years and to certain categories of disabled persons under 66 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.  The scheme also applies to spouses under age 66 for journeys on which they accompany the qualified person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of the free travel concession is generally restricted at certain times.  These restrictions apply, <i>inter alia</i>, to city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday, inclusive.  The restrictions have been imposed because the services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or <Col N="647" /> school.  It is believed that the services might not be able to cope with the additional influx of passengers which could arise if the restrictions did not apply.</P>
    <P>The restrictions in question do not apply in the case of mentally handicapped persons, or certain persons attending specified rehabilitation courses.  Persons in these categories only are issued with special red free travel passes which allow unrestricted travel. As the person concerned does not come within the categories mentioned, he does not qualify for an unrestricted travel pass.</P>
    <P>The cost of my Department's free travel scheme in 1990 is £27 million.  An extension of the scheme to allow unrestricted travel to other categories would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  Any easing of the restrictions could also have significant implications for bus operators whose services might be affected at peak times.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health will be examining outpatient arrangements generally in the context of his recently announced Dublin hospitals initiative.  It is expected that issues such as the one raised in this case will be considered within that framework.</P>

      <P>It is understood that this question relates to appeals made by unemployment assistance claimants in the Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time involved in carrying out an appeal in any case varies depending on a number of factors, including the nature of the appeal and whether the appeal can be dealt with summarily or whether an oral hearing is necessary.  In some cases <Col N="651" /> the file has been referred to the social welfare officer for further inquiries in connection with the contentions made by the appellant.  The schedules are also affected by the volume of appeals cases on hands at the time.</P>
    <P>In general, the average time taken to carry out appeals, in the Cork area and elsewhere, is regarded as reasonable.  In recent months, however, there has been an increase in the volume of appeals on hands requiring an oral hearing.  This has resulted in some lengthening of the normal throughput time.

      <P>It is my policy to expand the social welfare information service and make it more readily accessible at a local level.  At present the information offices in Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Tallaght and Clondalkin cater for persons within the catchment area of Thomas Street employment exchange.  There are also information offices in the city centre at Pearse Street and Amiens Street.  I intend, as resources permit, to appoint further information officers at other centres including employment exchanges in the Dublin area which do not have an information officer at present.</P>

      <P>The person concerned renewed his claim to unemployment assistance on 27 November 1989.  Following investigation, a deciding officer assessed his means at £51.54 per week.  The means are derived from his one-third share of the family holding.

The local authority may, at its discretion, use the discretionary grants for non-national roads paid by my Department to supplement expenditure from its own resources on such works.  On 23 November 1989 discretionary grants for regional and county roads, totalling £3.023 million, were notified to Kerry County Council in respect of 1990.</P>

      <P>The development of proposals for the improvement of national primary routes is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant local authority having regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, the accident record on the road.</P>
      <P>There are proposals currently before my Department from Limerick County Council to undertake traffic management measures at Daly's Cross on the N7. These proposals are the subject of consultation at engineering level and I hope to be in a position shortly to approve them so that the work can commence.  A road grant of £25,000 has been notified to the local authority to meet costs arising this year.  The need for further work at this location will be considered when the effects of the proposed traffic management measures have been assessed.</P>

    <P>I hope to establish further satellite renal dialysis units at Castlebar and Cavan Hospitals as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>At present there are five kidney dialysis stations at Waterford Regional Hospital. There will be increased capacity for kidney dialysis in the new hospital currently under construction at Ardkeen.  In the meantime, my Department is discussing with the South Eastern Health Board the possibility of employing additional nursing staff so that further patients from the catchment area can avail of existing facilities at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

      <P>The question of course structure and organisation is a matter in the first instance for the college authorities and I have no direct involvement in the process.</P>
      <P>The current situation is that Athlone regional technical college run two courses in the plastics area: the four year <i>ab initio</i> degree course leading to a B.Sc. in polymer technology and a two year national certificate course in plastics from which eligible students may follow on to a one year national diploma course.</P>
      <P>The matter is to be discussed at a meeting of the board of management to be held on 22 March 1990 and if it can be shown that there would be sufficient demand for the national diploma year of the course in September 1990 the matter will be reconsidered.</P>
