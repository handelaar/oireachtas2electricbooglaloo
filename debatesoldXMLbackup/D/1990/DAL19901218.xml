      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business I have notice from Deputy Pat Rabbitte that he seeks leave to move a motion under Standing Order 30.  I understand that Deputy McCartan has been deputised to put the question in the unavoidable absence of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for facilitating me in this way. In accordance with Standing Order 30 I seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely, that Dáil Éireann expresses its serious concern at the reported leaking <Col N="2" /> on Thursday last of inflation figures produced by the Central Statistics Office in advance of their official publication time to certain financial interests in such a way as to allow them to make a speculative killing on the financial markets; calls on the Taoiseach to carry out the fullest possible investigation into the incident and to report back to the Dáil at the earliest possible date; and, in view of the damage that this incident could do to our international reputation, calls on the Taoiseach to ensure that steps are taken to prevent such leaks from occurring in the future.  In view of the seriousness of the matter I would ask the House and you, a Cheann Comhairle, to accede to the request.</P>

      <P>You can raise that matter quite conveniently later on the Estimates.  Is it agreed that business shall be interrupted at 9.30 p.m.? Agreed.  Is it agreed that the sitting shall be suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m.? Agreed.  Is it agreed that No. 7 shall be taken without debate?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with the Supplementary Estimates and the Excess Vote agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 8 agreed?  Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the extended time for Private Members' Business agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two brief questions for the Taoiseach.  Will he agree to make representations to the British Government seeking the unconditional release of the Birmingham Six for Christmas pending &mdash; and without prejudice &mdash; the review of their cases which is to take place in February, in view of the fact that they have been in jail for almost 17 years? I also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Ceann Comhairle agree that, in view of the seriousness of the matter, this is the only opportunity or means available to me to raise this matter before the Dáil goes into recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to facilitate the Deputy in another way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach would like to reply but I do not wish to get into conflict with the Chair as I <Col N="6" /> appreciate his position.  I will seek whatever means are open to me to raise the matter in another way and I am sure the Taoiseach will wish to respond.  Has the Taoiseach any plans to introduce legislation to enhance the powers of the director of the Central Statistics Office in view of the fact that the director stated he does not have sufficient powers to investigate the very serious leak which occurred in relation to the inflation figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to the conference in Rome last weekend.  Will the House be allowed time tomorrow to discuss the outcome of that meeting?  I assume the Taoiseach will be informing the House tomorrow of the Adjournment of the Dáil for a considerable period.  Will the Taoiseach and the Government give consideration to the House coming back earlier in January in view of the substantial amount of business with which we have to deal?  If I raise this point tomorrow morning it will probably be too late as the Government will have fixed a date for resumption.  Will the Taoiseach give some consideration to coming back early in January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention, as promised, to report to the House on the very successful Rome Summit.  I understand that the Whips will be getting together to see how that can be arranged. The House will reassemble in good time to do all the necessary business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we will be adjourning tomorrow until, presumably, close to the end of January and that the deadline for the United Nations Security Council motion is 15 January, will the Taoiseach say if any special arrangements will be made to recall the House in the event of the United States implementing that decision, as they threatened last night?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, I am sure we all earnestly hope, that the awful eventuality to which the Deputy referred will not arise in January or at any subsequent time.  Of course arrangements can always be made to recall the Dáil if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give consideration in his report tomorrow &mdash; or at a time the Whips agree &mdash; on the outcome of the IGC to outline the position which Ireland has taken in relation to the suspension of some sanctions against South Africa which were apparently agreed at that conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We should await the Taoiseach's statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, as the procedure in relation to this matter is by way of statements which cannot be questioned, I am being courteous in asking the Taoiseach in advance to give some consideration to this matter and to perhaps include it in the report to the House.  I am not anticipating his reply, I am simply requesting him to consider it when he speaks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As the promised legislation on the reorganisation of local government will not now be circulated before Christmas &mdash; as originally intended &mdash; will the Taoiseach say when in the next session that legislation will be circulated?  Will it be before the Easter recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to tell the Deputy about that as the report from the expert group has only just been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach allow a token Estimate to be introduced for the Department of Tourism and Transport so that what has euphemistically been described as &ldquo;unreported losses&rdquo; by Aer Lingus, now totalling perhaps £24 million, could be debated by the House?  If that is not feasible, could a <Col N="8" /> statement be made to the House so that Members could be informed as to what is happening in Aer Lingus?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend requesting the Whips to allocate time before the Dáil adjourns tomorrow to seek its approval to appoint a new member of Government?</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £37,550,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have available to them details of this Supplementary Estimate and I do not propose to outline the provisions in detail.  In the time available to me, I propose to highlight the four main aspects of this additional provision, namely, the additional provision £23.05 million in respect of acute hospital services; the provision of £13.251 million in respect of the general medical services scheme; an extra capital provision of £7 million and an injection of £9.749 million to improve the cash provision of the health agencies in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that, in February <Col N="13" /> last, I gave an understanding to meet the additional costs incurred by health boards and hospitals in dealing with the `flu epidemic, which occurred at the end of 1989 and the beginning of this year.  I also gave an assurance that acute bed levels would be maintained at around 12,000 as compared to a figure of 11,200 in mid-1989, and that activity levels would be held at those prevailing in the latter half of 1989. I am glad I have been able to honour these commitments in full, and the provision included in this Estimate reflects the costs involved.</P>
    <P>During 1988 and early 1989, the Government were severely criticised about waiting lists.  Indeed, it became so pervasive that, at times, one would think that the health services had ceased to function.  I made a particular point of tackling waiting lists as part of the programme of work undertaken with the additional funds which were made available to acute hospitals in 1989.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists are a feature of all health systems throughout the world.  Among the factors influencing waiting lists are the increasing demands from an ageing population and the development of new forms of treatment such as hip replacements. To some extent, they are a problem of success.  In this country, the waiting lists for most specialities are not excessive but I accept that there are some areas which needed to be addressed, particularly orthopaedic and ENT.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the additional £15 million which was provided for the health services in 1989 enabled a substantial increase in activity on the previous year's levels and, consequently, a significant reduction in long waiting times.</P>
    <P>Steady progress has been made in a number of key areas and I am committed to building on that work.  For example, the number of hip replacement operations performed nationally has increased from 1,624 in 1987 to 1,904 in 1989 and I am confident that the figure for 1990 will reflect a continued substantial increase in performance.</P>
    <P>In relation to ENT, very satisfactory results are being achieved.  The waiting list and waiting time for Temple Street <Col N="14" /> Children's Hospital has shown very dramatic reductions over a short period.  On 1 November 1989 the list was 1,228.  On 1 November 1990 it was 550 &mdash; a reduction of 55 per cent.  The throughput for the period 1 January 1990 to 30 September 1990 was 1,310 as against 913 for the same period last year &mdash; an increase in activity of 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>The waiting time for ear procedures at the hospital at present is a standard four weeks.  With the present rate of progress in relation to tonsillectomies, the waiting period will have been reduced to under two months by mid-1991.  Another example of where significant improvement has been achieved is in the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria Hospital, Cork. The ENT waitiing list there has been reduced by over 60 per cent in the period October 1989 to May 1990.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly concerned by the problems of child deafness and I specifically targeted additional funds to alleviate this problem.  I am pleased to report that as a result of these measures children needing grommets are attended to within a period of six months.  These are specific tangible results which are being achieved as a result of initiatives taken last year and continued throughout 1990.  They are part of an ongoing programme for reducing waiting times and I propose to continue to build on this progress.</P>
    <P>There is a particular challenge to those who manage the considerble resources of acute hospitals to strive for efficiency in their use.  It is my intention to pursue with all agencies a vigorous value-for-money programme throughout the system to ensure that the maximum benefit is achieved for every pound of public funds invested in the system.  The reports furnished to me by Mr. David Kennedy and Mr. Noel Fox will be particularly helpful in achieving the results which are necessary and desirable.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank them and their teams for the splendid work they have done during this year.</P>
    <P>I look forward to working with health boards and hospitals in 1991 to achieve savings in those areas which have been <Col N="15" /> identified as likely to yield results.  I am committed to supporting agencies and their managements in this vital task and I am very pleased that all savings achieved in 1991 will be used in the system for the good of those who rely on it for services.</P>
    <P>The additional provision of £13.251 million is required to meet the additional cash requirement of the general medical services (payments) board which will arise in the current year.  While the revised remuneration package for participating general practitioners, introduced in 1989, has operated very satisfactorily, I remain concerned at the increasing cost of drugs.  The increase in costs in 1990 has arisen not so much from the level of prescriptions written, although this is a contributory factor. Rather the increase is a function of the type of drug prescribed.  While I accept that the ever increasing complexity of treatment and the fact that new drugs are available for the management of previously untreatable conditions, I feel that we can still obtain better value in the purchase and usage of drugs.</P>
    <P>The new price agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries is working satisfactorily and a new drugs formulary will be issued shortly.  The general practitioner will remain the key determiner in the control of drug costs, and this role will receive prominence in the ongoing review discussions with the doctors.  I hope there can be early agreement on an effective arrangement for the containment of expenditure on drugs and medicines, consistent with the overriding need to provide appropriate therapy to each patient.</P>
    <P>A total provision of £7 million has been made in this Estimate in respect of capital expenditure &mdash; £6.2 million for building and equipping and £0.8 million for the development of information systems. This will enable my Department to meet binding commitments which have arisen during 1990.</P>
    <P>While there are many needs for capital to enable the existing service to be maintained and to allow for very desirable <Col N="16" /> developments, it is not possible for the Government in the current financial climate to provide other than for contractual obligations and essential works, such as fire precautions.  During 1990, I have conducted a very thorough review of the capital needs of the health services and I remain committed to introducing a five year programme for capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure that the fabric of the existing service is maintained so that services can continue to be delivered in an effective and efficient manner.  We must also ensure that each capital development is planned so that the revenue cost will be tolerable and that we strike a wise balance between what is desirable and what is affordable.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to provide some additional funding for the development of information systems.  This investment is essential if we are to improve the management of acute hospitals, which are difficult and complex entities.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate provides for an additional £9.749 million in respect of balances of grants for years prior to 1990.  These balances represent a cash injection which have a permanent beneficial effect on the liquidity of health agencies.  This injection will allow the agencies to improve their efficiency in the disbursement of cash and will result in more timely payment to creditors.  The taking of credit from suppliers is often seen as &ldquo;free goods&rdquo;, but this is far from the truth.  Suppliers who are made to wait for payment inevitably reflect this in their prices.</P>
    <P>Continuity and regularity of supplies is also critical in the health services and these can be threatened if suppliers can transfer to customers who can pay more promptly.  The provision of an adequate level of cash in health agencies is essential, if progress is to be made in maximising efficiency from purchasing and the management of supplies.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also provides for a bonus payment of certain health cash allowances this month in line with the long term social welfare allowances. Provision has been made for an <Col N="17" /> additional £1.45 million to be allocated to a range of minor subheads in the Health Vote.  The increases are due to a variety of factors such as additional consultancy contracts, changes in exchange rates affecting contributions to international organisations and additional costs associated with the EC Presidency.</P>
    <P>The original Estimates for appropriations-in-aid have been exceeded by £18 million and this sum can now be offset against the additional gross provision now sought.  An additional £14.5 million is available from health contributions and this is a reflection of the buoyancy in incomes generally.</P>
    <P>This country is a net beneficiary under EC regulations applying to migrant workers and additional receipts in this area will be £3.5 million.  The buoyancy arises as a result of a number of factors including currency fluctuations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity we have had to review the performance of the health services in 1990.  I regret that while there has been some modest improvements in some areas such as ENT, the overriding position is one of inequality of access, long waiting lists, gaps in our services and people having to wait for intolerable periods for basic health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to hospital waiting lists but he omitted to mention cardiac surgery or neuro-surgery.  I will return to orthopaedic surgery later.  In relation to cardiac surgery, we have over 1,000 public patients on the waiting list at the national centre for such surgery.  The waiting period is too long and the lives of people on the waiting list are at risk because of the length of time waiting for operations.  This was discussed previously in the House and I understand that the consultants have now issued an open letter to the Minister arising from his last comments on the matter, refuting what the Minister said.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the position whereby people who can pay privately for treatment can walk into an operating theatre in the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private for cardiac open heart surgery whereas <Col N="18" /> public patients have to wait at least a year, and maybe two and a half years, for treatment.  There are only two operations per day and people cannot gain access in good time.</P>
    <P>There is also a waiting list for neuro-surgery at Beaumont.  There has been a reorganisation of the neurosurgical services whereby the unit in St. Vincent's has closed and moved to Beaumont.  There are only six consultants there and there should be eight.  There is a delay of up to a year for those waiting for neuro-surgery relating to the spine.  I have spoken to consultants about this.  There are people with acute back pain who cannot get back to work and they have to wait a year or more for treatment.  Priority relates to brain tumours, other head related cases and the trauma cases arising out of car accidents.  This means the elective procedures have to wait too long.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated himself on the position in relation to orthopaedic surgery and said the number of treatments increased by a modest 300 but this bears no relationship to the need or demand.  In the south eastern health board region constituents at Kilcreene Hospital are waiting up to three years for hip replacements.  Some of them have been classified by their GPs as priority cases.  The position is the same in regard to other joint replacements.  That is unacceptable. I have been advised by the orthopaedic surgeons that because of the number of trauma cases they do not have sufficient capacity to make any inroad into the waiting list.  The waiting list position as regards hospitals is still totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>I regret very much moving outside the direct hospital area but I wish to point out that the Minister made no reference in his speech to some of the major problems in the health services at present. I refer initially to the area of mental handicap.  We have had street protests, Dáil debates and budget submissions seeking additional resources for residential and day care centres for adult mentally handicapped people whose parents are no longer able to cope in the <Col N="19" /> home.  The situation is that there is not adequate money to guarantee these people, whose parents may pass on, a place.  They are facing a crisis and their pleas have been ignored.</P>
    <P>Another area which the Minister failed to mention was that of speech therapy. A report was produced a little over a year ago which stated we need an additional 331 speech therapists.  The waiting lists for speech therapy are so long that children, in some cases, cannot properly fulfil their obligations to go to primary school due to speech deficiencies.  Parents have written to me pointing out that their child is not sufficiently advanced at five or six years of age because of speech impediments to take up a place in national school.  It is because of the shortage of speech therapists that the waiting lists are so long.  Children cannot be treated on time.  A similar position applies in relation to dental care by the health boards.  More than 15,000 children are waiting for orthodontic care.  No changes have been put in place to facilitate the children requiring urgent treatment.</P>
    <P>Last week we debated legislation dealing with child care.  We now have international figures to show that child abuse is at a minimum of around 7 per cent or 8 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is grossly exaggerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my figure, it is an international figure that was well publicised last week.  With the new legislative measures there will have to be additional resources for social workers, there will have to be local referral centres and proper family counselling and back-up support services for deprived families where children are at risk.  I see no intent on behalf of the Minister to cater for this area and, therefore, I must express deep concern.</P>
      <P>I would like also to refer to the last part of the Minister's contribution where he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> An additional £14.5 million is available from health contributions and this is a reflection of the buoyancy in incomes generally.</P>
    <P>I was advised by officials in the public sector &mdash; not in the Minister's Department &mdash; that in relation to 1989 an extra amount of £7 million in health contributions came in during the post-tax amnesty period.  This year the figure will be £14.5 million.  There is an excellent case for the Minister to say to Cabinet that this money should go to the beleagured health service.  People are paying this money on the understanding that it is a contribution towards the health service, without being an entitlement.  It should be clearly established Government practice now, and in the future, that any surplus money from health contributions, be they on an arrears basis or on a current year basis, should go to the net benefit of the Department of Health. The icy hand of the Exchequer will always grab any loose revenue which is available. This does not reflect the demand and need in the health services for extra resources.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of cost overruns I am very concerned about in relation to the Supplementary Estimate; it relates to the overrun in the GMS.  I am referring to expenditure on drugs for medical card holders through the GMS payments board which shows an overrun of £13.25 million.  This is very serious.  The Minister has congratulated himself on the deal he negotiated with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, leaving aside the fact that he said such a renegotiation was not possible during the last election but I am still most dissatisfied with the position in regard to drugs.  I would draw to the Minister's attention the position in Sweden whereby, in a very simple way, millions of pounds have been saved.  On the doctors prescription form there is a blank square and unless the doctor puts a tick in that square a generic drug is used by the pharmacists in dispensing that prescription.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to conclude by saying that unless the doctors feel strongly that a branded drug should be used, otherwise a generic drug should apply.  This simple measure would save money as generic drugs cost up to half the price of branded products.  I realise this is a very limited debate and looks only retrospectively at 1990.  I will be contributing to the 1991 Book of Estimates and my party will be opposing this grouping of Estimates because of our continued dissatisfaction with the state of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to these Supplementary Estimates I assure the Minister that while I have no objection to additional spending on Health one is forced to ask questions on the planning of the health spending which at this time of the year shows a shortfall of some £37.5 million.  This shortfall is in a very sensitive social spending area which is still experiencing the effects of previous drastic cutbacks.  The Minister chided the Opposition in his contribution when saying that the demands on the services almost indicated that they were not in operation at all.  The reality in the delivery of the service is that if one needs an urgent service or tries to contact a consultant or a hospital one is led to believe that the health services have ceased to operate.  We are unable to respond to the legitimate demands of people who are in need of urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the overall spending on Health which is still suffering from cutbacks, one notes that we still have closed wards, understaffed hospitals and long waiting lists for acute procedures, some of which have been identified by Deputy Yates, including cardiac procedures and hip replacements in all our orthopaedic hospitals.  There are long waiting lists and many people in pain. Consultants admit that they cannot fit these people onto an already overloaded <Col N="22" /> waiting list.  There are unusually long waiting lists up to six, seven or eight months, for ENT and many other surgical procedures.  These essential operations should be carried out as quickly as possible in the interests of the patients concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also referred to the services for the handicapped.  These have been the subject of representations made to us by the many organisations dealing with the handicapped.  Only last week I raised on the Adjournment the need for up to 2,000 places for adult handicapped people.  In spite of the provision of an additional £2 million in this year's Estimate, there is still a crying need for improvements in this area.  The Government will have to give serious consideration to the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for the services for old people to be improved.  People in my constituency, the south east and many other areas were privileged to have had access to sub-acute hospitals after acute treatment but because of a lack of sub-acute or district hospitals such patients are now being forced to live with their relatives who in many cases cannot look after them.  The State is unable to provide adequate geriatric accommodation or welfare home type accommodation for old people.  Major progress was made in this area in the past but this has now been stopped and old people are being forced to live with their families or go into private nursing homes which have not yet benefited from the provisions in the new Nursing Homes Bill.  Old age pensioners have to pay up to £60 or £70 per week for accommodation which should be provided for them by the State.  These people are entitled to this service under the 1970 Act.  Even though they have made contributions throughout their working life the Government still cannot meet the demand for this type of service.  We cannot rest on our laurels and say that major improvements have taken place in the services for the old and the handicapped if further improvements are needed in these areas.</P>
    <P>The problem of AIDs has not been <Col N="23" /> seriously addressed.  In spite of the Minister's efforts in this area there is still a perception in the minds of those dealing with AIDs patients that the £7 million which the Department let slip through their fingers could have been directed into this tragic area.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the lack of transport for people in rural Ireland who live far away from acute hospitals and who have to pay up to £25 for transport to a hospital or clinic.  These services were available to people up to 1987 but the new system of medical card allocation has resulted in many cards being withdrawn from people who were on the borderline.  Even people with serious illnesses, for example, those with major heart defects and people on kidney dialysis machines, have had their medical cards withdrawn from them. There seems to be a belief among health board officials that if a patient is on the borderline his medical card must be withdrawn from him because the system of payment to doctors under the GMS scheme has been changed.  There is a need for us to look at the new guidelines and re-evaluate the needs of patients before we create hardship for them.  We should also look at the freedom of chief executive officers to make a decision on hardship grounds.  People with serious illnesses who need special care and attention and continuous medication should be given special consideration, even to the extent of disregarding the income guidelines.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the extraordinary cost of drugs in the health service. Some improvements have been made in this area and the Minister has promoted &mdash; I was with him when he did this &mdash; a generic system of prescription.  Many companies in my constituency and elsewhere can produce adequate drugs, properly priced without profits being creamed off by manufacturers in the UK and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the additional cost for the influenza vaccine.  Is the Minister not aware that at present there is practically no influenza vaccine available for people in the south east?  According <Col N="24" /> to information given to me by doctors, neither the health boards, health board clinics, GPs nor chemists have this vaccine. If the flu vaccine is to be of any value to old people it should be made available to them at this time of the year. The Minister should address this issue as a matter of urgency.  I have been forced to put down a parliamentary question to the Minister asking him if he is aware of the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in the health service have also meant a diminution in the opportunities available for nurses.  The large-scale closure of hospitals created many redundancies in the nursing area and nurses were forced to emigrate to Iraq and elsewhere.  Up until recently the lives of those working in Kuwait were put at risk.  If the Government provided jobs at home for these nurses they would not have to emigrate to Iraq and other parts of the world to get work.  They should be able to find work in this country which needs better health care and hospital services.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity during the debate on the 1991 Estimate to consider how health funding can be better managed. We on this side of the House will highlight deficiencies in this area in a constructive way in the hope that by working together with the funds available or additional funds we will be able to improve the service given to people who have paid for it under the VHI scheme when they were working.  It is our duty to ensure that our health services cannot be criticised as they have been rightly criticised in the past.  There should be no question marks about this sensitive area of care.  I hope any efforts we make to remedy the needs we see in this area will be met by a proper response from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party will be opposing this Estimate because we believe the amount allocated is inadequate to meet the health needs of our people.  The structural and financial problems in our health service which led to such chaos in our hospitals last winter, and which were never really addressed, <Col N="25" /> are likely to be repeated if there is another outbreak of flu this winter.  The Minister said he had made good to the health boards the amount of excess expenditure involved.  There was no evidence at the most recent meeting of the Southern Health Board which I attended to suggest that that money had come into the coffers of the health board. There will be a shortfall of about £2.5 million in that health board this year.</P>
      <P>The only way in which the Government can address the problems in health policy and funding is to increase the level of funding to what it was in the early eighties. In 1983 health spending amounted to 7.61 per cent of gross national product and was gradually brought down to 7.1 per cent by 1986.  It fell to 6.6 per cent in 1987, to 6.24 per cent in 1988 and was reduced further in 1989.  Therein lies the problem.  In other OECD countries health funding accounts for 8 per cent of gross national product.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, there is a shortage of beds and staff in our acute hospitals.  The severance or redunancy package which was operated in 1987 left the health boards short of staff.  As a result, a reduced number of beds was available.  If we wish to increase the number of beds available in acute hospitals we will first have to increase the number of staff.  The embargo should be lifted straightaway and the only way to do this is to increase the funding available to the health boards to enable them to employ the nursing and general staff required.</P>
      <P>I would now like to deal with the area of mental handicap where one has to take account of the knowledge and experience of professional groups.  We have received a submission from a group of social workers representing the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Spastic Clinic, the Multiple Sclerosis Society and others, in which they state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are becoming increasingly aware of the discrepancy between the demand for and the availability of services to meet the growing number of young chronic, sick and disabled <Col N="26" /> people.  There are two groups about whom we are concerned.  One group consists of 110 people living at home and potentially at serious risk and the other group consists of only seven people whose families can no longer cope.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised that people with little babies who are mentally handicapped have been told within the past week by the Irish Wheelchair Association who provide them with a home help service that the number of hours they will be able to give them in 1991 will be greatly reduced because they cannot raise the money to provide the service and the health board are not in a position to provide the shortfall.  The recipients of this service, the caring relative, are afforded the opportunity of a daily or weekly break from the continuous demands in caring for handicapped persons at home &mdash; such demands include the washing, dressing, toileting, feeding and a wide variety of other tasks.  This little bit of relief being provided by a small number of social workers to so many families is also being withdrawn and this is very serious.</P>
    <P>In relation to the care of the elderly, the cruel face of monetarism is now being turned on the patient in need of full-time care and attention.  It now seems to be the policy to tell these people, having occupied a respite bed for a fortnight, they have to go home because they need the bed for some other patient.  I am aware of three people living in a small area who are in need of full-time care and attention.  It is clear that we are not adequately looking after our elderly who have many fears and experience trauma.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increased cost of running the GMS scheme.  There appears to be a determined policy to reduce the number of medical card holders, even though it will cost far more to run the scheme as a result.  Let me give one example.  Let us take the case of a husband and wife with three children with an income of £150 per week.  Under this scheme the maximum such a family are allowed earn is £144 &mdash; £108 for the husband and wife and £12 <Col N="27" /> for each of the children.  Therefore, this family find themselves £6 above the limit. Bearing in mind that out of this income the family have to pay £10 in rent and many other expenses, can this family afford to provide a medical service for themselves and their children?  The answer is no.  As a consequence, they will find themselves in a very serious position. I can assure the Minister that this is happening and ask him not to shake his head. Unless the Minister makes provision for tax and PRSI to be deductible in assessing eligibility for a medical card this will continue to be the case.  It is a disgrace that it cost more to run this scheme with a reduced number of people being provided for.  It is obvious that there is something radically wrong with the scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to dental treatment, time and again the Minister has outlined the amount available for orthodontic treatment but I would remind him at this point in time an umpteen number of patients are being turned away from local clinics as the people concerned are deemed ineligible under the guidelines laid down by the Department for orthodontic treatment. These guidelines, which were introduced many years ago, should now be withdrawn as they are completely out of date and many young children who are in need of such treatment are not receiving it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to both the Fox and Kennedy reports but I have not seen either.  Even though the Fox report dealt with the regional hospital in the Southern Health Board area I have not seen it. The Minister also stated that he would introduce a patients' charter of rights but we have seen no sign of this.  He also stated that he would put an appeals system in place to allow those, whose applications for full eligibility were disallowed, to appeal the decision but, again, there was no sign of this in the past year. I should also mention that the recommendations in the report of the commission on health funding have not been implemented.  We have now reached the stage where people do not know what lies in store for them if they get sick.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> There is an insufficient number of acute beds in our general hospitals while insufficient finance is being provided for hip replacement operations, for orthodontic treatment, for mentally handicapped services, for the care of the elderly and a whole range of other services, with the result that an inadequate service is being provided and this has to be rectified.  The only way to do this is to increase the amount of funding available for the health services.  The sum being provided is not adequate.</P>

      <P>It will not be possible in the space of two minutes to deal with all the issues raised but a number of trends run through this and other debates.  The first thing I should say is that I am not surprised Deputy Yates decided to run against his colleague, Deputy Bruton, for the leadership of the Fine Gael Party as their ideologies lie at both ends of the spectrum.  Deputy Bruton has spoken about the need to save and conserve money and the need not to spend money one does not have, while Deputy Yates has, week after week, come into the House and spoken about the need to spend not just £500,000 but £7 million, £8 million and £10 million on various services.  Therefore I am not surprised he opposed his colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all times I have said that I would negotiate with FICI and I am glad to say I have negotiated with them on two occasions very successfully &mdash; much more successfully than my predecessor in office.  Deputy Yates always seems to distort &mdash; Deputy Ferris was at this again this morning &mdash; the amount of money available under appropriations-in-aid. They alleged that £6 million of the amount available in 1989 was not spent. I should make it clear that every penny <Col N="29" /> voted by the Dáil for the health services in 1989 was spent by us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know at this stage &mdash; perhaps he is being mischievous &mdash; that we introduced an Estimate last year and every penny under the heading of appropriations-in-aid was spent.  This Estimate is for a sum £55 million greater, yet the Deputy has repeated the allegation today that there is money available which we could spend if we had a wish to do so.  I should make it clear that every penny that this House votes for the health services is spent.  I deplore the consultants who have told Deputy Ferris that an urgent medical service is not available to those who need it as such a service is available.  I have always admitted that there are waiting lists for certain procedures.  Indeed, I dealt with a number of them this morning, including the waiting lists for hip replacement and ear, nose and throat operations.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the question of the lack of opportunities for nurses.  The number of people working in the health service today is 2,000 greater than the number in 1989.  An extra £3 million has been provided for the dental service in the current year.  We have a substantial record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,500,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet increased expenditure on two subheads of my Department's Vote.  The two subheads are D.2 and M which cover expenditure on private housing grants and recoupment of expenditure incurred by local authorities on the operation of local motor taxation offices, respectively. The gross extra expenditure of £12.325 million is reduced by £6.825 million savings on other subheads giving a net additional requirement of £5.5 million. The savings arise on the mortgage subsidy scheme, on the grant to the Housing Finance Agency, on recoupment of certain malicious injury costs to local authorities and on the payment of the subsidy in respect of loan charges relating to capital loans raised by local authorities.</P>
    <P>An additional £11.59 million is required to meet liabilities for the payment of grants under the house improvement grants schemes which were terminated with effect from 27 March 1987.  Grant approvals under the 1985 house improvement grants scheme amounted to over £260 million.  By the end of this year, my Department will have paid out about £200 million in house improvement grants since 1985.  Applicants who had work approved for grant purposes prior to 27 March 1987 were given over three years to complete the work.  Final termination of the 1985 scheme took place on 31 May this year, by which date all grant-aided work had to be completed and written claims for payment submitted to my Department. The rush of applications for grant payments to beat the deadline, and my personal commitment to ensure that these grants were paid as speedily as possible, has made it necessary to increase the overall 1990 provision for home improvement grants from £13 million to just under £24.6 million.  These grants are paid from subhead D.2 of the Vote and the availability of savings on other housing grants, notably new house grants, has reduced the net additional requirement on the subhead to just over £10.3 million.</P>
    <P>As we are now in the final phase of the 1985 house improvement grants scheme <Col N="31" /> I think it is appropriate to give an overview of the scheme.  The 1985 house improvement grants scheme was introduced in November, 1985 and provided generous grants for repairs, extensions, provision of chimneys, water, sewerage and bathroom facilities.  However, even though the objectives of the scheme may have seemed to be desirable and valid at the time, one must express serious reservations about a scheme which provided such large handouts of taxpayers money for, often, non-essential work and to people who did not really need the grants.  What was required was an improvement grants scheme which was better targeted towards need and which would not cause a huge drain on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in terminating the 1985 house improvement grants scheme the Government recognised the worth of a number of well-targeted and cost-effective schemes and decided specifically to retain the disabled persons grant scheme, the essential repairs grant scheme and the special task force for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the vast sums of money which were pre-empted by the 1985 house improvement grants scheme severely restricted the resources which could be devoted to other necessary purposes across the entire housing area. Despite this, however, I am pleased that I was able to introduce earlier this year a modest, well-targeted, house improvement grants scheme, namely, the scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs.</P>
    <P>When the decision to terminate the main house improvement grant schemes was made in March 1987, every possible effort was made to ensure that nobody suffered hardship as a result of the decison. Each applicant who had an inspection before the termination date and had been found eligible under the scheme was issued with grant approval.  In the end, approved applicants had over three years after the termination of the scheme to complete the work and qualify for grants.</P>
    <P>Over 5,000 claims were received in my Department in the seven-month period <Col N="32" /> before the final closing date.  The additional funds for house improvement grants provided in this Supplementary Estimate will allow over 3,000 applicants to be paid in 1990 who would otherwise have to wait until 1991 for payment. Expenditure on the scheme in 1991 is expected to be minimal as only a small number of outstanding cases remain to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>£2 million of the Supplementary Estimate is required for local authority expenditure on running motor tax offices. Subhead M of my Department's 1990 Vote includes £8.53 million in respect of the recoupment to local authorities of the full cost of operating motor tax offices in their capacity as agents of the State in registering and taxing vehicles.  The additonal funds will enable all liabilities which mature for payment of this service in 1990 to be discharged in full.  The increased provision of £10.53 million for the administration costs of motor tax collection represents 7 per cent of estimated total motor tax revenue of £151 million this year.  I expect this percentage to fall over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the additional expenditure arises on wages and salaries, including overtime.  Staffing levels in motor tax offices had to be increased this year to cope with the increased volume of work, due largely to the introduction of the European Communities model driving licence in November, 1989.  The new driving licence incorporates a number of security features which substantially increased the processing time for each licence.  The workload will be reduced in 1991 when, because of the number of longer-term licences which have been issued, the volume of driver licensing applications will fall.</P>
    <P>The increased expenditure also reflects continuing progress on the reconstruction and improvement of motor tax offices and on increasing investment in information technology to improve the quality of service provided to motorists.</P>
    <P>Subhead M also covers expenditure on the maintenance of the computerised national vehicle file.  Significant progress has been made by my Department in <Col N="33" /> reducing the delays in updating the computerised file.  These delays were causing difficulties in relation to the enforcement of traffic law in cases where persons had sold their vehicles.  About 300,000 transactions were awaiting input to the national vehicle file at June 1990.  This has now been reduced to less than 30,000 and I expect that the backlog will be completely eliminated shortly.  The improved situation will assist in the enforcement of traffic law and the early production of statistics.  It will also enable the reintroduction of the final notice system for motorists who fail to renew their motor tax and thereby help to generate additional motor tax revenue.</P>
    <P>I announced on 26 October that I proposed to make regulations requiring all registration plates on vehicles registered on or after 1 January 1991 to incorporate the full Irish language name of the county or city of registration; the flag of the European Communities and the nationality symbol, IRL.</P>
    <P>The regulations have now been made. Owners of vehicles registered since 1 January 1987 have the option of using registration plates in the new format.  Vehicles registered on or after 1 January 1991, however, are required to carry the new registration plate.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the Supplementary Estimate. I will take note of any points raised and, in so far as it is possible, reply to them at the end of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's introductory remarks were more remarkable for what they did not contain than for <Col N="34" /> what they did.  While the Minister talked about and praised himself for what he describes as a modest, well-targeted house improvements grants scheme &mdash; mainly for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs &mdash; he did not seem to realise during the year there was need to provide additional funds to tackle the major housing crisis confronting every local authority. Whereas we have a Minister for thatched roofs we do not have a Minister for housing.  It seems to me that, during the course of this year &mdash; as we ambled through it with the Minister making complacent statements with regard to housing &mdash; the housing lists continued to grow enormously throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I estimate there are in the region of 25,000 people currently on local authority housing waiting lists.  It is my belief that a good portion of moneys that the Minister published in the Environment Estimate for 1990 as being available for the building of houses by local authorities in that year was not utilised.</P>
      <P>It will be very interesting to see the reply I receive to parliamentary questions I have tabled to the Minister today in relation to statistics of the number of houses built so far this year and the amount of money spent by local authorities on house building.  Our housing programme is a shambles.  It is about time the Minister took his mind off thatched roofs and devoted it to the more substantial problem of providing houses for the homeless, for young couples currently paying exorbitant rents in poor, private sector dwellings that place some people's lives at risk.  There is a major problem obtaining with regard to the standard of some of the private dwellings available for rental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have been more impressed with this Estimate had the Minister come to the House and said: yes, the money we allocated for housing last year has been spent; we have built all of the new houses we promised would be built &mdash; which I do not believe to be the case &mdash; and, due to the recognition of the need in this area, we are providing additional funds and want the sanction of the House <Col N="35" /> in so doing.  That does not exist.  There is no acknowledgement by the Minister in his introductory remarks of the problems of the homeless, of the housing crisis talked about by every local authority member in every political party throughout the country.  The Minister's own councillors on local authorities are condemning him for not tackling the problem. Yet the Minister himself does not seem to acknowledge that the problem exists.  Every voluntary body involved in the housing area has produced a plethora of reports during 1990 setting out the needs.  The Simon Community set out very recently again the needs with regard to the homeless for whom they specifically cater.  We are not meeting that need. The crisis obtaining has still not been properly acknowledged in this House.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is remarkable in not mentioning a particular item.  In the 1990 Estimate there was a sum of £500,000 allocated for the establishment and initial running costs of the Environment Protection Agency.  It came as no surprise to me to discover that money was not spent during 1990.  Had the Environment Agency Bill that Fine Gael had before this House this time last year received the support of Government, that agency would by now be up and running, undertaking the essential environmental work necessary, providing a greater degree of confidence in the area of environmental protection than is felt by the general public at present.  The agency is not up and running.  The Government having defeated the Fine Gael Bill in February 1990, the relevant Bill for the agency was published only last week.  I predict that Bill has little chance of becoming law until at least the autumn of next year.  In addition, I believe the £1 million allocated to the agency in the 1991 budget will not be taken up.  Indeed, because the Bill provides that the agency will not be formed or the provisions of the Bill become operative without Ministerial order, it is my belief there is no chance of seeing that agency up and running until at least 1992.  That creates a major <Col N="36" /> problem in the area of environmental protection.</P>
    <P>It is also a disappointment that neither the Minister nor his junior Minister, Deputy Harney, has acknowledged the need for an Oireachtas environment committee, something that Fine Gael and all the other Opposition parties supported this time last year in the context of the Fine Gael Bill.  There will be an essential political focal point and contact missing between the Environment Protection Agency the Government envisage establishing and this House.  There will be a lack of the connection necessary to ensure proposals for law reform, recommended by the Environment Protection Agency, are implemented, to ensure that essential administrative changes recommended by the Environment Protection Agency are taken on board.  There will also be a lack of supervision of the approach of Government Departments to essential matters in the environment area.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister referred to the new European driving licence and the motor tax position.  He did not refer to the appalling failure of this Government to ensure that there are adequate funds available to employ driving testers to allow people obtain their full driving licences.  There are people throughout the country, some waiting between 12 to 16 months, to undertake driving tests. It is almost impossible to undertake a driving test in Dublin under six months from date of application.  If one manages to do so within six months, one is extremely lucky.  The Minister needs to tackle that problem.  The Minister has made speeches about it, and for the past 12 months I have been reading press releases about the new initiatives the Minister is taking to tackle that problem. They are not yet working.  We do not know why they are not working beyond the fact that they appear to be the stuff of rhetoric as opposed to the stuff of action.  I am asking the Minister to tackle that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question of the <Col N="37" /> Minister recently with regard to section 10 of the 1988 Housing Act, asking him the amount of money allocated to local authorities to deal with the homeless which remained unspent.  The Minister told me that, out of £600,000 allocated, only £75,000 had been spent.  I also asked the Minister to arrange that this money be transferred and dealt with under section 5 of the Housing Act by way of a management grants scheme.  What is needed is a decision on the part of the Minister that voluntary organisations such as the Simon Community and others who are providing special housing needs cannot be expected to fund management and staff costs in settling the homeless and handicapped persons from charity funding.  Most of the unspent funds have been transferred by ministerial decision to allow for the recoupment of such grants paid by local authorities under section 5 of the Housing Act.  The relevant section allows for the payment of management and capital assistance towards the cost of providing dwellings currently limited to £20,000 per dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been difficult to persuade the Minister to actually tackle these issues. Always they appear to be under review. It is too late in the current year but I would ask the Minister to make the necessary arrangements in the ensuing year.  It should be possible, with consultation, to arrive at controlled and effective use of the limited resources available to meet housing management costs and a number of other strategically planned social needs, especially with regard to sheltered housing.  At present Dublin Corporation are unable to pay such grants to approved bodies, such as the Simon Community for the Usher's Island projects and the Focus Housing Association, the new sheltered housing project at Stanhope Street.  That is because the Department of the Environment will not recoup the requisite grant amounts under section 5.  In other words, it is still expected that the management costs of such services for the most disadvantaged homeless be met from charity funding.  I am asking the <Col N="38" /> Minister today to put an end to that practice, to allow moneys remaining unspent under section 10 of the Housing Act to be transferred by way of management schemes, allowing voluntary bodies to manage their organisations under the provisions of section 10 of the Housing Act.</P>

      <P>I do not want to have to interrupt Deputy Howlin, or indeed any other Deputy, so at this stage I take the half minute to remind the House that Standing Orders require that we apply ourselves to what is in the Estimate as far as possible.  The Deputy may use his ingenuity to skirt that but he should not advertise the fact that he is out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that warning was not directed personally to me at all. I have ten minutes to address the Supplementary Estimate on the Environment, an Estimate of some £5.5 million.  These moneys are to be spent in two ways, partly in the housing area and partly on motor taxation.  I want to be entirely in order by focusing, in the few minutes available to me, exclusively on the housing area.  There is no other area of responsibility of this Department more acute, more in need of funding, more the focus of a clamour around the country that seems to have escaped the attention and ears of the Minister in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a county which on a monthly basis at least debates the crisis of housing.  If those of us who are members of local authorities consider what is our prime responsibility &mdash; and I put it to the Minister it would be his prime responsibility &mdash; to boil it down to one single issue, it would be to provide shelter for those with none.  If the Minister was to have a real title it would be Minister for shelter, and that is a title the Minister has, unfortunately, failed to live up to and earn.  In the past number of years since this Minister took office we have seen a virtual abandoning of the public housing programme with 90 per cent of it slashed and in urban centres and counties up and down the country virtually no <Col N="39" /> new houses are being built.  Parallel to that, we have seen the introduction of a scheme that on the face of it was very welcome, to sell off the existing council stock.</P>
    <P>In good times that is an excellent proposition, to allow people who have lived and paid rent in a local authority house for a number of years to have an opportunity to own their own house.  That is fundamental in the Irish psyche, the Irish character, and probably it goes back to the lack of security of tenure that we want to own our own houses.  However, the dreadful consequences of both these events happening in parallel is that we have a diminishing housing stock available for letting to suitable tenants.  Furthermore, the quality of the stock that has remained in the ownership of local authorities has diminished substantially. Therefore, we have virtually no new houses being built and the quality and fabric of those houses we own has disintegrated.</P>
    <P>The issue of homelessness has been touched upon.  We have seen homelessness now becoming a feature of Irish life.  Few of us would have imagined a few short years ago that that would be a fact.  The national campaign for the homeless now estimate that 5,000 people are without shelter.  That is scandalous. We are fast approaching the UK situation where you do not provide social housing and you are met with a crisis that you must address, and very shortly we will have to address it in the way that even the Thatcherite Government across the way had to face it and provide totally unsuitable accommodation such as bed and breakfast or rented private accommodation for those families and elderly who have no other option.</P>
    <P>I want to be specific with the Minister. In my county, Wexford, this year 17 houses will be built.  That is for the county council area of Wexford.  It is the smallest number of houses built in County Wexford for 20 years.  At the same time, the assessment of the housing needs was carried out.  The latest number for the last assessment in 1989 was 543 people on a <Col N="40" /> waiting list.  Since that survey was completed in 1989 a further 214 applications have come in.  County Wexford has a grand total of 662 families and individuals in need of housing, who are approved for housing but who have no prospect of same, and that does not include the urban areas.  It does not include the corporation area of Wexford.  It does not include New Ross and Enniscorthy District Council areas.  I know when dealing with general figures we sometimes bamboozle ourselves in this House.  A sum of £5.5 million in a Supplementary Estimate sounds like a great deal of money and in individual terms it is, and we can talk about millions flowing here and there, but behind those figures of 662 people for the county of Wexford lie a number of individual tragedies.  I do not have to rack my brain long and hard to find the individual cases to put before the Minister. I will give three brief cases.</P>
    <P>I had a phone call this week from neighbours of a man living rough in rural New Ross, living in the ditches, eating cold meats he can buy.  He has no shelter whatsoever.  I have been prevailing on the local authority to provide him with a mobile home and they are endeavouring to find a site for that now, but there is no prospect of a house.  They simply do not have one that is empty.  In Wexford town we are still working off our 1987 priority list that has not been exhausted yet.  We have done no priority listing since 1987. Therefore, if you are one of the hundreds of people who have sought accommodation since 1987 it is tough luck.</P>
    <P>There are three different categories in the housing sphere.  There are families desperate to start off life with a roof over their head.  There are the elderly, in many ways the saddest.  People come to my office &mdash; as I am sure they come to every Deputy's office &mdash; reading the obituary list to see who is dead and if they have notched up a place on the priority list for non-family old folk accommodation.  A third category, mentioned by Shelter and the campaign for the homeless is anybody under 60, single younger people who are homeless.  In Wexford &mdash; I suppose it is the same elsewhere &mdash; they go on a third <Col N="41" /> category list known locally as the limbo list or the no hope list because they will never be a priority.  If the Minister were to address himself to that he would really be addressing the issue for which he has fundamental responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech made a comment in relation to the thatching grant. A pilot scheme has been initiated by Wexford County Council in an attempt to preserve our heritage in housing, and for small money it has proved a great success.  It is important that we maintain some of the architectural heritage of our country, and I applaud the Minister for taking that on board.  I think the derision it has caused on this side of the House is not a comment on the merits of the scheme itself but on the fact that it would be seen to be the thrust of what the Minister wants to do in relation to housing instead of addressing the core problem I have tried to highlight in the last minute or two.</P>
    <P>In no way am I suggesting that the problems we experience in the constituency I represent are in any way unique.  They are not.  Up and down the country the same problems and situation can be found readily.  My local paper highlighted the case of a woman who is in a grotty, miserable flat without electricity or source of heat or light.  We still have not been able to give her priority in regard to accommodation.  Yesterday a man came to my office seeking accommodation. He is going from relative to relative and because he has no fixed abode we cannot even assess him to determine exactly where he is so that we can make an assessment of his housing needs.  People are in despair; those of us who are members of local authorities are also in despair because we have nothing but the hard and sad word to give to people seeking accommodation.</P>
    <P>With his attack on the funding of local authorities in the last number of years the Minister has reduced local authorities themselves from being agents of development, catalysts in the community for good, to rubber stamps for decisions made centrally, a position I regard as <Col N="42" /> fundamentally anti-democratic and against the tide of current history.</P>

      <P>Since the bulk of the Supplementary Estimate deals with housing, I intend to confine myself to the housing element.  Since I came into this House 18 months ago, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I have repeatedly raised the matter of the housing crisis.  My very first speech in this House concerned that problem.  This is a crisis which has a number of dimensions.  There are 20,000 families on local authority waiting lists and thousands more who cannot get on the waiting lists because their income is deemed to be too high, being more than £10,000 per annum.  There are young families who cannot afford to buy a home of their own because of the increased cost of housing.</P>
      <P>There is massive exploitation in the private sector where people are paying very high rents for very poor accommodation.  There is the failure of the 1988 Housing Act to deal effectively with the problem of homelessness which has been documented by organisations like the Simon Community and, more recently, today's report by Threshold.  In addition there is the poor condition of the existing housing stock as shown up in the recent survey of housing conditions carried out by the Minister's Department.  It shows that in local authority after local authority there are houses in the private and public sector which are not fit for human habitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are the problems but, unfortunately, we are not getting any answers from the Minister or the Government. Last year we were told that 1,200 houses would be built by local authorities.  I <Col N="43" /> know, for example, that in the local authorities on which I serve none of those houses has yet been built.  We are still waiting for sanction to build two small schemes in the Dún Laoghaire Corporation district.  It is held up in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1991 just published do not offer any relief either, only a marginal increase in the allocation for local authority house building.  That allocation is now only one-fifth of what it was in the early eighties and house building is only one-sixth of what it was in the early eighties when more than 7,000 houses were being built per annum by local authorities.</P>
    <P>It seems that the biggest problem we have in regard to housing is the Minister. We have a Minister who will not acknowledge that there is a housing crisis. Repeatedly he has stated in public his belief that there is not a housing crisis. Repeatedly he has defended, both in the House and outside, the abysmally inadequate allocation for house building and house purchase to local authorities.  He has simply closed his eyes to the plight of the homeless in our community and to the plight of the families waiting for housing. At the rate he is providing money it will take the best part of 20 years to clear the existing housing lists.  Every Member knows the extent of the problem.  Every Member has come across young families living in overcrowded conditions, suffering extreme marital strain and living in unsanitary conditions.  That is causing a lot of hardship to young families. However, the Minister for the Environment whom we turn to, and whom we expect to argue the case for these families, has not done so.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago I raised this issue during an Adjournment debate.  I said then that if we did not see a significant increase in the allocation for housing in the 1991 Estimates the Minister should consider his position.  If he is not prepared to acknowledge the extent of the housing crisis he should do the honourable thing and pass on the Department of the Environment, or certainly the housing section <Col N="44" /> of it, to somebody who is prepared to treat it with a greater degree of urgency. The Minister has ignored the problem. He has ignored the plight of the homeless. The housing crisis we are facing has the greatest potential for social upheaval that we have seen for a very long time.</P>
    <P>How much longer does the Minister expect the many young families on housing waiting lists, and who are living in appalling conditions, will continue to tolerate those conditions and not express their views in some way or another?  I say that advisedly.  We have seen no relief for the homeless or an easing of the housing crisis in either the Supplementary Estimate that has been presented or in the 1991 Book of Estimates circulated last week.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Government to appoint a different Minister with responsibility for housing who will take this problem a bit more seriously.  The Minister for the Environment is presiding over the worst housing problem this State has faced in at least three decades.  He does not acknowledge that there is a problem.  The very least I would have expected from the Minister today, or at some time in the past, was a glimmer of an acknowledgment that there was a problem to be addressed.  If he gave such an acknowledgment he would have the support of those of us on this side of the House who have been trying to persuade him to deal with the problem urgently.</P>
    <P>Each local authority has schemes before the Minister awaiting approval. They want to get on with new housing schemes and with providing houses for the people who are on their lists.  Local authorities are frustrated because the resources, and the back-up, have not been provided.  Even the limited amount of house building which was provided for under last year's Estimates is being frustrated by the bureaucracy the Minister's Department expect local authorities to engage in.  I recall the Minister assuring me that schemes with less than 12 houses would not require the specific sanction of his Department before they go ahead.  I know of schemes that are still awaiting the sanction of the Minister's <Col N="45" /> Department.  Even the limited amount of house building provided for under last year's Estimates has slowed down and is being dragged out in a very penny-pinching manner by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister did refer in his contribution to the need for a better approach to the problem of house repairs and improvements.  The results of the survey, which have been circulated to local authorities dealing with the conditions of existing housing stock, show that there are many houses in the public and private sectors which are in a serious state of disrepair and require immediate attention by the Minister.  I would therefore, welcome from the Minister a more extensive form of home improvement grant than that confined to thatched houses.  A more urgent approach is required to deal with the serious housing problem we have.  The time for the Minister to start is now in the season when we are celebrating the most famous homeless family in the history of humankind. There will be many living in cribs here this Christmas, young families who are, effectively, homeless and living in appalling conditions either with in-laws or in private rented accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat, and lest the Minister be tempted in any way, it is appropriate that I would read now the Standing Order which governs Supplementary Estimates. It is Standing Order 128 and it states that in the discussion of a Supplementary Estimate the debate shall be confined to the items constituting same and no discussion may be raised on the original Estimates save in so far as it may be necessary to explain or illustrate the particular items under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been more useful if the Chair had made that announcement a little earlier so that Deputies could have confined themselves to the items covered by the Supplementary Estimate.  I am happy to deal with the matters raised but, unfortunately, they must be left until the main Estimate debate.  I am prevented under Standing Order 128 from dealing with <Col N="46" /> them now.  Far be it for me to run away from anything.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter raised the question of driving tests.  I announced in September that an extra 39 testers would be recruited and 32 of those are now operational.  The rest will come onstream shortly.  We also have contracts with another 11 testers. The backlog fell in November by 1,000 and we expect it to continue to fall.  As far as driving test applications are concerned we hope to reach the stage where it can be regarded as being reasonable next September.</P>
      <P>As regards Environment Protection Agency money, £1 million is available in next year's Estimate to deal with that. That can be dealt with under the general Vote.  I am pleased that Deputy Howlin referred to the success of the tenant purchase scheme.  It was a good scheme.  I know he supports the idea of having as many owner-occupiers as possible.  We have a very good record in that area.  I was at a meeting of housing Ministers recently and I noted we have the best record in Europe in that regard with over 80 per cent of owner-occupied houses. There is a great tradition of people owning their own homes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore offered support for the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant.  If we did not have the drain of the house improvement scheme we might have been able to do a lot more. We are still paying for that 1985 scheme. About £200 million has already been paid.  That was a lot of money.  Hopefully, at the beginning of the year we will be able to put that scheme to rest.  It is interesting to note that the £200 million was used to finance improvements to 100,000 houses.  It was a massive scale investment and the benefits will be seen for years to come.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore started on his usual line about a housing crisis.  I acknowledge that there are housing problems.  I have always admitted that but it does not amount to a housing crisis.  The facts clarify the position.  This year we built 20,000 new houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates 1990. - Vote 26: Office of the Minister for Education.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education, for certain services administered by that office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now seeking the approval of the <Col N="49" /> House for four Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to gross expenditures for the four Education Votes is that we anticipate having an overall overrun of £4.909 million.  This amounts to only 0.36 per cent and in the overall context of a gross expenditure of almost £1,372 million represents in my view extremely good management.</P>
    <P>The overrun of £4.909 million is the result of savings of £7.365 million on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education and of £1.215 million on the Vote for Second Level and Further Education, offset by deficits of £204,000 on the vote for First Level Education and £13.285 million on the Vote for Third-Level and Further Education.</P>
    <P>The arrangements prescribed by the Department of Finance in relation to ESF aid require that provision be made in the relevant votes for the full cost of ESF-aided programmes and the resultant aid be brought to account as Appropriations-in-Aid. Consequently, the full amount provided for in the Votes may be spent only when and if the ESF aid has been received.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Vote for Second Level and Further Education envisaged receipts from the ESF of £50.622 million. Receipts to date amount to £21.422 million.  It is expected that a further amount of £13.682 million will be received before the end of the year. However, it is not certain that this will in fact be received before the end of the year, and if received it is likely to be received late in December and too late to allow for the processing of the payments which must be made from the Votes before then.  This is a balancing mechanism pending receipt of the money which is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate now sought for the Vote for Second-level and Further Education will provide Exchequer funding to meet payments which the approved Estimates envisaged would be funded from Appropriations-in-Aid. If the Appropriations-in-Aid are in fact received before the end of the year, they will reduce the actual charge <Col N="50" /> on the Exchequer and the additional money voted will be returned as savings. Some of the expected shortfall of £15.498 million may be received in 1991 and have the effect of reducing the charge on the Exchequer in that year.</P>
    <P>The four Supplementary Estimates amount to £38.582 million and comprise: a token £1,000 for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education; £0.442 million for the Vote for First Level Education; £28.439 million for the Vote for second level and further education; and a Supplementary Estimate for £9.7 million for the Vote for third level and further education.</P>
    <P>A token Supplementary Estimate of £1,000 is sought for this Vote.  This is required to make available a grant-in-aid of £670,000 to Dublin Zoo in 1990.  This will put the zoo in a satisfactory financial position pending consideration of the report of the committee established by the Government.  This additional expenditure from subhead B.15, the grant-in-aid fund for general expenses of cultural, scientific, and educational organisations, is offset by savings on other subheads of the Vote.  On subhead A.6, savings of £0.118 million arise on consultancy services due to delays in commencement of some projects.  Consultancy services are not always as they appear &mdash; that is the terminology used.  I do not, nor do I intend to, engage in public relations consultancies of any kind, that is consultancies with regard to various measures of computerisation, reports with regard to unit cost studies and matters of that nature.</P>
    <P>On subhead B.9, grants amounting to £0.551 million under the grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities will not be paid this year as certain projects have not progresed to the stage where the grants are payable.  I want to assure the House and particularly Deputy Deenihan, that grants will be paid as soon as these projects reach the stages when they become eligible for grant payments. As regards the recreational grants scheme and the money from the national lottery for national and regional sports <Col N="51" /> centres, my colleague, who is on Government business today and is unable to be here, gave the assurance at oral Question Time two weeks ago and I reiterate it here today, that the moneys as needed from the lottery will be drawn down as the national and regional sports centres come on course.  The reason for the delay with the national sports centres has been well documented at oral Question Time. The regional sports centres are on target with their various plans.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.1 million is sought for special services for children in care &mdash; subhead H. Gross expenditure will be greater than expected and contributions from the health boards and local authorities will be less than expected.  An extra £600,000 will be needed for staff costs, particularly the cost of relief staff and overtime.  Repairs to buildings, furniture and equipment and increased compensation claims, will cost a further £250,000.  An extra £250,000 is needed for capital expenditure to provide for final payments in respect of the major project in St. Joseph's, Clonmel which had been expected to be paid in 1991 &mdash; good weather led to the work being concluded earlier &mdash; and the refurbishing of the Oberstown Centre, the girls' remand and assessment centre.</P>
    <P>A further sum of £486,000 is sought for the superannuation of national school teachers &mdash; subhead J.  The cost of building, equipment and furnishing of national schools will be £500,000 greater than expected.  Provision has to be made &mdash; I was glad to be able to do so &mdash; for classrooms and necessary furniture in a number of schools in major urban areas and for new accommodation and a security system for the central model school in Marlborough Street following a fire.</P>
    <P>These additional provisions are largely offset by savings in other subheads of the Vote.  Due to fluctuations in teaching numbers during the summer there will be savings of £1.379 million on the provision for the salaries of national school teachers &mdash; subhead A.  Due to demographic changes, the cost of the capitation grant <Col N="52" /> scheme in 1990 was less than the estimated cost by £103,000.  There will be a surplus of £162,000 in miscellaneous appropriations-in-aid related to refunds of salaries of teachers.</P>
    <P>The provision for salaries of teachers in comprehensive and community schools has proved inadequate for two reasons. A greater number of new schools came on stream than had been anticipated.  The additional cost of implementing the new terms and conditions of certain part-time teachers was underestimated.  A sum of £1.35 million is being provided for this purpose in subhead E.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.2 million under subhead M is being provided for a number of projects in the post-primary school building programme which are currently in various stages of construction.  There was an under-estimate for miscellaneous &mdash; subhead L &mdash; and an additional amount to meet payments including a grant to the National Parents Council is now being provided.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the position in relation to ESF aid.  For technical drafting reasons, the Supplementary Estimate for the Vote assumes that no further ESF aid will be received before the end of the year and, consequently, provision is made for a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid of £28.438 million.  There are offsetting savings on other subheads of the Vote which are due to over-estimations on salaries and allowances of secondary teachers and grants to vocational education committees.  Payments to local authorities in respect of the superannuation of VEC staff will be £600,000 less than expected due to overestimation.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate is now required for the Vote for third level and further education to allow for the payment of an additional capital sum of £9.7 million to the Higher Education Authority under subhead I.1.  This is to provide a grant-in-aid to supplement funding from private sources to allow for the purchase by UCD of the buildings and part of the land of the former Carysfort College and to adapt and equip it for use as a commerce and business education <Col N="53" /> facility.  This purchase by UCD will facilitate the intake of a substantial number of additional under-graduate students per annum on a range of courses, especially the commerce and computer studies disciplines.  I understand that private funding will amount to approximately £2 million.  We have received £1.75 million from the religious authorities which has gone into the general treasury fund. Deputy Gilmore received an answer on this matter recently in reply to a Dáil question.  That can be taken as an overall perspective of what is happening to Carysfort College.  Indeed, other matters will perhaps bear fruit in the months ahead with regard to arrangements for Carysfort College.</P>
    <P>I am happy to confirm to the House that it is the Government's intention that Carysfort College will remain in full use as a valuable educational resource.  I would like to express my personal satisfaction at what is a reasonably happy outcome to what was a long and contentious matter.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to provide £9.7 million towards the purchase of Carysfort College for use as a graduate business centre.  I understand this centre will serve not only as a business school but it is expected that final year commerce students in UCD will be accommodated there also.  This will provide much needed space for students, which I welcome.  I would like to refer to a speech I made in the House last week about over-crowding in colleges. I said that buildings in most of our third level institutions are crammed to capacity.  In Trinity College, UCD, UCC, Maynooth, UCG and our regional colleges, there is serious concern that over-crowding of lecture theatres, canteens, classhalls and laboratories constitutes a serious safety risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of academic research is also suffering.  There is a major shortage of technicians and laboratory staff to back up academic research initiatives. Many routine academic tasks have to be <Col N="54" /> postponed and, in some cases, abandoned due to the cutbacks.  Basic research in Ireland is grossly underfunded. This will affect not only the quality of teaching but also the future competitiveness of Irish industry.  As a result we will fall further behind.</P>
    <P>The libraries in many of our third level institutions are grossly underfunded and understaffed and have been forced to reduce holdings due to lack of space and to have shorter opening hours due to lack of personnel, which is a major disadvantage to many students who do not have alternative study facilities.  In this environment increased student numbers have come into the regional technical colleges and universities.  The Minister has made a commitment to provide further places, which is welcome.  However, unless proper funding is provided study places in the libraries will become even more crowded, lecture halls will overflow and there will be longer queues at canteens, for books at the libraries and at computer terminals.  I am sure this move will help to alleviate some of the over-crowding at UCD, but I should like the Minister to indicate the number of extra places she hopes will be made available by this move.  Will she also guarantee that this will not be an élitist institution?  It amazes me that Carysfort College had not been already purchased by the State for use as an RTC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is rather strange that there were savings in second level education at a time when second level schools are packed to capacity.  I should like to refer to the ASTI survey of 578 schools in May 1990.  It showed that of the schools which have prefabricated buildings, 80 per cent have had them for four years or more; 26 have had them for ten years or more and 42 have had them for 16 years or more. With regard to funding, 55 per cent of schools indicated that parents were asked for a voluntary contribution towards the running costs of the school; 56 per cent of schools have regular fund-raising activities for the running of schools.  With regard to facilities, 20 per cent of the schools did not have a library and only 11 per cent of schools had a librarian; 28 per cent of schools did not have a gymnasium or PE facilities, 31 per cent did not have economics facilities and only 515 schools had a qualified remedial teacher. This is all happening in our second level schools at a time when the Minister made savings, a fact which she emphasised today.  Instead of making savings in this regard, we should be spending more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out the pupil-teacher ratio in second level schools is now the highest in Europe at 20 to 1.  In Italy the pupil-teacher ratio is 10 to 1; in the UK it is 13 to 1.  On average, in Ireland, there are 30 students in most classes in second level education and this overcrowding puts tremendous pressure on teachers and students because teachers just cannot give the individual attention needed in many cases. <Col N="56" /> I call on the Minister to seriously consider the provision of a six year cycle in second level education in all our schools. At present Irish students spend less time in second level schools than most of their European counterparts.  For example, the time spent in secondary schools in Germany is nine years and the average in the rest of Europe is six years.  If a six year cycle is not made available in all schools, our students will suffer a distinct disadvantage compared to their European counterparts.  I know it was not mentioned in the Estimate but it is a point worth making.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contribution to the refurbishment of Oberstown Centre for Girls Remand and Assessment. However, as the Minister has responsibility for juvenile offenders under 15 years of age, I should like to specifically refer to the matter in view of the Supplementary Estimate.  I am very concerned about the recent happenings in our prison system and the way young offenders are treated by it.  The system is in a shambles and it is immoral to commit teenagers to prison, where they are tagged as criminals.  Certainly some of these teenagers need to be placed in a secure unit but the approach must be therapeutic rather than punishment.  The aim must be rehabilitation, not incarceration. Most of these young people are already socially deprived and need a firm but supportive atmosphere to rehabilitate them so that they can take their place in society.</P>
    <P>Our remand system for young offenders needs an immediate review and indications are that we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.  We are beginning to experience the fall-out of many years of social deprivation and chronic unemployment. We need a number of small units for unruly teenagers who are in conflict with the law but these units should be located in a regional context. I urge the Minister to look again at the system of care for young offenders, which needs to be improved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation for Dublin Zoo, which is very important.  However, <Col N="57" /> we will have to decide whether we want a zoo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to refer to the Third Level and Further Education Supplementary Estimate.  Inasmuch as the purchase of Carysfort College would provide extra third level places it is welcome as it is fundamental to all Labour Party policy that there should be access to education.  Obviously, if more places are provided they will help to further this ideal.</P>
      <P>The Estimate before us includes the provision of £9.7 million to enable UCD to purchase, adapt and equip Carysfort College in order to use it as a college of graduate business studies.  This is a most mysterious allocation and one for which I can only find one rational explanation because the facts are as follows: Carysfort College has been on the market for many months and is the subject of a number of planning restrictions, to such an extent that its market value, from the point of view of development, is very little.  It is certainly not worth the £7 million which I am informed it will cost any developer. The only potential purchaser who could be found for the college is another educational establishment.  There is no educational establishment in Ireland with the funding available to enable it to pay £9.7 million to purchase the college, to adapt and equip it, when the property is worth considerably less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in regard to UCD, on the <Col N="58" /> other hand, is that the governing body of the university have made no decision to purchase Carysfort.  The matter of purchasing Carysfort, or the resiting of part of the commerce faculty to Carysfort, has never been discussed.  There is a strong feeling in the college that it would not make educational sense to break up the faculty and that the college should consolidate as far as possible in Belfield.</P>
    <P>Why are UCD being force-fed with £7 million to buy a property which they neither want nor need and which in any event is worth considerably less than £7 million?  There is only one possible explanation.  This is yet another example of Fianna Fáil moving covertly to help a property speculator who has bitten off more than he can chew.  In the best of all possible worlds it might be argued that the property at Carysfort might be kept and stored for educational use at some time in the future, but it is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money to spend it buying Carysfort now, with no independent valuation and no clear proposal for its use other than the one being foisted on UCD by the Government.  This is particularly scandalous at a time when education provision is so underfunded generally.  In the light of the recent review on primary education which highlighted a crying need for extra teachers and resources at that level, it makes a nonsense of any approach to education policy to divert money to entirely spurious purposes.</P>
    <P>The business of third level education as far as my party are concerned relates to equality of access.  A sum of £9.7 million is being flogged here.  The college do not want it.  What a great difference that money would make if it were used to improve student grants for third level education.  On many occasions in the House I put it to the Minister that the income limit of parents of third level students should be based on net rather than gross income.  This £9.7 million would make a great difference here and would provide places in third level education for many students who are either disadvantaged because of their <Col N="59" /> socio-economic position or their geographical position.</P>
    <P>The money could be used at first level in regard to which the recent report of the review body has come out strongly and showed what needs to be done at first level.  The whole business of early retirement needs to be considered. Teachers today are subject to great stress in the classroom and many of them are burned out well in advance of the statutory retiring age.  Teachers at second level must have 40 years service to retire and teachers at first level must have 35 years service.  This is too long a career for teachers in the present milieu because there is not an effective system to implement discipline in our schools.  This problem tends to worsen as time goes on. Apart from early retirement, there is a need to bring in an effective discipline system to our schools in the interests of all.</P>
    <P>I have been puzzled about the Supplementary Estimates.  We had a Supplementary Estimate for third level a fortnight ago.  The problem again was the substantial shortfall in ESF moneys.  We have a second level Supplementary Estimate today which relates to a shortfall at second level.  What is happening here? Last year there was one Supplementary Estimate before Christmas which related to school transport.  Looking back at the Estimates, a sum of £7 million came in as ESF money after 1 January.  Why the huge shortfall this year?  Are we not getting our returns?  Is there a problem in Europe?  Is there some problem regarding the provision of ESF moneys for us?</P>
    <P>If money is being provided from the Exchequer to make good moneys that have not yet arrived from Europe there must be some cost to the Government and the Exchequer in terms of borrowings which may accrue.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.  Is it costing the taxpayer money and why is the money from Europe not materialising?</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Deenihan, I welcome the money provided for Dublin Zoo.  The zoo needs to be expanded.  They need more space but I welcome the money which will <Col N="60" /> help the zoo to get over a very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>I would reiterate my deep concern regarding the proposal in this Estimate to purchase Carysfort College at such an exorbitant price.  The principle of providing extra college places is welcome but it is absolutely incredible that this project could have been proceeded with when it has never been discussed at UCD level. This is something that is absolutely mind-boggling and all the facts demonstate that the value of that building is a great deal less than the purchase price being presented here.</P>
    <P>The £2 million from a private source is welcome.  Any money that can be put into education is welcome.  Indeed, the £1.75 million which was retrieved from the religious authorities is also to be welcomed. At the end of the day, on the basis of the proposal to purchase, adapt and equip Carysfort College, unless there are explanations that we have not got, my party will oppose this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one question to put to the Minister regarding the zoo. When does the Minister intend to publish the report of the committee which was established by the Government to look into the zoo?  Will the Minister give a straight answer to that when she is replying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confine the remainder of my remarks to the Supplementary Estimate for third level education which is to provide almost £10 million for the repurchasing of Carysfort College and part of the grounds.  I welcome the fact that the State is purchasing Carysfort, that it is to be used by UCD as an education facility. I have always expressed the view that Carysfort should be retained in education and I am glad to see that this is being done.  I have a number of questions about the kind of education for which it is to be retained: to whom will it be available, what will be the degree of access to it and will there be exorbitant fees?  These questions should be clarified because it is important that Carysfort continues to be a facility open to the general public and <Col N="61" /> not confined to one sector of society based on finance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the knock-on effect that the repurchasing of Carysfort will have in terms of releasing additional space in UCD because, as Deputy Deenihan said, we are all aware of the extent of over-crowding in third level colleges. However, the repurchasing of Carysfort raises a number of questions which the Minister should address when replying. We are being asked to approve the payment of almost £10 million of taxpayers' money to re-purchase a facility which was built and provided in the first place by taxpayers' money and which was sold only 18 months ago by the Sisters of Mercy in what now must be regarded as the sale of the century.  That gives rise to a number of questions.  First, why did not the Minister take the opportunity when Carysfort came on the market 18 months ago to buy the whole lot?  It was then on offer for £20 million.  She scoffed at the idea when I suggested in the House that the State should avail of the opportunity to purchase the entire Carysfort College and grounds.  Had that opportunity been availed of, the State would have got better value for money than what it is now getting for £10 million and the local people would have been saved the agony of seeing what was a fine facility being destroyed by a major unwanted housing development.</P>
    <P>The second question the Supplementary Estimate gives rise to is why the State did not secure its original investment in Carysfort?  In reply to a Dáil Question to me some time ago the Minister confirmed that as early as 1977, when the State committed over £2 million to extensions and the provision of facilities in Carysfort, her Department wrote to the Sisters of Mercy asking them to conclude a legal agreement under which Carysfort would have to continue in education or, in the event of its ceasing to be an educational facility, would return to the State.  Twelve years later when Carysfort was eventually sold that legal agreement was not concluded.  What was her Department doing in those 12 years that they did not secure the investment <Col N="62" /> which was made with taxpayers' money in Carysfort in the late seventies?</P>
    <P>We are now in the absurd position where the State has to come back &mdash; 12 years later &mdash; and spend another £10 million to buy a facility which was provided with taxpayers' money in the first place.  We are entitled to an answer to that question.  I know the Minister succeeded in getting back £1.75 million of the money originally invested but £1.75 million is a long way from the £10 million we are now being asked to re-commit to the repurchase of Carysfort.</P>
    <P>Why did the Department of Education, in the knowledge that a decision was made to close Carysfort as a college of education in 1986, not conclude that legal agreement with the Sisters of Mercy?  Why did her Department allow a situation to arise whereby the Sisters of Mercy were literally able to rip off that facility and sell it to the highest bidder 18 months ago?  There is a fine distinction between legality and morality. It was certainly legal, as no legal agreement was concluded, for the Sisters of Mercy to conclude that sale but there are very serious questions to be raised about the morality of putting for sale and selling on the public market a facility which was provided by the public.</P>
    <P>While we are on the subject of morality I would also like to ask the Minister a question which relates to this issue.  A number of weeks ago, I drew to the Minister's attention the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which showed that £800,000 of public money which had been given to Carysfort in the form of education grants, over a number of years, literally had gone missing and that in addition her Department, from as far back as 1984, had not sought or obtained audited accounts from Carysfort College.  There are two questions that must be answered here.</P>

      <P>There are questions to be put to the Minister.  First, what is the <Col N="63" /> state of the inquiry which the Minister said she would hold into the missing £800,000?  Second, does she not agree that what we are talking about here is fraud?  Third, and most importantly, why were her Department, which has been so generous in allowing Carysfort not to conclude a legal agreement for the earlier investment, so lax in the management of public funds that they did not require the authorities in Carysfort College to account for moneys which had been paid to them over a period of years and why had they not got audited accounts going back to 1984?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>This year has been an exceptionally active one for Ireland in the international sphere.  Our role of presiding over the Council of the European Community during the first half of the year entailed a special responsibility for the progress of business within the Community and also participation on the Community's behalf in negotiations and contacts with a large number of other countries throughout the world.  I think we acquitted ourselves with distinction in this role and that we can take pride in what was achieved in the Community under our Presidency.</P>
      <P>This was the fourth time that Ireland has assumed the Presidency of the Community. While each of these periods made its particular demands, the pace and intensity of negotiation were recognised to have increased greatly by the time the 1990 Presidency began.  The reasons for this were, of course, the development of the Community since the adoption of the Single European Act and, more recently, the developments in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe which have affected profoundly the relationships of European countries to one another and to the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report has been prepared and has been circulated to all Deputies which details the progress made at the various meetings of the Council during the six-month period.  The major themes of the Presidency are by now well-known to Deputies: the unification of Germany and the programme of assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; the implementation of the Single European Act, with particular reference to the internal market and the social dimension; <Col N="66" /> economic and monetary union; political union; creation of a people's Europe, notably action on the environment, organised crime and drugs, free movement of persons; the Community's external relations, including those with EFTA, Latin America, Asean, the Lomé countries and the Arab world; European political co-operation on issues related to security and co-operation in Europe, developments in the Middle East and South Africa.</P>
    <P>Work on these themes involved virtually every member of the Government.  The Council of the European Community met in many different compositions during the period, apart from the regular meetings of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and Finance which are held once or even twice a month.  Other Ministers met once, twice or three times during the six-month period, as required. These were Ministers responsible for consumer affairs, culture, development, education, energy, the environment, fisheries, health, industry, the internal market, research, social affairs, social security, telecommunications, tourism, transport and immigration.  The work culminated in the meeting of the European Council in Dublin Castle in June, under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The completion of the single market in 1992 will have far-reaching implications for economic and social development and many of these are the subject of legislation adopted under the Irish Presidency. In total 26 new measures were adopted in this field and 11 common positions agreed.  The Taoiseach has already pointed out, in reporting to this House, that this achievement constitutes a record for any Presidency and that two-thirds of the measures required for the Single Market had now been agreed. Some of these measures have particular significance for Ireland; each one of them is a contribution to the completion of a project which has been justly described as the bedrock of European integration.</P>
    <P>The creation of an economic area without internal frontiers ensuring the free movement of goods, persons, services <Col N="67" /> and capital and underpinned by economic and social cohesion and other accompanying measures is an essential foundation of economic and monetary union and of political union.  The social dimension of the Community is of particular concern to this country and the Irish Presidency gave significant impetus to work on the implementation of the Social Charter by securing agreement on a timetable for the priority proposals still to be examined.  Specific measures were adopted on health and safety of workers and on training, on the exchange of young workers and on assistance for the long term employed.</P>
    <P>Progress towards economic and monetary union was discussed in detail during the first half of the year and agreement reached on the commencement dates of the Intergovernmental Conference which will deal with this central issue.  That conference was formally inaugurated by the Heads of State and Government who met in Rome last Saturday following the European Council which took place there on 14 and 15 December.  The Taoiseach will shortly be reporting in detail to the Dáil on that conference and on the outcome of the European Council.</P>
    <P>The people's Europe is a concept that draws attention to the crucial importance of promoting the rights, freedoms and welfare of the individual citizen.  In the words used at the European Council in Dublin in June, it &ldquo;seeks to ensure and bring home in a direct and practical way the benefit of the Community to all its citizens&rdquo;.  In this context, the protection of the environment has been found to be of great importance to the individual citizen.  The dangers of a deterioration in the physical environment have been highlighted over the last year by the serious environmental problems revealed in the industrialised areas of Eastern Europe.  The Community has been coming to grips with these problems. Environment Ministers from both Eastern and Western Europe met in Dublin in June, at the invitation of the Irish Presidency and agreed that the new European Environment Agency would <Col N="68" /> be a pan-European agency open to all. The declaration on the environment adopted by the European Council sets out an agenda for the community in this vital area over the coming years.</P>
    <P>It is essential to ensure that a Europe without internal frontiers is protected against terrorism, crime and drug trafficking. Throughout the Irish Presidency, the high-level co-ordinators' group pressed ahead with their work to combat drug abuse.  The group reported to the European Council and made certain recommendations in regard to prevention of drug abuse, the suppression of drug trafficking, nationally and internationally, and the control of trade in chemicals used in refining drugs.  Consultative arrangements with the United States and Canada have now been agreed.  Priority action is now expected to combat money laundering.</P>
    <P>While the Community is proceeding according to the agreed timetable with the completion of the single market and the other work envisaged in the Single European Act, it must also respond to the developments taking place in the rest of the world.  Over the last year, these developments have been many and varied: constitutional changes in the Soviet Union, peaceful revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe, the final year of negotiations in the present round of the GATT, the movement towards reform in South Africa, continuing concern about the situation in the Middle East, rapprochement with Iran, a worsening of the plight of the least developed countries in Africa and elsewhere, accompanied by concern about their ability to meet their international debts.  These developments set the themes for the Presidency in the area of external relations.  Some of them were foreseeable well in advance; others made more rapid progress than expected, requiring of the Community a similarly rapid response.</P>
    <P>The advent of German unification, which changed the actual composition of the Community and its borders, was crucial.  It was recognised at an early stage that this would form a principal focus for <Col N="69" /> the six-month period.  Early in the year, the Taoiseach called a special meeting of Heads of State and Government in Dublin for April to deal specifically with the issues arising for the Community from the very rapid pace of events in Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The dramatic changes in Central and Eastern Europe permitted the development of a new set of relationships in Europe in an atmosphere of greatly reduced tension.  The European Council in Dublin welcomed those developments wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>It was an important objective of the Irish Presidency to strengthen the role of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe &mdash; CSCE, thus paving the way for the successful summit which took place last month in Paris. Among other points, the Charter of Paris, agreed at that summit, recognises that security in Europe is the direct concern of all 34 participating states, irrespective of whether or not they belong to a military alliance.</P>
    <P>The political relationship between the European Community and the United States was significantly developed during the Irish Presidency.  The meeting between the Taoiseach and President Bush in February established the framework for regular meetings between the two sides.</P>
    <P>It was necessary to address a wide range of other political issues during the Irish Presidency &mdash; the Middle East, South Africa and nuclear nonproliferation.</P>
    <P>The special meeting of Heads of State and Government in Dublin in April confirmed their commmitment to political union, and the June European Council took the decision to convene an Inter-governmental Conference on Political Union &mdash; a decision of obvious significance, which was built on at the Rome European Council of last week.  That council set out guidelines for the conference which, like the Inter-governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union, has now met for the first time, holding its opening session <Col N="70" /> in Rome on 15 December, immediately after the European Council.</P>
    <P>The supplementary funding sought today is for the Foreign Affairs Vote, but I would like to draw your attention briefly to some internal changes in the Vote for International Co-operation which I know will be of interest to the House.  The drawdowns by the European Commission in respect of the European Development Fund and subscriptions to international organisations such as the UN and OECD were lower this year than anticipated.  I am pleased to tell you that this has enabled significant transfers of over £0.6 million to the Disaster Relief Fund.  These have been used to make substantial allocations for Ethiopia and Sudan in particular.  Overall, the position for 1990 will be that over £1.3 million will be spent on disaster relief for developing countries, or double the original allocation of £0.65 million.  Of that total, £0.415 million has been allocated for Ethiopia, £0.310 million for Sudan, £0.125 million for Iran and £0.1 million for Angola and Mozambique.  Allocations have also been made for Peru and Cambodia and for the repatriation of refugees to South Africa and for repatriation of refugees who fled from Iraq and Kuwait.</P>
    <P>For 1991, as Deputies will be aware, the Government have allocated £43.2 million for Official Development Assistance, an increase of 26 per cent over the 1990 allocation.  As a percentage of GNP, ODA provisions will rise from 0.16 per cent to 0.18 per cent of GNP.  The main reason for the increase is funding for countries most affected by the Gulf crisis. Over the last couple of years, we have carefully ensured that we have met all our aid commitments.  In 1991 we will be able to expand our activities a little, providing <i>inter alia</i> food aid for Egypt, one of the countries most affected by the Gulf crisis, a very large increase in funding for UNICEF and some new projects in our priority countries &mdash; primary education in Tanzania, primary health care in Sudan and rural foot bridges in Lesotho.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has just introduced a Supplementary Estimate which seeks approval for an additional £497,000 to run the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Yet the Minister did not refer once in his speech to Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland affairs or the talks with Mr. Brooke.  He repeated the claim made earlier in the year by the Taoiseach that he was responsible for a whole range of measures, including the reunification of Germany.  I am sure the German people will be forever thankful to the Taoiseach &mdash; they will probably build shrines to him and light candles &mdash; for reunifying their country.  He keeps making the claim that that should set an example for us on this island: if Germany can be reunited after 40 years, then we should do the same.  However, he does not take into account the fact that the vast majority of people in Germany wanted reunification while at least one million people in the North of Ireland do not want to unite with us.  Until such time as he faces that reality there will be a problem.</P>
      <P>As I said there was no reference in the Minister's speech to Northern Ireland, Anglo-Irish relations and in particular, the decision handed down by the Court of Appeal in London yesterday on the Birmingham Six.  I would have thought that this debate today would have been an ideal opportunity for the Government to say precisely what they are doing and what pressure they are bringing to bear on the British Government to see that this farce which has gone on for 17 Christmases does not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a universal view &mdash; I use that term advisedly &mdash; that in fact the stringing out of this appeal is not serving British justice and that the Government should use every opportunity, both publicly and privately, to say to the British Home Secretary and Prime Minister &mdash; I understand the Taoiseach met him last week, while the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to meet the Foreign Secretary &mdash; that <Col N="72" /> they must bring the rules that they brought to bear in the case of the Guildford Four to bear in the case of the Birmingham Six.  I would have thought that this debate presented the Minister of State with a perfect opportunity to put that on the record of this House.  I regret very much that neither he nor the Minister saw fit to come into the House to put that on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to that fact already.  I note that there was a saving of £1.3 million in the subhead on salaries. Why could this not have been applied to overseas development aid?  I am aware that the classic response from the Minister would contain the words of the Department of Finance that we do not transfer funding between subheads, that any savings must be handed back, perhaps for reallocation, but the fact remains that the Minister has said that there already have been transfers between subheads.  For example, he has transferred £0.6 million to the disaster relief fund.  Therefore this £1.3 million could be applied to overseas development aid to top up their miserly contribution and increase the amounts Fianna Fáil have provided since coming into office.  I have not noticed any improvements despite the advent of the Progressive Democrats who when on this side of the House were very vocal in their demands for an increase in overseas development aid. However, since they joined the Government I have not noticed any improvements either in the outturn for last year or in the Estimate for next year in the amount being made available for overseas development aid.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that he has increased significantly the amount of money available and stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1991, as Deputies will be aware, the Government have allocated £43.2 million for official development assistance, an increase of 26 per cent over the 1990 allocation...  The main reason for the increase is funding for <Col N="73" /> countries most affected by the Gulf crisis.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking, that does not represent overseas development aid.  It is a once-off increase to help countries such as Jordan and Egypt and refugees from Kuwait.  It is not development aid to help Third World countries develop their economies to allow them to compete and find a place in the rest of the world.  It is a once-off increase and it is false to say that it represents an increase in overseas development aid in 1991.  That is something we should do.  This is not overseas development aid and should not be referred to as such by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to the European Community, it has been stated that what happened over the weekend flowed from the achievements of the Irish Presidency and the decision to set up two inter-governmental conferences which had their initial meetings last Saturday in Rome.  I must again point to the fact that the Irish Government did not put a paper before either conference outlining what their views are on anything.  We are the losers in that regard.  The Minister for Finance has said that he is very disappointed that the Irish view was not reflected in the draft document on monetary union produced by the Commission for the intergovernmental conference.  It is not reflected as the Irish position is not well known because the Minister did not put forward a paper.  Neither did the Government tell the House or the Commission what their views on political union are and that will be a major concern for the people of this country well into the future.</P>
    <P>The Irish position should have been debated in this House, and a paper should have been produced and presented to the intergovernmental conference with the authority of the Parliament behind it or will the Government make up the policy as they go along?  That is not an adequate response to what will be a huge step both for this country and Europe.  Will there be a federal Europe or a union of twelve member states?</P>
    <P>The Irish position should be on the <Col N="74" /> table and debated in this House so that we will know what the Government are going to say behind closed doors.  We do not know what they want or what their position is.  Do they want a federal Europe or a united states of Europe or a much looser arrangement along the lines of a Single European Act Mark II with majority voting, increased powers for the Parliament and the Commission being more answerable to the Council of Ministers? We have not heard what they want.  We have not been told what their position is in any of the debates held in this House, of which there have been precious few.</P>
    <P>When it was raised with the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs they sidestepped the issue and used put off phrases such as the Irish Government's position is well known and that they will be pushing it in the interests of the Irish people at the intergovernmental conferences throughout 1991.  Their position could not be known as it has not been outlined to the House or adopted by it. Individual members of the Government may have their individual views on what they would like to see come out of the intergovernmental conferences but that does not represent the Irish view and is the view of one part of the Government. We would like to know what the Progressive Democrats think.  Our experience in the past has taught us that eventually the Government think as they do because they force their will on the Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to repeat the plea that I have made both to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in my capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and that is to let the Government make provision for a two day debate in this House on a paper to be produced by the Government outlining their views on monetary and political union to be presented at the intergovernmental conference.  That is the least we deserve.  This is extremely important.  How do they propose to protect this Parliament in the decisions that will be made in Europe in the future? <Col N="75" /> We are the elected representatives of the people and this is the Parliament of the people and we should be the first to know what the Government propose to do and how they view the future of the people of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate we are now dealing with on Foreign Affairs arises out of our activities during our Presidency of the European Community.  The overruns are significant and reflect a certain lack of accountancy skills in assessing at the beginning of this year the additional expenditure that would be required in running a very active Presidency.  Certainly the overrun at 25 per cent in the amount allocated for travelling and incidental expenses this time last year arises out of a great deal of activity which should have been expected as we approached the Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overruns only reflect the tip of the iceberg as this Estimate on Foreign Affairs will not take into account the huge costs which arose as a result of gardaí being taken away from very worthwhile and necessary work and the presence of members of our Defence Forces who were badly stretched on Border duties.  The cost involved will not be reflected in the Estimate.  Nevertheless, the Minister has given a long list of the various activities with which this relatively small country had to deal on assuming the Presidency of the European Community.  I should like to have heard the Minister pay a very worthwhile tribute to the staff of his Department, the staff here and those who have served overseas, particularly in Community countries.  During the four Presidencies which we have held since our accession to the EC, they have performed magnificently and compared well with the staff of any of the other Community countries, including the larger ones.  It would be wrong for the Minister to suggest that the three previous Presidencies were in some way less active.  I was president of the Environment Council on one occasion.  I can assure the Minister that those three Presidencies were equally <Col N="76" /> successful.  Much of that success was due to the very high quality staff in the Department of the Environment who have served us abroad, particularly in the Community.</P>
    <P>A number of areas of activity received a great deal of publicity but due to the lack of debate in this House we have not had the opportunity to tease out the effects of our Presidency in particular areas.  The Minister mentioned the social charter and I would certainly like to debate in this House the effects of that charter on this country.  It has been badly watered down by the influence of Great Britain and the document which has finally emerged is much weaker because of the need to take on board the pressures exerted by Mrs. Thatcher and her Ministers during discussions on this matter in the past year.  The document originally presented and that finally agreed are very different.  The machinations during the discussions made it a much less significant document but it is, nevertheless, important and we must welcome it, even in its diluted form.</P>
    <P>We cannot but be concerned about the effect on peripheral regions of Economic and Monetary Union.  There has been a lack of real criticism by our Government and there has been a lack of debate in this House on the effects of the Single Market and Economic and Monetary Union.  We seem to base all our hope on the fact that we have a lower rate of inflation than most Community countries, but we also have the highest level of emigration, the highest level of unemployment and we remain the most isolated country in the Community.  The point about Ireland's isolation is highlighted by Britain's more permanent contact with the Continent which will be achieved as a result of the Channel Tunnel.  We are already experiencing the rundown of employment, the devastation of our young population in many rural areas and the lack of any hope in Government statements issued since our Presidency. I hope we will not simply go along with the big boys in the European Community and assume that because we seem <Col N="77" /> to have got the finances right the deep-seated social and economic problems can be overlooked.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in indicating that problems will arise from the removal of boundaries and frontiers.  He did not mention the problem of AIDS and drug abuse but I hope the boundaries will remain to the extent that we can keep a close watch on the drugs godfathers who will have much easier passage.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the health of the citizens of the Community will be strengthened as a result of greater unity. Each Community country seems to have a different approach to the spread of AIDS and I would hope for the development of a concerted view.</P>
    <P>We all regard with some satisfaction the unification of Germany.  Normally when the Community is expanded to include 16 million people years of debate and discussion have taken place to produce an evaluation of the effects on other Community countries.  The 16 million people living in the eastern part of Germany seem to have been brought into the Community without any such evaluation.  I hope we will hear more on this subject.</P>
    <P>I underline what the previous speaker said about ODA.  We must regard ourselves as a Community for this purpose. ODA has been reduced from 4.5 per cent in 1980 to 2.7 per cent in 1990 of the total EC budget.  This is a scandal.  Although a £100 million package of aid for Russia has been agreed, this seems to have taken away from the urgency of dealing with worldwide problems of famine and deprivation, particularly in the Third World.  I hope Ireland will always be to the forefront in demanding increased support for these countries and that the desire to help Russia in an undoubtedly difficult period will not dilute our aid to the Third World.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this will not happen and that the problems of the Third World and the Lomé countries will always be high among our priorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> We do not intend to oppose this Estimate. There are many significant problems we could raise but I hope the budget debate will provide that opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously ten minutes is not adequate to deal with international relations and I would hope to touch on three or four areas which I regard as being of particular importance. One of the most glaring omissions in Oireachtas procedures is the absence of a Foreign Affairs committee.  It is urgently needed, specifically because we are facing a situation arising from the Gulf crisis which is unprecedented and which this House has not yet debated.  We are facing a deadline on 15 January which could result in this country being involved in supporting a war in the Gulf.  There does not seem to be the urgency I would expect in relation to this issue.  Our Constitution states quite clearly that to declare war or to support war this House must pass a resolution to that effect.  This House has not even debated the issue. Yet we recess tomorrow until the end of January.  If there was never a need before there is now a clear need for a committee to examine issues like these that will arise more frequently in the future because of the major changes that have taken place in international relations, in international security and this overall area of debate. More and more these call into question Irish neutrality which urgently requires re-evaluation to ascertain in what way it can be rendered more relevant to the new position prevailing worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was raised less than two weeks ago, on 6 December, at Question Time, the Minister for Foreign Affairs promised that there would be day-long debates once a month on foreign affairs.  On the face of it that was a very generous and welcome offer in so far as it was a recognition that foreign affairs need to be debated on a more regular basis.  Clearly a formal debate in this House is not the way in which these critical issues which need to be addressed and teased out can be done.  The formal procedures in this House do not permit the to-ing and fro-ing of addressing the <Col N="79" /> minute details of issues relating to the Gulf or, for instance, issues relating to political or monetary union.  We need a committee to deal effectively with those issues.  The effect of having monthly debates in this House simply will be to harden positions, to have posturing and, in fact, could be seen simply as a monthly release of hot air which would do nobody in this House any good.</P>

      <P>The absence of this committee is more clearly highlighted than ever arising from the position we face in relation to the Gulf.  As a House we have made no effort to influence the people who have a say in whether or not there will be war in the Gulf.  Judging by the Taoiseach's response to my question this morning on how we intend to respond, it is quite likely we will have an emergency recall of the Dáil &mdash; I hope it does not have to happen &mdash; but it is possible that, on 15 January 1991, we will be sitting here trying to tease out what should be our attitude to the appalling nightmare that would result from the failure of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.  It is extraordinary that spokesmen for the American Administration do not regard war as the nightmare scenario but they regard a partial withdrawl from Kuwait by the Iraqis as &mdash; what was the phrase they used &mdash; a doomsday situation.  What would they do?  They could not plausibly launch an attack if there is partial withdrawal. Yet they cannot plausibly back down from their demand that the Iraqis pull out of Kuwait.  As far as I am concerned, and I am sure the majority of Members of this House are concerned, the nightmare, doomsday scenario is that a shot should be fired at all in the Gulf. War in the Gulf is unnecessary, is uncalled for and would be a catastrophe for millions of people in the Middle East and, indeed, right around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue on which I wanted to touch is overseas development aid.  All parties in this House agree in principle that our overseas development aid should <Col N="80" /> be substantially increased, that serious efforts should be made to reach the target set by the United Nations in the early seventies.  Rather than reaching that target we, as a State, have skipped back from the provision we made five or six years ago.  Given that there is agreement in principle by all parties in this House, given that it is an issue which, by and large, does not divide the House politically, it would make sense for representatives of all parties to sit down with the Government representatives and work out a strategy on how we should increase our overseas development aid on an annual basis until we reach the target of 0.7 per cent of the GNP within a reasonable period, say within five or six years. Five years is being sought by the agencies here who deal with ODA.  I have written to the leaders of all parties in this House, including the Government parties, making this suggestion.  I hope there will be an early positive response to my request.  I seriously believe there is little point in our shouting at one another across the floor of this Chamber in relation to this issue when we could sit down sensibly and work out a strategy.</P>

      <P>I will conclude by making two points, one in relation to overseas development aid.  The people outside this House have shown their generosity and would welcome a combined, co-operative approach on the part of all Members of this House to this issue.</P>
      <P>I wanted to deal with the question of Northern Ireland.  However, I will conclude on this point: given that the majority of parties in this House indicated, in the debate on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, that they saw a need to change the Constitution, perhaps progress could be made in that direction in 1991.  We should endeavour to ensure that nothing in our Constitution will stand in the way of a political arrangement in Northern Ireland which can bring about peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> This Supplementary Estimate is to meet the costs of storm damage caused to our coast by the severe storms of last winter.  In view of this and the time constraint, I intend to confine my speech to this area of my responsibilities.</P>
      <P>State funding for coast protection was transferred to the Department of the Marine on 1 January 1990.  Until then, this function had been entrusted to the Commissioners of Public Works who had an annual budget of between £100,000 and £150,000 for this work and whose powers were derived from the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  The involvement of the Commissioners of Public Works came about largely because of their engineering experience, particularly in marine engineering.  Primary responsibility for coast protection law with the local authorities, many of whom have undertaken protection works using their own resources.</P>
      <P>The Coast Protection Act, 1963 enabled local authorities to propose protection schemes to be undertaken by the Commissioners provided that a scheme met certain criteria laid down in the Act.</P>
      <P>It is to be noted that the Act related to land within a county that:</P>
      <P>is being progressively damaged by the continuing encroachment of the sea as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms and that the encroachment is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area or other valuable property.</P>
      <P>The 1963 Coast Protection Act was well known for its complexities.  Let me explain briefly how it worked.  Under the Act, local authorities might propose protection schemes to be undertaken by the Commissioners provided there was progressive damage occasioned by the encroachment of the sea.  The Commissioners could carry out a preliminary examination of the problem outlined in the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> Following the preliminary examination &mdash; which was basically an engineering assessment of the problem and an estimate of cost of any necessary works &mdash; the Commissioners could make a &ldquo;positive determination&rdquo;, that is, a statement that a scheme was feasible or a &ldquo;negative determination&rdquo;, that circumstances were such that a scheme was not warranted.</P>
    <P>In the event of a positive determination, the Commissioners were obliged under the Act to obtain a declaration from the local authority as to whether or not a scheme should be proceeded with and that, in the event of a scheme being executed, the local authority would pay the appropriate contribution.</P>
    <P>Before a scheme could be implemented, the Act required that the Commissioners would have further detailed consultation with the local authority. Those whose property was likely to be affected would be notified.</P>
    <P>Public exhibition of the proposed scheme was also required.  The execution of works was dependent on the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  Under the Act finance could be made available only when a proposal for a scheme of protection works, having followed the statutory procedures had reached the stage where the Commissioners could commence works.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners were not empowered by the Act to make grants to individuals or groups for the purpose of undertaking such works.  This is a brief outline only of the detailed steps required under the 1963 Act but it illustrates the complex and lengthy procedures which must be gone through.  Clearly, it was never intended to be used to deal with emergency works arising from storm damage.</P>
    <P>On the weekend of 16-17 December 1989, severe storms caused extensive damage along the south and east coasts. A deep depression tracked across the southern half of Ireland and the associated high winds coincided with spring tides resulting in heavy seas which caused major coastal damage, particularly, in <Col N="83" /> Counties Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford and Cork.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions informed this House of the initiatives I took following those storms.  The damage caused at many locations, including Bray Harbour and Esplanade, Arklow Harbour and north beach, Kilmore Quay and Rosslare Strand, was seen at first hand by the Minister and by myself.</P>
    <P>Kilmore Quay is, as the House knows, an important fishery harbour with substantial on-shore employment and it was vital to react quickly to provide financial assistance to repair the pier.  The awesome power of the sea was vividly demonstrated at Kilmore Quay when a section of quay wall, approximately 20 metres long, was demolished.  At Arklow north beach the severe storms in combination with the high tides removed the sand dune protection of a significant area of lowlying ground.  Extensive flooding of property occurred and would continue to occur if some action was not taken.  An emergency coast protection scheme to provide a protective rock slope was urgently required.  I offered immediately grant-aid of 50 per cent to Wexford County Council for repairs to the pier at Kilmore Quay and in the context of the budget I sought and received a special allocation of £950,000 to assist Wicklow County Council in undertaking the emergency coast protection works at Arklow north beach.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, further damage was yet to come.  During the month of February a series of storms hit the country and storm damage was reported from all coastal counties except Leitrim and Limerick. Again the Government reacted quickly and established a ministerial committee to assess the situation.  The Government, in setting up the committee, acknowledged that the level of storm damage was unprecedented and that exceptional measures would have to be taken.  As a member of this committee, I undertook a full review and an assessment of the storm damage, in each coastal county, was undertaken by engineers from my Department.  Their report summarised <Col N="84" /> the costs of all cases of reported coastal damage.  The damage reports were obtained by contacting local authorities and asking them to submit details of damage which could be attributed to the storms.  Any sites at which significant damage was reported were inspected by the Department's engineers.</P>
    <P>In assessing costs of damage, only damage arising directly from the storms of last winter was considered.  The cost of the damage was assessed as the cost of the repair work necessary to return the damaged areas to a serviceable condition of good engineering standard.  In cases this could mean that a collapsed sea-wall, for example, would be returned to a better than pre-storm condition as maintenance, or indeed reconstruction of the wall may have been neglected over the years.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to be aware that coastal erosion is not a new problem brought on by last winter's storms.  It is an ongoing phenomenon leading to the progressive damage of land by the continuing encroachment of the seas. However, there is no doubt that those storms, by damaging coastal defences, highlighted areas where coast protection works are required.  My engineers reported on three distinct types of coastal damage.  These are: (1) Repair work to piers and harbours; (2) Emergency and small scale remedial work to coast defences, sea walls, etc.; and (3) Coast protection schemes which were needed even before the storms but where the urgency for the work was increased by the storms, for example, north beach, Arklow.</P>
    <P>At the end of March, the Government, having considered the Minister's committee's report on storm damage, provided an additional allocation of £3 million to my Department for restoration works at commercial harbours, local authority piers and harbours and in relation to other marine damage resulting from the winter storms of 1989-90.</P>
    <P>Following discussions with the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment, in accordance with the Government decision, my Department <Col N="85" /> wrote to the local authorities advising them of the assessment of marine storm damage in their area and asking them to submit details of the projects which they intended carrying out and for which they would be seeking grant assistance.  An assessment of each application was undertaken by the Engineering Division, and once the Department were satisfied that it qualified for assistance, the council were informed that a grant was available in respect of the application.</P>
    <P>The final distribution of the allocation between authorities was as follows:</P>

    <P>My preceding comments and the figures which I have provided illustrate the serious consequences of a series of storms of unusual severity and their impact on Government expenditure in 1990.  I am satisfied that the response of the Government to these events was correct but, as Deputies will appreciate, these events <Col N="86" /> have added to the Department's expenditure for the year 1990 and have given rise to the Supplementary Estimate moved today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed that the Supplementary Estimate before us here today is so little. As the Minister has rightly stated, severe storms occurred towards the end of 1989 and in the early part of 1990 which resulted in very serious damage to the coastline of many counties and to infrastructure such as piers and harbours around those counties.  At the time as a result of Fine Gael raising the matter here on the Adjournment, the Government following that Adjournment debate decided to set up a Cabinet committee consisting of four or five Ministers to examine the situation.  That was done and the committee reported and recommended an allocation of money to local authorities.  If I recall correctly, the estimated amount of money at that time to cover the entire cost of the damage was in excess of £60 million and the Department made available something in excess of £3 million along with the Department of the Environment.  The amount of money allocated for the damage done was a major shortfall on what was required.</P>
      <P>There are still outstanding difficulties in various counties as a result of the storm damage last year.  I had hoped the Minister in the course of his speech here this afternoon would have presented a case that now coastal protection works are within the responsibility of the Department of the Marine and that the Department of the Marine will set about doing something positive in relation to coastal protection.  I had hoped too the Minister would outline here this afternoon the details of a coastal protection plan to prevent coastal erosion, particularly on the east coast which has not the natural fortress of rocks to defend it and which is highly vulnerable in an east or south-east storm such as occurred last February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coast is now being eroded so quickly that roads are threatened, as are houses and people's livelihoods.  This is <Col N="87" /> very evident along the coasts of Wicklow and Wexford.  Rather than reacting to immediate difficulties, there is an onus on the Government to make plans to take preventive action in the future.  What the Minister should be doing this afternoon is outlining to us the details of an erosion prevention plan, particularly for the vulnerable east and south-east coasts where most difficulties have occurred.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that there are not difficulties in certain areas along the west coast because of the variety of rock types in those areas.  I call on the Minister and the Department to set about putting in place a plan to prevent coastal erosion and present that plan to Europe for structural funds.  As an island nation with particular difficulties over and above those faced by the other member states, I believe there is a very special case for securing Structural Funds from Europe. When our case was being put just over a year ago this Government refused to have the matter debated here in the House, and it was most unfortunate that the Government omitted to make a submission for Structural Funds for coastal protection at that time.  I hope the Minister will act on what I am suggesting and not just react to events that happen.  I hope he will make plans and anticipate what will happen in the future.  The money allocated to the respective local authorities is minimal.  In no case did it completely cover the damage that needed to be repaired.  That is unfortunate for the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister is proposing an additional £300,000 for inland fisheries development but he did not deal with that in the course of his contribution.  I hope when he is responding he will outline for what purpose this money will be spent.</P>
    <P>Another interesting feature which is of concern is that there was a saving of £631,000 on the development of harbours for commercial fisheries and other purposes. I am amazed that the Department of the Marine could save this amount of money in that area when there are so <Col N="88" /> many harbours around the country seeking support for improvement and expansion works, and other harbours seeking to be classified as commercial fishery harbours. Could the Minister tell us where this money was saved, how it was saved, at whose expense it was saved, why this money was not spent on harbours that have sought money for development and expansion work and why those other harbours that have applied for commercial fishery status have not been so classified? Could he tell us why some of this money was not spent for the absolutely necessary development that needs to be done in this area?  Here was a real opportunity for the Department of the Marine to do further developmental work in areas that have been neglected over the years.  The Department have obviously failed in their duty.  They have left aside money that could have been very usefully employed. We find now that under this subhead £631,000 has been saved.  That is a very poor reflection on the Minister and on the Department of the Marine when there is such a great need right across the country for expenditure.</P>
    <P>Most of the other areas dealt with here relate to travelling expenses and other basic essential services.  I had hoped that funding would be made available in this Estimate for the air-sea rescue services. I am amazed to note that this does not appear in the Supplementary Estimate.  I am disappointed that this matter has been omitted because there was a lot of publicity in relation to the Doherty report and the subsequent decision to implement part of that report.  Yet nowhere can we find the necessary funding to put in place proper air-sea search and rescue services.  I see the Minister is nodding in agreement.</P>

      <P>I will have to deal with that later.  I am informed that I cannot debate it now.  I am disappointed about this because in the next few months a lot of difficulties will arise because of <Col N="89" /> bad weather at sea.  I am greatly concerned about what has been done to date to implement the Doherty report.  I am concerned that the proper facilities are not in place and that the necessary work has not been done.  Unfortunately we do not see any suggestion here that moneys are being provided for that matter in this Estimate.</P>

      <P>Any money, supplementary or otherwise, to the Department of the Marine is very welcome indeed.  Since I became spokesperson on the Marine for the Labour Party I felt that it was a young, fresh Department with a great future.  The reaction of the Minister in regard to the storm damage last year is an indication of how petty the funding is for that Department.  The money allocated to repair the damage to our harbours and our coastline falls far short of what is necessary, as estimated by the various county councils and harbour authorities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Department seem to be reacting to events as distinct from creating their own policies for the future.  As an island nation, we have a major problem.  We have lived with the problem of coastal erosion for a long time.  We have seen roads, harbours and fortifications falling into the sea.  We seem to have no policy whatsoever to try to prevent coastal erosion.  We are just reacting to events as they happen.</P>
      <P>I understand the Department have not got the funding they truly need.  I would consider it the poor relation of Government Departments.  We are looking for extra just to survive as a Department. This is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of the people in the Department and I sympathise with the Minister to a certain extent.  Perhaps his promotion to Tánaiste will give him more muscle at Cabinet level so that he will get proper financing in the future.  This Department need a proper financial input if they are to have any impact on the international scene and indeed, in protecting our coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our harbours were extensively damaged during the storms last year. <Col N="90" /> Fishermen had to tie up their boats, and foreign trawlers reaped the benefit.  It was extraordinary to see our fishermen rammed by foreign trawlers on the high seas last year.  That was the subject of a debate in the House on a number of occasions.  Not only did our fishermen have to contend with nature and dice with death but they also had to face a challenge from superior foreign boats with steel hulls.  I know the Minister took this matter up at European level but he should have been more forceful.  Our fishermen should not have to put their lives at risk in that fashion in order to earn a living.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a 50 per cent grant to Wexford County Council.  That may seem to be a reasonable figure but local authorities and county councils are strapped for cash.  They do not have money to meet difficulties that may arise, for example, storm damage.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine have responsibility for our coastline.  We must have a co-ordinated, cohesive plan.  We cannot expect county councils to get more cash from overburdened taxpayers.  We need a new policy on coastal protection, otherwise parts of the south coast will be eroded before long.  It gives me no joy to say that not only can we not cope with the challenge of foreign trawlers but we cannot cope with coastal protection.  That is a sad reflection on the funding for the Department of the Marine.  The Department is not long in existence but the plan was that it would be established in order to bring all these loose strands together. Ireland is the only island off Europe which is not linked with the European mainland.  It is important that we would have a plan covering merchant shipping and fishing ports.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the development of inland fisheries.  We cannot resolve our difficulties with the rod licence.  Unfortunately that issue has reared its ugly head again.  The feedback from angling groups is that the Bill before the House is unacceptable and must be amended.  If that is not done the issue of <Col N="91" /> inland fisheries will crop up again and again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The main element in the Supplementary Estimate has to do with the storm damage which occurred last year.  It is disappointing that the Minister in introducing the Supplementary Estimate did not refer to the possibility that these storms may become a more regular feature of our life as massive climate change begins to have its effect.  I am disappointed that while in 1990 it was found necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of £3 million to provide for the effects of storm damage, the 1991 Estimates do not make an ongoing provision for an emergency of this kind. It is unrealistic to expect that we will not have storm damage in 1991.  Provision should have been made for that.</P>
      <P>The extent of the storm damage for which money has now been provided has been contributed to by the fact that inadequate resources were provided over the years for coastal protection.  The Minister said that up to 1990 between £100,000 and £150,000 was provided for coastal protection work by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Clearly the effect of the storm damage we are being asked to pay for has been contributed to by the fact that the coastline was neglected and adequate funds were not provided to deal with coastal protection.  I am surprised to see that in the 1991 Estimate there is a cut of 42 per cent in the allocation for coastal protection.  We are now providing emergency money for storm damage and yet we find that in the Book of Estimates there is a massive cut in the amount of coastal protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister drew attention to the complex nature of the Coast Protection Act.  The time has come for that to be replaced with coast management legislation. Our coastline is a resource which needs to be managed like any other resource.  The Coast Protection Act, 1963, has been found to be unworkable, complex and is now inadequate.  It should be replaced by a coast management Act which would provide not just for coastal <Col N="92" /> protection schemes but for a plan for the protection and management of our coastline, which, obviously, would include the provision of coastal protection schemes.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to one scheme which bit the dust as it attempted to navigate the complex nature of the Coast Protection Act, 1963, that is the coastal protection scheme for the south County Dublin coastline.  It was initially proposed by Dublin County Council for the section of coastline between Shankill and Bray.  It is generally acknowledged that what is needed in that area is a coast protection scheme for the coastline stretching between Killiney and Bray.  It is interesting that some of the money being provided in this Estimate has to be spent on repairing damage as a result of a storm in that area.</P>
    <P>The Dublin County Council proposal for a coastal protection scheme under the 1963 Act got as far as the second stage, the stage at which the Commissioners of Public Works made a positive determination that a coastal protection scheme was warranted, but it got no further. Neither the local authority, nor the Commissioners of Public Works, had the money available to them to carry out such a scheme.  We are dealing here with an area of coastline which has been built upon to a large extent, and some houses are very close indeed to the eroding cliff-face. One of our major elements of public transport, the DART line between Bray and the city centre, runs along that coast. Concern has been expressed locally that the extent of erosion in that area may be undermining the DART line.  There is a need for that stetch of coastline to be included in a coast protection scheme.  I would like the Minister to bring before the House specific proposals for coastal protection schemes and coastal management for areas like that.</P>
    <P>A matter of disappointment to me is that fact that yet again we have a Marine Estimate in front of us which makes no mention of and no provision for the former employees of Irish Shipping. Those former employees, as the House well knows, have been waiting for more <Col N="93" /> than six years since the liquidation of Irish Shipping for proper redundancy and pension entitlements.  The Minister is responsible for that area, and I had hoped he would have used the opportunity of bringing a Supplementary Estimate before the House to provide some money, perhaps from the savings that have been identified in the 1990 Estimate, for those long-suffering former employees of Irish Shipping who served this country well.  They were promised time and again, particularly by the Fianna Fáil Party before their re-election to <Col N="94" /> Government in 1987, that they would get their proper entitlements.  It is a matter of great disappointment to me that the Marine Estimate makes no mention or takes account of these former loyal servants of this State.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Supplementary Estimates for Votes 3, 7, 13, 14, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 34, 39, 42 and 44 for the service for the year ending 31 December 1990, and the statement of excess on the grant for superannuation and retirement allowances for 1987, Excess Vote 22, are hereby agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I can understand Deputy Barry's concern and interest and the widespread interest of the House in all of these matters.  I would proffer the view to the Taoiseach that a committee on foreign affairs would be of enormous benefit to all parties in this House and indeed to the formulation of foreign policy.  I seek an assurance from the Taoiseach in relation to the question of neutrality, which Deputy Barry is seeking a report on.  Can I take it from the Taoiseach's remarks at the weekend in the wake of the summit in Rome, that our position in relation to Irish neutrality stands as it has been for many years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Deputy can take that.  What we were discussing is our refusal to take part in any military alliance.  I am very glad to be able to assure the House that our position in that regard was, probably for the first time, fully respected and accommodated in the conclusions of this summit, something which I find very satisfactory.  I was very grateful to my colleagues in the summit <Col N="98" /> for the very constructive attitude they took towards our position.  It was only guidelines that the summit decided upon but nevertheless they were significant. The decisions of the summit have implications of considerable importance for a number of possible applicant countries around Europe who I am sure will find great solace in the position which has now been established in these guidelines for Ireland.  I find some of the things Deputy Bruton has been saying recently with regard to these matters as not being very much in touch with the reality of the situation.</P>

      <P>There are quite a lot of different aspects of this issue on foreign affairs and neutrality which need to be teased out, and Question Time is not the best time for it.  The question relates specifically to the possibility of a forum which would deal specifically with the question of security, defence and neutrality which would be much wider than the issue of European Community issues and the questions of security and defence in that regard.  The issue of the UN and its evolution in the current situation needs to be addressed.  The new position we have adopted in relation to the CSCE arising from the fact that all countries involved in the CSCE are now holding disarmament talks, needs to be addressed.  Does the Taoiseach not feel that, as things are developing at European level at the moment, we may simply be put in a corner and ignored in relation to our attitude towards disarmament and security, defence and so forth if we continue to allow these matters to be discussed without our voice being heard, a voice for peace and disarmament, and without a coherent approach to this issue.</P>

      <P>We played a very active part in the CSCE process and fully supported the conclusions of the last summit in Paris which gives us all great hope for the future and is a source of encouragement for us.  All 34 countries present are now determined to create a whole new architecture of security and stability for all of Europe.  That is one aspect.  The other is that the Community are now prepared to talk in the IGC about having a positive attitude towards the question of disarmament, peacekeeping and so on. We will participate fully in the new common foreign and security policy. There can be no question about that. We support this concept.  It will be very valuable from the point of view of world peace to have the Community playing an enlightened role in international affairs. Most Deputies will agree that we have a problem about the question of security policy for the Community, having a defence &mdash; which is a code word for military &mdash; dimension, but we have gone a long way towards resolving the problem in that regard at the recent Rome summit.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the reply he has just given indicates very clearly that we need some kind of forum, because the words we are using have different meanings for each of us.  The Taoiseach said that &ldquo;defence&rdquo; was a code word for &ldquo;military&rdquo;.  I do not take that any more than I would a statement that the Irish Army is an aggressive military force, but it is there for the sense of this political union.  I would like to see all that clarified in relation to Europe.  That is why we want to find out precisely what we are talking about and if we all mean the same thing by the same words, such as neutrality, defence and security.

Would he agree, for example, that no action has been taken in regard to delegating explicit responsibility for decisions to named individuals and groups within the service, giving the possibility of cash bonuses to individual civil servants who perform exceptionally well or requiring each Department to have a clear set of objectives against which performance could be measured?

      <P>I am not particularly enamoured with some of those recommendations. I should like to inform the Deputy that we now have the efficiency audit group who are carrying out high level reviews of a number of Departments. The idea is that the efficiency audit group will go through the public service in time.  We also have the idea <Col N="111" /> of introducing administrative budgets for each Department which will give the management of the Departments a new freedom to promote efficiency and economy in their Departments.  They are two major developments.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is a continuing programme of better management and new personnel systems.  There is also the continuing steady increase in the use of information technology and reviews of efficiency of one kind or another.  There is a very major programme of ongoing work.</P>

Would he not agree that a change in the law to allow statutory responsibility to be devolved to individual named civil servants rather than maintaining the myth of ministerial responsibility for everything is necessary if we are to advance the cause of Civil Service reform to its full potential?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The National Library is the major repository of documentary material relating to Parnell and the Irish Parliamentary Party.  In addition to displaying a Parnell commemorative exhibition at the Library in October 1991, the Director of the National Library also envisages the circulation throughout the country of a touring exhibition on the theme of Parnell in his historical context.  The National Gallery and the National Archives will assist the National Library to mount this exhibition by making available the relevant material which they have in their care.  The preparation of an illustrated book or booklet incorporating facsimiles of items in the National Library is also under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that major refurbishment <Col N="113" /> works at Avondale, the home of Parnell, will be completed before the end of February 1991.  Those works are being initiated by Coillte Teoranta, the current occupiers of Avondale.  Their completion will greatly enhance the ambience of the Parnell museum at Avondale.  Staff of the National Museum of Ireland are assisting Coillte by way of professional advice including on the acquisition of items relating to Parnell and his era.  In addition, the National Museum is providing some furnishings and exhibits on a temporary loan for display at Avondale.</P>
    <P>My Department have kept in contact during the course of this year with the national cultural institutions and with Coillte to ensure that Parnell is commemorated next year in a fitting way.</P>
    <P>The question of Government representation at the centenary commemoration of Parnell will also be considered in due course.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe's secretariat has advised that while the committee in question met earlier this year in Glasgow, currently designated as &ldquo;European City of Culture&rdquo;, it is not the policy of that committee to meet regularly in &ldquo;European Cities of Culture&rdquo;, as the committee is only authorised to hold <Col N="115" /> one meeting outside Paris and Strasbourg per year.  The merits of inviting the committee to meet in Dublin will, however, be kept in mind having regard <i>inter alia</i> to the fact that EC Ministers for Culture will be invited to the launching of the project.</P>

      <P>The working group, which considered the long term arrangement for the use of An Caisleán, the conference centre at Dublin Castle, submitted their findings and recommendations to me earlier this year.  The facilities comprise the main conference centre, a number of delegation and break-out rooms, and a number of shared facilities such as dining areas and lobbies.</P>
      <P>The Government decided, on foot of these recommendations that the conference centre should be made available for Government and approved private sector use, and should be managed by the Commissioners of Public Works.  That decision has been implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The group laid down guidelines in that regard and we will adhere to those.  The idea is to have suitable use &mdash; I mean suitable from the point of view of dignity and so on &mdash; by the <Col N="116" /> private sector of the conference facilities. The group recommended that we should not encourage anything in the nature of commercial promotions of that kind. Otherwise we want to see the best possible use made of these excellent facilities.</P>

      <P>A programme for the modernisation of the Defence Forces transport fleet commenced in 1988.  As part of this programme a contract was placed in August 1990 for the purchase of 20 minibuses for use by the FCÁ and delivery of these vehicles will be completed by the end of this month.  It is intended to purchase a further 35 new minibuses for use by the FCÁ in 1991 with other FCÁ vehicles being replaced as financial resources permit.  I am satisfied that the additional vehicles being provided for the FCÁ will maintain the overall efficiency of the FCÁ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 18 and 22 and oral Question No. 29 together.</P>
      <P>The GATT negotiations were held at ministerial level in Brussels during the week 3-7 December.  Ireland participated as part of the Community bloc in the negotiations.  In this context there were four Council meetings of Trade Ministers accompanied, in the case of most member states, by agriculture Ministers. Additionally, there were several meetings at official level.</P>
      <P>Throughout, Ireland's objective was to seek a constructive outcome, on the basis of a balanced and realistic settlement for all issues, including agriculture.  This was very much in line with the position of other member states and was reflected in the constructive role which the Community played in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>From an early stage, the Community sought to have negotiations concentrated on the following principal subjects, textiles, international services, trade-related investment measures (TRIMs), trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and agriculture.  Despite the repeated attempts by some other participants, notably the US and the Cairns Group, to focus instead on the agriculture dossier exclusively, the Community's approach was eventually adopted towards the middle of the week and it was only then that real negotiations, as opposed to posturing, could begin.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, significant progress was achieved in regard to textiles, TRIMs, TRIPs and GATT rules and disciplines. Some meaningful progress was achieved in the case of international services, although there are still some key issues outstanding which require further negotiation before they can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of agriculture, the Community continued throughout to indicate <Col N="123" /> its willingness to negotiate within the mandate already agreed by the Council of Ministers and the fact that this did not prove possible was due mainly to the lack of realism on the part of other main participants and their unwillingness to proceed with flexibility.</P>
    <P>It was in the light of this that the chairman of the session decided to suspend the proceedings.  At no stage was there a breakdown and I do not believe that the latter is a scenario which is contemplated by any participant who is serious in the negotiations and about the importance of the Round.  Indeed, the purpose of the suspension was to enable further work to be done in an attempt to close the political gaps that continued to exist in some areas so that Ministers, later, could complete the Round with minimal difficulty. As Deputies will now be aware, Mr. Dunkel, Director General, GATT, has since announced that talks will resume at highest official level on 15 January next in Geneva.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, as talks have only been suspended, Irish industry will suffer no adverse consequences.  Indeed, as I have already indicated, on the basis of the progress achieved during many of the meetings on a range of issues, Irish industry may look forward to improved access to export markets and to a more secure trading environment which will follow from a successful conclusion to the talks.</P>
    <P>As to the consequences of failure of the Round, if this were to occur despite the best efforts of all parties involved, it is very difficult to be precise about what would follow.  The probability is, however, that the order and disciplines which we have become accustomed to in international trade may fracture and that protectionism may be intensified.  This could even lead to the creation of regional trading blocs throughout the world which in turn would limit market access and export oppportunities.  Irish industry, no more than industry in any other country, could not really escape these consequences.</P>
    <P>I am still optimistic, however, that all <Col N="124" /> parties involved will do their utmost to persist in negotiations in the Round, with a determination and will to succeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As there appears to be a deadlock between the EC and its main trading partners, the United States in particular, have any initiatives been undertaken in the difficult area of agricultural supports and has the Minister discussed with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and with his colleagues within the EC, any variation in the income support arrangements for farmers to try to break the deadlock? Would the Minister agree that the consequence of a deadlock would be an extremely serious impact on jobs and revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Detailed questions on matters relating to agriculture ought properly to be put to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I have discussed aspects of these matters with him many times and he and I have a similar view in regard to the difficulties which have arisen.  The Deputy should bear in mind that the fundamental difficulty which continues to arise in these negotiations is the attitude of the United States.  On all 15 issues which are the subject of the present round of the GATT, the European Community have taken the lead in making offers which might objectively be described as both constructive and generous and have shown, thereby, our anxiety to have a satisfactory outcome. There are certain limits beyond which even a Community as open-minded and generous and as deeply committed to free trade as the EC cannot go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising the importance of agriculture to the economy, is there a danger in the process of these negotiations that talks could eventually break down to mean talks in relation to agriculture as distinct from other areas and that we could be faced with a compromise which would incorporate areas of activity in the Irish economy other than agriculture?  Can the Minister assure this House that the Irish <Col N="125" /> textile industry will not be seriously affected?  While recognising that we have access to more markets, it is particularly important for the textile industry to have access to imports.  Can the Minister give an assurance that any changes which will be brought about will be in the interests of the textile industry and maintaining the large number of jobs involved in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the general strategy of the Community it was, from the outset of the ministerial talks, at what was scheduled to be the end of the Uruguay Round, the strategy of the Community that we should not be forced to discuss agriculture alone.  In fact the first three days of that meeting in Brussels were spent in the Community trying to make this point in that regard and the United States, and some others, taking the view that agriculture, and agriculture alone, should be discussed.  I am glad to say that after the third day, I think on the Wednesday night, the Community's view then prevailed and a number of topics I have already listed in my reply were discussed simultaneously.  As I indicated to the House, a number of those topics were discussed to the benefit of all sides and significant progress was made. Therefore, the Deputy can be assured that neither this country nor the Community wants to discuss simply agriculture on its own.</P>
      <P>So far as textiles are concerned the discussions that did take place were generally regarded as useful.  The discussions centred, among other things, around a transitional period which was suggested as being ten years plus.  If such a lengthy transition period can be achieved in the final agreement then the Irish textile industry would regard that as being very beneficial and a worthwhile substitute for the present arrangements under the multi-fibres agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not <Col N="126" /> agree that there is little point in sitting back, as he appears to be doing, putting the blame for the deadlock on the United States, saying that we in Ireland and the EC are justified in this matter when deadlock and this serious position faces us? Would he not agree, therefore, that new initiatives are necessary to try to break this deadlock?  Has he any new initiatives to break the deadlock and, if so, what are they?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 19 and oral Question No. 44 together.</P>
      <P>As the matter of the rescue plan for the Goodman Group and related companies is one for the Examiner and the High Court, I do not consider it appropriate for me to comment directly on it.</P>
      <P>However, I have received a notification under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987, in respect of the proposals by the Examiner.</P>
      <P>As I am required to do under the Acts, the notification is being examined in the context of the interests of the common good, having regard to the scheduled criteria in the 1978 Act.  These criteria comprehend such matters as the effects on competition in the marketplace, the interests of the consumer, the effects on continuity of supplies or services, the effects on employment and employees, the interests of shareholders, the impact on regional development and whatever economic benefits might arise for the enterprises and industry involved.</P>
      <P>The notification is still under consideration. I am, therefore, not yet in a position to indicate what my decision will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with me that it is now the view that foreign banks who behaved imprudently to the point of irresponsibility are set to exact their pound of flesh at the expense of Irish farmers and workers, specifically that this amounts to a tax on farmers that would be brought about by imposing a reduction in the price of cattle and by giving the international banks a stranglehold on the Irish meat industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has put that in a way that perhaps some of the interested parties in this matter might like to put it but I cannot be taken as <Col N="128" /> accepting that things are exactly as the Deputy has put them.  There are pros and cons.  I have received representations from different sides.  I will weigh them up and bear them all in mind before taking a decision in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Pros and cons are all right but is not the question that must be posed: have we learned anything from this terrible experience?  One man is still set to dominate this industry, the same man, with all of the pattern that has gone before, with references in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, for example, to his managing to hold on to his £10 million personal assets for a rainy day.  Surely the consequences for the industry, the price exacted by the international banks can be paid for only by artificially depressing the price of cattle and effectively operating a cartel on the price of cattle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made that point adequately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put the question to the Minister this way: does the Minister entirely disregard the views of the IFA, the ICMSA, the UFA and SIPTU?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not entirely disregard their views.  In fact I understand that I have come under criticism for even giving cognisance to their views.  However, the Deputy mentioned three organisations.  I think not all three of them hold the same view.  The last-named organisation, I understand, approves of this; the second-named organisation are divided on this and the first-named organisation are opposed to it.  So there are different views on the matter.  The Deputy mentioned that under the proposals, the same man who has dominated the Irish beef industry for some time would continue to dominate it.  The details of the proposals would not bear out that statement of the Deputy. First, it is envisaged that less capacity <Col N="129" /> would be involved and, second, it is envisaged that, for a period of seven years anyway, control of this group would not be exercised by the man who has exercised control over it in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister give any credence to the alternative view which is that there is the capacity within the industry already to take up the slack, that it would be far better in the interests of both sides of industry, suppliers and workers, if the normal process of market forces was allowed to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable capacity within the industry.  One of the difficulties is that it has been the pattern in this trade in Ireland to carry out a lot of the slaughtering in the autumn each year.  If that could be spread more widely throughout the year the very substantial capacity available would be more marked and could be more freely utilised.</P>

      <P>I appeal on a point of order for some flexibility here.  There are three spokespersons in the House.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been the practice to disclose the names of companies availing of the export credit insurance scheme or to give details of the amount of cover they have individually received.  This is confidential information relating to the commercial operation of the companies concerned.  Its disclosure would be inappropriate and would not be in the best interests of the companies concerned.  In any event, it would be virtually impossible for me to give the Deputy details of the names of companies who have held export credit insurance in the period in question as there is a continuous turnover of companies using the facility each year.  I can, however, tell the Deputy that at present there are about 400 companies covered by the scheme involving exports to 20,000 buyers in over 90 countries.  These companies are involved in various manufacturing, processing, distribution and services related activities.  Examples would include food, drink, chemicals, computer and telecommunication equipment, machinery and technical services contracts.</P>
      <P>For the period 1 January 1980 to 30 September 1990 claims paid amounted to £43.3 million.  In the same period recoveries of claims paid amounted to £15.3 million.  Total exports covered by the scheme in the period amounted to roughly £5 billion.  Amounts notified to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland as at 30 September 1990 on which claims might be payable stood at about £12.3 million.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the 1989 and 1990 figures included in the above totals are not audited and have therefore been estimated on the basis of the latest available information.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is a guarantee scheme provided by the State with taxpayers' money, therefore, it is not a question of normal commercial criteria applying.  The rate being charged for export credit insurance to Nigeria or to Iraq was not based on some commercial criteria.  For that reason will the Minister not recognise that there is a duty to disclose openly here in this House those companies who receive these State guarantees and the countries that default in relation to the cover provided?  Otherwise taxpayers do not know the exposure they are involved in or the amount of tax that ultimately, I presume, they will have to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the recent round of intensive price competition between the retail multiples in respect of bread and other grocery items.  I welcome intensive price competition.  Grocery retail outlets are free to compete with each other at whatever price levels they wish as long as they do not contravene the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987.  This order prohibits below-cost selling of certain groceries including bread.</P>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, who has responsibility for enforcing the order, is currently investigating allegations of below-cost selling of bread arising from complaints he received during the so-called &ldquo;price war&rdquo; referred to by the Deputy.  The director has informed me that following consideration of the results of this investigation and the issues raised he will include them in his report to the Fair Trade Commission who are to carry out a review of the 1987 Groceries Order next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from the Minister's reply whether or not the director found there was a price war.  He is just going to include the results of his <Col N="136" /> investigation in his report to the Fair Trade Commission.  Did he find there was a price war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A price war is something one reads about in newspapers.  It is not a legal concept.  The newspapers tend to put it in banner headlines to suggest that there is something wrong with intensive competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no law in this country against price wars or intensive competition.  In fact, I welcome competition which we have in most parts of the grocery trade.  Unfortunately, we do not have it in many other areas where prices are maintained at particular levels. The only prohibition is on below-cost selling. The director intervened in a recent episode where multiple retailers were giving out vouchers.  He advised them to cease that practice, and I understand they have ceased it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister understands the point I am making quite well, even though I am using the words &ldquo;price war&rdquo;.  I mean the selling of bread below the cost of production, which is against the regulations.  Did the Director of Consumer Affairs find the supermarkets guilty of that and, if so, has he taken any action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings of the director, were, so far as they were reported to me, that he did not find any below-cost selling of bread.  He did not approve of this voucher system that some of them introduced but so far as bread was concerned, he did not find evidence of below-cost selling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the figures in Question No. 23 speak for themselves and that many bakeries and retail outlets are engaged in a kind of commercial canabalism over the core product when they have the plant, the technology and capacity to corner <Col N="137" /> what is a huge market, that is, the £139 million worth of confectionery imported to this country last year; that things would be exacerbated by the closure of Gateaux and that there is huge scope there, particularly in view of the &ldquo;Strategy for the Food and Drink Industry, 1988 to 1992&rdquo;, published by the IDA?  That is an area that could be looked upon usefully by the bakeries, given the proper stimuli.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are any significant imports of bread into this country.  Confectionery, in a broader sense, is important.  The question, however, relates to bread and to the bakery industry.  We are obviously subject to the possibility of imports.  The difficulty with the bakery industry, which has been widely recognised here, is that because for many years there was a heavy State subsidy of bread, the industry never rationalised itself when other similar industries were doing so.  Unfortunately, we are going through the situation at the moment where that rationalisation is catching up and there are a small number of highly efficient firms in the country who are able to produce bread at a much lower price than the average.  The fact that it is much lower than the average does not mean that it is below cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of very large modern bakeries are maintaining that the price being charged in some instances by some supermarkets is just not possible without below-cost selling?  Is he aware of the figures that have been produced by some bakeries which clearly indicate that a way has been found of getting around the regulation prohibiting below-cost selling? I agree with the Minister that competition is very good and healthy and in the interests of the consumer.  Would the Minister not agree, however, that whilst being keen on open competition, we could bring about a monopoly situation which would not eventually be in the interests of consumers, such as the price wars between two large supermarket chains which would ultimately bring about the demise of other supermarkets <Col N="138" /> and particularly the small corner shop? Would the Minister not agree that we must find a balance between open competition and the efforts to create a monopoly which would ultimately destroy competition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am always striving to do, but it is not always easy to achieve.  The Deputy should look at that trade in the light of the Competition Bill which will be introduced shortly and where I think it will be possible to look at matters a bit differently and where, if there is any evidence of the abuse of a dominant position, it will be possible not just for the Minister but for individuals who might be damaged to take action in regard to such abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the 1991 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1991 Summary Public Capital Programme.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice since 1987 to afford this House the opportunity to debate the Government's spending plans for the following year before the Christmas recess and I am once again happy to be able to facilitate such a discussion.</P>
      <P>The publication of the Estimates this year somewhat later than in previous years stems from the difficult task which faces us on the budgetary front in 1991, and the painstaking and detailed way in which the Government set about the job of determining the Estimates, line-by-line, so as to keep expenditure at its lowest practicable level in 1991.</P>
      <P>Policy on public expenditure is part of the Government's overall economic and budgetary strategy.  That strategy has been, and remains, to secure the highest possible rate of sustainable economic growth.  The objective is not just growth itself, rather the employment opportunities for Irish men and women, the higher living standards for those at work, and the extra capacity to serve the disadvantaged which growth makes possible. These are the essentials of the better future and a fairer deal for everyone which our efforts aim to achieve.</P>
      <P>As a small open economy, our fortunes are inescapably linked with developments in world markets, and determined by our ability to exploit those markets. We must be recognised as a stable, competitive economy if the investment necessary for future growth is to be made here rather than go elsewhere.  These simple facts of life dictate the key strands of policy &mdash; economic, monetary and budgetary &mdash; which make up the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our firm commitment to maintenance of the value of the IR£ within the EMS is central to investors' perceptions of <Col N="266" /> stability.  This commitment to maintain the value of the IR£ will continue.</P>
    <P>Just as important to investment perceptions and indeed to interest rates is the fiscal stance.  A public debt which continues to decline as a share of GNP, lessening the burden of debt/service and the associated need for taxes, is essential if the gains of recent years in terms of improved interest rate differentials are to be consolidated and built upon.  This is one of the reasons we are committed to bringing the debt/GNP ratio down towards 100 per cent by 1993.  The other is to remove the risks that go with having a debt/GNP ratio that is too high.  We have already achieved very significant progress in that regard with the debt/GNP ratio falling from 131 per cent in 1987 to 119 per cent in 1989.  I expect that the final figures for this year will show a further significant reduction in the ratio.</P>
    <P>Continued moderation in cost developments right across the spectrum is a third vital ingredient.  I say &ldquo;right across the spectrum&rdquo; because I want to emphasise that its not just a matter of wage moderation. We must all be prepared, employers and workers, sheltered and exposed sectors alike, to tailor our demands to a basic reality.  Our costs cannot outpace &mdash; indeed, must rise more slowly than &mdash; those of our narrow-band EMS partners if we are to prosper in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a fourth strand of policy &mdash; structural reform.  Old ways of organising our affairs are far from ideal in the integrated world markets of the nineties; and have not delivered adequately, down through the years.  We have to get our priorities right.  Public policies must concentrate on the avenues which best enhance our capacity for growth, while underpinning the position of the genuinely disadvantaged.  We have to get our incentives right.  Effort and enterprise must obtain fair reward.</P>
    <P>We have to utilise all our resources to the best effect.  If changes in existing practice or regulation can better serve our aims for growing employment and income, we must bring about these <Col N="267" /> changes.  We must use the resources we can devote to social policies so that they have the greatest possible impact in tackling real social problems and help the genuinely disadvantaged as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The economic and budgetary strategy we have followed for the past few years has been clear, consistent and credible and it has delivered results.  It is essential that we build on those results.</P>
    <P>The Government welcome the report of the National Economic and Social Council, <i>A Strategy for the Nineties.</i> This report states that the outstanding lesson of the <i>Programme for National Recovery 1987-1990</i> is that economic stability and a competitive development of incomes are vital to economic progress.  It sees continuity in the fiscal policies, which have been so successful under the programme, as essential.  It endorses the Government's key fiscal target of a national debt/GNP ratio of about 100 per cent by 1993, and also recommends that the current budget deficit and the EBR be kept on a sustained downward path in the interim.  The council consider that to achieve these goals, there should be no real increase in public sector activity on average over the years to 1993.</P>
    <P>The economic environment within which our economic and budgetary policy will operate and develop in future years will be different to what it has been up to now.  The European Community dimension, consequent upon our participation in economic and monetary union, will assume increasing importance. Indeed, we have already embarked upon the first stage of that union which will see closer co-ordination of economic and monetary policies generally.</P>
    <P>Starting on Saturday last, 15 December, the Community began negotiations on the Treaty amendments necessary to secure EMU.  Fundamental to the success of that union will be sound and sustainable financial and budgetary conditions. Agreement has already been reached that excessive budget deficits will be avoided.  Furthermore, monetary financing of budget deficits will be <Col N="268" /> expressly prohibited.  Both these measures will be reflected in the text of any amended Treaty which emerges from the conference on EMU.</P>
    <P>With the entry of sterling into the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system, a welcome element of stability has been introduced into the management of our economy. Another vital element of stage one is the complete removal of exchange controls. We have already moved a long way towards our goal of full capital liberalisation. Recently I announced a series of significant measures, which will advance our progress further.</P>
    <P>The true test of the value of the economic and budgetary strategy which we have been pursuing is whether it actually delivers results.  By any standards, the progress achieved already has been remarkable.  Growth in output and employment has been strong, inflation has been low and very substantial progress has been made in correcting budgetary imbalances.</P>
    <P>The average rate of growth in real GNP of 4 per cent in the period 1987 to 1989 was double the rate achieved in the early eighties and was higher than the average of about 3½ per cent in the European Community as a whole.  This year GNP growth is likely to be close to 5 per cent &mdash; broadly similar to the 1989 performance and again will be ahead of the expected EC average.</P>
    <P>This recovery in our economic performance over the last few years has not been confined to a narrow area of activity.  It is broadly based, covering both the foreign sectors and the domestic economy.  There has been a significant increase since 1987 in the volume of personal consumption, in contrast to the first half of the eighties.  The combined effects of increased disposable income following growth in employment, cuts in personal taxation, increased consumer confidence, and falling interest rates were largely responsible for this turn-about. The strong performance of the tourist industry, as borne out by the increase in the number of people visiting this country <Col N="269" /> in recent years, has also undoubtedly played a part.</P>
    <P>While consumer spending increased by 5¼ per cent in 1989, some slowdown in the growth rate is indicated by the trend in retail sales in 1990 to date.  Nevertheless, personal consumption is likely to increase by about 3½ per cent this year.</P>
    <P>A major element of economic strategy has been to lower inflation and to keep the rate of increase in our costs in line with, or preferably, below that of our trading partners.</P>
    <P>Before the Gulf crisis broke, inflation here had been brought down to just under 3 per cent &mdash; around the same as the German rate and well below the double digit level then prevailing in the United Kingdom.  While the higher price of oil was an inflationary force this autumn, its impact was more than offset by lower food prices, lower import prices for other goods and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; by our own sensible behaviour in regard to wage increases under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>A most encouraging feature of recent economic developments has been the very strong investment performance. Last year, after a period of almost continual decline since 1982, investment grew strongly with both the main components of investment &mdash; machinery and equipment and building and construction &mdash; contributing.</P>
    <P>Investment is again performing strongly in 1990.  In the first ten months of the year, imports of capital goods were up by an estimated 8 per cent in real terms on the same period in 1989, indicating that business is continuing to invest in new machinery and equipment.  In the building and construction area, activity remains strong particularly in areas such as infrastructure assisted by the EC Structural Funds programmes, and commercial construction.</P>
    <P>Industrial output has also been quite buoyant in recent years, rising at an average rate of just over 9 per cent between 1987 and 1989.  The manufacturing sector has been the main source of this growth.  High technology sectors were to <Col N="270" /> the forefront in the earlier years. However, more recently the contribution of the traditional sectors improved.</P>
    <P>This year industrial output has risen by just 4 per cent in the first eight months. This slowdown relative to last year's growth has been most evident in the high technology sectors.  The remainder of manufacturing, which includes the more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; sectors, has maintained satisfactory growth.</P>
    <P>The balance in our trade and payments with the rest of the world also improved considerably following decades of deficits in the current account.  We are now paying our way in the world.  In 1988 and 1989 we had a balance of payments surplus of around 2 per cent of GNP and the surplus is being maintained this year.</P>
    <P>This balance of payments surplus reflects: the continuing strong performance of our exports which have grown by an estimated further 8 per cent in volume in the first ten months of this year; increased Structural Funds transfers from the European Community under the Community Support Framework which are underpinning stronger investment and helping us prepare for the challenges of &ldquo;1992&rdquo;; higher EC agricultural transfers which are helping to ameliorate the difficult situation facing farmers this year in relation to agricultural exports and prices; and the increased numbers of tourists who visited this country this year.</P>
    <P>Despite having to pay more for our oil imports, the balance of payments will remain in substantial surplus this year. With a surplus of over £400 million in the first half of the year, the current account surplus for the whole of 1990 should be in line with that of 1988 and 1989, if not better.</P>
    <P>By far the most conclusive proof of the success of the economic strategy pursued in the last few years has been the growth in employment.  The preliminary results of the 1990 Labour Force Survey indicated an increase in total employment of 30,000 in the 12 months to April 1990. All indicators in the period since April give clear evidence of further growth in employment: in the three months to June <Col N="271" /> manufacturing employment &mdash; seasonally adjusted &mdash; increased by over 2,000, giving a net annual increase of 7,000.  Non-agricultural employment growth has been better than I expected at budget time.  Employment in the larger private sector firms in building and construction grew by 9 per cent in the first nine months of this year as compared with the same period last year.  Private sector services employment has grown strongly, particularly in tourism-related areas.</P>
    <P>Over the duration of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, total non-farm private sector employment will have increased by about 70,000.  This provides the clearest demonstration of the gains resulting from the consensus achieved under the programme and shows that further gains can be achieved if this consensus is renewed.</P>
    <P>In 1989, we improved our competitiveness, in terms of hourly earnings in manufacturing industry, against most of our trading partners.  Moderate pay increases, combined with a general fall in the Irish pound's exchange rate, made this possible.  This year there has been some minor erosion of these gains, though not against the other EMS narrow band members, because of a strengthening of the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>Despite the gains in employment, unemployment is still a major problem. For 1990 as a whole, unemployment, as measured by the live register, should fall on average by some 7,000.  This fall is less than had been forecast at budget time. The shortfall is due to a slowing of emigration because of the deterioration in the UK and US economies.  All the evidence points to this reduction in emigration, rather than any under-performance on employment growth as the explanation for the live register position.</P>
    <P>This year's budget continued on the path of responsible financial management which is so important to economic progress. It was widely welcomed as a sympathetic and balanced response to the needs of those seeking jobs, of taxpayers <Col N="272" /> and of the least well-off in the community, through a well-thought-out package of measures aimed at bettering job prospects on an enduring basis, improving the structure of taxation, and looking after those on social welfare and on low incomes.</P>
    <P>It could be said that the 1990 budget represented the culmination of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It was, indeed, a justification of the overall economic strategy pursued in accordance with the programme, since it was the strategy's wider success that made these provisions possible.  The measures introduced last January, together with the steps taken in 1988 and 1989, met in full the commitments given by the Government in the programme.  In fact, they went further in many respects, making a significant start towards the objectives established in the Programme for Government.  It should be clear to all that the difficult decisions we took over the past few years have paid off, not only by way of growth and jobs, but also in terms of enabling us to address the issues of taxation and poverty in a very tangible way.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the improvement in budgetary performance is being maintained through 1990.  The trends reflected in the end-September Exchequer returns indicate that the level of borrowing by the Exchequer this year would be broadly in line with the budget estimate of 2.1 per cent of GNP.  Developments since then indicate the prospect of Exchequer borrowing coming in below the budget target for the fourth year in succession.</P>
    <P>The main contribution to the good budgetary performance this year is once again coming from the buoyancy of tax revenue.  Corporation tax revenues are running well ahead of expectations and PAYE receipts are also set to come in ahead of projections.  Corporation tax receipts could end up over 50 per cent above the budget estimate.  This dramatic improvement reflects, of course, the introduction of self-assessment for companies as well as the cumulative effects of the changes made in the corporation tax regime over the past few years. Though some of the buoyancy now <Col N="273" /> evident may reflect timing factors, notably a bringing forward of receipts under the self-assessment system, the size of the increase testifies to the success of the Government's policy of raising the tax yield from the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>The PAYE improvement reflects a combination of better collection from employers and a better employment performance than had been expected.  At budget time, the expectation was that non-agricultural employment would increase by 16,000.  The present indications are, however, that the actual figure could be over 20,000.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side of the 1990 budget, the indications are that there will be some overruns in the current and capital areas.  There is also likely to be a shortfall in the planned receipts from the EC, mainly down to timing factors.  The improved tax revenue receipts are, however, more than compensating for the higher expenditure and the lower EC receipts with the effect, as I have said, that the budget target should be bettered once again this year.</P>
    <P>Setting the expenditure allocations for 1991 proved to be an extremely difficult task.  A number of inescapable factors combined to put upward pressure on expenditure, such as the £100 million carryover cost of this year's budget welfare increases, the need for us to spend more on programmes attracting EC Structural Funds, and the carryover cost of sanctioned special pay increases.  The Government were determined to avoid taking measures which would adversely affect the less well off, or would damage vital public services.</P>
    <P>As in previous years, and notwithstanding pressures and demands for additional spending, the Government's approach in settling the Estimates was firmly based on the principle that there must be continuing constraint on expenditure. Public spending is and will remain under firm control.  In its deliberations on the Estimates the Government actively searched for ways to reduce spending by curtailing allocations to programmes not deemed to be absolutely essential, and by seeking greater efficiency in the use of <Col N="274" /> resources in all programmes, even the most essential.  Allocations for 1991 were allowed to increase only where there were decisive economic or social arguments for it.</P>
    <P>The results of our work are an increase of 4 per cent in the provision for non-capital spending in 1991, marginally above the projected inflation rate of about 3 per cent and an increase in Exchequer-funded capital investment of 5 per cent, with the total Public Capital Programme set to rise by 7 per cent.  Total Exchequer-funded expenditure, current and capital, is set to rise by about 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the work on the 1991 Estimates does not stop here. The Government intend to review the published Estimates allocations before budget time to seek out further reduction possibilities in the light of the emerging outturn figures for this year and the changing domestic and international economic environment.  Other Government Ministers contributing to this debate will be discussing in more detail the implications of the Estimates for their own spending areas, but I would also like to make some general comments on the major spending allocations.</P>
    <P>The provision showing the largest nominal increase in spending is that for the health services.  The net total Vote for health in 1991 amounts to £1,355 million, representing an increase of over £100 million on the budget provision for 1990 and a cost of about £25 per week for every household in the country.  When account is taken of the 1990 outturn, after the Supplementary Estimate of almost £38 million, the increase is about £63 million or under 5 per cent.  This rate of increase shows that there is no relaxation on the part of the Government in maintaining control on health spending.</P>
    <P>While respecting the constraints imposed by the need to bring order to the public finances, welfare rates since 1987 have been increased by this Government at least in line with the rate of inflation and, in some cases such as the long term unemployed, substantial additional increases have been given.  In fact, <Col N="275" /> nobody who must rely on welfare for support has been left behind in the general recovery in the economy.</P>
    <P>The published provision for social welfare at £1,554 million is £78 million or 5 per cent higher than the 1990 budget allocation and reflects in large part the carryover costs of this year's budget welfare improvements.</P>
    <P>We have also been both imaginative and innovative in our approach towards helping those on welfare.  There have been new schemes such as the carer's allowance; an overhaul of the plethora of existing schemes for lone parents into a new, consolidated lone parent's allowance; and extensions such as the supplement to the fuel allowance scheme for additional smokeless fuel costs.  These changes are the mark of a Government who are actively concerned about improving the plight of the less-privileged.</P>
    <P>There has been inadequate recognition of the extent of the upratings and reforms in welfare provision carried through by this Government over the past few years. These have been expensive; improvements since 1987 account for about £500 million of 1991 gross social welfare expenditure before any 1991 budgetary increases.  This should be borne in mind by those who propose additional welfare expenditures, proposals which at times are unrealistic by reference to our resources.</P>
    <P>Given all that we have achieved on the welfare front, and the difficult budget facing us in 1991, it is essential that there is a sense of balance and realism in considering what can reasonably be achieved in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to law and order is reflected in the 1991 allocations for the Justice group of Votes. Overall expenditure next year will increase by £30 million.  Expenditure on prisons will increase by 11 per cent.  We intend to significantly strengthen the staffing of the prisons and provision has been made for the recruitment of up to 170 prison staff, including medical orderlies, by reducing the very high level of <Col N="276" /> overtime in the prisons.  An extensive refurbishment programme is underway in St. Patrick's Institution.  This will include significant improvements to the women's prison.  The construction of an infectious diseases unit in Mountjoy will commence to provide the proper hygienic accommodation for offenders suffering from Hepatitis-B and the AIDS virus.  I am also making provision in the education area for the construction in Finglas of a new centre for young girl offenders.  The facility for boys at Ard Mhuire in Lusk which at present is not in use will also benefit next year from a major refurbishment prior to reopening.</P>
    <P>The funds made available for the prevention of crime and traffic law enforcement have considerably increased over the past two years.  In the coming year, funding is being provided to bring Garda numbers close to an all time high.  Including recruits in training, numbers will increase to over 11,000 by the end of 1991.  We will also have increased by the end of the current year civilian staff to a level of 600, thereby releasing an equivalent number of gardaí onto the beat.</P>
    <P>Other areas which the Government intend to strengthen include the scheme of civil legal aid and advice and the Garda Síochána Complaints Board.  The financial allocations for both these bodies are being substantially increased.  Deputies may have noticed that the financial provision for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is being reduced for next year.  However, a Supplementary Estimate for £4 million has been introduced this year to significantly reduce the backlog of outstanding awards.</P>
    <P>The provision for Exchequer pay and pensions already included in the Estimates is £3,264 million, an increase of 4.5 per cent on 1990.  The pay and pensions bill now accounts for almost 54 per cent of total net spending on non-capital supply services.</P>
    <P>Deferred implementation of the full costs of special pay increses under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> gave the Exchequer some breathing space during 1988, 1989 and 1990.  However, large liabilities have accrued which fall to <Col N="277" /> be met in 1991 and 1992.  These commitments are now placing a considerable and increasing burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Abridged Estimate Volume already includes an additional £54 million in respect of the cost of sanctioned special pay increases.  The outcome to a number of other claims, which are currently being processed, is expected shortly.  A further provision will have to be made in the 1991 budget for any increases in pay recommended on foot of these claims.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are taking place on a new pay agreement as part of the current discussions on a new programme for economic and social development.  The cost of any general round increase that may be agreed will have to be provided for next year.  It is not possible, at this stage of the negotiations with the social partners, to predict the level of increase that may emerge.</P>
    <P>The numbers employed in the public service in 1990 averaged approximately 197,000.  It is expected that there will be a slight increase in numbers in 1991 to around 198,000.  This is due mainly to increased staffing levels in the health sector because of the implementation of the 39 hour week and improvements in the child care and mentally handicapped services.</P>
    <P>While recruitment may be permitted in areas of particular need, the emphasis in 1991 will continue to be on consolidating the reductions in staff numbers already achieved.  There is no question of a general resumption in public service employment creation.</P>
    <P>On the question of the costs of running the Civil Service administration, I said as far back as my 1989 Budget Statement that I was examining the possibility of fixing Departments' administrative budgets on a three year cycle which would involve a real reduction in funding each year because of greater efficiency but which would allow greater managerial flexibility within these budgets.  A three year administrative budget has already been agreed for the Department of Social Welfare.  Under this agreement the management of the Department of Social Welfare have certainty in relation to the <Col N="278" /> administrative resources at their disposal for the next three years and much greater discretion as to how they deploy these resources.  In the context of settling the 1991 Estimates, the Government decided that these arrangements should be extended to all Departments by 1 March 1991 at the latest.  I am certain that this approach will stimulate improved management practices in all Departments while at the same time ensuring that the cost of running the Civil Service remains in harmony with the Government's overall public expenditure plans.</P>
    <P>This year the Abridged Estimates Volume shows for the first time the allocations of national lottery funds for 1991. Lottery funded items are provided for the identified subheads in the relevant Votes, while an annex at the end of the volume brings them all together.  This presentation was used in the Revised Estimates Volume for 1990 but this is the first time lottery allocations have been listed in the Abridged Estimates Volume.</P>
    <P>Nineteen ninety-one will see real growth in the Public Capital Programme for the second year in succession.  The 1991 programme, at £1,811 million, is 7 per cent up in cash terms on 1990.</P>
    <P>Exchequer-financed expenditure is up by £39 million while non-Exchequer financed spending, which consists for the most part of spending by the commercial State-sponsored body sector, will grow by £79 million.  The Exchequer will spend an additional £50 million during 1991 on PCP programmes supported from the EC Structural Funds.  In order to accommodate this, aggregate expenditure on other Exchequer-financed programmes has been reduced.  The Government are confident that the higher level of public sector investment next year will consolidate recent upward trends in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The provision in the PCP affecting the building industry is £51 million, or 5 per cent higher than that provided in the current year, with a £15 million increase for roads, £12 million for construction in tourism areas, a £14 million increase in industrial sector construction <Col N="279" /> and an increase of £24.6 million in the Exchequer's provision for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The allocation for agriculture is up by 10 per cent to £126 million.  This increase reflects, in the main, spending under the integrated rural development programme, which is an operational programme under the Community Support Framework which we expect will be approved shortly by the Commission, and for which £11.5 million Exchequer funding has been allocated as against less than £1 million this year.</P>
    <P>Tourism allocations will increase by more than one third from £43 million to £58 million.  The operational programme for tourism under the Community Support Framework provides for an extra £10 million for Bórd Fáilte and for SFADCo for first, a scheme of grants to private operators for non-accommodation tourism projects, and second, grants to local authorities and regional tourism bodies for non-commercial tourism projects.  There will also be a major expansion of investment in forestry, again under the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>A major expansion in Exchequer investment in regional technical colleges from £8.5 million to £14 million is also provided for.  This is being supported under the Community Support Framework and provides for the building of Tallaght RTC and the enhancement and replacement of existing RTC/DIT buildings.</P>
    <P>What I have said makes clear the important influence which the Structural Funds now have on our spending and investment programmes.</P>
    <P>The Community Support Framework for Ireland concluded more than a year ago has been translated into increased spending at programme level.  Already nine of the operational programmes under the CSF have been approved and the remaining three programmes &mdash; rural development, vocational training infrastructure and training of trainers, and objective 4 &mdash; occupational integration of young people &mdash; are expected to be approved shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The total commitments made to Ireland in respect of 1990 expenditure amounted to 631 MECU or almost £487 million.  The commitments for 1991 will amount to almost 767 MECU or £591 million, which shows an increase of 21.5 per cent over the commitments relating to 1990.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with prospects for the coming year.  The Government are now engaged in important negotiations with the social partners on a new programme to succeed the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It is our aim to achieve the same type of consensus in this new programme as we did in the PNR.  The objectives for the economy have not changed; they are to maximise sustainable employment growth and to continue the path of fiscal adjustment.  In order to attain these twin objectives the terms of any new programme must ensure that we have pay moderation so that we can continue to improve our competitiveness against our narrow-band EMS partners in Europe.  This is essential if we are to have the investment and employment growth which the economy requires, particularly with the completion of the internal market coming ever closer.  These terms must also be consistent with the Government's medium-term fiscal objectives which have been endorsed by NESC.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the PNR, our economy was in dire straits but the international environment was good.  Since then our economy has improved considerably and is now much healthier than in 1987, but the external environment facing us in 1991 will be a lot tougher. The short term outlook for our major trading partners has, at least temporarily, been clouded both by the Gulf crisis and by the advent of recession in the United Kingdom and the United States.  It would be unrealistic for us in this country to expect to remain immune from the impact of a slowing down in our export markets.  Slower growth among our trading partners places an even greater onus on us to remain competitive so as to increase our share of markets which are less buoyant.</P>
    <P>Despite the Gulf situation and the <Col N="281" /> more pessimistic view of the external environment, the domestic economy is still growing at a satisfactory pace though somewhat less quickly than in the recent past.  The inflationary impact of the Gulf crisis in 1991 may not be too severe because the substantial fall in the exchange rate of the dollar against the EMS currencies this year has mitigated the impact of higher oil prices on import prices.</P>
    <P>However, the potential inflationary impact of the crisis would be much greater if price increases were also to include extra profit margins or if workers were to seek compensation for the transfer of purchasing power to the oil producers. Accelerating inflation, loss of confidence in the economy, declining employment and rapidly increasing unemployment could follow.  However, if the crisis is peacefully resolved, as we hope it will, we can expect oil prices to fall with a resulting easing of inflation.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that oil prices have risen so rapidly and are remaining so high because of uncertainty and the risk of war in the Gulf rather than because of any major shift in the fundamental balance between supply and demand for oil.  When the Gulf crisis is resolved oil prices may begin to fall again fairly quickly.  All of us, Government, business and trade unions alike, should bear in mind in our assessments the likely rate of inflation for next year and beyond.  We must not allow present uncertainties to distract us from the longer-term fundamentals which on the whole are favourable.</P>
    <P>That the 1991 budgetary position for next year is particularly difficult is evident from the published Estimates.  There is a small real increase in overall allocations. On budget day, provision will have to be made for agreed special pay increases, in addition to the cost of any new general pay agreement and for welfare improvements. It is abundantly clear that there will be very limited room for manoeuvre in next year's budget if we are to stay on course for our medium-term goals.</P>
    <P>Beyond any temporary slowing down <Col N="282" /> which may occur in 1991, the longer-term prospects for growth in our trading partners, especially our continental European Community partners, are still very promising.  How much we can benefit from this depends greatly on our own conduct.  We as a Government, will continue to implement the appropriate economic policies.  Likewise, businessmen and employees should appreciate the pay-off in terms of job security and real gains in disposable income which continued cost moderation delivers.  Business, in particular, must plan to exploit fully new market opportunities especially in the Europe beyond 1992.  If we continue to pull together sensibly, I am confident that we can look forward to stronger economic growth in the medium term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As war clouds gather over the Persian Gulf there is widespread uncertainty about the future.  Uncertainty about the future is undermining profits and is already deepening the recession in the United Kingdom and magnifying the economic problems in the United States.  Ireland cannot stand aside from the effects of world events.  There are no barriers behind which we can hide and remain immune from changing international circumstances. Our volume and value of external trade is comparatively high and consequently international events impact very quickly on our economy.  This is especially true of events in the UK which impact almost immediately on us. Against this background a Minister for Finance must be prudent.  He cannot control international events.  His influence over such events either alone or within the context of the EC is slight, and yet he must make budgetary decisions against an ever-changing international background.  It is a year when a prudent Minister should be cautious.  He should not act in a manner which reinforces adverse international forces.  He should not undermine confidence in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that this is precisely what the Minister has done in this Book of Estimates. The Minister has commenced a <Col N="283" /> budgetary process which will undermine confidence, will increase interest rates, will put pressure on the exchange rate, and damage the national interest.  This Book of Estimates is increasing spending by far too much.  If we accept the Minister's figure overall, spending will increase by 4 per cent, but when allowances are made for the carry-over effect of last year's budgetary decisions, for a modest increase in pay and social welfare in the 1991 budget, for special pay increases in the pipeline, spending overall will increase by 81 per cent, which is more than three times the rate of inflation based on last week's leaked inflation rate figure of 2.7 per cent.  Three times the inflation rate in expenditure in one year is a major increase indeed, especially against such an uncertain background.</P>
    <P>There will not be sufficient buoyancy of revenue next year to meet this increase in expenditure.  If there were, our staggering high national debt together with our scandalous unemployment and emigration levels should dictate other priorities. The Government are taking a grave risk in this Book of Estimates.  It is clear that the Minister for Finance lost the argument in Cabinet and the lion Departments for the second year in a row are increasing public expenditure by far more than the rate of inflation.  The Minister for Finance, or at least his officials, know this.  In the press statement which accompanies the Book of Estimates the Minister said that the Government were determined to continue with the policy of expenditure restraint which had contributed so significantly to the recovery in economic performance of the past few years and which was endorsed by the NESC in their report &ldquo;A Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo; and that between now and the budget the Government would review the scope for further reductions in the light of the outturn figures for this year and the change in domestic and international economic environment.</P>
    <P>This clearly lets the cat out of the bag, and the Minister in an exercise of whistling past the graveyard is threatening his Cabinet colleagues that he will look for <Col N="284" /> cuts between now and budget day.  He has some chance of getting them.  This statement by the Minister included in the press statement, no doubt on the advice of his wiser civil servants, is a stronger and more damaging criticism of this Book of Estimates than any remarks which will be made in the House today.  The Minister through his failure to control public spending has left himself with two options, one to increase borrowing and the other to increase tax.  The Minister has commitments however, at domestic and EC level which will make it very difficult for him to significantly increase taxation, and I am afraid that he has left himself with little option but to increase borrowing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister returns again to the strategy of the late seventies and early eighties of paying for increased Government spending through increasing the Exchequer borrowing requirement, he will have struck a fatal blow to the prospects for economic recovery and will have condemned a generation of young Irish men and women to the dole queues and the emigration ship.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach were last in Government from 1977 to 1982 they trebled the national debt.  It took the rest of the decade to loosen the iron grip of this debt on our national life.  Under the Minister's predecessor, the present Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, supported by Fine Gael with the Tallaght strategy, great progress was made in controlling public expenditure and reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement. This Minister is losing control of public expenditure.  This is the second year in which he has increased public expenditure by more than the rate of inflation. He got away with it this year because strong revenue buoyancy kept him out of trouble.  I doubt if he will be so lucky next year.  This Book of Estimates not only undermines confidence but the adverse effects of the undermining of confidence will follow quickly in its wake.  Interest rates are already set to rise.  The Central Bank, by intervention in the market, has prevented an increase over the last three <Col N="285" /> weeks.  Yesterday, they threw in the towel and all independent commentators believe that a rise in interest rates is now inevitable.  For the first time in six months the exchange rate has come under pressure and while it is hoped that as interest rates increase this will stabilise the exchange rate, there is no guarantee of this, especially in circumstances where the Government policy on both interest rates and exchange rates is increasingly uncertain and unclear.</P>
    <P>The recent growth in this economy has been based on lowering the Exchequer borrowing requirement every year, maintaining a strong exchange rate and aiming for low inflation, low interest rates and low competitive costs.  The Minister continues to be verbally committed to these policies but, by his deeds, is undermining the very policies in which he expresses commitment.  By doing so he condemns the country to lower growth, continuing high unemployment and emigration, high tax and under funded services.  I believe the Minister for Finance now has priorities other than the control of public expenditure: the crisis in agriculture, the negotiation of the next pay agreement, the problems with the partners in Government &mdash; the Progressive Democrats &mdash; the rifts within Fianna Fáil and the smouldering leadership contest within that party are now dictating the pace.  The next budget which will flow from this Book of Estimates will be first and foremost a political budget dictated by political considerations rather than by considerations of economic management.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister, because of the present political problems of the Administration, does not take short term, ill conceived decisions which will condemn the country to poverty and stagnation through the nineties.  It is important to learn from the lessons of the past.  The conventional wisdom is that since 1987 public expenditure has been cut right, left and centre and that the declining Exchequer borrowing requirement is as a result of slashing public expenditure.  This is partly true; it is about 30 per cent of the truth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> Most of the progress in reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement was achieved, not by cutting public expenditure, but by very strong revenue buoyancy. Real expenditure has increased under this Minister in this year and will increase dramatically next year.  If we have a year &mdash; and next year with the clouds of war over the world may be such a year &mdash; when increasing expenditure is paralleled by a fall in revenue we will be plunged into crisis.  We will be back to the days of those forgotten Ministers for Finance: Deputy Michael O'Kennedy and Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, when Government Estimates were a wish list and budgets a work of fiction, when spending plans bore as little relationship to matching revenue as a child's letter to Santa Claus does to the income of a parent on the dole.</P>
    <P>I am constantly surprised that the Government have not taken the opportunity in recent years to restructure public expenditure.  It is much easier to restructure expenditure in a growing economy than in a static one and a major opportunity to do this restructuring has now been lost.  Despite the cutbacks of the eighties almost every spending programme is still in place in the Book of Estimates.  Many of these programmes are under funded according to civil servants, the Ministers and their parent Departments.  The Estimates campaign is a struggle by the lion Departments to ensure adequate funding from the Department of Finance for these programmes. The lion Departments will always win when a weak Minister, hungry for popularity, is Minister for Finance.  A thorough restructuring of public expenditure, after a carful examination of all the programmes, which would result in the dropping of programmes no longer considered necessary seems to me a more fruitful way to make progress.</P>
    <P>I want also to ask the Minister for Finance to make clear in a statement at the conclusion of this debate what the Government policy is on the sale of State assets.  What is the scope of the policy in this respect? Does it extend beyond Irish life, the Irish Sugar Company and ICC? <Col N="287" /> What criteria do the Government apply when deciding to sell an asset? Are they committed to dedicating the proceeds of the sale to the reduction of the national debt or are there circumstances in which they would envisage the proceeds of such sales being used to fund current expenditure? I would be grateful if the Minister in his reply would make a clear statement on Government policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>My Front Bench colleagues will comment on individual Estimates.  In dealing with individual Estimates I will confine my remarks to two particular Estimates: the Vote for the Central Statistics Office and one subhead in particular &mdash; Gl &mdash; in the Department of Justice Estimate. That Vote, to which the Minister referred in his speech, is an absolute disgrace.  It relates to the criminal injuries compensation tribunal.  The Minister for Justice has gained an amount of favourable publicity in announcing an increase in his Estimate of £20 million, presented as a package to fight crime.  The Minister will bring law and order to our streets and slam trouble makers into jail before riding off into the sunset at a mere additional cost of £20 million to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>At the same time, in Vote Gl, the vote which compensates victims of crime for injuries inflicted on them by criminals there is a reduction of 50 per cent, the allocation being reduced from £2 million to £1 million.  This is done where there is already a two and a half year waiting list for payment for those who have agreed the level of compensation.</P>
    <P>Mr. A. Reynolds: You missed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will deal with the Minister's point.  It is not those who have been injured, not those who have made application but those who have entered into agreement with the tribunal on a settlement figure: there is a two and a half year waiting list from that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. A. Reynolds: We wiped it out this <Col N="288" /> year by way of the supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is not so.  It is running at a level of £2 million a year and there is a two and a half year waiting list from the time of agreement. The Minister for Justice has agreed with the Minister for Finance to put in a provision which will fund half year claims. You will reduce the waiting list with the Supplementary Estimate but you certainly have not provided sufficiently in this year's Book of Estimates for injuries inflicted by criminals on victims.  I could understand if it was an Estimate cutting public expenditure but the Minister would have to go right through the Book of Estimates to find another cut of that significance.  This is in a vote for Justice which increases expenditure by about £30 million.  It is a mean, callous, uncaring cut and certainly presents a different image of the Minister for Justice from the one he likes to present when he is announcing good news on the media.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the Central Statistics Office is dramatically increased.  I presume the increase of over £10 million or 109 per cent is due mostly to costs arising from the 1991 census of population.  I have always found the Central Statistics Office both efficient and helpful.  They have figured prominently in the media in recent days arising from the leak of the inflation figures to certain players in the stock market.  I am surprised at the Taoiseach's attitude in trying to talk down the damage caused by this leak but I am even more surprised at his attempt to pin the blame for the leak on the CSO by appointing its director to investigate the leak.  This morning The Irish Times editorial dealt with the issues in a very precise way and it is worth quoting their remarks:</P>
      <P>Whoever leaked the information, whether through carelessness or in a calculated way, has done no service to the development of the Dublin financial markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A thorough investigation is necessary to reassure the public and the <Col N="289" /> international investment community that standards matter in the State's financial affairs.  Even more important is the coming into law of the provisions of the Companies Bill 1987 which makes insider dealing an offence.</P>
    <P>Arising from that the Taoiseach's inquiry is totally inadequate.  I call on him now to institute a full inquiry with terms of reference to include the power to call witnesses and sub-poena evidence so that the source of this leak, no matter at how high a level he serves, is identified and that arrangements are put in place to prevent a recurrence.  The information on the inflation figure was available not only to officials at a senior level in the Central Statistics Office, it was also available to members of the staff in the Government Information Service who report to the Taoiseach and it was available to certain senior officials in the Department of Finance.  I presume it was also available to certain senior Ministers and it certainly was available to the Taoiseach himself.  I do not understand then why, when an inquiry is instituted, it is confined in its scope and in its power in effect to the Central Statistics Office because the director of the Central Statistics Office has no power to inquire outside his own area of responsibility. He has been given no power to inquire outside his area of responsibility, no power to call witnesses, no power to sub-poena evidence from other Departments, no power to investigate the stock market and no power to gain access to their records.  It seems that the Taoiseach is merely instituting an inquiry in a pro forma way and would be just as happy if he did not find the source of the leak.</P>
    <P>In the light of the comments in the international press it is a very careless and casual way to address an issue which is a major concern now and which will have an adverse effect on the financial markets in Dublin and on Dublin as a financial services centre, unless the matter is cleared up and clarified immediately and arrangements put in place to ensure there is no recurrence of this leak. Finally, I wish the Minister well in his <Col N="290" /> budgetary plans and any other plans he may have.  I am afraid he has made a bad start to the budgetary process in this Book of Estimates and has left himself with very little scope to mend his hand on budget day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notes that the Estimates will do nothing to repair the social and economic damage of the last three years, and notes in particular that:</P>
      <P>&mdash;no money is provided for the hiring of one extra teacher at primary or secondary level &mdash; as a proportion of GNP, overall education spending is 5.6 per cent &mdash; the lowest level since the start of the 1980s;</P>
      <P>&mdash;third world aid, which has been savagely cut in recent years, has been cut again in real terms;</P>
      <P>&mdash;increases in health spending are totally inadequate to meet the needs of long queues for services, and will neither reopen beds nor hire sufficient extra staff &mdash; the proportion of GNP spent on health, according to these Estimates, will be no more than 6.3 per cent;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Social Welfare Estimate will not even begin to paper over the cracks in the extent of poverty in Ireland;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the revenue available to local authorities, many of whom are in crisis, is frozen for another year;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;there will be almost no public housing starts next year, and Dail Eireann further notes that in capital terms, there is a shift in spending away from social infrastructure towards other sectors.  Critical capital needs in the health and education areas are not going to be met for another year, and calls on the Government to take note of these major concerns and criticisms <Col N="291" /> in the framing of the budget for 1991.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One would get the impression from listening to the Minister's speech and subsequently reading it that he was describing a different place to the country in which I live and in which so many of us have to try to survive.  The Minister slowly but surely began to accurately describe the real world towards the end of his speech but one did not get the impression at the beginning of his speech that he was aware at all of the reality of the crisis in our society at present.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Estimates represent a recognition by the Government that there is pressure for change in the area of health expenditure, we welcome the increases which have been identified by the Minister.  However, until such time as the Minister for Health, whose responsibility it is, can indicate to us that there will be a reduction in the inordinate queues for acute operations in many of our hospitals, these increases, welcome and all as they are, will have no impact on the general public.</P>
    <P>In the area of public housing, one can state that the increase indicated in this year's Estimate relative to last year's for local authority housing is welcome because the provision last year did not effectively materialise.  The increase will not have any impact on the rapidly growing housing lists in all our local authority areas.  If the Minister is not aware of these demands then his back bench colleagues in urban areas must surely be aware of them or else the people have simply given up going to the clinics of Fianna Fáil Deputies seeking assistance in trying to be housed.  I should add that the housing problem will be compounded next year when the level of emigration to which the Minister referred starts to fall and people do not solve the Government's housing policy by emigrating to other countries.</P>
    <P>The Estimates represent the level of spending the Government propose to undertake for 1991.  There is an overall increase of approximately 4 per cent on the provision of 1990.  Fifty-four per cent <Col N="292" /> of the total amount of the Estimates will be absorbed by pay and pensions.  We believe that the way in which the services of the 190,000 employees in the public service, Civil Service and extended public service combined, are delivered to the rest of us as a community must be dramatically transformed.  If we want to respond to the increasingly competitive world economy in which we must survive we need to become much more efficient in the way in which we organise our services and be much more competitive internally in the way in which these services are delivered.</P>
    <P>There is a particular need for the managers within the various sectors of the public service, particularly the Civil Service Departments, to ensure that they maximise the potential for efficiency and courtesy within those Departments, having regard to the high percentage of taxpayers' money which is absorbed in the first instance.  I make this point consciously as a Labour Party Deputy because the vast majority of the working people have to depend on public services in respect of education, health, transport and housing.</P>
    <P>To that extent I welcome very much the announcement in the Minister's speech &mdash;I do not think this is the first time he made it &mdash; that he is extending to all the Departments of Government by March 1991 provisions for an administrative programme whereby budgets can be planned for three years by the managers of those Departments.  I hope that announcement will be followed by a transformation in the culture of the Department of Finance which will enable Departments to do what is intended, that every degree of flexibility which they will seek to implement will not be stolen back by the Department of Finance, and that they will not be second guessed by junior officials in the Department of Finance who, without having had any experience in the matter themselves, seem to think they are experts in matters relating to field operations.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to outline clearly the way in which he proposes to provide for training and management <Col N="293" /> development for the public sector in general and the Civil Service Departments in particular.  I would remind the Minister that he is not just the Minister for Finance but is also the Minister for the Public Service.  The benefit of giving autonomy in the operation of Departments on a yearly basis over a three year cyclical period will not be maximised unless proper management training provision is made for the civil servants currently working in those Departments.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe there is a clear need for the Government to recognise that if we do not have economic growth we will not be able to provide the wealth this country needs to generate the services and employment all of us want to see established in this economy.  Various assessments have been made of how this economy is likely to perform or should perform over the next number of years. The favourable wind which was behind the backs of the Government from 1987 onwards has turned in their face at this point in time.  I do not think there is any room for being optimistic that the Government will achieve the targets they have set for themselves.  It is clear that relative to this year economic growth next year will be halved.  As the Minister said, the inflationary impact of the Gulf crisis is difficult to analyse at this point in time.  I believe from previous experience that after a particular economic or political crisis has resolved itself it has taken the oil companies too long to reduce their prices in real terms for the benefit of the consumer.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to ensure that the Government will pass on any reductions in the real cost of oil to the market place if there is a satisfactory and, I hope, peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with another area which affects the Estimates in general and the economic management of the economy by the Government.  It is clear that during the next three years that either the Minister for Finance, or any future Minister for Finance, will find his traditional room for manoeuvre seriously curtailed.  This, in theory, will be offset by the advantages which will accrue from our participation <Col N="294" /> in a much larger and wider economy which will enable us, if we maintain our competitive position, our productivity and efficiency, to dramatically increase our share of markets and the wealth of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Labour movement, in the document published by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, recognises the new reality which faces everybody on the continent of Europe and that a market led economy provides opportunities and possibilities for all of us on this island, but that system of economy must be regulated in an open and transparent manner.  If workers are to provide the flexibility and moderation the Minister is looking for in the current round of negotiations at the end of the Programme for National Recovery the concomitant quid pro quo must be fairness in the administration of our affairs and a clear, open and transparent set of arrangements which treat all players in the economy equally and do not give favoured status to some above others.</P>
    <P>We are not satisfied that this administration have grasped that nettle alongside the repeated calls for pay moderation which are more or less ritualistically sent out at this time of the year, and particularly at the commencement of negotiations for a new programme for economic and social development.  I say to the Minister, and to his colleagues in Government, that any new programme which might be negotiated &mdash; it will be negotiated with great difficulty &mdash; will have to contain a clear commitment that all the provisions of, for example, the Companies Act which was recently passed by the House will be implemented with the necessary resources being made available without delay, to ensure protection for small businesses.  It is not clear from these Estimates if that will be the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one final point on the economy.  There has been a substantial increase in the Estimates for the Department of Labour.  They recognise, perhaps belatedly, that notwithstanding the general improvement in some macroeconomic figures, having regard to interest and inflation rates, the underlying trend in the labour market is such <Col N="295" /> that the country will face substantial long term unemployment figures between now and the end of the century if we maintain our current socio-economic policies. There will have to be a massive intervention in the labour market if we are to deal with structural and long term unemployment. The policy of this and previous Administrations has been to group all the long term unemployed into one category without differentiating between the social and economic needs of a 59 year old long term unemployed person in rural Ireland or on the west coast as against an 18 to 22 year old person who has been unemployed for two years in an urban area.</P>
    <P>There is a need to analyse the labour market in its entirety to get the balance right as between training and retraining and early retirement out of the direct labour market for those who could exercise that option.  A whole area of social policy has been neglected by this Administration. The responsibility for the administration of some of the interventionist measures in the labour market concerning the long term unemployed has been devolved on FÁS, which is an amalgamation of AnCO, the National Manpower Service and the Youth Employment Agency.  The theory behind the proposal to set up FÁS, which I initiated at one stage and supported, was that the vigour, enthusiasm and the &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude, as typified by AnCO, be transferred to the National Manpower Service.  If anything the virus of the minnow has infected the energy of the major fish with the result that FAS are now regarded by many people on the receiving end of the social employment schemes, the other training schemes or the training related labour market schemes, as a bureaucratic, slow and cumbersome organisation who lack vitality and sensitivity.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the point I made on the question of the 54 per cent of total expenditure going on pay and pensions.  We have to generate efficiency and effectiveness into the public sector having regard to the large amount of <Col N="296" /> money devoted to it.  The people most affected by the indifference, incompetence and general low morale which typifies so much of the public sector are the weaker and poorer sectors of society. They are the people who have to depend upon the public sector for public health beds, local authority housing or public education.  In the nineties we will have a much more vulnerable and open economy. Because of this we need to exercise effective control over that sector of our society which is sovereign to us.  The morale of the public sector is not determined by Brussels, or by the outcome of the Gulf crisis or international trading conditions but by what we do within the House and in the administration of this Republic.  Other than the indication from the Minister that he is going to give Government Departments responsibility over a three year period to plan their activities, there is little or no indication to suggest that the personnel in the public sector are going to be revitalised. That will create problems for us.</P>
    <P>The reason I stressed that point at some length in this debate is because the Labour Party believe that the State can play a positive role in the economy.  There is a positive role for a firm and effective public sector which provides a framework within which enterprise can strive.  We believe the State should be behind the economy and those trying to create wealth and jobs in society and not in front of them blocking and impeding them and creating bureaucratic obstacles for them. That is the perception of many people who are trying to create additional jobs in our society.  I say to the Minister for Finance that in many respects these Estimates fail to recognise reality.  The increases being provided for health and housing will not make a significant impact on the length of queues.  I hope the Minister is aware of this and will respond on budget day.  These Estimates form part of an overall package which has to be put together and announced on budget day when we will get the picture for 1991.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, during the nineties, the last decade of this millennium, we will have an opportunity, as set out in the <Col N="297" /> strategy document of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and reflected in the NESC study, to make a real success of the economy having learned from the mistakes made in the seventies and early eighties. We will have to do this together and there will have to be a degree of trust.  If we call, on the one hand, for pay moderation without ensuring on the other that there will be a fair law for all and a clear regulatory framework, under which all offenders, no matter how big, influential or well connected, will be promptly and effectively dealt with, we will not reap the benefits from the new opportunities in front of us.</P>
    <P>Proinsias De Rossa: I ask the House to take account of The Workers' Party's intention to move an amendment to the Estimates.  The amendment is as follows:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>noting that the 1991 Estimates for the Public Service and of the 1991 Summary Public Capital Programme provide for increases in expenditure only generally in line with inflation, and will therefore be inadequate to undo the damage done by the cutbacks of recent years to essential services, especially in the health, education and local goverment areas, noting in particular the continuing crisis in the health services in such areas as the provision of services for the mentally handicapped, rejects the Estimates and calls on the Government to redraft them to ensure that essential public services are reestablished on a sound basis and to enable unemployment and emigration to be tackled by stimulating a far more rapid rate of job creation.</P>
    <P>On 6 December last the Taoiseach addressed a Cairde Fáil function in Dublin and, according to the newspaper reports, urged the Fianna Fáil members and supporters to speak out about the economic miracle this Government had performed.</P>
    <P>The Irish Times of Monday last carried a picture of a scene at St. Luke's Hospital <Col N="298" /> in Kilkenny, showing a series of beds in a corridor, with the nurses trying to cope with impossible conditions and provide medical care with a degree of privacy and dignity for the patients.  Similar photographs have appeared in newspapers all over the country, as the appalling conditions experienced in St. Luke's can be found in hospitals in virtually every county.  This is the dark side of Fianna Fail's self-proclaimed economic miracle.</P>
    <P>On 7 December, the day after the Taoiseach's address, the unemployment figures for November were published.  These showed that there were 222,943 people on the live register, an increase of more than a thousand on November 1989, despite the fact that emigration continued throughout the year at an appalling rate.  Many of these are people facing their fourth or fifth successive Christmas on the dole.  These are people who have been abandoned by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government and for whom the Taoiseach's claim of an economic miracle is a very sick joke.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency last week published their pre-budget submission, entitled Tackling Poverty in the Nineties. I want to quote a brief extract from the very first page:</P>
    <P>The phenomenon of child and family poverty has emerged as a serious issue in recent Agency research.  During the 1980s in particular, the percentage of children in poverty rose dramatically mainly as a result of increased levels of unemployment.  Other categories with a high risk of poverty include children in families relying on low pay and small farms as well as those in larger families. These results pose a serious challenge to a society which has traditionally placed a very high value on children and families.</P>
    <P>These are the families for whom Fianna Fail's economic miracle has made no difference at all.</P>
    <P>The truth, of course, is that the Fianna Fail economic miracle is, for most people, a mirage.  The closer you look at it the more phoney it becomes.  More <Col N="299" /> respectable looking firgures on a balance sheet do not constitute an economic miracle. An economic miracle will have been performed when all those who can work can get well paid productive jobs, when those who cannot work are protected from poverty and want by a humane social welfare system, supported by a tax system which redistributes income equitably and when we have health and education services which cater for people on the basis of need, rather than ability to pay.  Fianna Fáil may have performed an economic miracle for a small, wealthy elite, but for the lives and living standards of the majority, the improved economic figures have delivered nothing.</P>
    <P>Inflation is a case in point.  It is all very well for the Government to brag about this country now having the same low levels of inflation as West Germany, but unfortunately these figures have not brought West German levels of wages and social welfare or West German employment levels.  A large part of the credit for the reduced inflation figures must go to workers who have, under the terms of the Programme for National Recovery accepted pay increases at or below the level of inflation.  This is in stark contrast to many employers who saw their employees' restraint as simply an opportunity to reap even greater profit, much of which was transferred out of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech acknowledges this fact but does not indicate any measure to stem the haemorrhage of profits out of the country or to prevent profit-taking by companies who have benefited. The only serious criticism he makes is of employees who he warns, must not under any circumstances attempt to gain wage increases which would, as he sees it, upset the delicate balance he is trying to establish.</P>
    <P>Between 1986 and 1989 the national wage bill rose by 15 per cent from £10 billion to £11.5 billion.  In the same period profits rose from £4.3 billion to over £6.1 billion, a rise of 42 per cent.  Throughout the eighties when inflation was at a higher <Col N="300" /> level successive Governments and right-wing economists told us that unemployment could only be tackled when inflation had been brought under control. Inflation is now around half the level it was in 1985 but the numbers on the dole are virtually the same and in the same period some 200,000 of our people have been forced to emigrate.</P>
    <P>If we want a genuine economic miracle, steps must be taken to ensure that the benefits of lower inflation are shared out to all sectors of society based on the ICTU's proposals for a programme for economic and social development.  In particular measures must be taken to ensure that profits are used not simply to stuff the bank balances of employers, but to increase the levels of income, especially of those on low pay, and for investment to create substantial additional employment and thus reduce the huge numbers still without work.</P>
    <P>The sacrifices which workers have been called on to make year in and year out for almost a decade have not been repaid. Increased productivity and trade figures have not brought higher wages or sufficient jobs or ended emigration. Increased tax revenue has not brought any real tax equity.</P>
    <P>Figures revealed in the report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1989, published in September, illustrated graphically how little progress had been made in tackling the disproportionate tax burden carried by the PAYE sector.  Not only had the PAYE tax take increased by some £56.8 million between 1988 and 1989, but the overall proportion of income tax paid in PAYE increased in the same period from 74 per cent to 82 per cent.  This further increase in tax paid by the PAYE sector has to be seen against the background of the decrease of more than £31 million in the total paid in corporation tax and a drop of more than £7 million in capital gains tax in the two years in question.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there has been a decrease in the returns from virtually all tax categories other than PAYE.  What is clear from the report is that despite all the promises of tax reform and despite all the <Col N="301" /> minor juggling around with tax rates and bands, and the claims by the Minister that he has reformed the system, the PAYE sector is being bled dry while other sectors continue to escape with little more than a token contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In addition, the pillars of society listed in the report who were convicted of tax offences or from whom the Revenue Commissioners extracted overdue tax shows quite clearly that many of those in the business and commercial sectors take a cavalier attitude to their tax obligations. What is needed in the next budget is an onslaught on tax evasion and avoidance and the transfer of a substantial portion of the tax now paid by PAYE workers to other sectors.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage Fianna Fáil's paper economic miracle looks decidedly shaky and uncertain.  There has been a major outflow of funds.  Our reserves have fallen from £3.7 billion in mid-November to an estimated £3.25 billion in mid-December. Most observers believe that this will lead to a jump of at least 1 per cent in interest rates within weeks.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the headline in an evening paper, I understand a 1 per cent increase has already been announced in mortgage rates.  In turn this will increase inflation and add to job creation difficulties. The Central Bank have estimated that growth in gross national product next year will amount to 2.25 per cent only, less than half the estimated level of growth in 1990.  Many economists believe that we will be doing well if there are 12,000 new jobs created in 1991 compared with an estimated 26,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The recession into which the British economy is now rolling will also have an impact here.  For much of the eighties emigration, mainly to Britain, acted as a pressure valve and eased pressure on housing, employment, social welfare, and other services.  With the decline in emigration to Britain pressure is going to increase on all these services.</P>
    <P>This then is the background against which the Estimates and Public Capital Programme must be viewed.  Most disappointing of all is the failure to provide <Col N="302" /> any additional funds to tackle the continuing unemployment and emigration crisis.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats seem quite prepared to allow the two most important social problems facing the country to continue at their present appalling level.</P>
    <P>Conservative governments, such as this administration, always claim that they cannot create jobs, and concentrate instead on establishing what they describe as the right climate for private enterprise.  But the Public Capital Programme is one area where everyone agrees that decisions of the Government can create jobs.  The Public Capital Programme is a measure of the Government's commitment to investment in job creation.  In that regard this year's programme is most disappointing, indeed is a slap in the face for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government press statement issued in conjunction with the estimates claimed an increase in the 1991 Public Capital Programme of £118 million or 7 per cent, over 1990.  While this is technically true, it is only part of the picture. The Public Capital Programme for 1991 is virtually the same as it was in 1982, but when allowance is made for inflation, this represents a decrease of around 50 per cent.  If we look at table 3, of the Public Capital Programme affecting the building industry &mdash; a major source of employment in Ireland &mdash; we see an even more dramatic decline.  While there is a 5 per cent increase over last year, there has been a decrease of around 19 per cent since 1982.  However, when allowance is made for inflation the decrease is of the magnitude of around 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>No sensible person would argue for additional capital spending simply for the sake of spending.  But there are many infrastructural problems crying out for development which will bring social and economic benefits to this country as well as providing badly needed additional employment.  There is a particular argument for increasing Exchequer Public Capital Programme spending on Structural Fund-related programmes, where the EC matches our level of spending.  In <Col N="303" /> other words, for every £1 we commit we get the value of £2.</P>
    <P>In our amendment seeking rejection of these Estimates we cited, as one of our principal objections, the absence of measures to enable unemployment and emigration to be tackled by stimulating a far more rapid rate of job creation.  Our other main objection was that the increases for most Departments, generally in line with inflation, will not be sufficient to undo the enormous damage inflicted by the cutbacks of recent years to a wide range of essential services, especially in the health, education and local government areas. Our amendment refers particularly to the provision of services for the mentally handicapped, an area where the cutbacks have caused enormous hardship not just for those with mental handicaps, but also for those who have to look after them.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a Member of this House, on any side, who has not been approached by the parents of children &mdash; and sometimes adults &mdash; with a mental handicap who have been driven to the edge of despair, by the impossible task of caring for their loved ones, without proper support services, year in year out, every day of the week, often 52 weeks of the year.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Eastern Health Board area is one of the worst in the country.  There are 642 people on the waiting list for services.  Of those 202 have no services at all and must sit at home while a further 440 require a service adjustment.  Promises made by the Minister for Health last year that he would protect the services for the mentally handicapped sound very hollow indeed to parents who are under such pressure. Any state which does not provide proper care and attention for those with mental handicaps does not deserve to be able to call itself civilised.</P>
    <P>There are many particular items in these Estimates I could refer to but, in the time available, I can deal with just a few.  I want specifically to deal with the housing situation as it is now clear that we are again on the verge of a major <Col N="304" /> housing crisis and there could well be serious social consequences unless there is a substantial increase in the level of local authority house building.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that there are more than 20,000 applicants on local authority waiting lists, construction of public housing was at a virtual standstill.  The amount allocated in the current year for construction of local authority housing at £33 million is around only one-seventh of the annual funds allocated in the mid eighties. The number of local authority houses to be built this year represents only around one-fifth of the level achieved in the mid eighties. Last year we were promised 900 houses starts, but by the end of the year about 300 only had been built.</P>
    <P>At the present rate of construction it will take 20 years simply to deal with the current waiting list.  The situation would have been far more critical had it not been for the fact that more than a quarter of a million of our people emigrated during the past decade.  If, as the Government suggest, emigration is slowing down, the pressure on housing will intensify accordingly, and many local authorities will face an explosive situation. Unlike in the sixties it is not simply a problem facing the large cities.  There are serious housing problems in virtually every town throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Housing must not be seen simply as an economic issue: it is primarily a social issue.  It is an indictment of our record as a state that, more than 70 years after independence, tens of thousands of families are awaiting proper housing, many of whom live in grossly overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, often exploited by landlords who offer substandard accommodation at inflated prices. The misery caused by inadequate or poor housing can have a knock-on effect on many areas of life.  It can lead to marital tension and even breakdown; it can damage a family's health; can result in educational and behavioural difficulties for children.  If anybody doubts that contention they need only talk to teachers in our schools, particularly national schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> While private landlords are probably the worst offenders in regard to conditions, parts of the housing stock of many local authorities are also in a deplorable state.  There are 2,500 local authority houses in Ireland without a toilet and 8,000 local authority houses without a bathroom.  This is nothing short of scandalous.</P>
    <P>The response of the Government to this crisis in these Estimates is derisory. The 1991 Estimate for the Department of the Environment allocates £30.6 million plus £32 million from the sale of local authority housing, which gives a total allocation of some £62.6 million.  This compares to a totally inadequate £51 million last year.  It will mean an increase of about 200 only in the number of local authority housing approvals over last year's figure.  There is also the appalling plight of our travellers who live in dreadful conditions in caravans and still die in ditches at the side of the road.</P>
    <P>This neglect of those in need of housing would be in itself sufficent grounds for voting against these Estimates, but the Government's approach to housing is indicative of their wider approach to social and economic matters.  These Estimates reflect the conservative values of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. They have increased spending by the minimum amount defensible.  There is no commitment to ending unemployment or emigration.  There is no commitment to restoring essential public services to an acceptable level.  That is why we are opposing them and urging this House to reject them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving directly to my own Estimate, let me be allowed to observe that the social conditions about which the leader of the Workers' Party has been complaining are so very much better, so very much enlightened, so very much more effective than the communist systems which he and his party would have us espouse. It is time that simple fact was stated to The Workers' Party. The communist system has broken down before our eyes and he and his party <Col N="306" /> would have us espouse here a system which the people of Eastern Europe have themselves rejected.  It is time we told The Workers' Party directly that it is too easy to make these general complaints and too easy for them to ignore the total injustice that has been a consequence of the systems they would want us to adopt here.  I am glad we operate a better system, a truly democratic system which, whatever faults it may have, is in every sense more just, more balanced and more efficient than the systems his party were founded to introduce into our country. That has to be said for the record.</P>
      <P>I propose to speak to my Estimate, Agriculture and Food, which at £392 million gross is about 25 per cent above actual expenditure in 1989 and the original Estimate for 1990; and also to deal with the general framework of GATT developments, developments in Eastern Europe and the most recent indications of CAP policy changes.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations which began in 1986 was due to be completed in Brussels during the first week of this month.  However, this was not possible and the difficulties on agriculture were certainly a factor.  The aims of the negotiations in relation to agriculture were agreed in 1986 and were to achieve greater liberalisation of agricultural trade and to bring all measures affecting import access and export competition under strengthened GATT rules. This was to be achieved by improving market access, disciplining all direct and indirect subsidies and other measures affecting agricultural trade and by minimising the adverse effects that sanitary and phytosanitary regulations have on trade.  From the commencement of the negotiations in 1986 the European Community was committed to reducing support and protection levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Uruguay Round has been ongoing for four years, it is only in the last year or so that a degree of urgency has entered into the negotiations. During Ireland's EC Presidency in the first six months of this year I was able, as Chairman of the Agriculture Council, to focus the attention of my fellow Ministers on <Col N="307" /> the Uruguay Round.  This enabled the Council to take a strong position in defence of the Common Agricultural Policy and, in fact, to unanimously declare that the principles of the CAP were non-negotiable in the GATT discussions. This strong stance set the scene for the Community's firmness on agriculture in the face of the severe pressure which has been brought to bear on it in the last few months.  It was also an important element in framing the Community offer on reductions in support and protection levels for presentation to the GATT talks.</P>
    <P>There was considerable difficulty in reaching agreement in the Council on the proposals put forward by the EC Commission, and seven meetings of the Council were needed before agreement was secured at that level.  The delay in reaching agreement at the Council indicated the level of concern which the majority of Ministers had with the details of the proposal and the insistence by some Ministers &mdash; and we were to the fore in this &mdash; that producers would have to be compensated for possible losses.</P>
    <P>The Community offer which was ultimately agreed provides for a 30 per cent reduction in support for groupings of the main products over five years from the 1986 levels with a 10 per cent reduction for other products.  All non-tariff border measures would be converted into tariff equivalents subject to certain conditions including rebalancing.  There would be a fixed component covering both tariff equivalents and existing tariffs and a corrective factor which would compensate for all currency fluctuations and for part of world price changes.  Export supports would not be subject to any specific level of reduction but would be reduced as a result of reductions in support and protection.</P>
    <P>The agreement of Ministers was secured only after the Commission had accepted some amendments to its initial proposal and entered into a number of undertakings.  These dealt principally with the matter of complementary measures, the ensuring of Community <Col N="308" /> preference, a clearer commitment on safeguarding export refunds and a strengthening of the rebalancing proposal.</P>
    <P>In so far as the compensatory measures are concerned there is an acceptance by the Council and by the Commission that any future adaptations to support arrangements that may be necessary will take account of the difficult situation of certain categories of producers and certain regions.  In particular, the Commission has stated that it considers that the total level of assistance to the less favoured regions should not be reduced as a result of the implementation of the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations. The Commission has undertaken to submit concrete proposals, supported by appropriate financial solidarity, to ensure a viable future for Community farmers based on, <i>inter alia:</i> reorientation of support to producers taking account of diversity of the structure of farms and production; and reinforcing structural assistance, including production neutral income subsidies, concentrating on producers and regions which have most difficulties in adapting to changes and measures to protect the environment and to improve product quality.</P>
    <P>At the Brussels meeting, there was very little real negotiations.  The US and the Cairns Group held to their proposals for a 75 per cent reduction of internal supports and protection and for a 90 per cent cut in export subsidies over ten years from 1991. They also continued to demand specific commitments on improved access and on limiting export subsidies.</P>
    <P>Despite the fierce pressure brought to bear on the Community during the week, the Council of Ministers remained solidly behind Commissioner MacSharry in defending the Community's position. Such unity of purpose will be more important than ever when the negotiations resume early next month.  I would like to assure this House that I will continue to defend the interests of Irish agriculture in the future negotiations.  I will be seeking to limit the impact of any GATT <Col N="309" /> concessions not only on our farmers but indeed on the wider economy.  The compensatory package to which I have referred will be a major factor in such limitation and will be a vital element for me in considering any overall GATT agreement.</P>
    <P>Since the middle of 1989, worldwide attention has been focused on the momentous political events in Eastern and Central Europe on which I have just touched in my response to some of the remarks made by Deputy De Rossa, events motivated by people wanting the real basics of democracy as distinct from the facade of democracy which had been current in those countries for so many years.  The nations of the Western World welcomed the movement towards democracy in those countries and were quick to act to provide practical assistance where necessary to support the reform process and ensure stability in the emerging democracies.</P>
    <P>If the countries of western Europe were surging towards introducing and accepting the positions which have been current in the totalitarian states of Europe, imagine the sermons we would get from the Workers' Party.  They should acknowledge that they have been wrong, that they have been misguided.</P>

I would welcome it if he would point it out. Otherwise let him move on with his speech and stop this nonsensical ranting.</P>

      <P>I will not have to apologise.  When I hear The Workers' Party criticise the inadequate social conditions and the inadequate housing, I have to say that the people of the Soviet Union, of Moscow, Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, would give everything to have the social provisions we have and it is time The Workers' Party recognised that.</P>
      <P>In response to the understandable revolution that occurred in eastern Europe, Ireland, together with the other member states of the European Community, assisted in the preparation and operation of an emergency action plan.  The developments in Eastern Europe continue to give rise to speculation regarding the impact they will have on existing international political, fiscal and commercial structures and it is very difficult at this time to be in any way precise in predicting what implications these changes will have in the long term.  I believe that we should not look at Eastern Europe as an entity but rather we must consider each of the constituent nations in the light of its own level of development and state of commercial and marketing infrastructure and degree of self-sufficiency in each commodity area.  The economic requirements of these countries differ and the direction their economies will take in the future will differ also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These developments present the Community with a number of challenges.  The Commission has been given the task of co-ordinating the overall western assistance by the group of 24 major industrialised nations and that assistance is urgently needed to help these countries to recover from the totalitarian regime which has been a feature of those countries for so many years.  This involves <Col N="311" /> assessing and determining the needs of each of the countries of central and eastern Europe and establishing the elements of such assistance ranging from short term emergency humanitarian help to longer term economic aid.  The Commission is also responsible for overseeing its own assistance measures and co-ordinates the aid of individual member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland has actively participated in the Community's discussions on all aspects of policy towards central and eastern Europe.  We have also provided bilateral economic assistance to Poland and Hungary. In time the opening up of new and large markets in east Europe will provide opportunities for trade from Ireland particularly, I feel, in the area of processed agricultural commodities.</P>
    <P>So far as the USSR is concerned, the Community will be making available food aid up to an amount of 750 million ECU, 250 million of which will be in the form of gifts under the 1990 EC farm budget. This country expects to supply some of these requirements.  I am glad to say that the Estimate we are discussing has specific provision for special food aid programmes in respect of this action programme on the part of the European Community.  No less would be expected of a democratic country like ours that has always been sensitive to what real democracy means as distinct from what has been a facade for democracy in the totalitarian states of Eastern Europe up to this moment.</P>
    <P>On EC agricultural policy Members of the House will, no doubt, be interested in the proposed radical reorientation of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy which was signalled last week by the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. MacSharry.  As the formal proposals have yet to emerge, it is obviously not possible at this stage to make any detailed comment in respect of them.  Broadly speaking, however, it is understood that the Commission intends a major overhaul of the existing product support mechanisms involving a general <Col N="312" /> switch away from commodity price supports and towards the alternative of direct supports to farmers.</P>
    <P>A major objective of the proposed changes is, of course, to ensure that, in future, a significantly greater proportion of the Community's total spending on agriculture and food finds its way towards smaller and medium sized producers and, in particular, towards producers who are located in the more vulnerable, less favoured areas. The achievement of an improved balance between rural and urban development and maintenance of family farming, which is a feature of socio-economic conditions is in our own country, as distinct from more intensive, factory type production, as the European norm is also fundamental to the Commission's present thinking and as such, these are objectives with which we, in Ireland, broadly sympathise.  I would go further, they are objectives that we would enthusiastically endorse and I have already conveyed to the Commissioner, subject to seeing the detailed proposals, that I certainly sympathise with the general outlines of what he has indicated, namely, that the funding which comes through from the CAP should be targeted specifically on family farms.  I also told him that I too support the orientation by which he would hope to ensure that the 80 per cent of farmers would get a little more than 20 per cent of the support.  I think that on any basis of social equity all in this House would share that position.</P>

They will see where the rural communities of Romania were literally not just being moved from their own places but were <Col N="313" /> wiped out without any regard for human dignity, and I am glad to say that under any system that any party on this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would never tolerate that.  For once we were on the same side, if the Deputy had been listening.</P>
      <P>Given the recent re-emergence of substantial intervention stock levels throughout the Community in several product sectors and the failure of stabiliser arrangements to sufficiently curb output, further adjustment to the CAP's various common market regimes is inevitable. This is particularly true in view of the budgetary situation that is evolving at present and, indeed, change would now be required even independently of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations which are likely to resume early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it is impossible to be specific in regard to details.  However, reduced price support, milk quota reductions &mdash; especially for larger dairy farmers &mdash; increased use of &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo; or land fallowing and the promotion of organic faming in place of more intensive production methods are among the various ideas which are now being mentioned. Any changes are bound to have major implications for an economy such as ours which remains massively dependent upon production and trade in agricultural produce.  Accordingly, when the Commission's proposals are formally submitted to the Agriculture Council, I shall be particularly vigilant to ensure that they do not adversely affect the interests of Irish agriculture and that, in fact, any changed emphasis in the CAP will facilitate a genuine redistribution of resources from richer to poorer farmers and regions, and I presume Deputy Sheehan would share that priority with me.</P>

What we are doing is in line with commitments we have already given in the context of the formulation of the Community's negotiating mandate for the GATT.  My guiding principle will be to see to it that the proposed reorientation of EC agricultural support will, as intended, cushion the impact of reform for smaller, more vulnerable producers while ensuring that the further development of our food processing industry is not put in jeopardy.  Beyond these few general observations, I do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</P>
      <P>In so far as specific subheads of expenditure and receipt are concerned I do not intend at this stage to go into the substance of them in anticipation of the detailed Estimates discussion in the new year.

      <P>I wish to make a few comments as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and do so in a non-party political manner.  I will not point <Col N="315" /> the finger at any section of the House or at any Minister.  I wish to comment on the way the public service is audited and controlled.  I hope my comments will be taken into account urgently.</P>
      <P>The House has been negligent in its duty in not seeking to update the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts who are the watchdog for this House.  I wish to pay tribute to the members of the committee.  When the committee were appointed they found that no report had been published since 1979.  There are many people who say that this is a great committee to be a member of because they get great publicity and so on but the committee work on mundane matters for most of the time and these do not get any publicity.  The committee meet week in, week out, sometimes twice a week.  They meet during the recess.  The only time they do not meet is during the month of August.  The committee have not only published all reports to date, including those which were outstanding, but have also had a number of interim and special reports the most recent of which was a special report on computer security in Government Departments which will be laid before the House tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The committee work well.  The members are diligent and put a lot of effort into doing their job and into seeing how their job and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General, could be made more effective in the future.  I pay tribute to the Department of Finance who have encouraged the Comptroller and Auditor General to develop, albeit in a non-statutory way, a certain value for money audit type approach to his work which he has done on a limited basis.  I also thank them for courtesies extended to me as Chairman in my efforts to try to keep the work of the committee going in an efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is an officer appointed under the Constitution. He is appointed in the same way as a High Court judge and given absolute independence under the Constitution reporting to this House.  He is <Col N="316" /> not a civil servant.  He does not work for the Executive.  He is the only person, apart from the officials of the House, who works for the House.  Yet he is not an officer of the House but rather of the Constitution.  We give him this absolute independence and authority.  He can only be appointed and removed by the House and by the Seanad for stated misbehaviour in the same way as a judge. Having given him this absolute independence we then tie his hands behind his back by giving him powers which were passed when Gladstone was Chancellor of the Exchequer &mdash; he had not even become Prime Minister &mdash; under the 1866 Exchequer and Audit Departments Act.</P>
    <P>The budget for the Civil Service servicing the then United Kingdom of Britain and Ireland was £7 million.  In 1990 the gross budget for the Republic of Ireland will be of the order of £20 billion taking into account debt repayment, debt servicing and grossing up the supply services figure, yet the Comptroller and Auditor General operates under legislation which was passed in 1866.  That is totally unsatisfactory.  It is a scandal which this House has allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The first thing the current committee set about doing was publishing the outstanding reports and then they set out to assess what should be the current role of the committee and of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The 1987 committee set up an advisory group on public financial accountability under my chairmanship with the Comptroller and Auditor General of the day, the Director of the Institute of Public Administration of the day, the immediate past President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the day and the Director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the day and the Director of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the day.  That group met and worked extremely hard. They brought over the English Comptroller and Auditor General, Sir Douglas Henley, when they abandoned the 1866 Act and brought in the National Audit Act, 1983.  They spoke to the Secretaries <Col N="317" /> of the Departments of Health, Finance and the Environment for different reasons to do with the local government audit and the health board audit and issued a first class report which was debated subsequently in the House.  It was given a very warm welcome in the House.  The Dáil was then dissolved and nothing has happened since.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Heads of a Bill have been circulated.  The Committee of Public Accounts met with the Minister for Finance but, to be fair, the Minister was busy in the first six months of this year with the European Presidency.  It is this House which has been negligent. Constitutionally the Seanad do not have an audit function.  It is the duty of this House to ensure that our auditor &mdash; the person who audits the spending of this money to ensure that it is properly spent &mdash; has sufficient powers.  He does not have modern powers, nine years before the 21st century.  He should not have powers which were passed in the last century.  I ask the House to take note of this point.</P>
    <P>In its day, the 1886 Act was significant but it should be updated and a national audit Bill should be brought in which would confer on the Comptroller and Auditor General power to carry out VFM audits based on three Es, efficiency, effectiveness and economy.  That is what a modern enterprise requires and managing the public purse is a modern enterprise. The audit function needs to be updated.</P>
    <P>If you take 1 per cent of £20 billion you come up with the figure of £200 million. There are salaries and many other things involved in that, but does anybody believe that there is not 1 per cent of waste that could be identified and cut out?  Look at all that has turned up under the traditional powers the Comptroller and Auditor General has as regards spot checks.  Of course there is constant wilful, wasteful expenditure week in and week out, being funded by borrowings which we cannot afford and by taxes which we are taking from workers, money which we need not be taking from them, or perhaps from enterprises that could be <Col N="318" /> profitable.  This is being done because we are not cutting out wasteful expenditure in an organised and proper way.  We are not allowing the one man who is totally independent and who cannot be given direction by anybody the power on behalf of the taxpayer and of this House to identify where that wasteful expenditure is occurring so that we, through the Committee of Public Accounts which has been a traditional forum for this House, should be able to call in the Accounting Officers, ask why this is happening, and tell them it has to end.  That power must be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is totally wrong of this House to deny him those powers.</P>
    <P>In Britain Norman St. John Stevas, then a member of the House of Commons, introduced a Private Members' Bill which the Government of the day agreed to take on board.  Despite the fact that there was a general election there, the Government, on their return to Office, introduced a Bill which not only provided that the Comptroller and Auditor General would have powers to do value for money audits based on the three Es that I mentioned but also gave him a budget to cover outside consultants who would help him measure the waste.</P>
    <P>This State ordered two ships from Verolme Cork Dockyard for fisheries protection. It only got one ship but paid what was contracted to be paid for two ships. Maybe we got value for money, nobody knows, but maybe the ship was worth only a half or a quarter of what was paid for it.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to report to the Committee of Public Accounts not only what happened in such a case but also what should have happened.  He should be allowed state the value of the ship, what was paid for it and what should have been paid first.  Until the Comptroller and Auditor General is given such powers, the House, the Government and the taxpayer will continue to be ripped off. It is totally negligent of the House not to give him those powers.</P>
    <P>We have had our amusing moments at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I came to know what the word <Col N="319" />&ldquo;philoprogenative&rdquo; means when I discovered that one lady was collecting children's allowance for 86 children.  Lest we think this is the only country where that sort of thing happens, when I mentioned it to the Canadian auditor general he said it was nothing compared to what happened in his country where there was a horse on the payroll in the Department of Defence.  It is an amusing aside but it can happen.  In the management of funds one man is given responsibility for auditing and reporting to this House, and that is the Comptroller and Auditor General but it is wholly unacceptable that as we head into 1991 &mdash; in nine years' time we will be heading into the 21st century &mdash; the Comptroller and Auditor General is operating under powers passed in 1866.</P>
    <P>I want to praise the current Comptroller and Auditor General for the work he has done in trying to develop his role, albeit on a non-statutory basis, and the Department of Finance for encouraging him to do so.  I also want to praise his predecessors.  The State has been and is very well served by the accounting officers statutorily appointed by the Minister for Finance to account to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The public service is greatly criticised and is constantly in the public gaze, but during my term of office as Chairman of that committee I, more than most Members of the House, have come in contact with senior civil and public servants and, despite the wrongs that are there and the fact that we are being negligent in providing the proper powers for audit, the country and the State is very well served by these people who, almost without exception, operate to very high standards and take their duties as accounting officers very seriously.  That is something I might not have said a number of years ago without the experiences I have gained in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is Parliament which provides funds. The Government of the day do not have money at their disposal.  It is this House and the Seanad, but primarily the Dáil, that provides the money.  We take that money from the taxpayer and therefore <Col N="320" /> it is to Parliament &mdash; specifically to the Dáil &mdash; that there must be accountability for the spending of that money.  It is absolutely essential that this matter be given priority.  I hope that in the new session a Bill will be introduced in this regard.  In the event that a Bill is not introduced in the next year I will introduce a Private Members' measure because it is time the House took the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that I am not pointing at anyone in particular.  This is a matter for the House to consider, given the specific job of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In Britain not only is the Comptroller and Auditor General independent &mdash; his nomination is brought before the House by the Prime Minister for appointment &mdash; but his appointment is effectively made by the Public Accounts Committee. The Prime Minister simply endorses it.  Over and above that they have appointed what they call a Public Accounts Commission which is similar to the Speaker's Commission.  The Public Accounts Commission, chaired by a Member of the House, decides on the budget for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Treasury there do not have the right to determine the budget.  Parliament have told the Treasury that it is none of their business, that the Comptroller and Auditor General works not for the Civil Service but for Parliament, and it is they who decide what budget to give him.  They give him an adequate budget to pursue the spending of taxpayers' money and, as we have recommended in our case here, he has the power to pursue not just the spending of moneys by Departments but, for example, in Britain it was the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee who pursued the spending of money in the De Lorean case.  It was they who held public hearings on that matter.</P>
    <P>We have recommended, for instance, that if the IDA or any Government Department were to give £1 million, £500,000, or any other figure to industry and we suspected that the money had not <Col N="321" /> been adequately or properly used, this Parliament should have the right to inquire where the money went.  This Parliment will cut off somebody from unemployment assistance or disability benefit for the sake of £5 or £10 perhaps, if, they have not their t's crossed or their i's dotted.  We have taken substantial amounts of money in that way, and we have recommended that that should be the case.  I would go further and say that if we give substantial amounts of money to voluntary organisations we should have the right to inquire where the money is spent and ensure that it is adequately and properly spent.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately spent my time making this contribution because I believe it needs to be made. There are two reports on the Order Paper, one of which is a special report, which I will be moving tomorrow morning for distribution to the House, and the other an interim report on which I am seeking a debate.  It concerns Tara Mines and the lack of powers of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General to find out what went on there.  This House provided moneys out of which £660,000 was paid to one firm, without going to tender, to carry out a report for a Government Department concerning Tara Mines.  Not only will they not show the report to this House, they cannot do so because the Attorney General has advised that, under contractual arrangements which they made with the company concerned, they cannot, without being in breach of contract, disclose the contents of that report.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which parliamentary committees, especially the Committee of Public Accounts, should have modern powers to pursue and the Comptroller and Auditor General should have powers based, not on the 19th or even the 20th centuries, but the 21st century. The Comptroller and Auditor General should have powers which will see him well into the 21st century and I appeal, on a cross party basis, for those powers to be given to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very valuable use of time to look at Estimates on spending coming to the end of the year.  Everybody can be satisfied as we look back at the very creditable economic performance of 1990.  Despite an increase in oil prices a very good economic performance was recorded in 1990.  GNP is up between 4.5 per cent 5 per cent; the inflation rate of 3.5 per cent &mdash; 3.4 per cent on average &mdash; in 1990 sees Ireland very well in line with her narrow band EMS partners and considerably below that of the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The situation regarding employment has already been spelt out, it is certainly better than was forecast earlier.  The ESRI now estimate that there will have been a 40,000 increase in the number of people at work between the middle of April 1989 and the middle of April 1991.</P>
      <P>The target for the 1990 Exchequer borrowing requirement looks as if it will be achieved, if not bettered.  The strategy for 1991, of course, is now preoccupying Government time and we are determined to continue with the policy of expenditure restraint along the lines put forward by NESC in their document <i>A Strategy for the Nineties.</i> This means maintaining downward pressure on the borrowing and debt ratios.  There will of course, be a more difficult external environment facing us after 1990, a weakening world economy, possible higher oil prices and a general situation in which confidence is not as high as we would like.  A lot of this was brought about by events in the Gulf and there is uncertainty about how we will all handle the transition of Eastern Europe towards a market economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important how Ireland responds to this slow-down in world economic activity.  One thing is certain, it will affect Ireland in the sense that it cannot be immune from what goes on in the global market-place.  However, the degree to which we are affected will depend crucially on how we react to these circumstances. In this context, it is now more imporant than ever to keep costs under control, to make sure that we stay competitive and that competitiveness <Col N="323" /> remains the key word in business and in the economy generally.  Both, even in those difficult circumstances, can be realised despite the deterioration in the external environment because Ireland retains sufficient positive elements to permit moderate economic expansion in 1991, especially if we keep our eye on the ball and watch the competitive aspect of the economy.  The global market-place is quite ruthless and, if we are not competitive, we will not survive in it.  We must ensure that we do not stray off that particular focal point which is critical to a healthy economy.</P>
    <P>The projections for 1991 are for real GNP growth of between 2.25 per cent, which the Central Bank have put forward, and 2.75 per cent, the figure suggested by the ESRI.  If we attempt to compensate ourselves for higher oil prices by greater public spending, higher wages or bigger profit increases, our competitiveness will be directly affected through higher inflation and much weaker growth potential.  That possible reaction to the situation in the Gulf is simply not available to us; we must ensure that competitiveness remains at the centre of the economic strategy and of Government economic performance.</P>
    <P>Of course the operational programmes from the European Community are designed to gear the economy to prepare for the more open market post-1992.  I am referring to the operational programme on peripherality.  For example, in my own Department, on the transport side over £140 million has been invested in airports, ports and public transport infrastructure up to the end of 1993 which will assist underlying growth potential and help to cut transport costs.  On the transport side, the EC programme will directly upgrade and assist our transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>On the tourism side, the operational programme for tourism from the EC comes to £145 million, the amount of EC aid available to the country.  It is geared towards improving the quality and expanding the range of holiday products on offer in Ireland.  I assure the House <Col N="324" /> that I will take every care to ensure that the agencies carry out these programmes in an efficient, cost effective and creative way.  These funds, which we are fortunate to have negotiated, will be put to the best possible use under the criteria agreed between the Government and the European Community.  I see these funds, not so much as money for spending, but as money for investing.  I am sure all Members of the House fully understand the difference between spending and investment.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, a new programme for economic and social development is being negotiated which can provide an ongoing framework for consensus and discipline over the coming years.  The Government, through a partnership with the social partners, have demonstrated that economic performance can be improved through programmes for national recovery and I very much look forward to the next one being successfully negotiated.  I know that all sides of the House are anxious to achieve this.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some developments within my own area of responsibility. My priority over the coming 12 months will be to provide the necessary support through leadership, finance and regulatory arrangements so that the tourism and transport sectors achieve their full potential for the year.</P>
    <P>The European Community, as Deputies are aware, is pushing hard towards completion of the Single Market and nowhere is this more important than in the transport sector, because transport provides the means by which we can have closer integration.  As I said many times at European level, I do not believe we can build a single market if we do not build a single market in transport because, without it, you cannot move the citizens of Europe around the Community. Therefore, the completion of a Single Market in transport activities, air, rail, road and sea, is critical to the development of economic performance.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has already been made in liberalising air and road freight. Ireland will be playing a full and positive <Col N="325" /> role in progressing remaining measures for completion of the internal market in transport by 1993.</P>
    <P>At home my Department are constantly working towards raising standards so that we will be able to compete on the international stage.  For example we have just launched a campaign against unlicensed operators and those who employ them.  Professionalism is critical to the operation of the transport industry.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, a major equipment renewal programme is well under way at the State airports.  The main elements of the programme which affects all three State airports include new radar systems, complete replacements of the main VHF communications systems and replacements of most of the existing navigational aids.  The programme will be completed by 1992 at a total cost of about £28 million within budget.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to refer to a recent exciting development in the configuration of Irish airspace.  Under an agreement concluded with the UK earlier this year, Ireland will assume responsibility from 10 January 1991 for the provision of air traffic control services in the block of airspace to the southwest of Ireland known as SOTA-Shannon Oceanic Transition Area.  SOTA will in effect double the size of Irish airspace.  I am delighted to say that, as a result of the re-equipping programme, Ireland will be able to provide full radar and VHF coverage in the SOTA area which will allow operators to avail of optimum flight levels and thus increase the efficiency and fuel-effectiveness of their aircraft.  It is a pretty technical area, but what it means in effect is that we have negotiated the doubling of the size of Irish airspace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we double it regularly, we will have all the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late eighties have been a boom time for the air transport industry.  The moves both within the EC and moves globally also towards greater market freedom have allowed airlines greater flexibility to respond to consumers' needs <Col N="326" /> and to compete for new markets.  The Government has consistently pursued radical air transport policies aimed at increasing competition through opening up new markets, lessening restrictions operating in the existing markets and giving airlines greater pricing freedom. As a result traffic through our airports has almost doubled in the last five years and international services now operate from a total of nine airports within the State.</P>
    <P>Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair have been operating this year in increasingly difficult conditions such as rising costs, interest charges on necessary fleet acquisitions and an economic downturn in important markets like the US and UK. I am confident that both companies can, with a determined effort on the part of all concerned, return to profitable operations in the short term.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are pressing ahead with the fleet replacement programme and during 1991 the company will be accepting delivery of eight new aircraft.</P>
    <P>There will also be significant capital expenditure in a number of Aer Lingus's subsidiary companies during 1991.  In particular, I should mention the Team-Aer Lingus project which will create a further 560 jobs over the next five years.  The project involves the construction of a major new £35 million hangar at Dublin Airport which will greatly expand Aer Lingus's capacity for aircraft overhaul. The IDA, with Government approval, have contributed a significant capital and training grant package which will underpin the long term potential of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>A further major development is the PWA international project which is a joint venture between Aer Lingus's subsidiary, Airmotive, and Pratt and Whitney, a leading US engine manufacturer. This involves the operation of a jet engine case repair facility which is due to commence operation in January 1991.  It will employ 175 initially, and will eventually employ 290.  The coming together in a joint venture of a leading Aer Lingus <Col N="327" /> company with one of the aviation industry's largest and most prestigious technology corporations is of major significance for the Aer Lingus group and for the long term development of the aerospace industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The CIE subvention of almost £110 million for 1991 is the main expenditure item in my Department's Estimate.  CIE have responded well to the new challenges facing the group in recent years and this is appreciated by both the travelling public and the Government. However, the substantial Exchequer support which the organisation continues to need, puts an onus on management and workforce to continue to strive for further improvement in the quality and cost efficiency of their services.  There is provision for over £36 million for CIE in the 1991 Public Capital Programme for a number of bus and rail projects, some of which will receive funding from the European Regional Development Fund under the Peripherality Programme already mentioned.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, I recently gave approval to CIE to increase their fares, due to the need to compensate for higher costs which arose mainly from the Iraqi Gulf crisis.  This is the first increase I approved since coming into office and indeed I had refused to approve a number of earlier applications.  However, I have made it clear to CIE that my policy continues to be that where they have to bear increased costs these should be compensated for by improved cost efficiency and marketing of their services rather than by increasing charges to the travelling public.  In that regard, in the recent round of CIE fare increases &mdash; the only one in two years, as we refused earlier ones &mdash; I specifically asked CIE to freeze the fares of children travelling on services. It is important to hold children's fares at the existing level.  Unfortunately, that means that fares for the other travelling public had to be increased proportionately. I know they will not object to that, given the necessity for our children to be transported.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> In future ferry services to the Aran Islands will be provided by private operators and the Government recently approved the award of the contract for new improved services, to Doolin Ferries Ltd.  The bulk of the allocation of £0.5 million in the 1991 Estimate will be spent on the provision of the new service from Galway and I am also exploring the possibility of effecting improvements during the current winter season in the provision of passenger services between the three islands and Rossaveal.</P>
    <P>I am currently in the course of finalising my proposals for a new bus competition Bill which I hope to submit to Government some time in the New Year.  While it is not possible to be specific about the details of the new legislation until after they have been approved by the Government, I can assure you that the Bill will provide for and facilitate a considerably greater degree of competition in the transport industry than is possible under existing legislative provisions.  I am confident that the new provisions will give rise to significant improvements in the quality and range of bus services available to the general public throughout the country.  I have no doubt that the excellent staff of CIE, given their experience, expertise and commitment will be able to meet any competition that comes along. Our State companies in the past showed that they can do that.  I have no doubt that they can do it in the future.  All of our State companies have come to realise that competition in an economy such as ours is essential to the smooth operation of that economy, and that it does not spell difficulties for the State company but rather spells an exciting new phase for their new development.</P>

    <P>I thought I should use the occasion of my Estimates, given that there are a substantial number of State companies under my Department, to say that I have discussed this approach with all of them and that they are all fully satisfied, prepared and even excited about the notion of competing fairly and squarely with other people in the same business.  I have the height of respect for and give full encouragement to our State companies. <Col N="330" /> They have my fullest confidence, but they know that I require them to work within a competitive framework.  That is my philosophy and they know where they stand with me.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government continue to target tourism as a major axis for economic development.  Our confidence in the industry's ability to earn foreign revenue and create sustainable jobs was expressed in concrete terms in the very ambituous performance targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The programme called for a doubling of foreign visitor numbers to over 4 million by 1992, an increase in tourism revenue of £500 million and the creation of an additional 25,000 jobs.  I should like to report to the House now that we are halfway into the period covered by the programme that the sector is directly on course to meet the ambitious targets set some years ago.  This year we can expect to see overseas visitor numbers exceed three million.  We can expect to see total revenue pass the £1 billion mark for the first time and sectoral employment reaching about 80,000, representing an additional 15,000 jobs in the three year period since 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to use my time in this debate to focus on a couple of areas rather than speak in global or general terms.  I realise the pattern in debates on Estimates, whatever they come, is for Members on the opposite side of the House to stand up and say how wonderful and marvellous the Minister, the Government or the economy&mdash; or all three &mdash; are.  People on this side of the House stand up and say that that is not the case and point out the shortcomings of Government policy in the year as specifically related to individual Departments.  It is a seasonal ritual.  It is necessary for an Opposition party to be able to point out the shortcomings that would not be highlighted in the plethora of PR activities that take place in Government Departments.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to take this opportunity, as my constituency colleague who is sitting across from me was the last contributor, to say a few things to him.  I commend him on the hard work he has done in the wide range of areas in which he operates and wish him well in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>I would like to refer to a few local needs and ask him if he is aware &mdash; I am sure he is because he lives in the middle of it &mdash; that we have manic proportions of traffic problems in Dublin South.  I do not believe there is anywhere else in Dublin, other than St. Stephen's Green at 9 o'clock every morning, where there are worse traffic problems.  As a representative for Dublin South the problems of traffic, speeding and hold-ups in the morning are as bad as any I have every been asked to deal with.  It is a huge problem.  I am not suggesting the Minister can with the stroke of a pen do something about it: it is inter-related to a whole lot of other things such as the southern cross and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituents of Dublin South are slowly going mad and I am sure they have been in contact with the Minister, have called to his clinics and his office.  There are chronic problems around Dundrum, <Col N="332" /> Churchtown and Goatstown.  They are probably the worst areas.  The Minister must be aware of them because he lives there.  It is causing grave problems because people decide their own short cuts and speed through estates and avenues which were never intended for huge streams of traffic.  This is dangerous for old and young people apart from being very stressful for people who live there.</P>
    <P>I cannot give any hope to the people who contact me.  They ask about the proposed busway, if the railway line will be reopened.  They are living in hope but I have to tell them that, in my opinion, the whole area will come to a stop some morning and everybody will be locked in &mdash; wall to wall &mdash; in cars from St. Stephen's Green to Dundrum village unable to move.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that whatever spending is done on roads &mdash; I accept there are enormous improvements on the main road &mdash; in Dublin South the position is absolutely dreadful.  I would like to think the Minister who has such a pertinent responsibility in this area would be able to give some hope to the people who are slowly going mad because of the awful traffic problems they are experiencing from Rathfarnham to Stillorgan.</P>
    <P>I will not address myself in global terms to the macro economics of this financial debate.  I would like to take the opportunity to concentrate on a couple of areas in which I have a particular interest and which have not had the focus of attention nor the general political appeal of many other issues.  The first relates to the problems in prisons, specifically women's prisons. I appeal to the Minister for Justice to address seriously the question of Mountjoy women's prison and allocate the necessary funds to upgrade the women's accommodation and facilities, work which was recommended as long ago as the Whitaker report.  I ask him to end the promising and the faint commitments made in speeches and begin effective action.</P>
    <P>The question of accommodation and facilities generally in the women's prison has been an issue for 20 years.  I regret <Col N="333" /> that in that time no noticeable change or reforms have occurred.  The grievance today is the same as in the past over-crowding. In the most recent Mountjoy visitors' report it was stated that there are three or four women to a cell.  There is no segregation of hardened criminals from short term inmates, no place for remand prisoners, very inadequate work facilities, poor educational facilities and no leisure or exercise facilities.  We are talking here about a very small number of about 30 to 35 women as compared to the thousands of male prisoners.  Few of whom are in for serious crime; most are there because of social problems which relate mostly to alcohol, shoplifting or crimes of that nature.</P>
    <P>This year we had a tragic suicide of a young woman offender in Mountjoy. Understandably, at that time there was great media interest and focus on Mountjoy Prison and the women there. There was a certain degree of anguish from the Minister and the Department of Justice.  Some commitments were given subsequent to that publicity.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  Ireland should never again find itself in a position where one private enterprise becomes so dominant in the domestic marketplace that their collapse precipitates a national crisis.  When a private company develop into such a power they behave as if they are immune from the market forces which would put smaller companies out of business.  Fine Gael want to see fair competition.  This is why we as a party are committed to private enterprise and continue to promote competition legislation.</P>
      <P>In February 1989, Fine Gael published an economic development Bill.  Section 14 of that Bill sought to incorporate into Irish law Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  In fact we had gone further earlier by proposing an amendment to the Restrictive Practices Bill, 1987, which endeavoured to achieve the same objective.  We also published a document known as &ldquo;1992&rdquo; which also sought the incorporation into Irish law of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. These Articles would ban price fixing, limitations on supplies, market sharing and other similar cosy arrangements. Unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil Government of that time voted down that Bill. In the same year the Progressive Democrats introduced the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, which endeavoured to do much the same as our Bill but it was also voted down by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government came to power 18 months ago we have been waiting for the introduction of new competition legislation.  However, despite the fact that the responsible Minister is none <Col N="335" /> other than Deputy Desmond O'Malley, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats nothing has happened.  It is very difficult to understand the delay in dealing with this most important issue.  I now call on the Minister to allow this Bill to pass Second Stage even though it refers only to the food processing business.  I will explain later why Fine Gael are introducing this limited Bill.  I ask the Minister not to give us the standard reply, that the Government intend introducing their own legislation, which we will have to wait for.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, and his party, campaigned vigorously during 1989 for more scope for the introduction of Private Members' Bills, something which I totally support, and introduced their own Bill on competition.  I find it very difficult to understand why, having had the opportunity in Government, no such Bill has been introduced two years later.</P>
    <P>We as a party support legislation which outlaws restrictive practices and anti-competitive conduct in all sectors of industry, trades and professional services. As I stated earlier, we endeavoured to deal with this issue by way of a Private Members' Bill.  We have brought forward this Bill, which deals solely with the food processing sector, in response to the recent rescue package announced by the Examiner to the Goodman Group. This package could have serious implications for the Irish beef industry unless steps are taken immediately to avoid possible difficulties.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone is under any illusion that this rescue package is designed to gain the maximum recovery of funds, loaned imprudently in my opinion, by a large number of banks to the Goodman Group, leaving Mr. Goodman with a 40 per cent stake in the company and with the prospect of regaining majority control over a relatively short period of time. I do not make an apology for saying that that is the sole reason this legislation has been brought forward.  We prepared this Bill over a couple of days in order to indicate the fears we on this side of the House have in relation to the <Col N="336" /> proposed rescue package which will be going before the courts for confirmation.</P>
    <P>If this package is agreed it will mean that the Goodman Group will hold a dominant position once again in the beef industry &mdash; it will control 40 per cent of the market.  This figure includes Classic Meats which controls about 10 per cent of the market.  This dominant position could lead to price fixing and result in excessive profits being made at the expense of the Irish beef producer.  The Bill being discussed this evening would deal with this problem by making all anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices automatically void. In addition, it would make these practices an offence subject to a fine not exceeding £100,000 or six months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with monopolies and prohibits the abuse of a monopoly or a dominant position in the food processing business by limiting the share held by any one company to a maximum of 30 per cent of their market.</P>
    <P>There are many lessons to be learned from the near collapse of the Goodman Group, not least that it was downright irresponsible on the Government's part to depend solely on Mr. Goodman to develop the Irish beef industry.  This was done at considerable expense to the taxpayer, and we are not finished yet.  My understanding is that the examiner and the banks are confident of winning the court case resulting from the cancellation of export credit insurance.  The taxpayer could then be faced with a bill well in excess of £100 million if the Goodman Group are successful with their legal action in this regard.  This is a daunting prospect facing the taxpayer and while I accept that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce did what he thought was fit, right and proper at the time, he was left with a situation which should never have been allowed to develop in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is also my understanding that when negotiations took place on the reintroduction of export credit insurance, negotiations took place between the Taoiseach and the then Minister for <Col N="337" /> Industry and Commerce and Mr. Goodman in relation to the sourcing of meat that would be supplied to Iraq.  My clear understanding is that the Government of the day were left in no doubt that some of this meat would have to be sourced from outside the country because of the non-availability of meat in Ireland. Despite this, the Government decided to proceed and grant cover to the maximum level which, I understand, amounted to something in the region of £120 million.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, without wishing to interrupt or to be disrespectful to the Deputy, he is now engaged in a detailed consideration of different aspects of a very serious claim against the taxpayers of this country in which he is informing the House, and thereby the country, that he expects the Exchequer will lose.  I find this quite unacceptable. He is seriously prejudicing the public interest, the national interest, in this matter.  I do not accept that it is common gossip that this case being taken against me and the Irish taxpayers for more than £100 million is one that I will lose.  It has always been a tradition of this House, perhaps taken to extremes, not to discuss cases between two private individuals which have nothing to do with this House, but here is what I understand is the largest individual claim ever made against the State and Deputy Barrett is regaling us at some length as to why the State is going to lose it.</P>

      <P>Of course, but I am stating that part of the package being considered by the examiner for the rescue of the Goodman Group involves a sum of money which could exceed £100 million likely to be won in a court action against the State.  I do not deny that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had the right to do what he did.  He took his decision and if he took the wrong one he and the Government will ultimately be answerable to this House and the public at large. I did not say any more than that nor will I repeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another lesson to be learned is that monopolies are bad for Irish business, for the consumer, and can lead to doubtful practices.  It is clear beyond doubt that the Government and the Opposition were misled with regard to the ownership of Classic Meats.  The examiner is taking into account in his restructuring package the sale of Classic Meats which, it is hoped, will repay a sum of £16.5 million owed to the Goodman Group.  Proper <Col N="340" /> competition legislation would have prevented the concealment of the ownership of Classic Meats.  The concealing of the facts did nothing for the reputation of Irish business and damaged our image abroad.</P>
    <P>It is time that this Government put in place a plan for the beef industry based on the principle that no more monopolies would be allowed to be developed.  This plan should recognise the need to develop new markets based on the excellence of the product and the quality of production. The quality of Irish meat and our reputation for a clean environment must be the cornerstone of our drive for new markets.  For far too long we depended on sales into intervention and on sales to countries outside the European Community.  This policy is extremely dangerous bearing in mind that it depends to a great extent on EC subsidies which are becoming extremely dubious in the context of the current GATT talks.</P>
    <P>To help us in our drive for new markets, we must of course accept that we need strong companies capable of competing in the international field.  A company does not have to have a domestic monopoly &mdash; in Fine Gael's view 30 per cent &mdash; to be able to compete abroad. There is no good reason this country should not have a number of efficient food processing companies exporting high quality food products.  These companies would be better off putting their profits into marketing abroad than in ill-advised takeover deals or investments in dubious enterprises outside the business they know.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach and his Ministers had pursued such a policy rather than depending on one individual to develop the beef industry by way of tax concessions, grants and export credit insurance, we would not have witnessed such a crisis.  Indeed, my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, who is sitting beside me, would know all about promises in relation to grants following the announcement involving the Industrial Development Authority, the Goodman Group, the Taoiseach, and <Col N="341" /> his Government.  This great announcement eventually led to the closure of the Tuam sugar factory on the false assumption that it would be replaced by a meat processing factory.  Instead there is a vacant site.</P>
    <P>When news of the Goodman collapse was announced in August I called for a full inquiry into the whole affair.  That call still stands.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers involved have refused to answer the important questions posed by Fine Gael and other Opposition parties in relation to a number of key issues, some of which I have mentioned already. Why were so many tax concessions agreed?  Why was export credit insurance reintroduced, despite the fact that other countries had refused to introduce such insurance in relation to Iraq?  What discussions took place about this matter and with whom?  What understandings were reached?  All these questions remain to be answered and the public will not be satisfied with silence on the part of the Taoiseach and his Ministers, who hope that all this will go away if a rescue plan is put in place.</P>
    <P>The full report prepared by the examiner may not be made available to the public.  This has serious consequences not only for the agricultural sector but for business in general.  The misdeeds of one man should not damage the reputation of a country or its citizens as a place to do business or lend money.  We still do not know the whereabouts of the £25 million lent by the Goodman group which is the subject of a court case in Cyprus.  I read in some articles of the possibility that this money was used for the procurement of arms, which could have serious security implications for this country.  These doubts, rumours and allegations should not be allowed to continue.  I hope the matter will be fully cleared up once and for all.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to think that the reputation of the beef export business has not been damaged over the past few months.  The Government's job is to restore that reputation by developing a sound beef export business involving the <Col N="342" /> producer, the processor and the marketing skills available to us.  Farmers must be involved totally and have a say in the development of their industry.  They must never again be dependent on a monopoly to purchase the raw material and find markets for the finished product.</P>
    <P>While the Bill before us refers only to the food processing sector, it is my opinion that one of the major structural problems in the economy is the prevalence of restrictive practices and anti-competitive conduct in many sectors of industry, trade and professional services. A general ban on anti-competitive practices is in my view the best way of ensuring that the economy will operate in an efficient manner to protect traders and consumers from anti-competitive practices, provide for adequate price competition and more generally prepare this country for the rigorous competition which will be opened up as a result of the Single Market in 1992.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael propose to incorporate into Irish law Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  These articles of the Treaty of Rome would then become directly enforceable in the Irish courts as regards domestic as well as international business transactions.  Predatory pricing, market sharing and all other abuses of the dominant position in the market would then become crimes in Irish law and the courts would have power to award damages. This would be far more effective than our present cumbersome procedure whereby there has to be a complaint, then an inquiry, a report, a recommendation to the Government, the drafting of an order which has to be approved in the Dáil, and finally action.  All this can take a considerable time.  This Bill will make such activities illegal from the date of enactment and legal proceedings could be instituted without any of that wasteful process.</P>
    <P>One of the best means of enforcement of this proposed legislation is provided for in section 4 (c) of the Bill, that is a remedy to seek damages.  The greatest possible deterrent to somebody who may be contemplating a collusive arrangement, a price fixing arrangement or an <Col N="343" /> abusive, dominant position is to realise that if, for example, he pushes someone to the wall it will cost him money.  It is only right that the courts should have the power to award damages to an injured party who has suffered as a result of anti-competitive practices.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope it will not be to long befoe the Minister himself brings a Competition Bill before the Dáil which will deal with the areas not covered by the Fine Gael Bill and I can assure him that if and when this happens he will have the full support of this side of the House in having it processed through this House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We have a bad history in terms of the development of monopolies.  We spoke at Question Time today about trying to achieve a balance between competition, the good of the consumer and the possible development of monopolies.  In relation to motor insurance, the PMPA eventually gathered a huge percentage of the market and then found themselves in difficulty. This House had to pass urgent legislation to protect the consumer so that motor insurance would continue to be available.  We have seen continual supermarket wars.  The average consumer is delighted when prices go down as a result of keen competition between supermarkets.  Keen competition is one thing but endeavouring to put a competitor out of business is another.  When the Minister is bringing in legislation he must recognise the necessary balance between the protection of the consumer and the protection of jobs in industry.  He must not allow the suppliers to supermarkets to be forced out of business as a result of unfair and improper competition.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is put on the Statute Book it will give guarantees to the Irish beef producer that the proposed rescue of the Goodman Group will not be carried out on the basis of excessive profits being made at the expense of the Irish economy. The Fine Gael Bill will ensure that (a) there is competition in the sector by banning, on pain of criminal penalties, all collusion or price fixing, and (b) no <Col N="344" /> one group would be able to hold more than 30 per cent of the killing capacity in the beef industry.  If the rescue plan goes ahead without proper competition legislation being in place, the Irish economy will have to meet the cost of the rescue of the banks and the owners of the Goodman Group.  This is almost as bad as asking the taxpayers to rescue the group. Any rescue should be based on normal profits, not on excessive profits resulting from lack of competition.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There is a story told of the writer, Ernest Hemingway, in his declining years.  While drinking in a bar he was approached by a lout looking for a fight.

It is cheap because it is clear that little effort has been put into the Bill.  I will demonstrate why.  It is clear also because, in the almost half hour that Deputy Seán Barrett spent speaking on the Bill, he scarcely referred to it but dealt instead with a topical matter.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Because of its opportunistic nature the Bill is fundamentally flawed.  I will deal with these flaws first and then set out the Government's position.  Leaving aside technical difficulties I see three areas of fundamental difficulty with this Bill. They are: first, its restricted scope; second, its mechanical approach to market shares and, third, the imposition primarily of criminal, as opposed to, civil sanctions.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in its title and content &mdash; this is taking the restricted scope question first &mdash; deals with just one sector of the economy, namely, the food processing sector.  Important as is this sector, it should not be singled out as being the only area of the economy with regard to which competition policy should be reformed.  This is the most fundamental flaw in the Bill and arises directly from the opportunistic motives which gave rise to it.  Indeed that was borne out in the contribution just made by Deputy Seán Barrett.</P>
    <P>One of the defects of existing legislation on competition &mdash; the Restrictive Practices Acts and Orders &mdash; is that there is a piecemeal approach to problems. While there are orders in relation to the grocery trade and petrol distribution, whole sectors of the economy are not subject to direct control.  Collusion, price-fixing and other undesirable anti-competitive practices are quite within the law.  At present, in order to regulate them, a lengthy and involved process is required before an order under the Restrictive Practices Acts can be made. I will not detail all of the necessary steps here; that was done very well by Deputy John Bruton in February last during his contribution to the debate on the Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, brought forward by the Progressive Democrats, which I was involved in promoting.</P>

      <P>Knowing what was said then by Deputy John Bruton and which hardly can have been forgotten in the <Col N="346" /> meantime, I am very surprised that an approach based on dealing with particular sectors is now being advocated because he made it very clear then that that would not and could not work.  I wonder what sector will come next?  I suppose whatever is the political flavour of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no way to deal with an issue so fundamental to economic well being as is undoubtedly competition policy.  If reform is necessary &mdash; and I agree it is essential &mdash; certainly it should not be confined to one sector.</P>
      <P>It is worth while looking at the implications of the proposed scope of the Bill because, in confining it to one sector, it seems to me, on reading the Bill, it is not just confined to food processing alone; it is confined only to some aspects of food processing.  According to section 2 of the Bill the &ldquo;food processing trade&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, which section defines &ldquo;processed food&rdquo; as:</P>
      <P>goods manufactured in the State in the course of trade by a company which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) are intended for human consumption as a food, and</P>
      <P>(b) have been manufactured by a process involving the use of machinery or plant whereby the goods which are produced by the application of that process differ substantially in form and value from the materials to which the process has been applied and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the process does not consist primarily of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the acceleration, retardation, alteration or application of a natural process, or</P>
      <P>(ii) the application of methods of preservation, pasteurisation or any similar treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> It is some mouthful, as is the case with definitions, particularly those contained in Finance Acts.  However, it is interesting more particularly for its exclusions than for what it covers.  It does not include preservation, pasteurisation or any similar treatment.  Therefore it does not cover one of the most significant activities of the dairy sector, namely, the preparation of milk for the liquid milk market.  Equally it does not cover, for example, the preparation of yoghurt.</P>
    <P>The omission of milk sold on the liquid milk market is an important omission especially as far as the consumer is concerned. It is also contrary to the clear impression conveyed in the press release which accompanied the publication of this Bill, which statement made great play of the importance of the milk market.  The omission of milk from the Bill now is curious, especially since there is a total and collusive lack of competition in the liquid milk retail trade commented on within the past couple of weeks by the Director of Consumer Affairs who deplores the collusion present in that trade.  I would like to add my voice, for what it is worth, to that of the Director of Consumer Affairs in deploring that collusion.  No matter where one goes in this country, no matter to what form of outlet one goes, the price of a litre of fresh, liquid milk is exactly the same &mdash; in the largest supermarket, the smallest shop or delivered to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Likewise, the definition used in the Bill does not include packaging of produce in preparation for retail sale.  As a result it would seem to exclude a great deal of food.  These are significant omissions arising, I imagine, because the source of the definition is a provision in a Finance Act designed to address issues such as capital allowances and the treatment of grants.  This deficiency underlines the lack of thought in the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if it is correct to approach competition policy on a sector by sector basis &mdash; an approach which, I must make clear, I do not at all accept &mdash; it cannot be correct to deal with just one element within that sector.  Food processing is an important link in the chain between primary producer and the final consumer. Market behaviour by processors can have an effect on suppliers of raw materials and on consumers, but that is not the complete picture in the food industry. The primary producer does not always deal directly with the processor.  Similarly the processor need not deal directly with the retailer.  This Bill deals, as I have said, with just one link in that chain. What about the rest?  If the fixing of purchase or supply prices is undesirable if carried out by the processor what makes it acceptable for primary producers, wholesalers, retailers or other middle men to engage in such practices?  It makes no sense that only the processors are singled out and all the other people <Col N="349" /> involved can go scot-free even if they do exactly the same thing and it is equally damaging and equally undesirable.  The idea of trying to apply new competition rules to just part of one sector is quite unworkable.  Rather than improving matters it creates obvious anomalies.  Competition policy is too serious an issue to be dealt with in such a frivolous fashion.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals in the Bill is that, in effect, a ceiling of 30 per cent limit should be applied to any company's share of capacity in either beef or dairy processing. Later on I will deal with the practical difficulty of operating simply on the basis of measuring such shares.  For the moment I want to address the principle involved.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it is realistic to fix an arbitrary fixture as a ceiling on the market share of any enterprise in a particular sector.  The extent to which competition exists or can exist cannot be decided in the abstract by reference to some automatic formula.  It is a matter that requires examination on a case by case basis.  The market share held by one enterprise has to be judged in the light of other factors, including the share, actual and potential, of others in the market.</P>
    <P>Competition policy is directed at something more than the structures within the marketplace.  It is also concerned with behaviour.  Most of the provisions of the Bill recognise this to the extent that something close to the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome appear in 4A and 4B of section 3.  These provisions deal with anti-competitive agreements, arrangements and practices and with the abuse of dominant positions. These are essentially issues of behaviour.</P>
    <P>Structures do play a part, of course, but only a part.  In assessing mergers under the terms of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, the market share that would result from a proposal is an essential part of the assessment process, but it is not everything, nor are there handy mathematical formulae that will produce ready answers.  The reality of the marketplace is different and much more complex.  It <Col N="350" /> is interesting that in applying its Regulations on the Control of Concentrations the European Commission does not apply automatic criteria in respect of market shares.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the question of how such an automatic ceiling might operate.  As a generous gesture I will assume that there is no difficulty in measuring the share of processing capacity that is held by each company in the sector and that it is plain where the control of each company lies.  I might add that these are big assumptions, and I know from practical experience that they are unrealistic, but I am anxious to get to the core of the difficulty with this proposal.  Two examples will illustrate the point.</P>
    <P>First, from 1 January 1993 companies will be free to trade across national boundaries within the Community.  This has increasingly become the case already. If the size of operation that would be viable in that Community market, with more than 340 million consumers, is such that it would exceed 30 per cent of the processing capacity for the sector in Ireland, are we to condemn that sector in Ireland to failure by limiting it to a size that means it cannot compete in Europe or the world at large?  That would be absurd, but that is what is proposed in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Secondly, take a sector evenly divided between four companies. Each has a share of 25 per cent of the capacity.  One of the companies closes. The reason for its closure does not matter.  It could be a matter of losing a licence or its premises going on fire.  Am I, then, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to order that each of the three remaining companies who now have 33 per cent of the capacity are each to divest themselves of some of their capacity because of what has happened? What if they have only one plant each? What happens when the fourth company rebuilds its plant?  Again this is absurd and so divorced from reality as to defy belief.  One could not order the companies concerned with one plant each to close down in order to comply with the requirement set out in this Bill.  This particular provision is totally unacceptable and undermines whatever value lies in the remainder of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for both criminal and civil sanctions.  In the United States criminal sanctions are available in respect of offences of the type envisaged here. <Col N="353" /> However, the pattern within the European Community is for civil remedies. The Enterprise (Competition and Consumer Protection) Bill, 1989, which was debated here last year followed this pattern. It provided for civil sanctions only. It was not confined to damages being awarded, as this Bill is, but also provided for injunctions to be granted.  This is an adequate range of remedies to deal with relationships between businesses and between them and their customers.</P>
    <P>It does place on onus on the people concerned to decide what really affects them and to what practices they should give priority in taking action.  That is the way it should be in business.  There may be a need for some authority to provide support but the emphasis should be on people relying on themselves.</P>
    <P>The over reliance of this Bill on criminal sanctions is a mistake.  It may be worthwhile for a business to risk a fine being imposed if the likelihood of conviction, requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, and the level of the fine is much less then the excess profits to be obtained.</P>
    <P>The full range of civil action is a better option.  In certain cases on injunction may be far more valuable than an award of damages or the imposition of a fine.  This element of the Bill requires a fundamental rethink.</P>
    <P>The other point that occurs to me on looking at the criminal sanctions that are included in the Bill is that it is not made clear whether or not the offences created are to be regarded as indictable offences or summary offences.  In the absence of the statement to the contrary I presume one would have to assume they were indictable offences which would have to be tried before a jury.  So far as the penalties are concerned the six months imprisonment certainly would be well within the limits of the District Court and of a summary conviction, but the proposed fine of £100,000 would be rather beyond that.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not make it clear what type the various offences are.  In those circumstances it would probably be impossible to prosecute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> Incorporating provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome into Irish domestic law involves a new and radical approach to competition policy.  It involves taking a qualitative leap from a system based on the control of abuse to a system which prohibits anti-competitive activity in general.  Such a giant leap which is to change the way we look at problems with business behaviour requires much more than this fashion conscious two page effort loosely stitched on to a piece of existing legislation.  It is particularly disappointing to see that this is all that could be produced after a fairly full debate on this very subject in February last year.  There are many gaps and omissions and I am talking here about points of substance and not just minor drafting details.</P>
    <P>What, for example, is to become of all the existing legislation on competition? Where are the safeguards?  Where is the provision for review?  What about appeal?  Should the activites of the Commission not be made transparent and what about accountability?</P>
    <P>To begin with the status of existing legislation, the Bill refers to the Civil Liability Act, 1961, the Finance Act, 1987 and the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  No reference is, however, made to the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  Nor is there a reference to the vast body of legislation under the Restrictive Practices Act &mdash; namely the Restrictive Practice Orders.  Are they to exist side by side with this proposed Bill?  If so, surely the Bill amounts to nothing more than just another Restrictive Practice Order for a part of the food processing sector. I thought the idea was to move away from this approach.  Indeed, it is difficult to know just what the intent of the Bill really is.  It would seem to have started out rather ambitiously but has failed to carry through.  Was it a case of cold feet or is a manifestation of the clear opportunism which prompted a Bill with this title at this time.</P>
    <P>There is a need to amend existing legislation. This I acknowledge and it is part of the approach we are taking in our <Col N="355" /> competition Bill which will be before the Dáil in the next session.  Our existing legislation based on a control of abuse system involves a complex and time consuming process and is a cumbersome way of achieving fairness in business behaviour. It has to follow that provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome, if incorporated into Irish law, will require changes in existing legislation and a different approach.</P>
    <P>Something which should concern any legislator and which should be built in to any Bill which seeks to regulate behaviour to the extent that is purported in this Bill, are safeguards.  The Bill before us gives the Fair Trade Commission the power to make declarations as to the applicability of section 3 which amends the 1987 Act.  Without providing for rights of appeal, this surely amounts to giving the Commission extraordinary judicial power.  This is certainly not desirable and it amounts to a serious and dangerous omission in the Bill.  If this subject were treated seriously it would have been plain to see that the courts must have a role to play in this process.</P>
    <P>Another problem which arises with the Commission relates to the status of its declarations.  How long do they last for and what happens if circumstances change?  It would have been very simple to include some sort of review clause in this section.  Yet its omission places such a shadow of uncertainty over the Commission and its powers that I doubt if it could ever be brought to operate effectively following such scant and incomplete guidance.</P>
    <P>Compounding the uncertainty is the absence of definition in the Bill.  What, for example, is an undertaking?  Is it a business, a person, a group of persons? Is it the public sector or the private sector?  It is all the more curious that these questions have to be asked now as it appears that a discussion document on 1992 produced by Fine Gael two years ago advocated that Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome should be introduced into Irish law and made applicable to commercial activities in both the public <Col N="356" /> and private sectors.  Why now shy away from such a bold approach?  And if this is still the intention why not make this clear in the provisions of the Bill?</P>
    <P>Still on the subject of the Commission, how, we must ask, is it to cope with this new volume of work and additional power?  Does the Deputy think that these new duties can simply be subsumed under the mantle of their existing responsibilities? This is naive to say the least. Surely a competition Bill, if it is to approach the problem of prohibiting anti-competitive behaviour in any meaningful way, should contain provisions for a reassessment of the role and functions of the Commission and, if it is warranted, provide for increased resources, powers and facilities.  If the machinery for implementing this new policy approach is not put in place then it is futile to argue that anything can be achieved or that anything can be changed.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other questions that could be asked about the role of the Commission.  What is the procedure for an undertaking requiring an exemption? Should it follow a procedure similar to that established by the EC Commission? Will the Commission be empowered to carry out investigations and what is the role of the Commission in relation to section 3 which amends the 1987 Act?  I could proceed but I doubt if I would get any satisfactory answers to these queries.</P>
    <P>In summary, it should be abundantly clear to all who are concerned about competition policy that we need serious, reasoned, comprehensive and balanced legislation in this area.  This policy area has long been neglected but its importance has come to dominate the agenda at many different levels.  The Government have recognised its importance and will very soon be in a position to present their response.  The social partners, in the context of the programme for economic and social development, have also seen the importance of competition for stimulating economic activity and thereby increasing employment.  We have been reminded at European level that we cannot survive if we do not have the <Col N="357" /> competitive edge.  For too long we have sheltered under the protectionist cloak whether this was in the form of subsidies, artificial price controls, restrictive practices or cosy business arrangements.</P>

      <P>It is heartening to see the general level of agreement on the desirability of a new conceptual approach to the problems of competition policy. The growing awareness and appreciation of the conceptual problems, even if still flawed and incomplete, can, however, only be welcomed and, although I cannot support and must oppose this Bill, I look forward to a full and thoughtful debate on the Government's Bill during the next session.  The definition of the food processing trade, as I quoted it from section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, includes only trades carried on by a company.  As I am sure most Members are aware, much of the business in food processing is not carried on by companies but by friendly societies or co-operatives of one kind or another.  This is another omission in the Bill which would have a serious effect so far as its application is concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett devoted much of his speech to the Goodman problem and various items related to that.  It is not appropriate for me to deal with that.  I came in to deal with the Bill before me and with nothing else.  I do not want it to be assumed that, because I did not reply to some of the matters raised by Deputy Barrett, and in particular the points raised in relation to a court case, I accept in any way what was said.  If assumptions are made by the examiner or anyone else in relation to a particular court case I do not accept those assumptions.  I regard them as very big assumptions and I will fight them to the greatest possible extent. If the Deputy feels I was wrong, as he suggests I might have been, in cancelling export credit insurance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thought we would have a decent speech when the Minister commenced with a Hemingway story which I heard 20 years ago.  However, it went downhill from there on which was disappointing.</P>
      <P>Despite the Minister's latter remarks that we need serious and reasonably comprehensive legislation in this area, I resent the fact that he does not seem to take this Bill seriously, despite its flaws and weaknesses.  That is surprising given his comments in Opposition over the last five years.  He portrayed himself as a person concerned about many weaknesses in our competition legislation.</P>
      <P>His speech was disappointing to say the least.  It verged on insulting to those who drew up the Bill.  Deputies in Opposition do not have the back-up of civil servants or the parliamentary draftsmen when drafting legislation.  Notwithstanding the difficulties the Minister has with the Bill, I hope tonight's debate will spur him into taking action in this area which, as he said on many occasions, is one which needs urgent attention.  I am glad he recognised the fact that we need legislation in this area.  Despite his reservations about the possibility of this Bill focusing on one sector of the food processing industry, I do not feel any inhibition because of these remarks.  The reality is that this Bill might not be before the House were it not for difficulties being experienced in that area at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support the Bill as far as the food processing sector is concerned.  This is very timely in view of the anomalies and weaknesses which have been highlighted in this area.  We would like to add to the <Col N="359" /> Bill and improve it.  I do not believe that any party can claim to have all the knowledge, wisdom or best ideas on how to deal with reforming legislation and the Bill could do with some improvement. However, the basic principles should be welcomed.  If the Government saw fit, we could, on Committee Stage, strengthen the Bill as it deals with competition in the food processing industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I do not have any confidence in this Government.  Up to the last ten or 15 minutes my lack of confidence was in the Fianna Fáil component of the Government but now I have no confidence in the Coalition accepting the Bill in its present form or even the principles of it.  They will see it as a measure aimed at curtailing the monopolistic tendencies of a small number of entrepreneurs, particularly in the beef sector. The history of Fianna Fáil in Government, particularly since 1987, suggests that their primary interest has been to facilitate and encourage those monopolistic tendencies.  In the course of the past six months we have seen the disastrous results of this policy.</P>
    <P>As this Bill is aimed at removing the possibility of a monopoly in the beef processing sector in particular, I will confine my remarks to the fall-out from the Goodman affair which, after all, provided the principal impetus for this Bill.</P>
    <P>In a previous debate I spoke about the necessity to clean up the beef industry in the interests of workers, farmers, consumers and the country generally.  We are now facing a situation where a large number of foreign banks, with little or no interest in our economic development, are on the verge of becoming major players in the beef processing sector.  For that we have to thank one Mr. Larry Goodman.  It has become a trite and convenient argument advanced by most lobbies on behalf of the Goodman Group that the banks are entirely to blame for the debacle we witnessed last August.  In this House the Taoiseach gave credence to that propaganda in his dismissive references to bankers and the attitude of bankers towards business.  The truth is <Col N="360" /> that Ireland as a small trading economy must be able to hold up its head and assert that in all its business dealings, including its dealings with banks, it has behaved honourably.  We cannot make that assertion in respect of the Goodman fiasco.  It bears repeating that that fiasco was caused by the decision of one man and his advisers to mislead banks quite deliberately about the purposes for which money was borrowed and spent.  If most of the rest of us did that in our dealings with banks, we would have spent the last six months defending ourselves in court against civil actions, if we were lucky, and possibly against criminal charges or fraud.</P>
    <P>Instead what do we find?  The banks are forced into a rescue plan in which Mr. Goodman will retain 40 per cent of the new business, the banks will hold 10 per cent and the remaining 50 per cent will be placed in trust to revert to Mr. Goodman if a certain profit target is met.  This is as close to getting away scot free as I have ever seen, especially when Mr. Goodman's personal wealth has not contributed in the slightest degree towards the cost of the restructuring.  However there are, in my view, a number of serious obstacles still be to overcome before this agreement can be seen as fitting the letter or the spirit of Irish and European legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I have today written to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to outline my views on the agreement which will be before the High Court tomorrow.  I would like to take this opportunity to read that letter into the record of the House because I believe what must be paramount in any consideration of the latest developments in this case is what our Constitution calls the exigencies of the common good, and what we often refer to in this House as the national interest. The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>I understand that you will be considering the Goodman re-structuring under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies legislation of 1978 and 1987.  I am accordingly taking this <Col N="361" /> opportunity to express to you a number of concerns that I have in relation to this whole matter.  As I understand it, the relevant legislation gives you the power to refer this matter to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices for examination and report under a number of headings.  These headings include <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;the extent to which the proposed merger or takeover would be likely to prevent or restrict competition or to restrain trade or the provision of any service;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extent to which the proposed merger or takeover would be likely to affect employment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the interests of shareholders and partners in the enterprises involved;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the interests of employees in the enterprises involved; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>In addition to the various matters which must be considered by the Examiner on your referral, the Act of 1978 also empowers the Minister, &ldquo;if he thinks that the exigencies of the common good so warrant&rdquo; to prohibit a proposed merger or takeover absolutely or to lay down conditions for such merger.  Having regard to all of these provisions and, in particular, the responsibility vested in you to ensure &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good&rdquo; I would like to make the following points:</P>
    <P>1.  Serious question marks continue to surround aspects of the operations of this company prior to the re-structuring. In particular, it is my understanding that the security and intelligence authorities of several countries are investigating the provenance and purpose of a loan, the proceeds of which are lodged in a Cyprus bank and subject to a number of legal actions.</P>
    <P>2.  The principal suppliers to this company (i.e. beef producers) have a moral right to be satisfied that prices for their product will not be artificially controlled in order to facilitate the <Col N="362" /> making of excess profits to finance the re-structuring.</P>
    <P>3.  The trade unions seeking to organise workers employed by the company have been continuously rebuffed (and in fact only succeeded in meeting the Examiner of the company following a threat of widespread industrial action).  Conditions of employment in the company are very much inferior to standards commonly regarded as acceptable throughout industry.</P>
    <P>4.  It is understood that there is no intention of securing any contribution from the personal wealth of the former proprietor of the company towards the cost of the re-structuring.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues also arise, and in my view they too are fundamentally important.  The first of these arises in connection with recently enacted European Community merger and takeover legislation.  Council Regulation No. 4064/89 (21st December 1989) on the Control of Concentrations between Undertakings entered into force in this country on 21st September 1990.  On my reading of the regulation, its provisions appear to apply to this case.</P>
    <P>Under Article 4 of that Regulation, concentrations with a Community dimension &ldquo;shall be notified to the Commission not more than one week after the conclusion of the agreement, or the announcement of the public bid, or the acquisition of the controlling interest.  That week shall begin when the first of these events occurs.&rdquo;  In this case, it would appear that the first event to occur was the agreement between the banks, Goodman, and the Examiner, and that the one week deadline has therefore expired.  Responsibility for notification rests on all parties to the transaction.</P>
    <P>Third parties with a sufficient interest in the agreement (in this case both farmers and employees would surely feel that they qualify) are <Col N="363" /> entitled to be heard before the Commission before it arrives at any conclusion. An important aspect of the notification procedure is that it enables a member state to complain to the Commission that a concentration threatens to create or to strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded on a market within that member state.  It is a matter for the Commission to decide whether to take action under the regulation.  The point is that the agreement should be notified to the Commission in order for it to make up its own mind, and that once the concentration has a &ldquo;Community dimension&rdquo; the obligation to notify arises.  Finally, in this connection, a copy of any notification sent to the Commission should be sent to the competent authority of the member state, (in this case, yourself) within three working days and the Commission is obliged to carry out the procedures under the regulation &ldquo;in close and constant liaison&rdquo; with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Arising from this, it seems to me, there are certain questions:</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether to your knowledge any notification of the agreement reached between the Goodman Group and its creditors was made to the European Commission pursuant to EC Regulation 4064/89 within the one week time limit provided by that regulation;</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether a copy of any such notification has been received by you from the Commission;</P>
    <P>&mdash;whether an opportunity will be given to interested parties to make representations to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The third area in addition to &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good&rdquo; and the European dimension, which needs to be considered, is the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.</P>
    <P>As you are aware, this code is issued <Col N="364" /> by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, a body consisting of representatives of the Bank of England and a series of British professional bodies. There is no representative of any Irish body on the Panel &mdash; however, because the London and Dublin Stock Exchanges are linked together, the Panel exercises jurisdiction in the Irish Republic as well as in the United Kingdom. The Code does not have the force of law, but all persons professionally concerned with the securities markets are obliged to comply with its provisions. The Code applies to all offers for companies listed on the Stock Exchange which are resident in either Britain or Ireland.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Code is to regulate &ldquo;offers&rdquo; whereby &ldquo;control&rdquo; of a company is to be obtained or consolidated (&ldquo;control&rdquo; in this case means a holding of shares carrying 30% or more of the voting rights of a company).</P>
    <P>Following the vote in favour of the rescue plan by the banks, Mr. Larry Goodman will retain a 40 per cent shareholding in the new business, while the banks will hold 10 per cent.  The remaining 50 per cent will be placed in trust and will either revert to Mr. Goodman (if certain profit targets are met), or to the banks.  The banks therefore could potentially end up holding 60 per cent of the company.</P>
    <P>The holding company in this case, Goodman International, is a private company to which the takeover Code does not apply.  However, one of its subsidiary companies, Food International plc, is a public company. Depending on the precise details of the proposals accepted by the banks, it may well be that an offer is being made for control of at least 30 per cent of that company, within the meaning of the Code.  If there is doubt on that question, it is one to be resolved by the Panel.</P>
    <P>The major rule of the Code which would be relevant to this case is Rule 9.  This provides that where a person, or a series of persons acting in concert (such as a group of banks), acquire <Col N="365" /> shares which carry 30 per cent or more of the voting rights of a company, he or they must extend offers for all the remaining equity share capital, at a price which may require to be adjudicated upon by the Panel.  The Panel is entitled to waive this obligation in circumstances which seem to it to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The question this must give rise to in your consideration of the Goodman case is whether or not your Department has considered the question of the applicability of the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers to the Goodman proposals.  If so, you must be satisfied that the provisions of Rule 9 of the Code (already set out above) have been complied with.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate if the Minister would take the opportunity of this debate to clarify the questions raised, which I believe are very important.  It will be clear from the contents of that letter to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is not my view that the interests of the common good will be well served by allowing this take-over to go through. The Minister has, as I outlined, a number of options; he can refer the matter to the examiner of Restrictive Practices; he can reject the agreement or make it subject to conditions; he can ensure that it is referred to Europe or he can insist that it be made subject to the take-over panel rules.  He must exercise these options in respect of this agreement.  I would welcome the Minister's comments in relation to clarifying his attitude as he has not spoken in this regard since the announcement of the agreement by the banks.</P>
    <P>The agreement is in the interests of only one person.  It is not in the interests of people who depend for their livelihood on the production of beef; nor is it in the interest of those who are at present employed under, sometimes, very dubious circumstances in this industry.  I do not even believe that it is in the long term interest of the banks involved and that there will be any protection in the agreement for them in the event of another <Col N="366" /> debacle like the one we witnessed last August.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill the Government have missed a very significant opportunity to bring about an improvement in this area.  When we debated the Companies (Amendment) Bill last August in an emergency session, there was a very clear understanding in this House &mdash; and outside it &mdash; that we were buying time and facilitating the orderly dismantling of this business with a view to putting something better and more creditable in its place in the medium term.  That opportunity only exists if the air of short term crisis in the beef industry can be dispelled.  In particular, the opportunity is only there between killing seasons.  The Government, instead of embarking on the restructuring of the industry to take account of new conditions in the market as well as in the manufacturing end, have given the time to restructuring Mr. Larry Goodman instead.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in particular, who made his strong views known to this House in the past two to three years, has missed the opportunity to restructure the beef industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House again affords an opportunity to the Government to restructure the beef processing industry because there was a debacle, despite promises, press conferences and a launching of a major private sector company by the Government and, indeed, in association with the Government, over the last couple of years.  It has all come to nought.  Not only that but the whole of the Irish beef processing sector has been brought to the brink of a major disaster and many people will regret the failure of the Government to grasp the opportunity which presented itself, albeit in very unfortunate circumstances, over the last couple of months.  It appears that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has lost his nerve in relation to the statements made in this House over the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthy of debate within this House and of acceptance on Second Stage.  As I said at the outset, there is <Col N="367" /> room for improvement but I do not think anybody who has ever presented a Bill to this House would attempt to claim that this Bill has all the answers.  It is regrettable that the Minister &mdash; and, indeed, the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; seem to consider this Bill unworthy of improvement or serious debate, from the comments the Minister made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of progressive industries in the country and some of the most progressive are in my constituency.  They concentrate on an integrated approach but this Bill adopts a negative approach.  It is not in line with the attitude we should be adopting in our preparation for the Single European Market.  All right thinking people know how important the food industry is to this country; its development is a major part of Government policy to increase <Col N="368" /> employment, prosperity for farmers, processing workers and marketing staff.  All these people, and many more, dpend on it.</P>
      <P>There are shining examples of success in that industry.  Two in my constituency are beacons, the poultry and the mushroom industries.  There are many similar examples throughout my constituency. There are many industries in Cavan and Monaghan based on processing by competent factories of the products of hard working farmers in the area.  It would be a pity if my constituents were misled by this Bill into thinking that it would benefit them.</P>
      <P>The food industry needs all the help it can get from State sources and, above all, it needs a steady economy, very low &mdash; or nil &mdash; levels of inflation, good employer-labour relations and Government finances to be on a sound basis. Since 1987 all those conditions have been developed by the Government and that must be admitted.  It is a pity the Government of which many of the speakers tonight were members in the years 1983 to 1987 caused so much damage, through their irresponsible policies, to the economy. One only has to look back at the levels of Government borrowing which were a constant millstone round the necks of our people to know how irresponsible they were.</P>
      <P>There were high levels of inflation during the years of that Coalition Government.  What kind of help was given to the food industry during those four years?</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on section 3 of the Bill which talks about controls by a company or companies of more than 30 per cent of the total processing capacity in the beef or dairy sectors. Speakers on the far side kept talking about beef but they forgot about milk and the dairying sector.  Of course, it was embarrassing for them to mention the dairy sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent events in the beef sector gave rise to this section and indeed to the Bill.  There will always be problems in any industry which gives an excessively large amount of control into one person's hands.  However, I wish to remind Deputies opposite that that is not necessarily bad.  It only becomes bad when the dominant position is abused. This Bill seems to give no discretion to the Minister.  The proposed section 4D states that if a company, or a group of companies, controls more than 30 per cent of the total processing capacity in either the beef or dairy processing section the Minister shall by order require that company or group of companies to sell, within six months of the making of such order, such plants or processing facilities as are necessary to reduce the share of the processing capacity to below 30 per cent of the total processing capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> This Bill is not operable.  The Minister mentioned the serious situation which could face a number of industries if they were divided up.  This Bill does not allow any discretion to the Minister.  Is that sensible?  Have the Deputies opposite given any thought to international markets with whom we will be competing very shortly?  Have the Deputies opposite never heard of 1992 and what it means?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be an Irish company or a group of companies with 31 per cent of the total capacity operating successfully with great benefit to producers and employees generally.  I would always advocate that the ownership of trading and processing facilities in agricultural products should, to a large extent, be in the hands of farmers or farmer co-operatives.  Before I came into the Dáil I helped to build up a co-operative which is very successful now.  Since I came to the Dáil I have tried to ensure the development of all possible industries in my constituency.  I am satisfied with how those industries have prepared for 1992.  They looked at every aspect of industry from production to marketing. This Bill confines us to competitiveness in processing.</P>
      <P>It is well to recall that from 1983 to 1987 I harassed the Coalition Government to implement measures suggested by the EC to break down barriers, to get rid of the monopoly which the Dublin District Milk Board had since the thirties.  The Government reacted against that suggestion at all times.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as Deputy O'Kennedy became Minister for Agriculture, he ensured that the dairies throughout the provinces could sell milk in Dublin.  Until then the provincial dairies could not come to the city but the city dairies could go to the provinces and reduce the price of milk leading to <Col N="371" /> uncompetitiveness in the provinces.  The provincial dairies are at the moment building a strong distribution base.</P>
      <P>This is a time to instil confidence in the meat processing area.  The difficulties of the industry are not of our own making. Most of the difficulties are outside our control.  They relate to Iraq and Iran, to disease problems and so on.  These problems have been amplified to our disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite referred to monopoly in the meat area but I notice that few people have moved in to invest money in this area in the past six or eight months and I do not know whether they will in the future.  We need to develop this industry.  We need commitment and good labour relations.  In my constituency we have an adequate, adaptable labour force and much could be done there. In County Monaghan, we produce two thirds of the eggs for the Twenty-six Counties, half of the broilers, 90 per cent of the turkeys, and 100 per cent of the ducks, quail and pheasants.  These industries have been built up in an overall way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a monopoly because these industries are based on a very solid structure.</P>
      <P>We should concentrate on providing skills in our VECs.  We should recommend classes in food hygiene, food treatment and general hygiene standards to prevent disease and ensure that we can continue with disease free status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mushroom industry in Monaghan we have an example of a well structured integrated approach, from the manufacturing of the growing tunnels to the manufacturing of compost to the purchasing of mushrooms to supply the British fresh market, to the mushrooms which are not of the first quality and which are processed and sold on the European market.  The whole mushroom industry has been developed from A to Z.  That is the type of approach to take and not the sector by sector approach <Col N="372" /> advocated by the people on the other side.  It is important to have an integrated approach.</P>
    <P>There is great employment opportunity in the food sector.  It should be developed further.  We have to compliment our food processing industries on their initiative and enterprise in product development which is a very expensive area.  The industries from their own resources have developed products very effectively.</P>
    <P>I referred to mushrooms and poultry which have been developed.  On the radio a few days ago, a young Irishman who had gone to work in a German factory was featured.  He returned to Ireland and set up in Clones, recruiting all his own staff in the 18 to 20 age bracket and training them.  He has built a small factory employing 70 people.  He will be increasing employment to 85, and he has a £5 million turnover.  These unique &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; products were featured on radio and television last week.  The designs on the meat comprised various animals and so on.  This made the meat very attractive to youngsters.  This is an example of where a young man with initiative &mdash; in this case the person concerned came from a family who had been involved traditionally in the dairy industry &mdash; has a £5 million market exporting sausages to Germany.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> He has been very selective in the legislation he has introduced.  It is a pity it is being introduced on the basis of getting at the Goodman Group rather than on a proper legislative basis.  A Bill which deals only with competition in the food processing industry does not go far enough.  There is a number of industries in Wexford which deal with food processing; among them are Slaney Meats &mdash; they provide 300 jobs &mdash; sheep processing and value added cooked meats, and Halal also deal with sheep processing.  This industry, despite the problems of the last six months, have made tremendous strides over the past decade.  The food industry is a major component of our exports.  It is geared reasonably well to deal with and to compete on the European and world stage in the years ahead.  To single out the food processing aea as the one <Col N="374" /> that needs a Bill to deal with competition is not on.</P>
      <P>Food processing is an important link in producing food for the consumer.  One cannot deal with food processing in isolation because as the Minister stated, other areas need to be looked at.  In many cases the processor is not the person who deals with the farmer &mdash; there are many people in between &mdash; wholesalers and retailers.  In my constituency usually the dealer purchases the product from the farmer and sells it to meat factories and the food processors.  One could say there is very little competition among the dealers or that a cartel is in operation. That area needs to be looked at, but when one thinks of cartels and lack of competition, there are many other areas that spring to mind solicitors, insurance companies, banks and the liquid milk industry to which somebody referred earlier. There is need for a Bill to examine this whole area and any new legislation must cover all the areas that need to be looked at.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that new legislation will be on stream to reform the present competition law.  As we are all aware, this is part of the Programme for Government agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  The Minister has given a commitment to introduce legislation in the next session to deal with all aspects of competition and monopolies. Two years ago we had a very good debate on this topic.  Any debate in this House that awakens the need for new legislation in this area must be welcomed.  The Minister should proceed as quickly as possible to ensure that the legislation is before the House in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with competition and monopolies, one has to look at it from different sides.  In the supermarkets at present there is much competition, but who is benefiting?  We have had open competition and open warfare on prices. It certainly helps the consumer in the short term but down the road it affects a great many people.  When we look back at the bread war of about 12 or 18 months ago, we see that severe problems were caused for the bakeries at that time.  In <Col N="375" /> my constituency the £6 voucher has caused severe problems for suppliers to supermarkets in the last few week because pressure was put on them to supply vegetables and other products at very low prices.  It also meant having to wait six months for payment and in many cases they were not able to survive.  This whole area of competition needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>A Bill to deal with below cost selling was passed but I am not sure it is operating very well when we look at the situation that developed in the supermarkets in the last few weeks.  Certainly some of the prices at which goods were being sold involved an element of below cost selling. That puts pressure on suppliers and causes problems down the road in regard to job losses.  If we are to look at competition we will have to look also at the effects it will have on small industries and industries which are supplying supermarkets and other large multiple chains.</P>
    <P>When open competition on the airways was introduced in the United States many airlines went out of existence. While there was a short term reduction in prices, in the long term it meant a monopoly was created and many airlines were put out of business.  We now have a few of the larger airlines charging what they like.  I hope that will not happen here.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> As I said earlier, the Bill before us should be far more wide-ranging.  I would not be particularly opposed to it if it dealt with all the areas we talk about.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett called for a plan for the beef industry rather than a monopoly. With 320 million people in Europe, and because of the Single European Act, there are new markets to be tapped. What worries me a little &mdash; leaving aside the Goodman debacle &mdash; is that the leading co-operatives or the leading industries do not appear to be rushing to get involved in the beef sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> It amazes me that some of the major co-operatives which have been amalgamated and are regarded as big players have not become involved in the beef industry or, as Deputy Leonard said earlier, the pig industry.  There must be opportunities for these co-operatives to become involved in the beef industry with the development of European markets and the removal of the barriers in Eastern Europe.  I do not think it is good enough for the co-operatives to just continue what they are doing at the moment. Farmers should have a bigger say in what co-ops do in the future.  At present it is a case of the tail wagging the dog, in the sense that the directors and chief executives seem to make the decisions for the co-operatives, and some of those decisions are not seen to be in the best interests of farmers, particularly smaller farmers.  Farmers themselves are somewhat to blame for this because they have not encouraged the co-ops to get involved in the beef and pig industries or other areas where they can develop.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Even though the price paid to farmers for milk has dropped by 15 to 20 per cent over the past three to six months, this drop has not been reflected by a reduction in the price of milk to housewives.  I believe housewives are being ripped off in this respect and both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture and Food should take a direct interest in this area.  There should be some reduction in the price housewives have to pay for milk.  I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take an interest in this issue.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I want to refer to the Bill itself.  As the Minister said, <Col N="377" /> under section 3 the commission will be able to take action against anyone who steps out of line and they will have full judicial powers.  If the Bill is to operate fairly surely there should be a right of appeal to a higher court or to the Minister? I am not sure what Deputy Barrett has in mind in this section, but under any system there should be such a right.  I ask that that point be clarified.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to participate in this debate.  Any debate which deals with monopolies or the lack of competition in any industry is to be welcomed.  I hope the Minister will introduce new legislation to deal with this area shortly after the Christmas recess as I believe such legislation is needed.</P>

      <P>I found the contribution of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, to be extremely negative.  I have been in this House for ten or 12 years and I do not think I have ever heard such a dismissive or insulting opening sentence as that at the beginning of the Minister's speech tonight.  I do not care who wrote the speech but I want it to go back to him and his Department that I do not think it is appropriate to bore holes in this legislation.  We can all do that but it is not needed.  I am sure that when the Minister introduces his Bill into the House there will be ample opportunity to do that.  We acknowledge, of course, that the Bill is not all-embracing &mdash; we never intended it to be.  We found that there was a particular problem in the food processing industry which may in the next 48 hours or couple of weeks dictate the prices Irish farmers will receive for their produce for the next seven years.  I do not think there is anything wrong in bringing legislation on to the Floor of this House <Col N="378" /> which will not alone deal with the competition aspect in the food processing industry but will also throw light on many other aspects.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister, I have to say I believe he has a genuine interest in this industry.  As Deputy Spring said, he has the full back-up of the Department, and I assume he has put a lot of time into the preparation of the proposed Bill. However, I have listened for a long time to promises to introduce such a Bill.  If the Bill is as important as the Minister suggested tonight I cannot understand why it has taken almost 18 months to introduce it.  After all it has been part of the agreed legislative programme of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil since the last general election and was part of the Progressive Democrats' policy before that, which I remember voting for in the House one night.  Therefore people should not think that we were trying to jump the gun by introducing this Bill. The Government have had plenty of opportunities over the past two or three years to introduce such a Bill.  There must be a wealth of information in the Department on this issue which means such a Bill could have been introduced by the Minister long before now, and I object strongly to the tone of the Minister's contribution here tonight.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which deals with restrictive practices and monopolies in the food processing sector, is of vital importance. Never before has there been such a necessity to create an environment where genuine competition would be allowed to prosper.  This Bill is in the best interests of producers, consumers and, in the long term, processors.  This Fine Gael Bill fills a void in existing legislation, and the Government would do well to study it line by line before voting it down.  It is a genuine honest effort to strengthen the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, to ensure that a true competitive spirit will be fostered and that all food processors will at least be able to play on a level pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne and Deputy Leonard asked why others in the beef industry do not want to get in on the act.  After the <Col N="379" /> announcement of the food processing package by the Fianna Fáil Government two or three years ago which was built around the Goodman organisation, other processors must have felt left out on that occasion and believed that Fianna Fáil wanted the Goodman empire to do the food processing for them.  That is the reason they feel left out and are not getting involved.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not in any way help lame ducks, far from it.  It will gear the food processing industry to capitalise on the vast potential arising from the opportunities which will be presented with the completion of the internal market in 1992.  The cornerstone of any modern economy is its ability to provide an effective competition policy.  Ireland has much to gain by having an imaginative policy on competition in the food processing industry, as we export 80 per cent of our beef and dairy produce.  The agri sector represents 40 per cent of our total balance of trade and is vital to our economy.  A properly organised competitive environment is, therefore, vital to get the best value in terms of low cost production, thus leading to competitive market prices for finished products.</P>
    <P>In the food processing industry, the primary producer must be protected against excessive profits being creamed off in the processing, marketing and distribution chain.  The beef industry is a case in point.  Because the vast proportion of Irish meat, unfortunately, goes into intervention and intervention prices for a pre-determined quantity of beef are determined in Brussels there should be no problem whatsoever in ensuring that the producer gets the financial reward that is due to him.  It is worth pointing out that in an effort to help farmers in difficult times the concept of buying surplus beef, storing it in intervention and allowing it back onto the market at times of scarcity has always formed a major aspect of the Common Agricultural Policy.  However there is no doubt whatsoever that during the past few seasons <Col N="380" /> the primary producer did not receive payments consistent with intervention payment levels; in other words, the beef processors were able to create a cartel arrangement with the result there was little or no difference from one week to another in the quotations offered by the major processors.  When speaking about this matter I should make it clear I am referring to the telephone calls which are made on Monday mornings between factories.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged given the involvement of one particular group, namely, Goodman International, that there was a conspiracy between all the players in the food processing sector to depress prices to a stage where huge food profits were to be made by processors while farmers suffered losses of up to £50 per head. In more recent times the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, have publicly stated that in their view the full benefits of intervention are not finding their way directly to farmers. Indeed, I have a copy of a quotation by the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, as reported in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> of two weeks ago stating this.  However nothing has been done about this matter and this sad saga persists.</P>
    <P>In reply to a priority question which I tabled last week the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy stated that there was little either he or the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, could do and the matter now rests with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley.  From what we have heard today, it appears that there is not a lot he can do about it either. What I find most galling is that despite the plaintive request made by the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, and the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, it appears that in law little can be done.</P>
    <P>Back in October 1989, when this rip-off was apparently extremely transparent to all farmers and the factories were having a holiday hayride, I took it upon myself to write to the chairman of the Fair Trade Commission to ask him, in view of the alleged collusive activities being undertaken by the meat factories, <Col N="381" /> if the commission would investigate the allegations.  I explained to him that, despite a European Community funded APS scheme which was designed to boost beef prices for our farmers, it had become apparent that the very week this scheme came on stream that the quotations from the factories had been reduced.  I also pointed out to him, having regard to the enormous financial muscle of the entire meat processing sector, that if such a formidable pressure group were to act in an internal but non competitive environment the results could be disastrous for thousands of farming families.  Furthermore, I asked him to clarify if European Community aid earmarked for beef producers was getting to its destination. I sought an immediate report from the Fair Trade Commission.  As the House will appreciate, such a report would have had to be carried out with great haste and almost 50 per cent of cattle are slaughtered in the months of October, November and December.</P>
    <P>My worst fears were well founded.  In early October 1989 I received a letter from the chairman of the Fair Trade Commission in which he stated:</P>
    <P>I refer to your letter of the 18th of October, 1989 in which you stated that it is your intention to ask the Fair Trade Commission to investigate alleged collusive activities by Irish meat factories over the past few weeks.  While it would be interesting for the Fair Trade Commission to conduct such an investigation we do not believe we should accede to your request at the present time.  We think it is preferable that the Commission should at present concentrate on completing its report on competition law.  The Commission is also endeavouring to complete reports on the legal profession, the petrol inquiry and on architects, surveyors and estate agents.</P>
    <P>If that was all the Fair Trade Commission could do in the circumstances is it any wonder that this Bill is before us tonight? It is clear that the rip-off continues and will continue until such time something along the lines of this Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> Many farmers understood that the Enterprise Bill, presented by the Progressive Democrats when in Opposition, would have solved many of the problems referred to.  That Bill proposed to update competition law by making Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome part of domestic law.  Fine Gael on that occasion supported the Bill because it would have made abusive monopolies and dominant trading positions an immediate criminal offence.  As the House is aware, under the law at present there is only a very limited range of sectors where a prosecution of a criminal offence would be successful and in any event the case must first be identified after a lengthy public inquiry as outlined by Deputy Barrett earlier this evening.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government of the new Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats who came into power in July 1989 contained a specific commitment that legislation would be introduced and, for better or worse, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, was given the specific responsibility for this legislation.  Even though they are now almost 18 months in office legislation has not been introduced even though it has been promised on many an occasion.  That is one of the specific reasons this Bill is being introduced in the House tonight.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Government, if their public statements on the importance of the Bill are sincere, that they should support it.  Perhaps it is only the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats who are actively promoting the legislation and that the Government feel they are duty bound not to cross some of the well known agri-business figures operating at present.  Certainly, they were much quicker and much more attentive in bringing forward the Companies (Amendment) Bill in this House on 28 August 1990 when Goodman International were in serious difficulty.  Had the same priority been given to the proposed competition Bill there would be no <Col N="383" /> need for any of us to be in the House tonight.</P>
    <P>The Companies (Amendment) Bill, which was introduced on 28 August, was novel legislation by Irish standards.  What happened then is now history but we are about to see the final play out of events during the next few days when the court will hear objections from the creditors. Having regard to the figures being bandied about by the newspapers, which I have no doubt are absolutely correct, a number of very important questions must be asked.  The success of the entire rescue package seems to depend on very high profit margins being achieved by the group during the next seven years.  It has been mentioned that the entire package is based on an annual profit margin of 3 per cent of turnover.  Many experts disagree and say that this will be impossible to achieve taking one year with another.  If we have another six or seven years like 1990 they might get away with it but they say there is no hope in the world of this happening.  It is ironic that when farming is in a depressed state meat factories tend to do well because of the availability of intervention &mdash; 1990 was such a year.</P>
    <P>If great pressure is exerted by the European Commission next year on the volume of beef allowed into intervention &mdash; everybody seems to agree that this is what will happen &mdash; extra pressures will be put on the finances of Irish meat factories. If this scenario proves to be correct, many experts believe that this is what will happen, then it appears the Goodman International rescue package can only go in one of two ways.  First, greater profits will have to be made and the only way that this can be done is to buy the product more cheaply.  If the Goodman Group are able to control 40 per cent of the cattle slaughtered and are in a position to dictate price not alone would the farmers selling Goodman International suffer but everyone else would suffer as a result.  Many commentators have been trying to quantify what the outcome of all this will be.  Two important figures come to mind from this <Col N="384" /> rescue package.  The first is the loan repayment of £134 million together with another loan of approximately £110 million to be repaid over a seven year period.  Press statements have indicated that it is the company's intention that greater profit margins, together with greater efficiencies, will ensure that these levies will be overcome and that the company will meet the target.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand the logic of this argument.  Less intervention available in 1991, and greater priority given to the identification of direct markets, will mean greater costs for all processers which will depress their profit margins.  I can foresee that Goodman International will probably kill about 400,000 cattle in 1991.  It is possible that, despite the best efforts of the group, there will be an additional cost factor of almost £50 per animal because of bank repayments. This will come directly from the farming community and it could be a huge burden on the group but it could also be an unbearable burden if transferred to farmers.  The farmers cannot be saddled with that type of levy, particularly in the worst farming year in living memory.</P>
    <P>The entire rescue package is fraught with danger in other ways.  The only hope the banks have of recovering their money is by ensuring the rescue package goes ahead.  An empty meat factory is as valuable an asset as a garden shed.  It is worth nothing to anybody unless it is in business.  It would be a sad day for Irish agriculture if these banks had sufficient clout and influence over the other processors to ensure a price cartel.  That would be even worse than anything we have been used to in the past.  This is an aspect which needs great attention.</P>
    <P>If in the light of economic circumstances in some years' time Goodman could not surmount his financial difficulties and was forced into liquidation, could suppliers find themselves in the same position as those who supplied Clover Meats some years ago?  In that case suppliers of livestock were among the main unsecured creditors and did very badly.  There is need to tighten up the <Col N="385" /> legislation in regard to unsecured creditors.</P>
    <P>There is a huge snarl-up in many areas of business life, not only in regard to food processing.  Farmers have to take at least 20p a gallon less for their milk this year while the housewife pays 31p a pint, irrespective of how the retailer managed to purchase it.  It is the same price everywhere. Clearly there is collusion among the retailers.  Cattle are selling at £100 less per head than last year and sheep are at least £15 or £20 a head cheaper, yet the housewife buying meat is certainly paying more than she should when one considers the return to the primary producer. This is what I mean when I refer to competition in the business world.  This is the kind of thing we must counteract. This Bill is heading in the right direction and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Bill.  I was very disappointed at the reaction of the Minister, whom I have always believed to be a fair-minded person who was well attuned to world events.  His was a small and narrow-minded reaction to this Bill.  It does not do justice to a man of his stature here and internationally to react in that fashion to a progressive and necessary Bill.  When the Minister was on this side of the House from 1987 onwards he repeatedly called, as I and some others did, for the introduction of such legislation in the clear knowledge that developments after 1992 would make it imperative for the Legislature to introduce a regulatory system to protect the consumer and the producer and eliminate abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated tonight that he is in favour of competition, implying thereby that people on this side of the House are not.  We are equally in favour of competition, but competition works both ways.  At Question Time today he was the first Minister to indicate in relation to the GATT talks that it was time Europe stood up to the United States.  I thought that was a sign of promise, the first we have seen for quite a time.  This made me more disappointed at his reaction tonight.  We are all well aware of what is <Col N="386" /> happening in relation to 1992 and of our responsibilities.  We have a pivotal role in the food processing area because the greater portion of our economy hinges on agriculture and the food industry generally. It is in the interests of the Government, the Minister and every Member to recognise the importance of introducing in time the regulatory measures necessary for the long term good of the industry, not for the short term benefit of some people who may decide it is to their advantage to proceed in a certain fashion now.</P>
    <P>For several years there has been ample evidence of the necessity for legislation of this type.  If it had been allowed to continue, we could have found the beef industry being controlled by one person. What would have happened if that had been the case during the past six months? The industry would be controlled by foreign banks.  The recent deal will impact first on the producer and then on the consumer.  The people who are talking about worldwide competition are past experts at introducing restrictive practices when it suits them.  The sooner the better people opposite recognise that, particularly in the context of the GATT talks.</P>
    <P>There is need for this legislation.  I fully accept the constructive remarks of some Members opposite indicating that it could be improved.  Experience has clearly shown the necessity for this legislation. If this Bill, or a similar one, is not passed in the near future the agri-industry will pay a high price.  The Minister very strongly condemned the Bill as opportunistic. He has had ample opportunity to produce similar legislation but has not done so.  He has also had ample opportunity to consult with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in relation to a national milk agency Bill, which has been promised for the past three years.  I hope we do not have to wait as long for the legislation he promised tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the proposals for saving the Goodman organisation before us at present appear <Col N="387" /> to present the farming community in particular with one of the thorniest subjects that has come before them for many a long day.  It is a topic being discussed widely not only by small groups and individuals but is being aired at meetings generally.  Grave concern is being expressed about what will happen, the fear that the banks may well be able to decide the price of beef on the Irish market over the next seven years or thereabouts.  It is a grave cause of concern.</P>
      <P>That is the reason my party decided to introduce this Bill.  Much of the criticism being levelled at it, much of which is airy fairy, to the effect that there is no logic at all in it, contending that its provisions will affect other industries &mdash; that kind of nonsense &mdash; must be refuted.  There is no way it will do so.  It was introduced to deal with a specific set of circumstances which arose.  Its provisions are intended to protect the farming community from the fall-out of the collapse of the Goodman Group and its putting together again. Indeed it is a symptom of much that is wrong generally with the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Those of us representing Border counties can vouch for the fact that our economy is not in a very healthy state, particularly from the point of view of the importation and distribution of goods. Research has shown that 80 per cent of the goods on our shelves are imported and that the type of importation in which we engage, to a large extent, is monopolistic; at least it bears the traits of monopoly.  The result of that is that much of the goods on offer, before taxation, are up to 19 per cent or 20 per cent higher in price than they would be if there were proper competition and control.  It would appear we have a lot of single agent importation &mdash; which is possibly now illegal &mdash; but its traits still exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of this Bill are designed to undertake a particular task in a given area.  When we look onwards to 1 January 1993, when we will have a united market in Ireland, there will be grave danger &mdash; unless we examine the manner in which we conduct business in particular &mdash; that <Col N="388" /> much of the distribution of goods may take place from Belfast.  That is somewhat off the point as far as this Bill is concerned.  However, it must be stated at every opportunity because we representatives of the Border counties know exactly what are the problems in that we deal with them on a day to day basis.  In fact that is why the Government were forced to introduce this crazy 48-hour rule.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the whole Goodman business that has worried me enormously is that a prospective exporter to Germany infomed me about three weeks ago that he was endeavouring to develop a market to Germany one and a half years ago; being a German national living in Ireland he was talking to people in Germany. He was talking to the CBF people in Stuttgart.  The advice he got from Stuttgart was that he should contact the Goodman International Organisation who would assist him in gaining his market in Germany; in other words, they would do the exporting for him.</P>
    <P>The way this Government have acted since 1987 is unbelievable.  One of our problems is that we know many of these types of things happen but we cannot prove them; we cannot produce the proof but everybody knows what went on.  It is disgraceful that the Government who brought about this position, who intervened on behalf of a single company, are still in power.  It is a disgrace that it ever happened.  That Government should not be in Office; they should have the decency to leave at once.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this important subject. Within the context of 1992 and the completion of the Single European Market it is vital that all sectors of business and industry prepare for the competitive markets that will obtain thereafter.  No sector <Col N="389" /> should be allowed shelter from the realities of such competition.  Competition is important for stimulating economic activity and improving efficiency.  It is vital that we approach these problems in a well thought out fashion.  It is my belief that the provisions of this Bill do not do so, being restricted to one sector only, namely, the food processing sector.</P>
      <P>One must ask if the definition of &ldquo;food processing trade&rdquo; contained in section 2 is too narrow.  What about those people involved upstream or downstream, as the case may be?  Food processing is an important link in the chain between the primary producer and final consumer. The primary producer does not always deal directly with the processor.  Similarily, the processor need not deal directly with the retailer.  What about other sectors of our economy?  Are we to legislate individually for each of these sectors?  It is my belief that it is impossible to legislate sector by sector because, to do so, would create an enormous amount of paper work and lead to a great deal of confusion on the part of the public generally.  Were we to legislate sector by sector what effect would that have on existing legislation?</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill provide for criminal and civil sanctions whereas the pattern within the EC is one of civil remedies. The over-reliance of this Bill on criminal sanctions is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask also whether the provisions of this Bill offer any protection to employees.  For example, in my constituency in Wexford, Waterford Foods propose closing a subsidiary, Snowcream, employing 46 people, a profitable company with a good record in industrial relations.  Does this Bill make any provision for the employees of Snowcream? For example, the proposed section 4D states that no one company or associated group of companies shall control more than 30 per cent of the total processing capacity in either the beef or dairy processing sectors.  What is so magic about the 30 per cent figure?  For example, will a company with a 31 per cent processing capacity be prohibited from trading?  It may well be that such a company will <Col N="390" /> need that 31 per cent to compete on the European Market.  In determining that figure we must ask ourselves whether we are ignoring the effects of imports here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>One outcome of the introduction of this Bill is that it has become clear to all concerned about competition policy that we need serious, balanced legislation in this area.  The Bill before us does not constitute the answer to that need.</P>
      <P>In his speech earlier this evening I was glad to note that the Minister informed the House that the Government are currently preparing legislation in that area. The Government have recognised its importance and, as the Minister said, will be in a position soon to present their response.  The social partners also have seen the importance of competition in stimulating economic activity, thereby increasing employment.  Bearing in mind that the second national understanding is being negotiated at present I am sure that all of the social partners are keenly aware of the necessity for such legislation.</P>
      <P>One matter warranting serious investigation is the difference between the price being paid to primary producers and the retail prices being fixed by different methods at the retail end of the business. One glaring example of such is the price of milk.  We witnessed over the past year and a half the price of milk being paid to dairy farmers reduced by approximately 20 per cent, whereas its price to the consumer has not been similarily reduced. Any Bill to be introduced by the Government must deal with and abolish the disgraceful conduct taking place <i>vis-à-vis</i> milk pricing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte has given me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of a private notice question today regarding an allleged leak on Thursday, <Col N="391" /> 13 December 1990 of the inflation figures produced by the Central Statistics Office. Deputy Rabbitte knows the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important matter.  The leaking, in advance of their official publication time of any set of economic figures is a serious matter for a number of reasons.  However, the leaking on Thursday last of the November inflation figures constitutes a matter of grave importance; one which merits the fullest possible investigation, including an investigation by the Stock Exchange, and on which a full report must be made to this House.</P>
      <P>The level of inflation can determine how attractive it is to invest in Government stocks.  If inflation is lower than expected the stocks become more attractive; if inflation is higher than anticipated, they are less attractive.  The November inflation figures, which were due to be published at 5 p.m. on Thursday last were generally expected to show a slight increase over the August figure, particularly because of increases in fuel prices arising from the Gulf crisis.</P>
      <P>When the figures were officially published at 5 p.m. they actually showed a decrease from 2.9 per cent to 2.7 per cent.  However, it is now clear that much earlier in the day &mdash; as early as lunchtime, four hours before their official publication time &mdash; the figures were well known to a small number of people dealing in the Dublin financial market. This led to a surge of buying of Government gilts and stock by those who had access to this information.  I understand that the entire Government supply of £75 million was taken up and a further £80 million was bought on the secondary market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know how much money was made on these deals as a result of having the inside track on this information, but it is likely to have been quite substantial. I believe it is outrageous that a small, select number of individuals should have been able to gain access to this sensitive information in such a way as to enable <Col N="392" /> them to make a financial killing although this is not the major concern.  This is, in fact, the equivalent of insider trading in Government stock.  It is the same as if a broker or company executive, as a result of privileged information, was aware in advance that a particular company were to publish an impressive set of figures in their annual report and used that information to buy up shares in the knowledge that their value was likely to increase. This will be illegal here as soon as the recently passed Companies (Amendment) Bill becomes law.  Unfortunately even when the new Bill becomes law last Thursday's sting may still recur with impunity.</P>
    <P>It is not just the fact that a number of people were able to gain an advantage over their rivals and make substantial profits.  There is a large overseas bond holding in the Irish market and these investors are known to be most unamused. For example, the chief economist at Riada stockbrokers, Dr. Dan McLoughlin, was quoted as saying that if we want to be taken seriously this sort of thing cannot happen.</P>
    <P>This is not the first occasion on which concern has been expressed about the manner in which some commercial interests with the right political track record seem to be able to secure access to sensitive information and to use their political contacts to make greater profits. It is an issue that has, for example, figured prominently in the ongoing Goodman saga.  It is believed in financial circles that this is not the first time that advance information on the inflation figures has leaked, but that it is the first time the information has spread so far.  Many dealers have commented with wonder at the manner in which one firm of brokers, whose principal is known to be a keen admirer of this Government, has been able to forecast with such uncanny accuracy important economic figures in advance of their official disclosure.  I have no particular admiration for stockbrokers or financial dealers, but I do appreciate the damage that can be done to our reputation internationally if it is believed that a small number of favoured dealers have <Col N="393" /> the inside track to sensitive market information. The general manager of the Stock Exchange for example, Mr. Tom Healy, was quoted as saying that this was an unfortunate happening in terms of our international reputation.</P>
    <P>Both the Central Statistics Office, who compile the figure, and the Government Information Service, who distribute them, report to the Department of the Taoiseach, and Deputy Haughey must, therefore, accept direct political responsibility for the leak.  It is clear that the information would have been known by the Department of the Taoiseach, in advance of publication, and this Department, together with the Government Information Service and the Central Statistics Office, must be covered in any inquiry.  There is clearly a possibility that the Official Secrets Act may have been breached and there could well be a case for calling in the Garda, should any internal inquiry prove inadequate.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating any witch hunt against public servants, who do their jobs to the best of their ability, often under very difficult circumstances.  I believe very strongly, however, that the source of the leak must be traced and plugged. This must include a tightening up of procedures for the release of market sensitive information.  The Stock Exchange must not be let off the hook.  A Government inquiry can establish who leaked the information.  A Stock Exchange inquiry can determine who received and acted on that information.  The exchange will have a full list of who bought and sold on Thursday and it should not be too difficult to establish who was acting with the benefit of insider information on the inflation figures.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that the Stock Exchange seems to want to wash its hands of the affair.  Indeed, the record of the Stock Exchange in establishing any case of insider trading is similarly a matter of concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach became aware of alleged leaks of the mid-November inflation figures, he <Col N="394" /> immediately ordered an investigation to be conducted by the Director of the Central Statistics Office in relation to the official handling of the Consumer Price figures information prior to its release and the Secretary of the Department of Finance to consult with the Stock Exchange as to the alleged use that was made of the information in the financial markets.</P>
      <P>The investigation by the director on the official handling of the information is under way.  The Secretary of the Department of Finance has been in consultation with the Stock Exchange.  He and the Director of the Central Statistics Office visualise that they will be in a position to report by the end of the week.  The Taoiseach will then consider in the light of their report if any further action is required.</P>
      <P>Until such time as these investigations have been completed and the facts established, the Deputy should not jump to conclusions about leaks, sources or people who benefited.</P>
      <P>The matter is, of course, a serious one if there was a leak of official information leading to a monetary gain.  We should, however, have a sense of proportion in our comments on the matter.  The matters alleged pale into insignificance by comparison with recent major scandals on the New York and London Stock Exchanges. For anyone to suggest that this matter is one that would damage Dublin as an international financial centre is out of all proportion to what is involved.  Anyone who suggests this is indeed doing a disservice to our reputation by making political capital in this way and by denigrating Dublin as an international financial centre.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, and the House, can rest assured that this matter is being rigorously investigated.  When the Taoiseach receives the results of this investigation, he will make a statement on the matter, including whether he thinks any further inquiries, investigations or action are justified in order to answer public concern about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding on this issue, I would like to say that the alleged leak <Col N="395" /> should not obscure the fact that the mid-November figure showed that we now have the lowest inflation rate in the Community. This shows how successful the management of the economy has been since 1987 with the co-operation of the social partners.</P>
    <P>I am astonished also that the Deputy in his remarks made no reference at all to this achievement of the lowest inflation rate in the Community which represents such good news for all citizens as regards the value of their earnings.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of whether the Irish Government will make representation to the United Kingdom authorities for the unconditional release of the Birmingham Six for Christmas pending and without prejudice to the review of their cases, in view of the fact that they have served 17 years in prison already.  Deputy Bruton knows the procedure, he has five minutes at his disposal to present his case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of the Birmingham Six this evening on compassionate grounds.  These men have already served 17 years of a life sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, at this stage, the British Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, MP, has the power to order their release, without prejudice to the rehearing of their case and without any presumption that they are either guilty or innocent.  I believe that the Irish Government should seek such a release before Christmas, and should also let the House know, before we rise if the men would accept such a <Col N="396" /> release, without prejudice to the determination, in the course of the present review, either by the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Court of Appeal, that the original conviction was faulty.</P>
    <P>It is important, of course, that the review take its full course.  Very grave doubts have been raised about these convictions. It is highly important that, in view of the inter-connection between our two States, Irish people have confidence in the British system of justice, just as it is important that British people have confidence in the Irish system of justice. Ideally both systems should be subject to a strong and continuing system of oversight by the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Six have served a very long sentence &mdash; 17 years.  The average life sentence here is only eight years. A few years ago, when I questioned the matter, I was told that the longest serving prisoner then on a life sentence in Ireland had served 14 years.  The Birmingham Six have already served three years more than that.</P>
    <P>It may be a trivial matter but I feel that the reference by a judge yesterday that he would not let the study of the papers in this case &ldquo;spoil his Christmas&rdquo; does not enhance confidence in his seriousness in approaching the case.  The original evidence has been the subject of repeated, and serious challenges.  I am not in a position to come to a conclusion on this challenge, but we must always remember, in a matter of this kind, that it is not for the accused, or the prisoner, to prove his innocence.  Under the legal system of both Ireland and the United Kingdom, it is for the State to prove guilt. Unless guilt is proved, beyond reasonable doubt, no one should serve one day, let alone 17 years, in jail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Bruton for his extraordinary generosity in sharing his brief time with me.  It has been clear, a Cheann Comhairle, for many years that the case against the Six who are about to spend their seventeenth Christmas in her Majesty's prisons, Richard McIlkenny, Paddy Joe Hill, Billy <Col N="397" /> Power, Johnny Walker, Gerry Hunter and Hugh Callaghan is completely unsustainable, that is clear to all but the British legal establishment.</P>
      <P>The decision of the British Director of Public Prosecutions yesterday to ask the Appeal Court to again review the evidence in this tragic case rather than to make up his own mind is totally incomprehensible. It is abundantly clear to all with even a passing familiarity with this case that the twin pillars, to use Lord Lane's words, on which the conviction of the Six has been based have been totally demolished.  The forensic science work of Dr. Skuse has long since been discredited. Indeed Dr. Skuse himself has long since been dismissed as an incompetent. Dr. Drayton, his associate, has publicly disassociated herself from the views of her evidence as put forward in the appeal case by Lord Lane.  She has indicated that Lord Lane is misinterpreting her evidence.</P>
      <P>The long-disputed confessions beaten from five of the six men has been destroyed as evidence by the electrostatic data analysis tests and by other textual analysis.  Nobody, but nobody, believes the evidence of the now discredited West Midlands Police force.</P>
      <P>There is still time for the British Director of Public Prosecutions Alan Greene to act as an independent agency to stop shielding judges who have acted less than judicially and to serve the cause of justice. He could have done all of this yesterday without further incarcerating six innocent men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposition put forward here tonight by Deputy Bruton is an interesting one and one that I have not heard explored in its full context.  I would, however, make the point that as recently as last week I spoke by telephone to one of the men in one of the jails and he made the point that even still the men want to walk from jail with their innocence affirmed.  I recall that when I and another Member of this House visited Gartree some time ago we met with that irrepressible spirit, Paddy Joe Hill, and he said: &ldquo;I will walk from here a free man or I will leave in a box&rdquo;.  It is up to the judicial establishment in Britain to stop trying to hide their shame with a fig leaf, <Col N="398" /> to stop bringing shame and discredit on a judicial system that has long traditions, and release these men.  If the proposition put forward here tonight is an attainable one it is one we on all sides of the House should pursue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The holding of this debate reflects the deep disappointment of the Dáil and of the country that the Birmingham Six will be spending their seventeenth Christmas in prison.  The Government, as their statement today makes clear, fully share this disappointment.  Our dismay, however, is as nothing compared with the feelings of the six men as they and their families spend yet another Christmas apart.</P>
      <P>The Government's deep concern about the case, and their view that it should be satisfactorily resolved at the earliest possible date, has been repeatedly conveyed to the British authorities at senior political level.  Most recently, the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the case at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference in Belfast.  He followed this up with a letter of 6 November to the new British Home Secretary. In addition, the Minister for Justice and for Communications conveyed the Government's concern to the Home Secretary when he met him in Rome on 7 December.</P>
      <P>Over a long period, the Government had vigorously conveyed their serious concern about the case to the British authorities and pressed them to undertake a complete review of it.  They therefore welcomed the establishment of the Devon and Cornwall Police investigation into the case and its subsequent referral last August by the then Home Secretary, Mr. David Waddington, to the Court of Appeal.</P>
      <P>The Government have also, when they considered it appropriate and helpful, raised the case in the international context, including at the United Nations last September where the Minister for Foreign Affairs underlined the Government's sense of urgency in seeing the case satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prison conditions of the men have also of course been of serious concern to <Col N="399" /> us; in this regard, we welcomed their reclassification last year from Category A to Category B.  Officials of our embassy in London have been making regular visits on a structured basis to the men and have done everything possible to ensure their welfare.  The embassy has also facilitated prison visits by a number of Deputies to the Six.  In this respect, I would like to pay a warm tribute here to colleagues who have been frequent visitors to the men and have been a source of hope and solidarity to them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's preliminary hearing of the case followed on the Home Secretary's announcement almost four months ago that he was referring the case again to the Court of Appeal.  The Taoiseach welcomed this decision at the time and expressed the Government's hope that, in the interest of justice, this protracted case was at last close to a satisfactory solution.  This referral was made on the basis of new material which had come to light in relation to one of the Six, but as the Home Secretary's statement made clear, the effect of his decision was that the whole case was once more before the court, where it was to be treated as an appeal by each of the six men.</P>
    <P>To underline the great importance the Government attached to yesterday's hearing, we instructed the Ambassador in London to be present as our official observer.  I was also greatly encouraged by the fact that two members of this House &mdash; Deputies Andrews and Roche &mdash; were present yesterday.  This was an important showing of solidarity with the six men, not only from the Dáil, but also from the people who have elected us.</P>
    <P>The Government in their statement issued earlier to-day, emphasised that they fully share the widespread sense of indignation, including that expressed in a most trenchant editorial in the <i>London Times</i>, that an opportunity was missed yesterday to bring a speedy and satisfactory conclusion to the ordeal of these six men.  The statement went on to say: It is imperative, in particular in the light of the extensive new evidence which has become available, that the necessary sense of urgency now be demonstrated <Col N="400" /> by all with responsibility in this tragic case.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully conscious of and share the very strong views expressed here tonight.  There can be no doubt of the feelings of this House and of the country on this issue.  The Government will, with the strongest possible sense of urgency, continue to convey to the British authorities the view of the Oireachtas and of the people of Ireland of the need for the earliest possible satisfactory resolution of this case.</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this important matter.  This case concerns Jack and Lulu Hynes both of whom are Irish citizens living in Clondalkin, County Dublin.  Arrest warrants have been issued by the Government of the Philippines against both of them on trumped-up charges of kidnapping and illegal detention of security forces personnel in the Philippines which is alleged to have taken place between 1 June and 14 August 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no foundation whatever for these charges and neither Jack nor Lulu Hynes was in the Philippines at that time. This is victimisation by the Government of the Philippines against this couple and the reason for it, we believe, is the fact that they were involved, when in Ireland, in campaigning for human rights in that country, more particularly in the case of Father Niall O'Brien and Rudi Romero. <Col N="401" /> Jack Hynes has only been back the Philippines once since 1977 when he returned for the wedding of his wife's eldest daughter in 1983.  He stayed for one month and has not been there since. Lulu Hynes, who is a native of the Philippines, has only returned three times since 1977.  She went back in 1979 and for her daughter's wedding in 1983 and between November 1987 and January 1988.  She has not been there since then at all.  Her parents are still alive in the Philippines and are in poor health.  Unless this matter can be resolved she fears for her safety if she goes back to the Philippines to see her parents.</P>
    <P>This is victimisation by the Philippine authorities.  They have raised charges against upwards of 100 people in respect of this matter.  Mr. and Mrs. Hynes were not there at the time.  They are innocent people who are being victimised.  We are asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to conduct a vigorous campaign with the Philippine authorities on their behalf.  We do not want the usual wishy-washy diplomatic exchanges on this.  These are Irish citizens who are being victimised.  They are Irish passport holders and we want a vigorous campaign by the Minister and the appropriate authorities to vindicate them and to secure the dropping of these spurious charges against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting and ironic that this issue follows immediately on that of the Birmingham Six.  This case involves a potential miscarriage of justice against Irish citizens in a foreign country just as does the case of the Birmingham Six.  I join with Deputy Taylor in hoping that the Minister will not offer a wishy-washy effort on behalf of these two Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>I trust the Minister's response will be more positive than the disappointing reply I received today on the issue in which the Minister advised the couple to seek to resolve the problem by legal means.  The Minister appears to be completely unaware of a recent resolution in the European Parliament condemning the continuing violation of human rights in the Philippines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Philippino lawyers have pointed to the fact that there are serious irregularities <Col N="402" /> in the proceedings relating to the charges. One is the failure of the authorities to conduct a proper preliminary investigation of the charges, as is required by the Constitution, prior to the issue of arrest warrants.  A number of the accused could not possibly have participated in the alleged kidnapping simply because they were abroad at the time.  It is against this background that the case of the Hynes's must be viewed.  They wish to clear their names and the Government can help if they so wish.  As Irish citizens they are entitled to seek the Minister's assistance.</P>

      <P>There was much euphoria in this country when President Aquino was elected.  This was to inaugurate a new era in Philippino politics. Unfortunately, this has not happened.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response to Deputy Gregory's question. If Lulu Hynes goes back to the Philippines and is arrested on those charges, the Government will act but that is not the point.  She should not have to take the risk of being arrested and of it taking us possibly years to get her out.  She should be able to go back to her own country knowing that she cannot on any account be arrested.</P>

      <P>At the meeting the person in question explained the background to the case. She indicated that she was most concerned at the situation in which she and her husband found themselves.  As Deputies are aware, charges relating to kidnapping and illegal detention had been brought against them and several dozen other people in a Philippine court and, as a result, warrants had been issued for their arrest.  Several of the people charged with them had been arrested while others had gone into hiding.  Most have strenuously denied any involvement whatsoever in the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> The official from the consular section of the Department explained at the time that the matter was primarily a judicial one and that it is not our practice to intervene in the judicial affairs of other states.  The person was advised that it seemed best to seek to resolve the problem by legal means.  It was suggested that, as a first step, the persons concerned should consult their legal adviser in this country.  The latter would be able to advise them on how best they could prepare a case proving that they were not in the Philippines when the alleged incident took place.</P>
    <P>This would involve the preparation of a dossier of documentary proofs that they were resident in Ireland on a continuous basis since 1978.  This would probably entail assembling documents relating to employment, house purchase, children's schools, utility company bills, etc.  Sworn affidavits from various sources such as employers, local clergy, school principals etc. would also be of assistance.</P>
    <P>The persons' Irish legal adviser could then pass the dossier to a Philippine counterpart for presentation in the appropriate Philippine court with the view to having the court order, on which the arrest warrants are based, quashed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Department have learned that the legal representatives of some of those who were indicted at the same time have appealed against the initial court decision on the grounds that there were serious irregularities in the procedures adopted by the court.  It has been alleged, for example, that the court did not have proper jurisdiction to issue the warrants.  Another allegation relates to the claim that the judge did not conduct a proper preliminary hearing of the case.  Lawyers on behalf of some who have been indicted but who claim to have been nowhere near the scene of the crime are also attempting to introduce appropriate evidence to this effect.</P>
    <P>My Department advised the persons in <Col N="404" /> question against returning to the Philippines. The Department also asked to be kept informed of progress in the case. The Department undertook to instruct the Honorary Consul General at Manila to monitor the progress of the case in conjunction with the persons' Philippine legal representative, as soon as the dossier had been referred to the Philippines.</P>
    <P>I understand that the persons' legal representatives in this country, who have been in touch with my Department, are at present in the process of compiling a dossier containing detailed statements from their clients and from various persons who can confirm that they could not have been in the Philippines at the time in question.  My Department will maintain contact with the legal representatives.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should make representations at this stage to the Philippine authorities about this case.  As Deputies are aware my Department have been prepared to make representations in the past where there has been an actual or threatened miscarriage of justice and we will continue to help in every way. However, in this case the matter is still before the courts and, in my view, it is best to seek to resolve it at this stage by recourse to the legal system.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that we will continue to review the situation and that the Honorary Consul General at Manila will be instructed to continue to monitor the progress of this case as it evolves.  We will pursue this case vigorously on behalf of the persons concerned.</P>

      <P>The present provisions governing control of monopolies are contained in the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended.  The Act defines a monopoly as existing where an enterprise, or enterprises under common control, provides or supplies, or to which is supplied or provided, not less than one half, 50 per cent, of goods or services of a particular kind in the State in a particular year. However, this does not apply to an enterprise which exports at least 90 per cent of output from the State. <Col N="139" /> I do not believe that it is realistic to fix an arbitrary figure as a ceiling on the market share of any enterprise in a particular sector.  When considering merger proposals under the 1978 Act I have to take account of the likely effect on competition of any increase in market share of the enterprises concerned.  But this is an issue that cannot be decided by reference to some automatic mathematical formula decided in abstract.  It requires examination case by case.  The extent of market share, actual and potential, held by others is one of the factors to be considered.  This changes over time.</P>
      <P>Of course what is important is not so much size of market share but rather behaviour.  For this reason the Competition Bill which I hope to publish early next year will introduce the concept of &ldquo;abuse of dominant position&rdquo;.  The provisions of the Bill will apply to all sectors of business and industry.</P>

    <P>In the same period, our trade with the former GDR was very small.  In 1989 exports amounted to IR£4.3 million and imports amounted to IR£8.8 million. However, on the basis of our trade patterns with the FRG market and on estimates made by the Federal Ministery of Economics in Bonn, CTT estimates that Irish exports to the former GDR market could reach IR£200 million by 1996.</P>
    <P>CTT monitor economic developments in Germany from the perspective of the potential for Irish exporters.  CTT is already supplying business services and marketing support to Irish companies interested in the area of the former GDR. These services are provided through the CTT office in Dusseldorf and through the recently appointed CTT trade consultant in Berlin.  This month CTT arranged a specialised briefing for 20 Irish companies on market conditions and possible opportunities. An effective way of getting business in the former GDR is often through West German institutions and buyers.</P>
    <P>In addition to the services being provided to specific companies CTT will present a major workshop on the infrastructural, manufacturing and consumer demand situations in the region in Dublin in March 1991.  This workshops is aimed at companies with no experience in this market who wish to investigate opportunities. In addition, sectoral trade missions will be arranged in response to investigations of the market and there will be an Irish stand at the Leipzig Spring Fair.</P>

      <Col N="144" /> While the former GDR was one of the most economically advanced of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe the opportunities for business immediately following unification have been limited by the large number of bankruptcies, restructuring of industry and the virtual collapse of the distribution system.</P>

      <P>I do not think that any useful purpose would be served at this stage by having an inquiry into the affairs <Col N="146" /> of the two enterprises to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the PMPA, I am satisfied that all necessary steps were taken by my Department to monitor the affairs of the insurance company with a view to protecting the interests of policy holders. It was not until August 1983 that firm evidence of a problem became available as a result of a specially-commissioned consultancy study, the conclusions of which were confirmed by a second expert opinion received in October 1983.  This was followed by the enactment of legislation which allowed of the immediate appointment by the High Court, on the petition of the Minister, of an administrator to the insurance company.  The Deputy will be aware, I am sure, that the administrator is pursuing a number of actions against former auditors of the PMPA.</P>
      <P>In relation to PMPS, in 1986 a depositor with the society instituted proceedings against the Registrar and the Minister for Industry and Commerce for, <i>inter alia</i>, negligence and breach of statutory duty, (Monica (otherwise) Pascal MacMahon <i>v.</i> Ireland, the Attorney General and the Registrar of Friendly Societies).  The plaintiff's action was dismissed both in the District Court and subsequently, on appeal to the High Court.</P>
      <P>With regard to the view reportedly expressed by depositors with the industrial and provident society regarding the statement I issued in July 1982, I would refer the Deputy to the response which was given in this House by the then Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to Question No. 5 on 13 June 1985 (CP24/847), cols. 1501-05) when similar concerns were raised by the Deputy about shareholders in the insurance company.</P>

I am satisfied that this potential will be exploited to the maximum possible extent as a result of the new responsibility of Shannon Development for the promotion of the estuary which I announced on 20 July last.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread practice among insurance companies of refusing policies or quotations to persons on the grounds that their names or addresses are suggestive of membership of the travelling community; if he proposes to take any action in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of what I have said on numerous occasions in this House, that, my main and indeed statutory duty as the insurance supervisory authority, is to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory reserve and solvency requirements.  In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.  There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote in any particular manner or at any particular premium and I cannot compel them to do so.  I am not responsible for the day to day operations of insurers or the exercise of business acumen on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am aware that insurers are sometimes reluctant to offer quotations for certain risks.  I would point out such reluctance usually has a reason behind it. It may be that an insurer has had a poor claims experience on a particular risk or has had difficulties with a policy in the past, or perhaps the poor performance of a company's account in a general area of <Col N="148" /> cover may affect a company's attitude to quoting for any type of risk in this same area.  Insurers, however, are generally willing to quote for what they would term reasonable risks.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which problems in obtaining insurance cover can cause.  Because of these difficulties and the awareness of the problems they cause, arrangements exist with the insurance industry to assist in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the case of motor insurance there is, of course, a legal obligation on all motorists under the Road Traffic Acts to have minimum third party insurance &mdash; thus it is essential that some facility exists to help those who experience, for whatever reasons, difficulty in obtaining such cover.  To this extent there is an agreement with the insurance industry for dealing with cases of inability to obtain motor insurance through a body called the declined cases committee.  This committee, established under the declined cases agreement, is comprised of representatives of the authorised motor insurance companies.  It examines cases referred to it by my Department, which have been declined by five or more motor insurance companies and nominates one of the companies to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration, it is necessary to approach and obtain written refusals from five motor insurance companies. These should then be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department indicating the order in which the insurers were approached together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.  It should then be possible to have the necessary cover arranged.  This agreement came into effect in June 1981 and since then has had an almost 100 per cent success rate.</P>

      <P>Current legislative controls in relation to advertising are contained in the Consumer Information Act, 1978 and in Regulations which gave effect to the EC Directive on misleading advertising. In general terms, these prohibit advertising which is false or misleading.</P>
      <P>In addition to these controls all advertising in Ireland is subject to the code of advertising standards promoted by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland (ASAI).  This code lays down guidelines in respect of, among other things, advertising as it relates to children.  Also the RTE Authority implement their own code of standards for broadcast advertising which has detailed provisions in relation to advertising for toys and games.</P>
      <P>I believe that the matter raised by the Deputy is one of those areas in advertising which are more appropriately dealt with by means of such codes of standards rather than by legislative controls and I do not therefore propose to introduce measures as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The position of the Government <Col N="155" /> in relation to a comprehensive test ban is clear and unequivocal.  We believe that the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban is an urgent priority and we have repeatedly called for immediate progress towards that end.  We recognise that in convening the partial test ban treaty amendment conference the promoters wish to advance the objective of a comprehensive test ban.  We will participate in a constructive manner in this conference, which we hope will lead to a commitment by all states &mdash; including, most importantly, the nuclear-weapon states &mdash; to a comprehensive test ban treaty.  At the same time we believe that the discussions at the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva offer the best prospects for agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty.  We hope that the partial test ban amendment conference will give impetus to the work underway in that forum.</P>
      <P>The states parties to the partial test ban treaty have agreed that the second substantive session of the conference should be held from 7 to 18 January 1991. We hope that all participants at the conference will work constructively during that agreed period to advance agreement on this issue.  We fully support the view that efforts must continue until the objective of a comprehensive test ban is reached, and as I said, the conference can give an important impetus towards this end.  However we would not wish, at this stage, to pre-empt any decisions the participants at the conference may take regarding the forum for future consideration of the issue.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer was due tax relief under section 6 of the Finance Act, 1983 (relief due in year of marriage) in the income tax year 1988/89.  However when his liability was reviewed there was a net underpayment of £50.57 in that year as he had been taxed on an incorrect tax table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> His liability for the year 1989/90 has been reviewed and a cheque for an overpayment of £309.65 will be issued to him on 19 December 1990.  The taxpayer's former employer has not yet provided the actual details necessary to complete a full review of his tax liability even though they have been requested to do so.  Therefore as an interim measure the Inspector of Taxes has estimated his earnings and the tax deducted in arriving at the amount of the refund.  On receipt of the actual details a full review will be carried out.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the normal practice for me to comment on such matters in advance of the Budget Statement.  Hotel accommodation is subject to the reduced VAT rate, ie 10 per cent at present.  If the Deputy is referring to the post 1992 situation, I would stress that no firm decisions have yet been taken on the classification of goods and services at the different VAT rates.  Final positions on specific activities will not be taken until the overall picture on the total 1992 package and, of course, the budgetary implications for individual member states, becomes clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is misinformed.  In fact there is a special mortgage interest relief ceiling for widowed persons of £2,900, compared with £2,000 for a single person and £4,000 for a married couple.  Apart from this special allowance for mortgage interest, the difficulties of widowed persons are recognised in the income tax code in that widowed persons have a higher personal allowance than single persons; this stands at £2,550, compared with a single person's allowance of £2,050.  In addition, where a widowed person has children, he or she is entitled to the widowed parent allowance of £1,550 which, combined with the widowed personal allowance, brings the widowed parent's total basic allowances to £4,100, the same as a married couple's personal allowance.  Finally, <Col N="161" /> I would point out that mortgage protection policies are available which ensure that a couple's mortgage is actually paid off on the death of a spouse.</P>

The person concerned had claimed entitlement to duty-free importation of the vehicle under the transfer of residence provisions.  Since the seizure this claim was the subject of investigation.  That investigation has now been completed and it has been found that the person is ineligible to benefit under these provisions.  Furthermore it has been established that in support of the claim false evidence was given to Customs.  In such a case the importer is liable to prosecution and the vehicle is liable for forfeiture.

      <P>Prior to the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice (Case No. C-367/88 refers), frontier zone residents were allowed to import a maximum of two litres of beer as part of the reduced monetary allowance of £30 available to such persons under the relevant EC <Col N="163" /> Council Directive.  Following the judgment on 6 December 1990, the beer limit was removed.  However, in accordance with the Council Directive, travellers' allowances are to be granted only in respect of importations having no commercial character, that is, those that (a) take place occasionally, and (b) consist exclusively of goods for the personal or family use of the travellers, or of goods intended as presents; the nature or quantity of such goods must not be such as might indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons.</P>
      <P>This means that a person seeking to import beer as part of the monetary allowance available to persons living beside the Border will be required to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that the beer, as with any other goods, is for personal use only.  Customs and Excise officers will determine eligibility for exemption on a case-by-case basis having regard to the particular circumstances and the quantities of beer involved.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Customs and Excise) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 98 of 1987) which introduced the 48-hour restriction do not apply to importations by frontier zone residents.</P>

      <P>The pilot programme for integrated rural development was launched in October 1988 in 12 selected areas so as to gain the experience necessary to enable the possible introduction of a nationwide programme to be considered at a later date.

Pending a decision by the Government on the matter, it would not be appropriate for me to indicate any details at this stage.</P>

      <P>Following failure by the employer concerned to pay the award made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the employees referred the matter to my Department in accordance with section 10 (1) of the Act which empowers the Minister for Labour to institute proceedings for the recovery of such sums. The employer company was no longer trading at its known address although not in receivership or liquidation.  Legal searches revealed no assets in its ownership. Legal advice was sought on the question of instituting proceedings and my legal advisers have requested further detailed information.  My Department is currently conducting inquiries with the help of the employee.  In circumstances such as these where an employer appears to have ceased trading and to have no assets it is difficult to bring a successful prosecution.  My Department takes all feasible action in such cases in an attempt to bring them to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>It is a basic condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit that the claimant must be unemployed.  Regulations under section 29 (5) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, allow a claimant, who is engaged in a subsidiary occupation, to be treated as unemployed provided he has at least 78 reckonable employment contributions paid in the three years preceding the date of a claim or that the profit from his occupation does not exceed £4 per day.  The purpose of the special condition is to ensure that the claimant can be regarded as genuinely unemployed.  The majority of unemloyment benefit claims involving claimants who follow a subsidiary occupation are from landholders.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances for which they were intended the regulations are considered to be reasonable.  However, consideration will be given to reviewing the regulations with a view to increasing the figure for daily profit from the occupation.</P>
      <P>An increase in the daily limit for qualification for unemployment benefit would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>He appealed against the decision and further inquiries were made by the social welfare officer in connection with the appeal.  Determination of the appeal has been delayed as the papers were mislaid. This matter has now been rectified and the social welfare appeals office will proceed with the appeal without further delay.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance scheme came into effect last November and provides an allowance direct to carers who are providing full time care and attention to elderly or invalided social welfare pensioners and who satisfy a means test.  The maximum allowance is £45 with increases for each child dependent on the carer.</P>
      <P>In the means test for carers allowance, as in the case of other social assistance schemes, account is taken of any cash income, savings and investments, as well as property, which the carer may have. If the carer is married, half of the means which the couple have between them will be attributed to the carer.  The maximum allowance is payable where the means do not exceed £2 a week.  However, a carer with a working spouse can qualify for some allowance if the joint means do not exceed: £93 if they have no children; £107 if they have one child; £122 if they have two children; £133 if they have three children; £148 if they have four children and £162 if they have five children.</P>
      <P>I plan to review the uptake and operation of this new scheme once it is fully operational.  Modification of the means provisions would have cost implications and would also have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, as amended, established the criteria that have to be met by any person wishing to obtain what is known as a public house licence.  The purpose of these criteria is to restrict the grant of new licences, mainly through the requirement in rural areas for two existing comparable licences to be extinguished in favour of one new licence and in urban areas for one such licence to be extinguished in favour of one new licence.</P>

      <P>The decision to remove telephone extensions from official Garda living accommodation, including the Garda house referred to, was taken by the Garda authorities as part of the process of providing the force with an improved and most cost effective telephone system in conjunction with the provision of the Garda national communications system.  These extensions were provided at stations which are open only for a limited time each day and they did not guarantee a Garda response to calls made by the public outside of normal station opening hours.</P>
      <P>The new Garda communications system incorporates a public access call facility at all such stations.

      <P>Parking of vehicles on public roads is subject to control and regulation by bylaw under section 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which are made by the Garda Commissioner, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment and after consultation with the local authority concerned.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that consultations have taken place with Mayo County Council with a view to the introduction of parking restrictions on the approach road to Knock Airport, so as to facilitate vehicle access in the event of an emergency at the airport. There are also, of course, provisions under the road traffic Acts prohibiting <Col N="196" /> the obstruction of traffic in public places, on foot of which the gardaí may take action in appropriate circumstances.</P>

      <P>The situation in Thurles is entirely consistent with my declared position which is that illegal deflector systems would be required to close down when a legal alternative became available. The position is that a legal cable service has been available in Thurles for some months now and, but for a boycotting campaign against it which has in the main been orchestrated by one individual, multi-channel service would be available to the vast majority, if not all, who require it.</P>
      <P>The planning permission issue is a matter between the operator concerned and the appropriate authorities and it is understood that the matter has been appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  If, however, the Deputy has a real concern on this question perhaps he might investigate whether the illegal deflector systems have planning permissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to his proposal that the illegal rebroadcaster be permitted to commence rebroadcasting in the Thurles area, I would point out that if I was to countenance such a proposal legal action to <Col N="197" /> require me to close down all rebroadcasters in the area, and not just Thurles alone, would be the inevitable consequence.</P>

The Bill will enable a person or a local authority to bring a complaint to the District Court in respect of neighbourhood noise which gives reasonable cause for annoyance. There will be improved powers for local authorities to deal with local noise problems and the new agency will have powers in certain cases.  Finally, there are provisions enabling the Minister to make regulations introducing further measures for the prevention or limitation of noise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.  I am aware of the report of the research to which the Deputies refer. It is a summary of a personal research project which was completed in 1988 and which is currently being submitted to a medical journal for publication.  Figures on the prevalence of asthma vary considerably depending on the population studied and the diagnostic criteria used. The incidence depends on a large number of unknown variables.  The report highlights the important role of information and education in the early diagnosis and treatment of asthma.  In recognition of such a role the health promotion unit of <Col N="221" /> my Department have provided substantial funding to the Asthma Society of Ireland for the production of a comprehensive information booklet on asthma which incorporates advice on the causes, prevention and treatment of asthma together with information on the effective medications now available.</P>

      <P>I have approved the appointment of a consultant paediatrician with appropriate support staff to Wexford County Hospital and I have conveyed this approval to the South-Eastern Health Board as an initial step in the development of paediatric services at the hospital.  The staffing situation will fall to be reviewed at a later date in the light of activity levels at Wexford.  I understand that the South-Eastern Health Board are currently preparing a formal application to my Department for approval to fill this post.  The non-capital allocation notified to the South-Eastern Health Board today takes account of the expenditure likely to arise during 1991.  In the circumstances, I do not consider that a meeting with the Wexford Paediatriic Action Group is necessary.</P>

      <P>The South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital is the regional centre for ear, nose and throat services in the Southern Health Board area.  Ear, nose and throat activity at the hospital has greatly increased this year.  In 1989 a total of 1,267 ear, nose and throat operations were carried out at the hospital.  Up to the end of November this year a total of 1,665 ear, nose and throat operations were performed.  This represents a substantial increase in ear, nose and throat activity at the hospital with a consequent reduction in the waiting time involved for patients.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is an agreement between the Government and the INTO regarding the staffing of national schools.  As part of this agreement my Department have implemented a reduction of one unit in the enrolment-staffing schedule for national schools from 1 September 1990. This agreement has led to an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools for the 1990-91 school year.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements negotiated under the auspices of the Central Review Committee, school authorities, in particular the principal teacher, are responsible for arranging the organisation of the school so as to ensure that no class group exceeds the following guidelines set down by my Department.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine in the case of a single-grade class group; 38 in the case of a class group with two consecutive grades; 35 in the case of a multi-grade class group.</P>
      <P>Enrolment at the school on 30 September 1990, was 230.  Staff consists of a principal and six assistant teachers.  The school also shares a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>None of the classes is in breach of my Department's maximum class size guidelines. Since the question refers to the senior school, there are no infant classes involved.</P>

      <P>In the universities 3,600 additional places are being provided over the next three years.  Numbers in the vocational education committee third level colleges have expanded rapidly in recent years and the new regional technical college in Tallaght will provide when completed a further 1,200 places.</P>
      <P>Because of the transfer of the students from the Belfield Campus at UCD to Carysfort College Campus this will enable the intake of additional students to UCD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Colleges have not been targeted for expansion on an individual basis.  In the universities a special capital investment programme of £15 million, spread over five years, has been initiated to cater for the increased intake.  In the vocational education committee third level sector a building programme is currently underway to cater for the growth in numbers. This involves modification and adaptation work which is intended to upgrade <Col N="239" /> and enhance the colleges' existing facilities. The programme, which is in conjunction with the European Community Structural Funds is expected to cost £12 million in the period 1990-1993.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware from my reply to Question No. 223 of the overall infrastructural development programme for the third level sector costing almost £76 million which is planned over the next three years and which is supported by the European Structural Fund.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline his views on the accuracy of the figures in the consultants report (details supplied) entitled the Shannon Stop-over Policy that 80,000 passengers are being lost to Heathrow and Gatwick airports each year because of the effects the Shannon compulsory stop-over is having on the development of transatlantic flights.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a report entitled <i>The Shannon Stopover Policy</i> dated March, 1990, Davy Kelleher McCarthy Ltd, Economic Consultants, estimated that in 1987, around 80,000 passengers travelled between Ireland and the US via Heathrow and Gatwick Airports.  This figure was based on the findings of a survey undertaken by the UK Civil Aviation Authority which estimated that in the same year 67,962 passengers travelled between Ireland and the US via Heathrow and 12,074 via Gatwick.</P>
      <P>Such surveys are a useful source of information on trends and developments within British civil aviation but it is not to be concluded from the survey in question, as implied in the Deputy's question, that 80,000 passengers are being lost to Heathrow and Gatwick because of the mandatory Shannon stop policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the consultants conclude that just some of this traffic would be recaptured in the event of a change in policy and that this would depend on the range <Col N="257" /> of North American cities served directly from Ireland.</P>
    <P>For a variety of reasons, it is normal practice for a significant number of travellers to and from Ireland to use the London gateway.  Clearly the number of carriers and the range and frequencies of services on the US-London routes, many of which to/from destinations not served through Shannon, make London a more convenient and attractive gateway than existing direct services to this country. Furthermore, tour operators are increasingly selling combined Britain and Ireland holidays/packages, via London, adding to Irish inbound traffic on these routes.</P>
    <P>Given the enormous differences in the levels of traffic between Ireland and the US and London and the US, there will always be a wider range of services to the US out of London than out of Ireland. Accordingly, it is to be expected that some traffic between Ireland and the US will travel via London.</P>

      <P>Aer Lingus have informed me that these unfavourable market conditions, together with a delay in the delivery of the first B767 aircraft, increased fuel costs and a number of other cost factors, including the Shannon stop, have all combined to make launching the Los Angeles/Dublin service uneconomic at this time.</P>

Further considerations of up to £700,000 approximately may be received over the coming years in respect of the sale of the brand names depending on the future profitability of the purchaser.</P>

      <P>The proposal for a new commuter rail service from Clondalkin to Connolly Station involves the construction of eight new stations, the upgrading of signalling, the provision of new rolling stock and a feeder bus service from Clondalkin station to Tallaght.  The new stations would be located at Clondalkin, Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot, Inchicore, a new Heuston suburban station, the Phoenix Park, Cabra and Drumcondra.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the project would take about two years to complete from the date of commencement of work and would cost about £28.5 million.</P>
      <P>This project has been included in the operational programme on peripherality (roads and other transport infrastructure) which sets out the projects to be aided under the European Regional Development Fund in the period to 1993. However, the availability of EC aid for the project has been made conditional on the outcome of a socio-economic cost benefit analysis of the proposed investment. This examination will be undertaken shortly and it is expected that it will confirm the merits of proceeding with the project as a matter of urgency.</P>
