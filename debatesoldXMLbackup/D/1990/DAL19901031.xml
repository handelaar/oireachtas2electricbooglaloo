      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business I propose to dispose of some notices of motion under Standing Order 30, received from Deputies Dick Spring, Proinsias De Rossa and Alan Dukes.  I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their motions to my office.  I call, therefore, Deputy Dick Spring.  Will the Deputy please state the matter of which he has given me notice?</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I gave you notice of my intention to raise a matter this morning at the commencement of public business and that matter is as follows: that this House views with extreme concern the recently published allegation that a senior member of Fianna Fáil attempted to intimidate a member of the presidential household staff on the night the Government fell in January 1982, with a view to securing an interview with the President.  Such intimidation, if it occurred, would be a clear breach of section 8 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and of section 254 of the Defence Act, 1954.  This House calls on the Government immediately to institute an inquiry by the Garda Síochána into <Col N="558" /> the matter.  As this allegation has been made about the Taoiseach, and because of its gravity, the Taoiseach must be given an opportunity to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely, the allegations that a Defence Forces officer on duty in Áras an Uachtaráin on the night of 27 January 1982 was abused and threatened by a senior Fianna Fáil politician when he informed that politician that the President was unavailable to take a phone call, and that the officer was further warned that his career would suffer if he did not put the call through. I believe this issue has the most important implications for our democratic institutions and for the relationship between our politicians and the Defence Forces. It is essential that the Dáil should be allowed debate the allegations as a matter of extreme urgency and, indeed, to allow the Taoiseach, who has been named in the allegations as the politician concerned, an opportunity to clarify his role in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of which I have given you notice is the allegation relayed to me by a number of sources, apart from the publication in a newspaper, that on the night of 27 January 1982 the then Deputy Charles Haughey threatened to interfere in the future career of an Army officer on duty in Áras an Uachtaráin, who refused to put a telephone call from Deputy Haughey through to the President, an action which was in clear breach of the provisions of our Defence Acts and of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and a course of conduct which is <Col N="559" /> totally prejudicial to the proper conduct of political activity in our State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>This move by the Opposition to force a debate of confidence in the Government is inappropriate.  There is no reality behind it or public support for it.  It is in fact a misuse of Dáil time.  It is nothing more than a crude piece of electioneering, an attempt to use Dáil procedures for Presidential election purposes.</P>
      <P>There is a continuing high level of public satisfaction with the Government which has extended over a considerable period.  The principal reason for this is the dramatic economic progress achieved over the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motions are related to statements made in the course of a Presidential election campaign and those made previously by the Fianna Fáil Presidential candidate. Deputy Brian Lenihan is not a Government candidate.  He is the Fianna Fáil candidate.  The Presidential election is not a Government matter; it is a matter <Col N="561" /> for the people.  To attempt to take the election away from the people in this way and to try to have it decided here by a vote of the Dáil is not democratic, it is an infringement of the people's right to decide for themselves who should be President.  The selection of a President is now firmly before the people and it is theirs to decide.</P>
    <P>For nearly four years now this country has had the benefit of good, effective Government.  The Opposition have no alternative policies of any note or any achievements that they can look back to. Instead, they spend their time attacking members of the Government personally, raising one false accusation after another without ever substantiating one of them. I want to assure this House and the nation that I and my Government have maintained &mdash; and are determined to maintain &mdash; the highest standards in Government. I totally reject any suggestion to the contrary.</P>
    <P>The achievements of this Government have been dramatic.  During the last four years we have achieved an average economic growth rate of 4 per cent per annum. Since 1987 unemployment has fallen by 30,000, and employment has increased by 40,000.  The number of redundancies in 1989 were halved compared with previous years.  Emigration is now falling rapidly.  There has been a complete turnaround in the public finances.  Government borrowing for all purposes has been reduced to its lowest level for well over 30 years, around 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 there has been a balance of payments surplus for four years running, an unprecedented achievement.  Inflation has been kept in low single figures so that it is now below even the German and the Swiss levels.  Interest rates are comparatively low, well below those prevailing in Britain, for example.</P>
    <P>Investment, which had been sluggish for most of the eighties is now strong again.  Important and indeed on occasion massive new projects, involving thousands of jobs rather than hundreds, such as Maxtor and Intel, and Fruit of the Loom, are coming on stream at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> Since 1988 there have been real reductions in personal taxation and in indirect taxation.  For many categories of social welfare recipients, there have been valuable real increases in benefits.  For all at work, the combination of tax relief with moderate pay rises has increased take-home pay significantly, leading to a real increase in living standards.</P>
    <P>All of this has been made possible by a new concept of economic management, which the Government have initiated with the social partners.  This is something of unique value; a pearl of great price; the new consensus between the Government and the social partners on economic and social objectives and plans to implement them.</P>
    <P>It has been directly responsible for dramatic progress, but I want to make the point that we are only seeing the start of what is possible and attainable.  Negotiations have just commenced on a new programme, a programme of economic and social development this time.  I believe the social partners would in general be grievously disappointed if the present negotiations for a new Programme for Economic and Social Development were disrupted at this stage.</P>
    <P>The International Monetary Fund in their most recent conclusions, dated 15 October 1990, have praised our economic management.  I quote from their report:</P>
    <P>Since I was in Ireland the last time in 1986 the Irish economy has greatly improved in most areas: wage moderation took hold, as demonstrated by general observance to the three-year Programme for National Recovery; price inflation came down to the ERM average and even below; and international competitiveness improved noticeably, which was an important element in turning the external current account deficit into surplus.  While favourable international circumstances have been of help in bringing about these developments, it was in large part policies and developments in Ireland itself which deserve credit.</P>
    <P>The remarkable aspect about the <Col N="563" /> achievements of the last four years is that they have been reached on the basis of an emerging consensus of virtually all involved; government, employers, trade unions and the population at large.  It is therefore gratifying that even the most entrenched economic problem of Ireland shows some improvement; unemployment has fallen and employment has grown despite the twin challenges of a growing labour force and lower emigration.</P>
    <P>The rapporteur from the IMF sums up: &ldquo;We are heartened by your resolve to stay the course, and we wish you well&rdquo;. That is not Government propaganda, it is a factual report from the IMF.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted on all sides that Ireland's EC Presidency was an outstanding success.  It enhanced the country's standing and reputation abroad and will have a beneficial effect for us internationally for many years to come.</P>
    <P>We have launched and are already implementing a new ten-year action programme on the environment, to clear up air pollution and to get rid of smog, to purify our rivers, to clean up our beaches, and to promote the planting of broadleaved trees.  There has been a huge revival in the tourist industry, with a 14-15 per cent increase in numbers and revenue for the fourth year running.  There is massive investment in new accommodation and leisure facilities for tourists. We have unblocked oil and gas exploration with a new regime, which has already resulted in new gas finds.  The construction industry is booming.  The extended urban renewal scheme has created major new developments in cities and towns such as Limerick, Cork, Waterford and most recently, Tallaght, where I opened the magnificent new town centre last week.  We have established a new International Financial Services Centre, that already involves well over 2,000 jobs.  We are steadily rectifying the problems that were arising in the health service.  More places in third/level education are being made available.</P>
    <P>I do not have the time to go into every <Col N="564" /> area of Government policy, but I believe we have achievements to our credit that equal or surpass any previous Government in this country.</P>
    <P>However, we are invited to believe by the Opposition parties that all this tremendous achievement is irrelevant and fades into insignificance compared with the Tánaiste's inaccurate description in a private interview with a research student of events that had happened eight years ago when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition.  If there was a Nobel prize for irresponsibility, I would happily nominate the leaders responsible for this motion.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the events of the night of 27 January 1982 when, after a mere seven months, the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government collapsed having been defeated in a budget vote.</P>
    <P>After the defeat of the Government, I immediately called a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench to discuss the situation.  We agreed that in the confused state of affairs the question of Fianna Fáil being able to form a Government, if called upon by the President to do so, should be considered.  It was also agreed that the former Deputy Sylvie Barrett who was then a member of the Front Bench should seek an interview with the President to put this to him for his consideration. In the event the President did not agree to speak to the former Deputy Sylvie Barrett or to grant him an audience, whereupon I issued a public statement in the following terms:</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the President to consider the situation which has arisen now that the Taoiseach has ceased to retain the support of the majority in Dáil Éireann.  I am available for consultation by the President should he so wish.</P>
    <P>As the House will recall, there turned out to be three General Elections in the space of 18 months, the close proximity of which contributed nothing at all to the stability or prosperity of the country.  To suggest that there was anything improper in indicating availability or in making sure <Col N="565" /> that that position was communicated to Áras an Uachtaráin, as former Deputy Sylvester Barrett has confirmed, is difficult to maintain.</P>
    <P>I am very definitely not prepared to listen to any lectures or strictures from Fine Gael on respect for the Presidency, on not embroiling the Presidency in politics, or not pressuring the President.  The only time in the history of the office that a President was forced out of office, forced to resign, was when President Ó Dálaigh was insulted by a Fine Gael Minister. Everything we are talking about today pales into insignificance compared with the enormity of the public insult from Fine Gael which drove the late President Ó Dálaigh from office.  We did not hear much about high standards in high places in those days.  The then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, did not call on the Fine Gael Minister for Defence to resign or the Government to resign on that occasion. So, are we to take it from Fine Gael that a mistaken recollection about 'phoning the President in a private interview with a student eight years after the event is a resigning matter, whereas calling the President &ldquo;a thundering disgrace&rdquo; as the Fine Gael Minister for Defence did in front of the Army of which he is the Commander-in-Chief is not?</P>
    <P>The point has been made that these allegations have been lying around and have not been denied for eight years.  If we were to refute every false allegation made against us, we would have little time for anything else.  I do not depend on the book by Raymond Smith as a record of fact, but Raymond Smith's book, Stephen O'Byrne's and other accounts all agree on one thing at least, that Deputy Brian Lenihan did not speak on the telephone to the President that night.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan is a good person.  He does not pretend to be a paragon of virtue.  He has his faults and failures like the rest of us, but he does not deserve after 30 years of distinguished and faithful public service to be malevolently targeted, set-up and hounded as he has been during the last week.  The people of this <Col N="566" /> country know Brian Lenihan to be open and honest and decent, and they just do not accept that he meant to deceive them or let them down.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the attitude of some sections of the media to this affair has been disappointing.  Another Presidential candidate, Mrs. Mary Robinson, was interviewed by a jounalist for the magazine <i>Hot Press.</i>  That interview is also on tape.  A number of the things that candidate Mary Robinson said on that tape were of great significance and farreaching importance in regard to the Presidency but there was no urgent press conference called with Assistant Editors to play that tape and dissect it in public. Let me remind the House of one particular thing that was said during the course of that <i>Hot Press</i> interview by candidate Mary Robinson.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of the interview was her stated intention to confront the Taoiseach of the day on the basis of having a superior democratic mandate:</P>
    <P>The only restrictions on the office of Presidency are when the President is carrying out official powers and functions.... However &mdash; and it is a big however &mdash; there is no constitutional restraint on what I do outside of these official functions.  As a President directly elected by the people of Ireland, I will have the most democratic job in the country.  I'll be able to look Charlie Haughey in the eye to tell him to back off if necessary because I have been directly elected by the people as a whole and he hasn't.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy in the House must recognise this is totally contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and a recipe for a crisis that would affect the stability of our political institutions.</P>
    <P>I do not recall very much reproving media comment about that interview, or round the clock crisis coverage, or criticism of Mrs. Robinson's subsequent attempt to deny what she had said in another part of the taped interview.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the Brian Lenihan interview with a student named Jim Duffy who we are supposed to believe <Col N="567" /> was doing no more than researching a thesis.  What Brian Lenihan said on that tape during that interview can be clearly demonstrated to be inaccurate.  The central and important statement was certainly not correct, because there is absolutely no doubt that Brian Lenihan on that night back in 1982 did not speak on the telephone to President Hillery.  It was a strange kind of interview with the research student putting forward all sorts of leading questions and Brian Lenihan almost falling over himself to pour out colourful answers without reflection.  I think most fair-minded people will agree that there are many possible explanations as to why Brian Lenihan should have provided such an inaccurate colourful account of these events and a clearly incorrect version of what happened.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Brian Lenihan in May facilitated someone he took to be a bona fide research student with a background interview on the Presidency he does not appear to have been aware of the student's close association with the Fine Gael Party.  As with all such interviews and source material, scrupulous researchers will always go back to their sources to verify with them the information they have been given.  Indeed, in a letter on 4 October 1990 Mr. Jim Duffy wrote to the Tánaiste the following letter:</P>
    <P>As promised, I am sending you a list of quotes from our interview of 17 May last.  I would like to be able to use these but want first of all to give you an opportunity to inspect these to ensure their accuracy.  If there are any that you would wish me not to use, or else to use without giving the source's name in the footnotes, please let me know.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from that letter that the writer felt that it was necessary to have the Tánaiste verify the accuracy of what he said on tape, a normal and proper academic procedure.  However, the Tánaiste was given no such opportunity because the tapes were prematurely released with a statement by Mr. Duffy that he was under political pressure to <Col N="568" /> do so.  Political pressure from whom, we must ask.</P>

      <P>In order to clarify a certain confusion on the issue, it is vital to note that in the interview of 17 May the Tánaiste did, as I said, talk about an actual conversation with the President, not that he merely attempted to talk to the President.  All the other accounts of what happened that evening support Deputy Brian Lenihan's present denial on mature recollection, when he states that he did not, in fact, speak to the President.</P>

      <P>The role of Fine Gael in this whole matter must surely repel all right-thinking people.  Deputy Jim Mitchell has boasted about how Fine Gael laid a trap.  Fine Gael unscrupulously manipulated the television programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; to achieve a political assassination.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald was brought in to play his ignoble part in this squalid plot.  He was willing to play his part and, as he has so often done before, he overplayed it.  He departed from the truth.</P>
      <P>I have a transcript of the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme, when he stated categorically &ldquo;I was in Áras an Uachtaráin when those phone calls were made and I know how many there were&rdquo;, a remark which was followed by the assertion: &ldquo;It seems to me that eight phone calls were made by people who imitated the voices of leaders of the Opposition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald subsequently denied that he had necessarily been in Áras an Uachtaráin when the calls were made and maintained that the implication in his remarks that he had recognised voices was a joke.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan throughout his career has been a person who has been completely open in his dealings with other people.  His wide popularity stems from a recognition of his fundamental decency, his lack of malice and his wish to befriend.  His rare qualities, allied to his courage and resilience, have made him universally liked and admired in this House and among the population at large.</P>
      <P>There is not the slightest doubt, that Brian Lenihan did not speak to President Hillery on the telephone on the night of 27 January 1982.  In fact, President Hillery did not speak on the telephone to anyone in Fianna Fáil that night.  The Tánaiste was carefully set up by Fine Gael with the willing collaboration of a Fine Gael activist in a way that breached the ethics of research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> It is not the first time that we have seen these tactics employed by Fine Gael. They have been the hallmark of that party under the influence of Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  The more his Government devastated the economy, and the nearer he brought the country to its knees, the more he tried to conceal his failure by a prolonged personalised campaign of attack on Fianna Fáil and on me personally. He bequeathed Alan Dukes to Fine Gael and as the enormity of that mistake becomes increasingly evident, he once again seeks to avert attention by renewing his campaign of villifying his opponents.</P>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil we have constantly had to contend with unfounded allegations. The fact that none of them have ever been substantiated has not prevented them being repeated again and again; embellished and added to without regard for either accuracy or truth.</P>

      <P>I now want to deal with the subject matter of the motions put down.  My father was a distinguished Army officer until he left the Defence Forces through ill health.  I have been an officer of the Defence Forces.  I was brought up to believe in the integrity of our Defence Forces and the Army and I have the highest respect for them.  I would never, and never have, insulted an Army officer of our Defence Forces in any way, and I never will.</P>

      <P>I reject this allegation with contempt.  I want to ask the question: why is it being brought up now after eight years?  Why is it being raised now and cast at me in this way?  The people opposite who are making this allegation during that eight years have been in Government themselves, they had all the records at their disposal and they knew about this sort of gossip and chat that was going on about that matter since 1982. Why did they not investigate it?  They did not because they knew it was a tissue of <Col N="571" /> lies and a fabrication, and that is what I brand it here in the House.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of deep regret to me that a campaign, which we intended should be conducted at a high dignified level and in a tone and manner fitting for an election of a President, should have been deliberately dragged down to its present level.  In our campaign up until now we deliberately avoided any personal attacks on the other candidates.</P>

      <P>We largely ignored the mistakes of the other candidates, whether in interviews or their ill-considered and thinly disguised personal attacks on Brian Lenihan.  Brian Lenihan is a good man; he has more humanity in his little finger than Alan Dukes and Garret Fitzgerald put together.  He has had a political career of distinction, and given unstinting service to the people in every one of the seven ministries he has served in.  No one can rival his experience or his international contacts, his deep knowledge of this country and its people. But this is now a matter for the Irish people to decide, and I suggest that the parties in this House should not attempt to pre-empt the people's decision.</P>
      <P>I am asking this House to support this vote of confidence in the Government. There are no grounds for doing otherwise. The Government are working successfully. A defeat for this motion will mean a general election.  No one is attempting to suggest that a general election at this time could be anything but harmful to the best interests of the people.  Surely that cannot be ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Dáil would be letting the people down if it forces a successful Government out of office and disrupts their plans for economic and social advance.  Can the parties here not give the people of this country a break?  For a long and painful period of years our people had to endure economic stagnation and a sense of national failure. The country was brought to the verge of bankruptcy.  Now that at last the people <Col N="572" /> are seeing and enjoying success, with their country forging ahead, highly respected abroad and looking to a prosperous future, do you really intend to bring all this progress to an end?  If you do, it will be a sad day for Ireland and the future prospects for her people.</P>

      <P>In what the Taoiseach has just said he has evaded almost every single issue before the House and he has avoided any explanation of any of the issues which has been brought before the people in the last week.  I am bound to say that in his indulgent treatment of the way Deputy Lenihan has used words over the last week the Taoiseach has shown a very scant regard and very little understanding of the importance of the truth in public affairs and in the conduct of Government.</P>
      <P>The moving of this motion this morning is the first proper thing the Government have done in this whole affair.  The moving of this motion has come about simply because there was no other way out of it for the Government.  We have seen over the past two days a Government trying every stratagem, every argument and every wriggle to get off the hook on which they were firmly impaled, not by anybody on the Opposition benches, any researcher or reporter but by Deputy Brian Lenihan last Monday night week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by Deputy Brian Lenihan, God help us, an Tánaiste and Minister for Defence on Monday night of last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the only reason this motion is before us today.  My party will vote against this motion because we do not have any confidence in the Government, we do not have any confidence in the veracity of the Government and we do not have any confidence in the Government's ability to rule our affairs in the way the Irish people want them to be <Col N="573" /> run.  Lest there be any misunderstanding about this, we are not talking only about the events of January 1982, important in themselves as they are.  No, we are talking about the behaviour of the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence since Monday night of last week and the behaviour of the Taoiseach over that period.</P>
    <P>I wonder &mdash; this struck me when listening to the Taoiseach &mdash; if he was trying to distance himself from the Tánaiste.  In the third paragraph of his speech this morning the Taoiseach seemed to be trying to distance himself from the Tánaiste as a presidential candidate.  That sits very ill with what the Taoiseach has been up to over the past few days.  Is he now washing his hands of the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence and candidate for the Presidency?  Why was it appropriate yesterday to leave this whole matter in the hands of Brian Lenihan, to quote the Taoiseach?  Why was it appropriate to leave it all up to him and his personal decision and why, suddenly today, is that no longer appropriate and the Government have to come in here to defend that person?</P>
    <P>We look back over the history of the events here and to the phone calls that were made in 1982 &mdash; the Taoiseach himself has recalled the fact that the evidence has been there since 1982 and has quoted some of the sources: Raymond Smith's book, Stephen O'Byrne's book, Geraldine Kennedy's article, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, and now the tape from Jim Duffy.  Since last Sunday we have had further confirmation of the fact that telephone calls were made because the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, who was then a member of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, again confirmed for all of us to hear that phone calls were indeed made to Áras an Uachtaráin in January 1982.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear, again, that what is at issue is not so much the substance or the propriety of those phone calls or indeed who they got through to but the fact that they have been denied consistently since Monday of last week. <Col N="574" /> Today we have had a first partial admission from the Taoiseach that phone calls were indeed made.</P>
    <P>If we go back to that time we can ask ourselves what was the propriety of those telephone calls, and I can imagine in the situation of that time that a party who felt they could produce an alternative Government in the Dáil might wish that to be considered, might wish it to be known to the public and might wish it to be known to the President.  God knows, there are enough ways of making that kind of thing known to the public and to the President without harassing the President's office itself with a series of telephone calls, which have now been admitted.</P>
    <P>I leave aside for the moment &mdash; because it is not relevant to our debate today &mdash; the question of whether or not there was a basis for doing so at the time and the question as to whether the Fianna Fáil Front Bench at the time could possibly have considered that they had a basis for doing it.  That perhaps is a discussion for another day.  I want to make it quite clear, because the Taoiseach does not seem to have understood it, that the accusations are not of speaking to the President or putting undue pressure on him, the accusations are of making telephone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin and, subsequently, denying that those telephone calls had been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Monday of last week there was an article in one of our national newspapers containing a statement by Deputy Garret FitzGerald about these events.  That was denied by the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence.  On &ldquo;Questions an Answers&rdquo; on Monday night of last week there was a direct question which, again, was denied in the most extraordinary terms by the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence.  If there was anything remarkable about that particular programme it was the fact that the Tánaiste himself in the face of all the evidence that is there and in the face of all that he knew himself should deny so publicly and <Col N="575" /> so transparently the fact that phone calls had been made.</P>
      <P>In one of our newspapers on Tuesday a further article was carried.  At that stage the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence had the opportunity of admitting that he had got it wrong on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; but he did not take that opportunity. On Wednesday, we had a more comprehensive publication in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  The Minister for Labour, at lunch time that day, seemed to recall what the tape might be and seemed to recall what the source of the tape might be.  It was the Minister for Labour at lunch time on Wednesday who revealed what he believed the source of the tape might be and it was that revelation on his part that put political pressure on the person who had the tape that led the following day to the playing for the news media of the tape itself.  That was the political pressure that led to the disclosure of the tape and that political pressure came from the Minister for Labour and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I watched the &ldquo;Six-One&rdquo; news on Thursday evening and I think I have rarely seen a more extraordinary &mdash; I will not say performance as I do not want to trivialise this &mdash; event during the course of which a man, who had indeed gained a good deal of respect over the years, almost literally turned himself inside out. I have rarely seen anything of that kind. It was a most saddening experience and in some way it was an eerie experience. The only thing that I found over that whole week to be sadder, more eerie and more unbelievable was to watch the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence in person in the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; studio doing the same thing again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been denials from Government spokesmen of any involvement by the Taoiseach in telephoning Áras an Uachtaráin that evening.  I am told it may be that the Government spokesman exceeded his brief, but that should not happen.  We have before us and have had before us for the last week a picture of a Government who seem to be totally out of control, who do not seem to know <Col N="576" /> what message they want to communicate and how they are going to communicate that message.</P>
    <P>We came, finally, to Sunday when, as I have said, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, gave the final piece of confirmation that phone calls were made and confirmed for all of us that everything the Government, or members of the Government or spokesmen for the Government had said during the whole of the preceding week was untrue.  The Taoiseach used a phrase earlier on that will come back to haunt him. If ever there was a tissue of lies and fabrication it came out of the Government right through the course of the last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The central point and the most important one is that this is not a matter that involves only the Tánaiste and the Minister for Defence, it involves also in the most complete and comprehensive way the Taoiseach himself. There have been suggestions that perhaps this matter could be resolved if the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence resigned from the Government &mdash; the matter that the Taoiseach yesterday left up to the Minister himself &mdash; but I must say in view of all that has happened and in view of the Taoiseach's yesterday left up to the Minister himself &mdash; but I must say in view of all that has happened and in view of the Taoiseach's own close and direct involvement in all this since 1982, it cannot possibly suffice, to restore any shred of credibility to the Government, that the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence resign.  He should of course; there is no doubt about that but if he does, then there is so much more reason that the Taoiseach who has co-ordinated, managed and run this fabrication of lies and deception should also himself resign as the only honourable course in this whole affair.  Nobody with any probity and nobody with any concern for truth in this whole matter can possibly be satisfied that credibility will have been restored if the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence is made the only sacrifice to be offered up from the Government benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen, and I think it is sad that <Col N="577" /> we should see it and hear it in this House this morning, an attempt by the Taoiseach to smear a researcher.  The Taoiseach referred to this this morning and I will point out his words:</P>
    <P>When Deputy Brian Lenihan in May facilitated someone he took to be a bona fide research student with a back-ground interview on the Presidency he does not appear to have been aware of the student's close association with the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>To make it all the more clear to us in words &ldquo;bona fide research student&rdquo; are underlined in the Taoiseach's script.  If the Taoiseach has to descend to casting aspersions on a researcher &mdash; a bona fide researcher &mdash; who interviewed the Tánaiste, among many other people, in an unpressurised interview seeking information and views for an historical study, and feels that that is a smear than I think Fianna Fáil have gone back to some of the old routes that we used to know about so well.  This is Fianna Fáil denying everything, denying the whole value that Irish people have always placed on education, and they are going back to this old cant we have heard from them for so many years &mdash; ten years, 20 years or more &mdash; that says if you have letters after your name you are not worth doing business with as far as they are concerned.  The fact of the matter is that in an interview, which should have been factual, with a bona fide research student, the Tánaiste told mostly the truth with regard to the events of January 1982 and then embellished it.  He then found that it did not suit him to recollect it.</P>
    <P>A truth, a Cheann Comhairle, is clearly of primary importance for the conduct of Government.  The view that the Taoiseach has set out this morning which indicates that one can bend the truth a little bit, one can play fast and loose with the truth if that will give the effect one wants, is highly dangerous and this House must reject it.  Truth is expected of Government.  How otherwise can we deal straight with a Government? How can the social partners deal with a Government that shows they have scant <Col N="578" /> regard for the truth?  How can this House deal with a Government that shows such little regard for truth?  How can Governments of other countries that we deal with have any confidence in dealing with a Government who have so little regard for the truth?  We cannot have Ministers who make up the stories of what they are doing as they go along to suit their audience.</P>
    <P>There have been far too many occasions when people in Fianna Fáil have been acting as a malign influence on Irish politics.  It has been happening for the last 20 years in incident after incident, in scandal after scandal.  We have had arms trials, phone tapping and the whole GUBU episode and all that meant.  We have had intimidation of Fianna Fáil members.  Indeed, I remember hearing on the radio a very cold direct threat to members of that party in a leadership contest when they were told, there is no such thing as a secret ballot, you have to stand up and be counted.  That has been so often the hallmark of the way Fianna Fáil have gone about their business and it is time this House said that those standards are not acceptable.  We will not have them and the Irish people should be given a chance clearly to reject them.</P>
    <P>There are things that are far more important than the fate of individual Members of this House.  We need continued economic and social progress.  We need job expansion on a far larger scale than we have achieved so far.  I reject utterly the contention implicit in the Taoiseach's statement this morning that there is a choice we must make between having this Government, with their scant regard for the truth and economic progress on the one hand, and having some other Government and no economic progress on the other, because that is not the choice that faces the Irish people.</P>
    <P>My party, since 1981, and going back even further than that, have always made it clear that we put progress of our nation, the economic and social progress, far higher up our list of priorities than any short term politicial advantage.  That will <Col N="579" /> continue to be our motto.  That will continue to be the way that we involve ourselves in politics.  We have shown that time and again and we will show it in the election that will inevitably follow today's debate.  Whatever the result of today's debate, whatever the politicial result that we see over the next few weeks, there is one thing that I am determined on: the Irish people must be the winners from it. The Irish people must get a Government, the expansion and the jobs they need and that must be the primary aim of all political action.  That will be my approach during the election that is coming up and after it.  I, and my party, will be ready to participate in and indeed, to lead a Government that will put the emphasis on securing for the Irish people the economic and social progress they wish to see brought about.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying we have, undoubtedly, made progress since 1981. We have made economic and social progress but not anything like as much as we would have wished to see.  I am proud of the role my party have played in that both in Government and in Opposition.  We will play that role again because that is what we are in politics for and that is what Members of this House are elected to do.  Others in this House will have to decide whether they participate in that and to what extent they will participate, but my party will be clearly on the side of the Irish people in achieving that kind of progress.</P>
    <P>We will not worry about short term political considerations because we believe that politics must serve the Irish people.  It is not the job of the Irish people to serve politics.  It is not the job of the Irish people to serve the ambitions of any one party and it is not the job of the Irish people to maintain any one party in that false position which they believe they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, as I have said we have made progress and it took a great deal of effort and commitment on the part of my colleagues in this party, and myself, beginning in June 1981 and going right through from December 1982 to <Col N="580" /> February 1987.  I look back on that time, and God knows they were difficult enough, when in this House we were opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party who show such little regard for the truth.  They did not want to know how we made progress or the importance of plain economic common sense and they found themselves in 1987 forced to follow on the same line.  I am glad they were forced to follow on the same line and I am glad that as a result of that we have made the kind of progress that has been made here over the last three years.  I am prepared to make sure that in an election, and after the election, my party play their proper role in ensuring that that progress continues.</P>

      <P>Over the weekend a commentator wrote that I was wrong in my assessment made last week that it was a sad week for Irish politics.  I still feel I was right and that last week was a sad week for Irish politics.  What is going on at the moment is sad for politics and politicians.  Let us hope that after this there will be some light ahead for politics and the standards in political life.  I am not convinced of that as things stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say at the outset that I am astonished that the Taoiseach has chosen to treat the matter which has given rise <Col N="581" /> to this debate with such contempt.  He has contented himself with repeating the brazen denials of the past week in circumstances where the entire country has made it clear that they do not believe those denials.  He has tried to ensure that the central issue is the personality of Brian Lenihan.  It is not &mdash; Brian Lenihan is liked and admired on all sides of this House on a personal basis, but he cannot be regarded as being immune from the need for high political standards simply because he is a nice man.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has compounded the arrogance of his bare-faced denials by indulging himself in a whole series of unworthy smears against people who are Members of this House, and two who are not.  His remarks about Mary Robinson are typical of some of the dirt that is being flung by Fianna Fáil speakers around the country in their panic at the imminent prospect of being beaten in a fair contest.</P>
    <P>This debate is not about Brian Lenihan, when it is all boiled down.  This debate, essentially is about the evil spirit that controls one political party in this Republic, and it is about the way in which that spirit has begun to corrupt the entire political system in our country.  This is a debate about greed for office, about disregard for truth and about contempt for political standards.  It is a debate about the way in which a once great party has been brought to its knees by the grasping acquisitiveness of its leader.  It is ultimately a debate about the cancer that is eating away at our body politic &mdash; and the virus which has caused that cancer, An Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey.</P>
    <P>In the 1989 General Election, I said that Fianna Fáil was a party that had become stultified in the grip of one man. As I have watched the events of the last week unfold, in common with thousands of other mystified and outraged citizens of the country, the conviction has been borne in on me more and more that Fianna Fáil is incapable of recovering its former stature for as long as that man is in a position to exert a stranglehold on the party.  I have watched the elected Taoiseach of our country tell lies to the <Col N="582" /> Dáil, and brazenly accuse others of lying when he knew the accusations were false; I have watched the Tánaiste try to turn himself into an Irish version of Richard Nixon, staring straight into television cameras and telling lies to the entire nation without so much as a blink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your dilemma, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I have watched a succession of Ministers and official Government spokesmen participate in a total and sustained effort to deceive the people who elected them, and as I have watched, I have wondered, as I am sure many thousands of others have wondered, what kind of country have we become.  Could it be that these people have simply lost sight of the difference between truth and lies?  Or could it be that they have chosen to lie their way, deliberately and casually, out of a political embarrassment simply because they have come to believe they can get away with anything?  If that is the case, how has it happened that these elected representatives have developed so much contempt for their electorate that they feel free to tell so many lies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be quite clear: we have been lied to so often that there is virtually nothing that we can believe in any more. The Taoiseach and his Ministers are like characters from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> telling us that the truth is whatever they say it is &mdash; no more, no less; but we do not live in Wonderland &mdash; we live in a democracy where trust in the political system depends ultimately on the truth <Col N="583" /> told by politicians.  If truth cannot be relied upon, then democracy ultimately will crumble.</P>
    <P>The issues that have been raised in the last week are not new.  Many of them arise from stories that have been going the rounds for years.  But it is a measure of the cynicism of Fianna Fáil that having ignored the stories for years, they should choose to deny them flatly at any moment when they might cause embarrassment. And when confronted with incontrovertible proof that lies had been told, they simply, and with total arrogance, asserted that anyone pointing to the proof was maliciously motivated.</P>
    <P>This is a simple technique.  It was perfected by Josef Goebbels in Nazi Germany, and subsequently elaborated by Senator Joe McCarthy in the United States.  Both of these politicians had a number of things in common &mdash; they both believed that democracy was capable of being twisted to their own ends and they both believed in the efficacy of the big lie.</P>
    <P>In the end, both of these politicians destroyed themselves, but not before they had perverted the society in which they lived.  And that is the danger we face here &mdash; for the last week, and more, we have been in a virtual tailspin of lies and mismanagement, with the situation becoming daily more out of control.  The corrupting effect of the political cynicism that we have been watching cannot be overstated.  If it is allowed to continue, it will cause long term and lasting damage to our concept of, and commitment to, parliamentary democracy in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the last week, in addition to all the lies, we have all heard one Fianna Fáil Junior Minister, Michael Smith, deliver a rabble-rousing speech to a Fianna Fáil meeting in Edenderry that was as close as anything I have heard to a fascist tubthumper from the thirties.  At a different meeting in Wexford, those who were there &mdash; and they included Fianna Fáil presidential candidate Brian Lenihan &mdash; were no doubt privileged to hear another Fianna Fáil Deputy, John Browne, exhort his members to ensure that Mary <Col N="584" /> Robinson was never in a position &ldquo;to open an abortion referral clinic in Áras an Uachtaráin&rdquo;.  Increasingly, reports are coming in from journalists that Fianna Fáil meetings these days are frightening occasions for the neutral participants.</P>
    <P>Members of a political party who can behave like this have clearly lost any sense they ever had of what is true or decent or honourable.  It must not be allowed to develop, for the sake of all of us.  We had plenty of it in the twenties and thirties but it must stop.  It must be stopped by the authority of this House and by the leader of that party, for everybody's sake, before we are into an unstoppable mess.  Some Fianna Fáil people will undoubtedly see this as little more than the Party fighting back, in the middle of a Presidential campaign that they are clearly losing.  But many more Fianna Fáil, in their hearts, know that this is a debased and degrading form of politics.  When politics depends on lies and smears to survive, it is little more than the politics of the gutter.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the need to restore the credibility of the Government &mdash; but surely the fact is that the credibility of politics is more important than the fate of any one Government.</P>
    <P>There is an ethos underlying Fianna Fáil politics now.  It is that ethos that forced Des O'Malley and others out of Fianna Fáil.  It is not the ethos of Seán Lemass, Jack Lynch or George Colley. It is, instead, the ethos so clearly illustrated on the Brian Lenihan &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, when the audience was invited to chuckle at stories of how Brian dealt with &ldquo;a sharp little bitch&rdquo; who happened to be a nun, or of how gardaí were threatened with disciplinary action for trying to carry out their jobs.</P>
    <P>No doubt the same ethos informed the Taoiseach when, as it has been alleged, he rang Áras an Uachtaráin in January 1982 and threatened to end the career of a member of the Army if the officer concerned did not put him through to the President.  If it was proved that a member of Provisional Sinn Féin made that telephone call he could be sentenced to seven <Col N="585" /> years penal servitude but when the Leader of Fianna Fáil does it we are supposed to accept it as part of the way we run our politics.  Having heard his denial in his speech just now can we assume &mdash; and I will be insisting &mdash; that he will now institute a Garda inquiry into the matter in order to clear his name? Such a step would carry far more weight than the high-flown rhetoric we have just heard from him.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that we are supposed to regard all this as the way politics is run in Ireland.  I do not and I hope I never do.  I believe there are many in Fianna Fáil also who do not.  That party can claim credit for many great achievements in the economic and social development of Irish life.  It is a party which has been radical in its day and never slow to adopt new ideas.  But, in the last 11 years, it has become a party dedicated to the oldest idea in politics &mdash; the idea of power for its own sake, vested in the imperial and dictatorial ambitions of its leader.  Thus, dissent and even debate has been silenced; all hint of criticism is seen as betrayal; any political campaign waged against the party is seen as anti-Irish.  It is one of the most striking features of the modern-day Fianna Fáil that not one of their elected representatives has had the courage to say in the middle of the present mess that enough is enough.  Even though privately, many accept that the last week or so has been a tissue of lies and deceit, not one of them is prepared to offer the slightest public criticism.  Instead they troop in here this morning like sheep, and applaud the most outrageous and unsustainable utterances of their leader.  In the modern Fianna Fáil, even loyalty has become debased to the most shameless sycophancy.</P>
    <P>This last week would not have happened in the days of Seán Lemass or of Jack Lynch.  It would not have happened if there had been a George Colley or any person of stature and honour left on the Fianna Fáil benches.  How can anyone conceive of all this happening in the days of the founder of Fianna Fáil, and the author of our Constitution, Eamon de Valera?  But they have all gone, and the <Col N="586" /> party is now dedicated to the greed and unprincipled behaviour of its present leader, who is bent on creating a party entirely in his own image.  When the world watched Ceaucescu and Honecker fall, we knew it was because people could no longer tolerate tyranny but how much longer will the members of Fianna Fáil tolerate the internal tyranny that rules their party with an iron hand and that has brought it to a point where it is an object of shame and revulsion for so many?</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on the day this Government were formed, on 12 July 1989, I said the following:</P>
    <P>Over the next months and years, two main questions will preoccupy the political system of our country.  At least, these two questions ought to be among the principal issues that we face and deal with.  It may well be that these issues will be ignored, and that they will be settled by default.  It may well be that the politicians we have elected to Government will simply turn a blind eye to them, and allow them to be decided by faceless, anonymous people.  If that were to happen, the result would be disastrous, as it has been disastrous in other countries where these issues have arisen.</P>
    <P>The questions are these: first, how are the fruits of economy growth to be distributed and, secondly who is going to wield the power and influence of ownership in Ireland in the future?</P>
    <P>These are huge and difficult questions. They may not seem at first glance to be the most obvious ones that arise on a day like this but if recent political experience has shown us anything, it has shown us that issues like these must be pushed to the centre of the political stage.  Too much of our recent experience has been tied up with defending people against the callous and unthinking consequences of an ill-considered approach to policy.  Too much of our recent experience has been tied up with unscrambling the consequences of secret deals and political cronyism.  We cannot, as a community, allow the style <Col N="587" /> and substance of this kind of Government to continue.</P>
    <P>Little did I know what would arise after that Government were formed and why we are all here today.  I believed then that despite the presence in Government of a party who have the protection of high political standards on their agenda, there was every possibility that the style of Government we have come to associate with Mr. Haughey would predominate. And what has happened?  Mr. Haughey has stood by while the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I had confidence in the other House I would do so but I do not. The Taoiseach has ignored all the wellfounded allegations of political favouritism that have surrounded the Goodman affair, choosing to attack foreign banks rather than face the reality that his closeness with Mr. Goodman gave one entrepreneur the opportunity to construct an empire built on sand.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has had absolutely nothing to say while Patrick Gallagher has walked away from prosecution in the Republic.  I have here in my possession the report of the liquidator in the case of Merchant Banking Limited.  It lists no fewer than 22 areas in which offences may have been committed, including bribery and conspiracy.  Questions will always surround this case in which so many people lost their life savings.  Yet, the Taoiseach has refused to institute an inquiry into those legitimate questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> These are some instances only of the way in which this Government have discharged the mandate they received from the people.  It is a dishonourable record which we have consistently opposed.  It has been said in defence of the Government &mdash; and the Taoiseach has repeated here this morning &mdash; that they have been successful in economic terms.  In that regard, I would have to say nothing has been achieved by this Government, no economic miracle has been wrought without a very considerable price having been paid by many people in our community. In the main, that price has been paid by those least able to bear it.  In health, education and other essential services like housing it is the old, the sick and the handicapped who have borne the cost of the so-called economic recovery.  In the main, it has been multi-national companies and the financial services sector that have benefited from the economic truth.  But, just as the Taoiseach was unaware during the election campaign of 1989 that the health services were in a state of crisis, just as he admitted on radio that he did not realise so many people were in difficulty by way of lack of access to our health services, I can assure him the same awaits him on doorsteps now. There have been no improvements whatever brought about in our health services since the election of this Government.</P>

      <P>Public housing is facing a crisis.  Urgent steps must be taken in that regard but nothing has been done.  I do not believe the Taoiseach appreciates the serious mess that awaits him if he goes out on the road from this House today.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred in his speech to the new consensus between the social partners that has helped considerably in addressing economic problems but this Government seem intent on destroying that consensus with their programme of privatisation by stealth and with their insidious attacks on public enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no confidence in this Taoiseach or Government.  I cannot believe what he or the Government say and I believe <Col N="590" /> there is a majority in this House who would agree with me.  Indeed, I believe there is a majority in this country who would agree with that statement.  It may be a secret and silent majority or it may not; we shall have to wait and see.  In any event, I believe the people of Ireland as a whole have been hurt by the damage done to this country by the events of the past ten days to a point where the people can no longer have confidence in this Government.  This Government must go.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental principle of our democratic system that we must all accept the verdict of the people given through the ballot box at a general election.  Whether we like it or not individually, the verdict must be accepted by politicians and by the people and the Government should, in the normal circumstances be allowed to get on with the job of governing for the period specified by law.</P>
      <P>The tabling of a motion of no confidence, which basically seeks to give the electorate the opportunity to decide anew on the membership of the Dáil and the composition of the Government, should be done only in the gravest of circumstances.  It should be done only when the Government have been guilty of such incompetence or such misconduct that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the electorate would want to review the mandate they had earlier given to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point of information is a valid one.  We have here a debate about confidence in a Government which is clearly absent here. In the opinion of The Workers' Party the revelations and disclosures of the past week made the tabling of a motion of no confidence not only appropriate but essential.  These disclosures brought to a climax the concern we already felt as a result of the Goodman and Gallagher affairs, the planning scandals, the poverty scandals in our society, the health cut scandals and the whole range of social and economic problems which this Government have failed to address.  The way in which the Dáil and the individual parties in it respond to these disclosures will have a profound impact on the future direction of Irish politics.  What is at issue now is not just the honesty of a number of Fianna Fáil politicians but the standards and values that the electorate can expect of those in public life and how confidence can be restored in the integrity of the process of Government of this country. Unless appropriate steps are taken irreparable damage will be done to our political system and the sense of cyncism and disillusionment that so many people feel about the Irish political system will be increased dramatically.</P>
      <P>What has shocked me most about the past week is not just the disclosures of lies, cover-ups and attempts to intimidate but the fact that so many people within Fianna Fáil have attempted to dismiss these issues as being of little importance. It is likely that had Mr. Lenihan admitted in the first place that he made a call to Áras An Uachtaráin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Varying views have been expressed by different constitutional experts as to whether it was proper for Opposition politicians in the circumstances prevailing in 1982 to attempt to contact the President.  It would have remained a debating point for constitutional experts and some politicians had not Deputy Lenihan been caught out telling deliberate lies, and there can be no doubt that Mr. Lenihan has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Presumably he will not be Tánaiste by the end of the day if the Fianna Fáil and PD parties have any common sense whatsoever.  He now claims that the version of events he gave to Mr. Duffy was untrue.  It seems far more likely that the version of events he gave to Mr. Duffy was true and that it is the voters and the general public who were being misled.  Indeed, the opinion poll published this morning indicates that the public themselves believe it was they who were being misled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan is not only a Government Minister but holds the important position of Tánaiste as the Ceann Comhairle has pointed out to me twice.  His powers are expressly specified in Article 28 of the Constitution.  It is the most important Government position other than Taoiseach, and the Tánaiste is specifically empowered under the Constitution to act for all purposes in the <Col N="593" /> place of the Taoiseach if the Taoiseach should die or become permanently incapacitated, and is entitled to act for or in the place of the Taoiseach during his temporary absence.  Indeed, we have all seen the Tánaiste come into this House in the absence of the Taoiseach and speak for the Government.  Accordingly, when the honesty and credibility of the Deputy Leader of the Government are called into question in such a serious way there is a major question mark over the credibility and honesty of the entire administration. If we cannot believe the Tánaiste when he replies to questions about telephone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin how can we have any confidence in the replies he gives to us as Tánaiste or as Minister for Defence?</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, that this was an internal matter for Fianna Fáil rather than the Government displayed an astonishing degree of naivety.  I can think of no other country in Europe in which the deputy head of government would still be in office a week after he was found to have been so untruthful.</P>
    <P>However, the issue has now gone far beyond the Tánaiste's own truthfulness. A procession of Government Ministers including the Taoiseach came forward and either in this House or in media interviews specifically denied that Mr. Lenihan made any phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin when there was in existence a tape recording of an interview given by the Tánaiste in which he freely admitted to making the calls.  Some of those must have been aware of the full story of the evening of 27 January 1982. The fact that they so willingly backed up the Tánaiste's story can only lead us to believe that there was a conspiracy to cover up a series of events that eight years on in the midst of a Presidential election campaign has now become a crucial and critical political issue.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious and disturbing allegations to have emerged in the last few days concerns the attempts made by a person described in newspaper reports as a senior Fianna Fáil politician to bully <Col N="594" /> and intimidate an Army officer who was on duty in Áras an Uachtaráin that night and who told this politician that the President was unable to take his phone call. At this stage even the dogs in the street know that the senior politician referred to is Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach. This report suggests that the Army officer in question was abused, insulted, and told his military career would be threatened if he did not do the caller's bidding.  This allegation is far more serious than the Tánaiste's calls to Áras an Uachtaráin.  If this allegation is true it suggests the person who made the call was prepared to try to abuse his power by destroying the military career of an Army officer who was carrying out the quite lawful and proper instructions given to him by the President.  A politician who is prepared to make such threats to an Army officer who refused to do his bidding would presumably be prepared to make such threats again and carry them out if public servants similarly displeased him.  Such a person is not fit to hold high office in Government.  The Taoiseach must now put on the record of this House a full account of his role in that affair.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach this morning addressed this issue but he left a significant number of questions unanswered.  When he says he rejects the allegation, is he rejecting the allegation that he made a phone call or is he simply saying he made the phone call but did not abuse the officer concerned? What exactly is he denying? What exactly is he rejecting?  That is not clear and on the record of this House.</P>

      <P>This State has been well served by its Defence Forces.  The men and women of the Defence Forces have shown a commendable determination to carry out their duties to the State and to the people without fear or favour and free from party political influences.  The verbal assault, threats <Col N="595" /> and intimidation of Captain Barbour, as he then was, strikes at the whole relationship between the Oireachtas and the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that as a result of this incident the President subsequently took steps to protect Captain Barbour and spoke to the then Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Hogan, about the matter.  Whatever about there being a log of the telephone calls made to Áras an Uachtaráin on the night in question and I believe there is such a log &mdash; there is bound to be a record in the Defence Forces of the meeting between the Chief of Staff and the President &mdash; this matter is now of such seriousness, and goes way beyond the question of the presidential election, that it would be in the public interest for that record to be made public.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested to me within the past few days, by a reliable source, that the same Fianna Fáil politician made a personal visit to Áras an Uachtaráin on that January night in an unsuccessful attempt to see the President.  While the Army is responsible for matters within Áras an Úachtaráin, the Garda look after perimeter security and control the gates. I also know that the Garda are meticulous record keepers.  There is bound to be within the Garda a record of what vehicles and persons were admitted through the gates of Áras an Uachtaráin on the night in question.  Again the matter is of such seriousness that the public interest would be best served by taking the unprecedented step of publishing the Garda record of callers to Áras an Uachtaráin on that night.</P>
      <P>The events of the past week have focussed attention once again on Fianna Fáil's insatiable lust for power and their willingness to do almost anything to get into power and to hold on to office.  They seem to believe that standards and values are something for other parties, and that they must always take second place to their own party's pursuit of power.  The whiff of corruption which is never far away from Fianna Fáil, has grown into an overpowering stench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Fianna Fáil seem to believe that they have some divine right to power and that anything that interferes with that is somehow contrary to the natural order of things.  Anything that keeps Fianna Fáil in power and preserves their ability to deliver political favours to their friends is justifiable.</P>
    <P>This is not, as some Fianna Fáil people are trying to suggest &mdash; especially in the Tánaiste's case &mdash; simply a case of the &ldquo;loveable rogue&rdquo; being caught out in a minor indiscretion.  It is simply a continuation of the traditions of what the late George Colley referred to as &ldquo;low standards in high places&rdquo; and which has been a feature of Fianna Fáil practices over many decades.  It is not a new phenomenon. It has a long pedigree that can be traced back through the recent Goodman and Gallagher affairs to the telephone tapping of the early eighties and the fine-fixing, stroke pulling and &ldquo;Tacateering&rdquo; of earlier decades.  It is endemic to Fianna Fáil's political culture.  Hopefully the fact that they have been so spectacularly caught out on this occasion will mean that it is also the beginning of the end of that political culture.</P>

      <P>While the immediate factor which caused The Workers' Party to table our motion of no confidence in the Government was the revelations regarding Mr. Lenihan's untruthfulness, the grounds for our lack of confidence in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration go much, much deeper.  If it were simply a case of a once-off error of judgement, one might be prepared to grant a &ldquo;fool's pardon&rdquo;, but these are just the latest in a long line of revelations which have called into question the honesty and integrity of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foremost of these is the Goodman affair which has raised the most serious questions about overlapping business and political connections.  My colleague, Deputy Pat Rabbitte has, on two occasions &mdash; on 28 August and again on Thursday last &mdash; spelled these out in great <Col N="597" /> detail in the Dáil.  The questions raised by him have remained largely unanswered and the Government, including Deputy O'Malley, have refused to consider the possibility of a sworn public inquiry into the affair.</P>

      <P>Thank you a Cheann Comhairle.  The questions raised by Deputy Rabbitte have remained largely unanswered and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy <Col N="598" /> O'Malley, has refused to consider the possibility of a sworn public inquiry into the affair.  It is clear, however, that only a sworn public inquiry could get to the bottom of this financial slurry pit.  The inescapable conclusion to be drawn from the Goodman affair is that big money, and especially big contributions to political parties, can buy favourable political decisions from the Government.</P>
      <P>There is also the Gallagher-Merchant Banking affair in which the unacceptable commercial activities of a businessman with close political connections with Fianna Fáil led to substantial losses for hundreds of relatively small depositors. The decision of a Belfast court to jail Mr. Patrick Gallagher for a two year period illustrates the clear difference in approach to what is called &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; crime on different sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>While many small depositors in both the Republic and Northern Ireland have lost relatively heavily as a result of Mr. Gallagher's unacceptable activities, those in the North had at least the satisfaction of knowing that the person primarily responsible had been brought to account in the courts.  Unfortunately those responsible for fraud and commercial crime &mdash; especially when they have the right political connections &mdash; are all too rarely brought before the courts in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the related matter of the circumstances in which RTÉ last week dropped a programme dealing with the Gallagher-Merchant Banking affair. RTÉ's claim that the programme was deferred pending further legal considerations was unconvincing.  The decision was clearly designed to avoid embarrassing Fianna Fáil during the course of the presidential campaign, although it must be said that RTÉ have never shown such sensitivity in regard to programmes which might be critical of other political parties or politicians.  The decision to drop the programme is a reflection of the climate of fear created in RTÉ, especially among senior management personnel, as a direct result of continuing intimidation on the part of Fianna Fáil Ministers.  If this programme <Col N="599" /> contains matters of legitimate public interest relating to political parties or to politicians and their relationships with Merchant Banking or any of the Gallagher Group of companies, then the voters are entitled to be made aware of that now.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a general election, honesty and integrity will clearly be major issues in the campaign, but honesty and integrity mean more than simply a commitment to tell the truth.  They involve a commitment to respect the needs of the people.  They involve a commitment not to say one thing in Opposition and then do the direct opposite in Government.  They involve a commitment to honour promises made at election time.</P>
    <P>The entire record of this Government will be the central issue of any election campaign, with special emphasis on the social and economic areas.  We will constantly hammer home to the electorate that this Government have failed to significantly reduce unemployment, that emigration reached unprecedented levels during their term of office, and that they inflicted serious damage on the fabric of our society through appalling cutbacks in our health, education, social welfare and local services.  A Government can be honest if they simply tell the truth but no Government can claim to have integrity if they fail to make the resources available to provide a proper health service, a decent education system and adequate welfare supports for those in need.</P>
    <P>The past week has been one of the most dramatic I can remember during my time in this House.  In some respects it has been a sad week, but there are encouraging lessons to be drawn from it. I do not believe there is anyone in this House who does not have a certain degree of sympathy for the personal dilemma in which the Tánaiste has found himself.  All who have had any dealings with him have found him to be always courteous and genial.  We also know that there are in the current Cabinet those who have been guilty of far more serious offences but who have managed to avoid <Col N="600" /> being called to account.  A personal sympathy for the Tánaiste must however be tempered by the knowledge that he has refused to acknowledge the impropriety of his activities or to be honest with the electorate.</P>
    <P>We can draw a number of encouraging conclusions from the events of the week. First, it has shown that telling lies does not pay.  The opinion poll published today shows that the people are not as gullible as Fianna Fáil seem to assume and that they are quite prepared to punish those who abuse the people's trust.  Hopefully it will now spell the beginning of the end of the sort of stroke politics which has been such a feature of Fianna Fáil's political agenda for so long.  The most encouraging result is that the best candidate is now quite clearly going to win the Presidential election.  The Workers' Party believed from the very beginning that Mary Robinson could win.  Today's opinion poll shows quite clearly that Mary Robinson will win, and that can only be a good thing for democracy and for the future development of Irish politics.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, whether or not there is a general election, this affair is not going to go away.  As far as The Workers' Party are concerned these issues can only be resolved by the resignation from office of the Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, and by a full and unequivocal statement by the Taoiseach of his role in the events of 27 January 1982, by a full public sworn inquiry into all these allegations, an inquiry into which all relevant Garda and Defence Force records should be made available. The broader issues raised by the Goodman and Gallagher affairs must be addressed by proper legislation, requiring full disclosure of political contributions made by business or commercial concerns and by the introduction of a code of conduct for all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This House has reached a crucial point in the development of our political system.  We are at a point where the stroke politics of Fianna Fáil is at last being revealed for what it is and from <Col N="601" /> which this House and indeed the country at large has suffered for so many decades. It is a good day for politics and I hope the Progressive Democrats Party will stand by their declared principles and refuse to continue to support an administration which has within it people who deliberately tell lies to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition's motion of no confidence in this Government is a sham and a farce initiated by Fine Gael to cover up their present lamentable poll ratings.  With Fine Gael's Presidential candidate, Deputy Currie, trailing in the polls, and their leader, Deputy Dukes, bringing his party to its lowest level of popularity in its history, it was time, they thought, for a smear campaign.  All efforts to restore their flagging fortunes had failed and it was widely being predicted that it was only a matter of weeks before Deputy Dukes would be forced to resign.  It was even being said that Deputy Dukes expressed a desire to return to Brussels.  This was the situation as of ten days ago with the Tánaiste Deputy Lenihan, sailing ahead in the Presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>It is here that Deputy Garret FitzGerald comes into the picture.  Buoyed up no doubt by speculation in one of the Sunday papers that Deputy FitzGerald might be called upon once again to lead Fine Gael, he decided to raise his profile and go on the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme.  Remember this is the same Deputy FitzGerald who brought politics to an all-time low with his so-called &ldquo;flawed pedigree&rdquo; speech, and with his implacable hatred for the Taoiseach, he has since carried on a relentless campaign of vilification.  This is the man who decided he would rescue the flagging fortunes of his party by low-down smear tactics once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald decided he would resurrect the events of 1982 after the fall of his Government and suggested that Fianna Fáil were guilty of something untoward in endeavouring to contact the President.  Deputy FitzGerald said he was in Áras an Uachtaráin when the calls came through, but he then retracted that <Col N="602" /> statement and said he heard calls had been made.  The question is, which statement is correct, and if he was told a number of calls had been made to Áras an Uachtaráin, who told him?  Was it the President or some of his staff?  If so, was this not a serious breach of confidence?</P>
    <P>I can remember many of the events of 1982 vividly.  When Deputy FitzGerald failed in that election he made vain attempts to cobble together a Government but was spurned by both The Workers' Party and the Independents.  It was then that he phoned me as I was the outgoing Ceann Comhairle and asked if he could see me.  He was prepared to come to my house if necessary at any time during the night.  In the event, I saw him the following morning at 8.30 a.m., some hours before the new Dáil was due to meet.  Do you know what Deputy FitzGerald proposed?  I will tell you what he proposed &mdash; that I refuse to go forward as Ceann Comhairle, on the basis that with my refusal to take the Chair, the Dáil could not convene, there being noone else willing to take over as Ceann Comhairle, and such an impasse would necessitate another election.  In no uncertain terms I made it clear to Deputy FitzGerald that his proposal was a grossly irresponsible one, with all the dangers to democracy that this would entail.  That terminated our discussion.  But I want to ask Deputy FitzGerald now, did he contact or attempt to contact the President that night?  I think he should clarify that matter today.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the self-righteous pharisaical stance taken by Fine Gael, when to their eternal shame the party were responsible for the forced resignation of an honourable President, Cearrbhall Ó Dálaigh &mdash; the only time in the history of the State that a President felt obliged to resign on a matter of honour.  Fine Gael should be hanging their head in shame at that disgraceful episode.  Remember, Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Peter Barry were members of that Administration and, on the principle of collective responsibility, were equally guilty.  But did we hear any demands by them for the resignation of the Minister <Col N="603" /> concerned for his disgraceful behaviour, or did they even repudiate his actions? No, never.  Could there be anything more reprehensible than that this party, Fine Gael, forced the resignation of an honourable President?  Now they have the audacity to speak of low standards.</P>
    <P>Did Deputy FitzGerald, when Taoiseach, demand the resignation of his Minister for Justice, Deputy Jim Mitchell, who committed the most serious offence of attempting to thwart the course of justice by phoning Ballyfermot Garda station where a constituent of his had been arrested?  That Minister should have been forced to resign immediately. Deputy FitzGerald's failure to take appropriate action on that occasion is a damning indictment of him.  I am not here to engage in mud-slinging but what I am saying is that the shameful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Your record is appalling. The Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has been through an ordeal which I hope none of us will have the misfortune to suffer.  His recovery was miraculous but it exacted its price.  I have never discussed the Tánaiste's health with him except to casually inquire how he was, as so many Members did.  However, as a doctor, I can well understand the process of rejection of a liver transplant.  You just do not transplant an organ from one person to another and trust that everything will be all right; it is not like that.  The body engages in a relentless struggle to reject the new organ, seeking literally to devour and destroy it and it takes the most <Col N="604" /> advanced medical skills and drugs to keep the rejection process at bay.  These powerful drugs, administered to protect the transplanted organ, are not without serious and toxic side effects.  In particular massive doses of steroids, which were necessary and given at that time, cannot but have blunted his mental alertness. In my humble opinion, this could have accounted for the Tánaiste's strange interview last May for which no other rational explanation can be offered.  I am glad to hear that the Tánaiste is now off all these drugs and that their adverse effects are temporary.  It may be said here that those drugs are still having an effect but I ask Members to compare it to a person after an anaesthetic, the effect is not permanent.</P>
      <P>I am appalled at the crocodile tears which were shed.  Deputy Jim Mitchell said that he was very sorry for Deputy Lenihan.  Many others said the same and their expressions of sadness and sorrow would win them an Oscar.  The Opposition, in attempting to destroy the Tánaiste, now seek to attack the performance of the Government and are proposing a vote of no confidence in them.  Their destructive course of action is merely serving to undermine international confidence in the State.  Even yesterday the effects of their actions caused an outflow of money from this country.</P>
      <P>The Government have an exemplary record of performance which has been widely acclaimed throughout Europe. We have the lowest inflation rate and one of the highest growth rates in Europe, something of which we can be very proud. We have a level of business confidence unparalleled for many years.  Compare this with the abysmal years of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition when business confidence was at an all time low and when the International Monetary Fund was practically at our doorstep waiting to take corrective measures.  The kind of Opposition we have is negative, destructive and prepared to take any action &mdash; even to the extent of jeopardising our economic standing &mdash; to serve their own selfish political needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud to have known Deputy <Col N="605" /> Lenihan whose fortitude and courage is a shining example to us all.  There is no questioning his distinguished record on behalf of the State.  I am proud to stand by him and I will be twice as proud to see him elected President.  To those snarling dogs who have scented blood and who are now hell bent on a kill I can only say that they bring themselves even more into disrepute.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have a long record of distinguished service, they are a proud and honourable party with some of the finest members this country could ask for.  I am proud to include many of them among my friends but I am appalled at what I have seen in recent years because the party have been hijacked by adventurous mercenaries who will only bring about the party's destruction.  I ask the honourable Members of Fine Gael to bear this in mind and to rescue their party from oblivion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the vote of no confidence, the people will not thank us for trying to precipitate an election which they neither need nor want.  Delving into events of eight years ago will not enhance the prospects of Fine Gael one iota in the election campaign.  I will not say anything about the other parties but I have not yet seen them supporting any positive legislation proposed by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House needs to address itself to three questions in this debate.  First, does the speech by the Taoiseach answer the material allegations made which have led to this debate? Second, are the issues involved important enough to warrant a motion of confidence and all that that entails?  If, in the last resort, there is an election, will it solve the problem?  The Taoiseach's speech did not answer the allegations made; the issue is so important that it fully justifies a motion of confidence because confidence equals belief and if you cannot believe the Government you cannot have confidence in them.  Third, if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; Fianna Fáil <Col N="606" /> in particular &mdash; cannot solve this problem, because solved it must be, there is no healthy option facing democracy other than a general election, which will solve the problem by electing a new Government committed to sensible economic policies and to telling the truth within themselves and to the public at large.</P>
      <P>To turn to the first question of whether the Taoiseach's speech answers the allegations, it does not.  First, there has been a systematic attempt by the Government and their spokesman to mislead the people about this issue.  For example, the Government spokesman, Mr. P.J. Mara, made a statement on behalf of the Government.  It should be said that Mr. Mara's office is virtually beside that of the Taoiseach and no statement would be made by him without the Taoiseach's full knowledge and consent.  The Government spokesman categorically denied that any calls were made by any of those by Deputy Haughey, Deputy Lenihan or Deputy Sylvester Barrett.  A Government spokesman categorically denied that any calls were made by any of those people and that a statement was made by a Government spokesman who occupies virtually the next office to the Taoiseach and he does not act without his full consent, and usually, on his instructions. Yet, within hours of that categoric statement by the Government spokesman, former Deputy Sylvester Barrett appeared on television and categorically stated that calls had been made.  That is the first line and a very important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I draw the attention of everyone in this House to the fact that although the Taoiseach said a lot of things in his speech, nowhere is there an explicit denial that he called Áras an Uachtaráin himself.  Nowhere in the speech does he say whether he called Áras an Uachtaráin. Surely, given the notice that the Taoiseach had of this matter, given the fact that at the very outset of the Presidential election campaign Deputy Currie and Fine Gael indicated that the independence of the President would be an issue in the campaign, given that they referred particularly and specifically to the calls that were made, how come that <Col N="607" /> the Government did not until now make any attempt to issue a comprehensive statement about the matter, and how come even at this stage the Taoiseach in the House does not deny that he made the calls?  The Taoiseach can get other people to do it for him, as he used P.J. Mara to issue these untruthful statements, but the Taoiseach in his speech avoided answering the question as to whether he called Áras an Uachtaráin. Surely that omission is extremely revealing and indicates that in fact the Taoiseach did call Áras an Uachtaráin.  Yet, he is not even yet prepared to face up to the truth so far as that is concerned.  It was only when looking a general election straight in the eye that the Taoiseach attempted to issue any comprehensive statement about the matter, in the form of the content of his speech when, contrary to the Government spokesman's statement, he admitted at least that Deputy Sylvester Barrett made such a phone call.  Why the delay?  Obviously because the Taoiseach thought he would get away with it.  He thought that if he postponed the thing for another day people would stop asking the questions.</P>
    <P>This version of the truth is the version of the truth that was operable on 31 October.  It is not the version of the truth that was operable seven days ago and there probably will be another truth in a week's time, and yet another a week later.  That systematic changing of ground, that systematic failure to answer questions, that systematic attempt to mislead is simply not good enough.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my second question. Why are these issues so important as to warrant a motion of confidence?  I contend that one cannot have confidence in a Government who cannot be believed because every day of the week a Government enter into commitments with international agencies, with other governments and with trade unions and industrialists and people will act on what they are told by the Government.  If a Government are to function people will have to believe what they are told by that Government.  A Government who <Col N="608" /> change their version of the truth from day to day, a Government who cannot tell the truth and stick by it under pressure are not literally &mdash; and I use the word advisedly &mdash; able to govern, because telling the truth is the essence of good governance.  Unless people can tell the truth they cannot govern.</P>
    <P>This coalition Government do not have any viability whatever if one component do not believe the word of the other.  If the Progressive Democrats do not believe what the Taoiseach and Tánaiste are saying about this matter they cannot stay in the Government.  How can they conduct Cabinet meetings?  How can they believe assurances given at Cabinet meetings if they do not believe in the truthfulness of their colleagues?  Such a Government riven by internal disbelief, as I believe this Government would be if they continued for another single day, simply cannot govern.  I hope the people can accept that.  I make that as a practical point and not as a partisan point or a point designed to embarrass anybody.  If one does not believe what people are saying how can one work with them? How can this Government operate for another day if the people within it cannot believe one another?  That essentially is what a motion of confidence is about.</P>
    <P>There is no resolution of that matter outside of this vote of confidence unless in the few hours remaining to them the Fianna Fáil Party in the first instance remove those people who have installed themselves at the very top of the party, but who do not represent and have never represented the essential ethos that lead to the foundation of Fianna Fáil in 1927 &mdash; an ethos with which I do not fully agree, but at least an honourable and principled ethos.  The people who found themselves, by methods into which I will not go because they are not relevant to this debate, at the top of that party do not represent the essential views of Fianna Fáil or of what the country needs. If Fianna Fáil and their parliamentary party members cannot remove them, the House is faced with no option but to do it for them.  That is what this vote is about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Statements have been made, in an attempt to divert attention, to the effect that this was some type of plot or some type of trap that was set.  I have never heard such innocence presumed on the part of the Irish people, as the suggestion that people might believe that.  Let me put it simply.  An Opposition's job, whether it be on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, at Question Time in the Dáil or anywhere else where political debate takes place, is to ask hard questions.  Fine Gael gave ample warning at the outset of the campaign that these issues of independence of the Presidency would be central issues in our campaign.  Fianna Fáil should have been fully prepared for this. All that Fine Gael did on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; was ask the questions.  It was not the questions which caused the problems, it was the answers, the mendacious answers to the questions.</P>

It was they and their answers, their falsehoods that caused the problem.  It was not a plot, not the hard questions, but the answers that caused the problem.  That is why we are in the situation we are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a further attempt to muddy the waters and divert attention the Taoiseach engaged in what I would regard as a bullying attempt to take away the reputation of a young research student starting on his working career.  The Taoiseach refers to Jim Duffy as someone, &ldquo;who we are supposed to believe was doing more than researching a thesis.&rdquo;  Let me categorically state for the Taoiseach's edification that Jim Duffy was researching a thesis, and doing nothing else.  He had no other motive whatever and for the Taoiseach to suggest otherwise is to use the privilege of this House to try to take <Col N="610" /> the reputation of somebody who cannot answer in this House.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
      <P>However, the Tánaiste was given no such opportunity because the tapes were prematurely released with a statement by Mr. Duffy that he was under political pressure to do so.  Political pressure from whom we must ask.</P>
      <P>I would like to answer that question.  The fact is that Mr. Jim Duffy released those tapes after receiving advice from <i>The Irish Times,</i> an independent newspaper, not in the pocket of any political party, and because P.J. Mara, the Government spokesman named him as having made the tapes and it was because of pressure by P.J. Mara, presumably also on the Taoiseach's instructions, again using his bullying tactic, hoping that if they named him, Mr. Jim Duffy would not have the courage to stand behind what he knew to be the case, and would run for cover, and that somehow or other the issue would be overcome.</P>
      <P>The political pressure came from Fianna Fáil deliberately attempting to bully a research student into not defending his own integrity.  That was done on the instructions of, I presume, the Taoiseach in the same bullying mode in which he delivered his speech.  He will probably attempt to bully the Irish electorate into believing that there is no alternative to his person in this election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the House that the Irish people are bigger than any one man and if we have to have an election to clear up this issue the Irish people will make sure we have a Government after that election <Col N="611" /> which does not include the Taoiseach. The Irish people have enough pride in themselves, enough pride in their international reputation and enough belief in the necessity for politicians speaking on their behalf, whether they are in Áras an Uachtaráin or in Government buildings, to be believed that they will make sure that if an election occurs the result of it will be to put Deputy Haughey in a position where he can no longer exercise the influence he currently does on the Irish electorate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton should get out of the old university campus environment of lecturing everyone and fighting for his motions, whether they are fact or fiction, and live in the real world. The Deputy lectured this House at great length during his speech.  As the Taoiseach said, Fine Gael do not have a right to truthfulness and honesty and all the other great virtues one would believe, from listening to Deputy John Bruton, they have.  The Taoiseach pointed out that the Fine Gael Party are the only party in the history of the country who have hounded and insulted an independent President out of Áras an Uachtaráin, a former Supreme Court Judge who did nothing other than retain the integrity and independence of the Office of President.</P>
      <P>As a constituency colleague of Deputy Brian Lenihan I want to make some general remarks on my experience of working in close contact with him in our constituency and endeavour to put in context the events which have brought about this.  Reference has already been made to young Mr. Duffy and it took him a hell of a long time &mdash; from May until 4 October &mdash; to send the details of his paperwork to the Tánaiste, which he received in a letter on 17 October, well into the heat of the Presidential campaign. Any Member who tries to say that there was no well laid plot to create this is not being truthful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the position the Tánaiste found himself in <Col N="613" /> when he agreed to be interviewed by this young man.  The Tánaiste facilitated him in every way possible and has gone on public record as saying that he embellished the truth in the interview he gave to Mr. Duffy and that much of the content of the tape was inaccurate and incorrect. The Tánaiste has apologised for that and has openly, frankly and truthfully admitted it.  Why did it take Mr. Duffy until October, during the heat of the Presidential campaign, to have the neck to ask the Tánaiste to correct and approve material which he knew in his heart of hearts he proposed to use on the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme?</P>
      <P>I was in Venice with Deputy Garret FitzGerald on the Trilateral Commission when he got an urgent call asking him to return home because he was needed for the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme. The Fine Gael Party are quite entitled in any campaign to use this type of strategy but it has not improved people's opinion of them.  There has been no overwhelming swing to Fine Gael or their Presidential candidate to show that people believe they are absolutely correct and we are wrong on this issue.  There is no evidence to suggest that the strategy being used by Fine Gael, and the way they are conducting this campaign, is having any beneficial results for that party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What they are doing, thankfully from our point of view, is going back to the position they were in in the fifties, sixties and seventies where they went into the side waters of Irish political life and looked as though they were doomed to stay there for the nineties.  If there is a general election obviously the Fianna Fáil Party will face it with confidence and determination.  A general election should be avoided if at all possible.  Some thought we would avoid it by looking for the resignation of the Tánaiste and his clear answer at this juncture was that he will definitely not resign.  One could not but sympathise with the Tánaiste.  He has apologised publicly for any misdemeanour he has committed and he is entitled to be allowed get on with his campaign.  However, Fine Gael, in their <Col N="614" /> misjudged political strategy, have turned this campaign into a personalised mud-slinging operation which I do not think reflects very well on their candidate or will improve his prospects in the election.</P>
    <P>One of the issues in this Presidential campaign is whether a Minister with the background and experience of Deputy Brian Lenihan can act independently.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out, the Fine Gael Party put that down as a major item early in the campaign.  However, they have progressed to the stage where they are trying to establish that there should have been no so-called interference with the role of the President on the night of the collapse of the Coalition Government, that no contact or approaches should have been made to the President about two independent Deputies who might have changed their vote and supported the Fianna Fáil Party.  The way that was handled, the communications and the other issues involved are irrelevant to the core issue here, which is: were the largest Opposition Party entitled to try to avoid a general election and was the President of the opinion that, having accepted the message from the then Taoiseach, he should ask the leader of that party to go back to the House?</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has tried to lecture us on truthfulness but I want to ask how anybody in the international financial community could believe the Government who were in power at that time? How could they believe Deputy Bruton who stood up here budget after budget and misled this House by mismanagement of the finances of the country?  How could any international community believe a Government who could increase the national debt from £12 billion to £24 billion?  Is that not the greatest credibility problem this country has had over the past 30-40 years?  Where was the accountability for all of those issues?  Who is accountable for the burden of tax we have had to put on the people since then to try to repay our national debt which was increased as a result of mismanagement by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government?</P>
    <P>The reality is that we are confronted <Col N="615" /> today with a situation which cannot be let go unmentioned.  Our colleagues in Government, the Progressive Democrats, in their wisdom, have seen fit to put a price on continuing in Government and at this stage it seems that at 7 o'clock this evening there will be a vote of no confidence in the Government and we will be plunged into a general election.  If that is the case, so be it.  I am quietly confident that following a general election we on this side of the House will resume in some form of Government. From an analysis of the constituencies it does not appear from the opinion polls that we will get a majority but prior to the 1977 general election the opinion polls were completely misleading and indicated that we would never have a majority Government in this country again.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has pointed out that we have our problems but we will resolve them in due course.  When this debate reaches its conclusion at 7 p.m. we will go to the country with confidence and return to this side of the House because the people recognise good Government.  They also recognise that the inertia and malaise of the Fine GaelLabour Coalition of the past was no way <Col N="616" /> to govern the country.  Any objective independent observer would have to admit that did not work.  This Government are working, but there is a difficulty as of today because six Members who support our party in Government have decided to put a price on their continued support.  This appears to me to have been somewhat premature and perhaps the result will be that we will be plunged into a general election, which we all want to avoid &mdash; no politician ever looks forward to an election &mdash; but I would face it with confidence.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Presidential election which is to take place next Wednesday there has been overkill in relation to the position of Deputy Brian Lenihan and his opponents in the other political parties.  I think the country will rally behind Deputy Brian Lenihan before next Wednesday.  They will realise that an honest decent man has been done a major injustice.  That candidate was frank, open and honest enough to admit that he made a mistake and that, in his interview with Jim Duffy he gave all sorts of details in order to embellish the situation for a young student doing his thesis.</P>
      <P>The reality is that in a general election campaign we will put before the electorate what can be achieved in the nineties. I also believe that the Fine Gael Party in particular have dabased themselves in this campaign.  According to this morning's opinion polls their rating stands at 17 per cent, not always to be believed, but this figure will probably increase marginally.  If Fine Gael were the main architects of bringing about this situation, leading the Government to putting down this vote of confidence, do they think they will reap any political reward, or do they really believe, with all these allegations and innuendoes flying around, that they have such a duty to the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave his answer this morning but it still does not appear to be satisfactory.  He has clearly and unambiguously stated in the House that he never insulted or had an argumentative discussion with any member of the Defence Forces.  I presume that this <Col N="617" /> means that he has never embarked upon a critical analysis of that man's behaviour at work.  This does not appear to be good enough or acceptable.</P>

Each time references were made to telephone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin the mythology expanded, and it was further expanded by Deputy Garret FitzGerald who claimed eight phone calls were made and he overheard the person on the other end of the telephone.  That has been proved to be pure farce and he tried to laugh it off on a radio show as a joke.  We look forward to a general election and to a Brian Lenihan victory next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I participate in this debate with a great deal of sadness.  It is a coincidence that I am following my constituency colleague, Deputy Liam Lawlor, in this debate.  I have always found him to be a very honourable person who does not engage in mudslinging, and I am sure he would say the same about me.</P>
      <P>The developments of the past nine days are a personal tragedy for another of our constituency colleagues, the Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Far from gloating on these events, no Member of the Dáil can but feel genuine sadness.  It is now history that the sequence of events began to unfold on the RTE television programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday, 23 October.  Given what the Taoiseach said today and what has been put out by successive Fianna Fáil spokesmen, it is absolutely essential that the true facts, and nothing but the facts in relation to that programme be put on the record of the House and be made known to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be recalled that all three candidates had been invited to appear <Col N="618" /> together on a single &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme.  It is our understanding that all three candidates had accepted that invitation in principle but that Deputy Lenihan withdrew subsequent to the three way debate on &ldquo;Saturday View&rdquo; on RTE Radio 1 on Saturday, 18 September when the general impression was that he had not performed well.  That was a fateful decision, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, to withdraw from other three way debates.  If the Tánaiste had been allowed to go on with the other two candidates, the sequence of events which then followed would not have taken place.</P>
    <P>Following the Fianna Fáil decision to withdraw Deputy Lenihan from that three way &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme, RTE proposed three separate &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programmes with one candidate appearing on each. It was also proposed that each of the candidate's national directors of elections would also appear once but in separate programmes.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bertie Ahern withdrew from the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme he was to have appeared on with Deputy Austin Currie and was substituted by a senior Fianna Fáil backbencher, I decided to do the same the following week, not for any Machiavellian reason, as has been ascribed by the Taoiseach in the House today and by others, but because national directors of elections are very busy people in the middle of election campaigns.  Accordingly, I decided to invite Deputy Garret FitzGerald to take my place on the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme with Deputy Brian Lenihan on Monday, 23 October.</P>
    <P>As all Members of the House are aware, each panellist is allowed six tickets for the show and I nominated six Fine Gael members to be present.  Likewise, both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party had their six nominees present.  I presume that these parties, like Fine Gael, briefed their respective panellists and six ticket holders on the questions likely to be raised.  In planning the questions and in briefing our representatives, we were <Col N="619" /> making no more than proper and well considered preparations and we state categorically that (1) we had no prior knowledge of the existence of the Duffy taped interview and (2) we had no prior inkling that the Tánaiste would answer the questions in the way he did.</P>
    <P>That issue of contradictions by Fianna Fáil and the attacks on Deputy Garret FitzGerald by Mr. Haughey are the only dirty tricks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal practice to refer to him as the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the Taoiseach are the only dirty tricks operating in this campaign.  Since Deputy Haughey took over the position of leader of Fianna Fáil that party have been embroiled in a succession of scandals which have besmirched that party and caused a great deal of humiliation and embarrassment to a good percentage of their members.  In making that point, I reiterate that it never was our intention to say that everybody in Fianna Fáil shares the same standards as have been demonstrated by some of their leaders in the past 11 years.  Indeed, it is those very scandals which led to the breakaway of Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Harney, Deputy Wyse, Deputy Molloy and others and the formation of the Progressive Democrats Party.  I can well understand in the passion and emotion and the self-defence of the moment that people such as Deputy John O'Connell and Deputy Lawlor would be sent in to the House to spread the muck as wide as they can in self-defence, but they know in their heart of hearts that a majority, at least, of Fianna Fáil members see that their party has been hijacked for 11 years and brought into the gutter time and again not by any foul Machiavellian plan of the Opposition but by their own misdeeds and omissions.  Far from showing any contrition for the events of the past ten days and for the repeated contradictions, members of Fianna Fáil have sought to defend the indefensible and to do so frequently in a way, led by the <Col N="620" /> Taoiseach to break every rule of parliamentary order and procedure.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled, Sir, that when I said in this House, in anticipation of the Broadcasting Bill, that I believed the Minister for Communications &mdash; in a reply to a question in this House &mdash; had misled the House, I was ordered to withdraw from the House.  I did not say he had deliberately misled the House nor lied to the House, I did not say he had told untruths but I said he had misled the House.  For that offence, which I understood was within Parliamentary order, I was asked to leave the House.  As events turned out, my line on that day in the Dáil was vindicated.  Compare that with the words the Taoiseach has used during the past several days.  In the Dáil he has used language which is an extraordinary bad example to every other Member of this House.  There is a total disregard for the traditions of Parliament as well as for its Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>If we have a general election arising from this motion of no confidence, the blame lies entirely with the Fianna Fáil Party for their inability to come to grips with the ghastly mistake and compounding mistakes that have been made in the past nine days.  Over the past three years, I have often thought about how the media in general could have assumed that the Fianna Fáil leopard had changed its spots.  During the past two or three years, the Taoiseach has been treated as if he could do no wrong and that the past was over and could never recur.  We can understand these ups and downs of political life and the ups and downs of political comment.  What I can never understand is that reputable newspapers like the <i>Sunday Business Post, The Sunday Tribune, Sunday Independent</i> and others with very serious journalists, have in editorial comment and in features frequently given sole credit to Fianna Fáil &mdash; and in the last year to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; for the economic recovery.  They have stated categorically in editorials and in other features that this Government have brought about low inflation, economic recovery and balance of trade surpluses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> This election, when the dust settles, will be about economic stability and economic progress but the realities are that on any detached analysis the foundations for economic recovery and growth were laid before 1987.  By 1985, we had inflation down to 3.4 per cent and we have maintained low inflation ever since. An inflation rate of 3.4 per cent in 1985 was half the rate of inflation in Britain in that year, whereas when Deputy FitzGerald took over as Taoiseach in 1982 our rate of inflation was twice the British rate: it was 21 per cent.  The foundation stone of economic stability and growth is low inflation.  That was brought about by Deputy FitzGerald's Government of which I had the pleasure of being a member.</P>
    <P>When Deputy FitzGerald came to Government we had a balance of trade deficit of £1,800 million in that year, the biggest ever in our history.  By the time he left office, we had a balance of trade surplus, the first in 40 years.  That was another turn around provided by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  They are two key achievements by the FitzGerald Government but there were many more.  For instance it is fashionable to believe that it was Deputy Haughey's Government who started to reduce VAT rates and income tax rates.  On the contrary, it was the FitzGerald Government who reduced the top VAT rate from 35 per cent to 25 per cent and, indeed, the top income tax rate down to 58 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked this morning about all the development that is taking place.  He talked about the Tallaght Town Centre and other places.  The reality is that most of the development is going on, in areas which are designated under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, which was introduced by my colleague, the former Deputy John Boland.  Again, it was Deputy FitzGerald's Government who laid the foundation for this development in the designated areas; nobody can dispute that.  It was an imaginative policy which is now showing results.  Moreover, all the major road construction programmes which have since materialised were all decided in the programme, <Col N="622" /><i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i>  These are uncontestable facts.  I am not trying to pretend that there were not failures of that Government, of course there were, aided and abetted by an obstreperous Opposition who encouraged every single interest group to oppose the rational policies of the Government and to seek more.</P>

      <P>It is important in looking ahead to this campaign, if we should have such a campaign, that uppermost in the minds of every Member of this House should be the future of this country and the absolute need to get sufficient economic stability and economic growth so as to provide worth-while employment for all its citizens at home.  I do not believe that any Member of this House &mdash; much less any party in this House &mdash; can rest complacently with the extent of our emigration during the past number of years or that we can congratulate ourselves on the great economic euphoria, which some commentators see, when so many of our people are unemployed and so many more are in Boston, Sydney, Birmingham and London.  I do not think we can rest complacently and pretend that there is economic utopia here when we have so many problems in our hospitals and in our schools.</P>
      <P>Let the debate not be about lies, counter-lies and allegations; let it be about the real issues but above all else, it has to be a debate about credibility.  When we say something can we be believed?  If we come into this House and answer questions, can we be believed?  When we deal with other parties or other Governments, can they believe what we are saying?  Can the financial institutions believe what we are saying?  To sum up, can there be continued confidence that this country has the mettle and the vision to sort out its own problems and to provide for all its citizens equally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As things stand we are facing a general election.  The Opposition claim this motion has been put down <Col N="623" /> because of credibility.  It would have been possible to put down that motion after the Presidential election but the Opposition decided to put it down this week.  One can gauge from that that the Opposition seek to increase whatever political capital they can gain from the events of the past week by introducing this new motion on the basis of what they claim is credibility. While we are in the political system and when mistakes are made we will always attempt to make whatever political capital we can from it.  This issue is not about who phoned whom when.  We are about to plunge the country into an election which nobody wants.  This is verging on irresponsibility because it is not in the interests of the country to discuss this motion at this time.  There will be political difference on that but that is my pure political judgment regardless of the outcome.</P>
      <P>When we talk about credibility we must bear in mind that the first thing that would be said to us by our constituents is, &ldquo;Isn't this incredible?&rdquo;.  It will be incredible because the issue before the House is not a timely issue or vital to the interests of the nation.  It is open to the political parties to put down this motion at any subsequent time.  We now have two issues &mdash; the Presidential election and the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes will have all the evidence he requires in recent opinion polls to show that the vast majority of the people do not believe he is a credible alternative to the Taoiseach.  Vituperation has increased in recent debates since the Broadcasting Bill and I have seen many Deputies on the opposite benches going very close to the wind in terms of allegations which were beyond the norm in political debate.  What I find incredible are statements of those Opposition spokespersons who have used the privilege of this House to make allegations, not about people in the political arena but in some cases about people outside that arena.  If the logic is that when an unsubstantiated claim is made which is not defended in this House it should stand, then by the same token if <Col N="624" /> people are prepared to make unsubstantiated allegations using the privilege of this House and they do not repeat them outside the House, they remain unsubstantiated allegations.  I refer to the speech made by the Tánaiste in the no confidence motion put down against Deputy Ray Burke as Minister for Communications. He displayed political maturity in a debate which was bereft of such contributions, with some honourable exceptions, that by Deputy Higgins amongst them.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the people are to be asked to contribute to political instability. That is precisely what they are being asked to do.  It is incredible that experienced politicians on the opposite benches who have been making political capital with some success from events in the previous week have come to the conclusion that the people want a general election.  I entered this House six years ago at the age of 24 in tragic circumstances. I find it difficult to see people who shed crocodile tears about emigration, joblessness and the lack of opportunity voting for this motion at this critical time, when we have a Government preparing to enter negotiations with all the social partners to decide how we can move ahead by consensus.  Those people believe they can credibly stand before the electorate and claim to do things better.  They are creating a crisis of confidence not in this House but in the country.  We are not here for our own sake or to seek some supporting role in a developing political soap opera.  We are here to serve the people, those whom we speak about as lacking jobs and opportunity.</P>

      <P>To what extent will that crisis of confidence in the country contribute to the solution of that problem? That is the credibility issue today.  The people should be allowed to make their decision on the happenings of the past week when they go to the polls next Wednesday. The people will make their <Col N="625" /> decision and everybody will abide by it, not least the candidate who is being portrayed here today as something he is not. He is not anything other than a decent honourable man.</P>
      <P>We are told that this motion is about the style of Government.  I was in this House in Opposition between 1984 and 1987.  I recall a style of Government which produced major economic policy documents.  Members of the Labour Party were members of that Government. Was one trade union leader asked what he thought?  Was one CEO from the health boards invited by the Minister for Health to discuss health problems? Was one farm organisation asked in to sit down, not to be told at a major press conference that this was the new reality document?  It was an autocratic Government, although I do not seek to denigrate the personalities in that Government. They did not seek consensus on the major issues and move ahead with a sense of give and take, getting away from platitudes and smart talk, and they did not begin to do anything for the people who had problems such as the jobless and the young.  That is what politics is about and it is the reason why I am in it.</P>

    <P>I do not intend ingratiating myself or countering arguments which have been made in the House or outside it.  I have no intention of so doing.

They are not saying it to journalists or broadcasting people but to me, their public representative.  I know what the problems are.  In terms of priority their problems is certainly not who phoned whom when.  In 1984 when I came into this House the question I was asking was, who employed whom when.  I need no lectures from anybody in my own party or any other party about my job in this House.  I will not have my honour challenged by smear or by generalisation.  I will not have the honour of my party challenged.  Neither will I have the honour of the people whom I represent challenged.  Certainly I will not have the <Col N="626" /> people who participate in the parliamentary doemocracy &mdash; with no cheque at the end of the month &mdash; challenged.</P>
    <P>What is the political crime?  If one asks constitutional lawyers &mdash; and I ask the House to find two or three who will agree on any given subject &mdash; what is the political crime they will say there is no explicit denial in the Constitution &mdash; in that unprecedented set of circumstances &mdash; disallowing a Member of an Opposition party consult with the President on the basis that he is available if he wishes, in his absolute discretion, to use his powers under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>It does not impinge on his discretion.  I am not interested in old battles between Deputy FitzGerald and anybody else.  Deputy FitzGerald has had his day.  He served his country as best he could and the people took their decision. I am here to represent them hopefully in the nineties and beyond.  If I make onetenth of the impact Deputy FitzGerald made in whatever contribution I can make, however ineloquently I may express it, I shall be happy.  But I am not prepared to stand here and listen to what happened over eight years ago.  Everybody outside this House wants to know what will happen in the next nine months and nine years.  I am not prepared to listen to recent converts to parliamentary democracy endeavour to impugn me in that respect either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will say this: yes, the Tánaiste over-emphasised his role on tape to a political student; that is quite clear.  I would ask any Member of this House &mdash; if he or she can endeavour to get off their high horse &mdash; did he or she ever under-emphasise his or her role in relation to a constituency matter?  Did he or she ever under-emphasise their role in terms of bringing employment to their constituency?  Did he or she ever under-emphasise their role in any of the legitimate activities in which a politician engages?  It should be remembered that it is not one politician's credibility only that is at stake here.  The way in which this whole debate has unfolded <Col N="627" /> has meant that politics are being undermined because we are not allowing the people take a decision on the issue that arose last week.  Let the people take their decision.  The House should not underestimate their intelligence in that respect either.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the political capital that can be made in any circumstances, all of us are here to make a positive, constructive contribution.  If we are not in a position to do so, then I have no longer any interest in remaining in this House. I will say this: I am a third generation Fianna Fáil man, one who came down from the North of Ireland many years ago.  I know that everybody in my constituency with whom I am associated is an honourable man and woman.  Having given the matter some consideration I say that the Tánaiste is the same honourable man who was in my house some 30 years ago beginning a Seanad campaign.</P>
    <P>I will make my opinion very lucid for the House.  If I am given a choice between pegging out 33 years of public service and a misleading, over-emphasised role on tape to a political student &mdash; about whom I know nothing and have no intention of saying anything &mdash; that will be a sad day for Ireland.  There is something crazy if that man's honour is to be impugned on that issue.  Many Members of the House present have been a long time in politics and know that he is one of the most decent men who ever walked into this House.  I will not stand over the malevolence of some people who perhaps do not realise the type of man about whom they are talking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important in the debate that takes place today that what takes place in this House should not interfere or intervene in the remaining stages of the campaign that is going on separate from any consequences of today's vote which might entail a general election.  I hope that the distance between that campaign and a general election and a campaign for the Presidency can be respected.  Nonetheless, it will be difficult. I want to say very little about that <Col N="628" /> campaign for the Presidency except in relation to one matter.  I want to concentrate what I have to say in these few minutes on what has now evolved from being an issue that might have been resolved into a major vote of confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make about the Presidency is this, that the candidates who are in the field &mdash; and I participated in the famous programme which gave rise to our present discussion &mdash; are people who have in one way or another, in their political experience, attempted to offer a good content to their version of public service, and I said that.  But, in recent days, the scurrility of the allegations made against Mary Robinson, the candidate nominated by the Labour Party, has been absolutely disgraceful.  People have been speaking here about standards on one side and those on the other.  She is one of the three candidates who is not a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  Members of these Houses have stood up in public &mdash; in the presence of their candidate &mdash; and asked the people what they thought of the consequences of voting for somebody who might have an abortion referral clinic in Áras an Uachtaráin.  How can people speak about standards in politics when one makes such a statement in the presence of one's own candidate, and that statement is not disowned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say &mdash; because Deputy O'Connell was drawing on his medical experience, and I listened with interest to what he had to say &mdash; that my experience has been as a political scientist.  I recall occasions &mdash; when reading in history &mdash; when senior figures in the Fianna Fáil Party walked off platforms when lesser figures made the kind of remark that may have been repeated in other parts of the country.  In so far as we have just been invited to let the people make up their minds with regard to what will happen on Wednesday next, I invite the people to make up their minds on those kinds of remarks.  No doubt the Deputy who made that remark will be back saying: you know, anything goes in an election.  That is why we are where we <Col N="629" /> are today &mdash; the &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; kind of political culture which has brought us to this very sad day.  That political culture, which I have heard described, is one which has had in recent times an increasing authoritarian content.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I remember the reaction of the media over my time in politics, when they used sometimes to attack the parties of the left for disagreeing publicly.  That was seen as an aspect of weakness, that there would be different opinions and debates going on within parties.  The contention was: why can they not manage to stick together in some kind of tribal loyalty so that they will all sing the same song no matter what their thinking or what they are doing.  That prevailed as the political culture within the largest party of Government for a very long time until circumstances evolved in which nobody could write a song except one person, when listening to and supporting speeches in this House was really like listening to the tones of the tuning fork set off when everyone said the same thing &mdash; one speech after another.  In these difficult economic times in which we find ourselves, when at last the nation's finances are coming under control, everyone has the same mantra.</P>
    <P>That party have never allowed dissent, individual opinion, intelligent ideas and so on, and those who were happy with that version moved to the Front Bench and those who might have wanted to have an independent view on anything moved to the back benches.</P>
    <P>That authoritarian political culture had a dreadful effect on the nature of politics itself.  It was not questioned very seriously except by long standing political journalists like Dick Walsh and others, but it led to the acceptance of another dangerous myth that was that there was one party in this State that would always be near Government or form Governments, a kind of &ldquo;divine right to rule&rdquo; party, and this myth permeated our society.  I am making no allegations about names, events or dates, but I want to say this poison and rot went deep into Irish society.</P>
    <P>In my time in politics people have come <Col N="630" /> to me complaining about forms of interviews for VEC positions, for positions in different aspects of the public service and so on.  I have always found that to be appalling.  The curious side effect of this has been highlighted in the poll rating of the Government up to this and the large vote for Mary Robinson.  The public want a new kind of political culture; they want the windows thrown open; they want fresh air.  They want a kind of symbol which will be both progressive and open, that will not be based on the nod, wink or nudge, meeting so and so and so on. That is what they want and I respect their opinion.</P>
    <P>If the Government think they are going to go to the country and secure a mandate after the awful events of recent times I assure them that there will be quite a job of conversion to be done.  The public will not be blackmailed by something like: &ldquo;If you reject us who were used to doing whatever we wanted who will you vote for?  There is nothing else on offer.  Bad and all as we are, should we not be allowed to continue?&rdquo;  That kind of argument is singularly seedy.</P>
    <P>What began as a question about events many years ago could have been resolved at the very beginning.  There could have been a response to an article in the newspapers last September.  There could have been a frank admission on what took place on the television programme. There could have been a statement afterwards. All these opportunities were lost &mdash; not lost &mdash; rejected through arrogance. The feeling was we can brazen it out and this arrogance was not confined to the realm of the Presidential election.  It was brought into this House by Ministers and Government spokesmen who said: &ldquo;I can unequivocally state this&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside &mdash; I am not ignoring it &mdash; the appropriateness of what had happened, there were many ways this could have been ended but they were all rejected because of this machismo the Government like to display.  The idea is we will just say it never happened, raise our voices and so on.  This was not a mistake, it is just brazenness.</P>
    <P>The people have had enough and they <Col N="631" /> will show it.  The only difference between the position this evening and the position last week is that the people will be able to show Fianna Fáil twice in the space of a couple of weeks what they think of them and they will not be put off by anyone saying they are sorry to have to bother them when they knock on the doors asking for their vote.  The people know it is one of their sovereign rights to vote, and they will have to vote again and again.  The people also have a right to question the atmosphere surrounding the Presidency and they will not give away that right.  I have listened to the statements made and I found them interesting. Is it not a pity that we should be so concerned with these issues but that we are going to imperil a superb economic performance?</P>
    <P>I have deep regret for the position in which the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, Deputy Brian Lenihan, finds himself.  I am one of the longest standing spokespersons on Foreign Affairs in this Dáil and my interactions with him were always marked by courtesy and helpfulness, but I am much more worried about what has happened.  It was appalling, it was bad, but worse were the people who surrounded him and put these denials on top of what was already dreadful.  I do not have to speak about making telephone calls to the President, how awful that is and the constitutional dangers involved, but I want to answer this nonsense that is going on.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the economy is doing so well it would be a pity to draw our breath for ethics, and this is what it is all about.  People are saying: let us not go on about soft things like ethical standards and appropriate behaviour in politics.  Let us get on with some real washing the economy, as the advertisement says.</P>
    <P>The reference for performance the Taoiseach used was the IMF.  That speaks for itself.  It relies for indicators of success on inflation rates, interest rates, export levels and the public borrowing requirement, but look at all the Ministers because this is a motion of confidence in <Col N="632" /> the Government.  There is a Minister for the Gaeltacht who promised a television service but will not speak Irish.  The Minister for Defence is already central to this debate.  A Foreign Affairs Minister insults the House by not giving us accountability through a foreign affairs committee.  A Health Minister presides over beds in corridors.  An Environment Minister presides over the collapse of public housing.  A Social Welfare Minister tells us there is no poverty.  There were many references already this morning to the Justice Minister.  The Communications Minister is the same person who turned his face against the concept of public service broadcasting.  The Minister for the Marine presided over the loss of millions of pounds in the tourism industry through the rod licence dispute.  Ministers for Energy and Industry and Commerce are missing and it is very interesting that their message to us is relayed by a Fianna Fáil backbencher who is no longer in the House.</P>
    <P>The truth is there is no question of there being a neutral management strategy for the Irish economy.  There is economic success for what can be called the depeopled economy, the economy measured without talking about its people.  You can say it is successful as a mechanical entity, separate from the people and by doing that you can ignore emigration, poverty, unemployment, housing, health standards, and I forgot the Minister for Education and the crowded classrooms who says to everything she is asked, &ldquo;Let us have a cup of tea&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This has evolved to a vote of confidence in the Government.  As I look at all these empty benches, and aware of the empty policies, I have no reluctance in voting no confidence in this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this motion of confidence in the Government.  The accomplishments of this Government and of its predecessors since 1987 have been nothing short of phenomenal.  It <Col N="633" /> would be well to review the situation which faced the nation before 1987 to see why the people should have the utmost confidence in this House and why this Government deserve a vote of confidence in this House this evening.</P>
      <P>The condition of this nation before 1987 was a most pitiful one.  Whatever European survey conducted during the period one wished to choose, Ireland always found itself at the bottom where benefits were concerned and at the top where disadvantages were concerned. Into this scenario came the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987.  I was a member of the Government at the time.  They were faced with a near impossible task.  They had been left a country which was both financially bankrupt and devoid of any sense of confidence thanks to the criminal ineptitude of the previous Coalition Government which had been led &mdash; and I use the term euphemistically &mdash; by Deputies Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring.</P>
      <P>In a few short years their Government, while preaching financial rectitude, had managed to double the national debt ensuring that every man, woman and child would spend the rest of their lives paying for that Government's profligacy. They mismanaged the nation's finances, driving our people, especially our young people, away from their homes in hordes. It is interesting to listen to Deputy Michael D. Higgins speaking as if emigration had only been discovered since 1987.  It was not admitted before 1987.  I recall question time after question time when the Ministers of State at the Department of the Taoiseach stood up and categorically denied what was obvious to everybody who knew anything about it.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who was so sanctimonious in his address here today, supported that Government right through their period in this House.</P>

      <P>While they mismanaged the nation's finances and drove our young people away from their homes in hordes, interest rates ran sky high, inflation was uncontrolled, businesses collapsed all around the country and money poured out of this country.  They claimed that theirs was a socially motivated Administration but crime was rampant.  They claimed they had solved the housing crisis in Dublin; indeed there was no crisis because there were no people.  They had been driven out of their schools and jobs and houses and on to the boats in the darkness of the night.  When this was pointed out to them they denied that emigration was happening at all, refusing to raise a finger for the many who had fled, especially those who went westward undocumented and unwanted.</P>

      <P>What of investment?  The greatest plight our people were facing was unemployment, but there was not one serious proposal on the books of the IDA when Fianna Fáil assumed Government that year.</P>
      <P>The sheer bankruptcy of that Government in its ineffectiveness was monumental and yet they lost no opportunity to preach to the people about how they should not expect things like secure jobs or a safe society.  Investment by private enterprise was unethical according to that Government.  Emigration did not exist and the Fine Gael/Labour view was that we were a poor country and should not expect that we could be anything more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a Fianna Fáil Government since 1987.  This nation has seen its balance of payments come back into some sense of proportion.  Interest rates came down and levelled off. Inflation rates came down to the lowest in Europe and exports reached record levels month after month.  Emigration <Col N="635" /> was recognised and imaginative proposals were put forward to create jobs to keep our people at home.  Our employment figures are showing now that real inroads are being made in job creation. We have benefited from three years of a very successful national understanding and all the social partners are preparing in good faith to again strive for a consensus which, in the long run, will be for the good of the whole country.</P>
      <P>At home investment is on an upswing. Our currency is strong, our interest rates are dropping, and our inflation rate is the envy of Europe.  Business confidence is such that it has stood up to the dire predictions of German reunification and the world-shaking events in the Gulf.  On the international level the successful recent Irish Presidency of the European Community has drawn kudos from all as being effective and constructive at a time when Europe was going through what I shall call the happiest of revolutions.</P>
      <P>Ireland has gone from being the poor man of Europe to being a country with great pride and determination.  As Irish people we know that we can now tackle our problems and overcome them.  That confidence is the legacy of the present Administration and what a marked contrast it is to the dire and depressing aspects imposed on this country by the FitzGerald/Spring Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my own contribution to the present Government I turn to the Department of Justice.  Since taking office as Minister for Justice in July last year one of my top priorities has been to ensure that the Garda are equipped and deployed so that the ordinary citizen can live in peace and security.  To this end my objective has been to have as many gardaí as possible out on beat duty on our streets where they are most needed.  Last November I announced one of the most powerful crime fighting packages ever put together in aid of the Garda Síochána, and the Garda Síochána have willingly acknowledged this.  Since then I have acted with determination to ensure that the various elements of the package are quickly implemented to ensure that <Col N="636" /> maximum benefit is got from it.  Apart from the extra gardaí, the extra trainees and the extra civilian help and the promotions of gardaí to strengthen the management of the Force I have ensured, with the approval of my colleagues in Government, that adequate funding has been made available to provide for the Garda needs in the form of vehicles, equipment, computers, overtime and training, including a massive £16 million investment in the Garda College in Templemore of which the first phase is completed.  I have given active support and encouragement to the Garda Commissioner in extending the community policing concept.  When I took up office as Minister, gardaí were involved in a number of these projects and this has now been extended.</P>
    <P>As evidence of the success of what I have been doing, I can quote from the 1987 report on crime which shows there to be an overall decrease of 3.1 per cent in recorded indictable crime in comparison to 1988, when recorded crime in the Dublin metropolitan area showed a decrease of 7.8 per cent.  Armed crime showed a decrease of 22 per cent from the figures of 1988 and there were a record 1,562 drug seizures.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my comments on the Garda side, I want to congratulate the Garda Síochána on the excellent work they are doing and in particular on some outstanding successes they have had in recent months.  They can be assured of my wholehearted support and that of this Government whether this be by way of providing them with the resources they require to carry out their duties or by defending them from the unfair and unjustified attacks from no matter how senior a level in Opposition parties in this House.  I can assure them of that support and of the support of the Government. These attacks are made on them from time to time by very senior people who should know better and from whom they should least expect it.</P>
    <P>To come to the events which led us to address this confidence motion in the House today, it is not so much a question of confidence in this Government as <Col N="637" /> much as answering one of the most snide, sinister and dishonest smears upon a public representative in the history of the State.  It is said both inside and outside this House that the Irish public do not hold their public representatives in great esteem, respect or appreciation.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, how could this be otherwise when we have seen Members of this House on the benches opposite conduct their business by deceit, baiting and sheer slander?</P>
    <P>That Brian Lenihan who agreed to give an interview to a student of a certain member of the Upper House who failed to regain a seat in the last election, was a man who had dedicated himself to Irish public service for the last three decades. That Brian Lenihan had served as a local representative, Senator and Deputy.  As a Deputy he has served under three Taoisigh, held nine Ministries in Fianna Fáil Governments since 1964 and, as expected of any public representative, he was always available to his constituents. This meant that his home was always an open house; his time was never his own and his family were obliged to assist with elections, constituency concerns and countless other duties which absorb a public representative.  That Brian Lenihan has served in more senior Cabinet positions than any other current Member of this House.  That Brian Lenihan has been responsible for a wide range of notable legislation which included a Bill which has done more to provide justice for women in this State than any other legislation, with the exception of the vote itself.  That Brian Lenihan played his part in providing educational opportunities for a far greater number of Irish people by fulfilling Donough O'Malley's promise, with comprehensive, community and other postprimary educational facilities and by initiating plans for what are now the Universities of Dublin City and Limerick.</P>
    <P>This is the Brian Lenihan who was the first to address the enlarged Council of Ministers shortly after Ireland joined the European Community.  This is the Brian Lenihan who secured Structural Funds <Col N="638" /> allocated to Ireland under the umbrella of the European Statutes and who was Minister for Foreign Affairs when Ireland first took up membership of the Security Council of the United Nations. This is the Brian Lenihan who worked with US representative Brian Donnelly to secure legitimate status for our emigrants in America when they were being ignored by Fine Gael and Labour in Government.  This Brian Lenihan is the one who provided a representation for the members of our Defence Forces and implemented the pay recommendations of the Gleeson report.  This is the Brian Lenihan who for many international statesmen is the very face of Ireland and of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I have known this man for 30 years, from before I became a public representative. My earliest memories of him are of a friendly, kind-hearted man who always expressed a willingness to offer advice or be helpful.  This is not a man who would lie to the Irish people whom he has faithfully served for 30 years but rather he is a man of honesty, integrity and high honour, and Ireland would be graced to have him as her President.</P>
    <P>There is simply no candidate in the race for the Presidency of our country who has had as much experience or done as much for as many Irish people as Brian Lenihan.  This is the situation which Members on the opposite benches could not tolerate, Members who were not concerned with who would come first with the Irish people in this Presidential campaign but who would be second or third. This is a campaign which began with only one party having a selection procedure to choose their candidate.  One of the candidates was simply imposed by a party leadership who now speaks of low standards in high places.  Perhaps he has not too far to look.  The remaining candidate was an unwilling and late draftee, a member of a party whose leader was obliged to travel to the candidate's home in County Tyrone to plead with him to condescend to run for the highest position which Ireland has to offer.  These are the alternatives to Brian Lenihan offered to <Col N="639" /> the Irish people, an imposed candidate and a draftee.</P>
    <P>When the campaign began Fianna Fáil underlined their candidate's experience, his loyalty and his integrity, which everyone agrees is unimputable.  Fine Gael decided to explain why the Irish people should vote for Austin Currie by telling them why they should not vote for the other candidates.  Brian Lenihan's sterling qualities of experience, loyalty and integrity were turned inside out and used against him.  First of all Brian Lenihan's loyalty was held up as questionable. Never before has loyalty been a virtue which was held up to doubt and question, but for Fine Gael loyalty is something for which contempt should be felt.  When the old song was ignored Fine Gael turned their attention to the other candidate, the red card was played, but two weeks later the Fine Gael candidate was seeking a meeting to discuss vote transfers.</P>
    <P>In the last week we have seen the Members opposite recount with relish how they devised their plot against Brian Lenihan.  By their own admission there has been use of Fine Gael activists as moles, well rehearsed plants on television programmes and political pressure.  With the hysterical denouncements of Fine Gael no one has been able to contemplate the utterances of Garret FitzGerald who claimed to have been in Áras an Uachtaráin when calls were made, who implied that he heard very good imitations of members of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench and, less than 24 hours later, claimed he was not in the building at all. Of course, this is the Garret FitzGerald who has such great concern for the institution and the independence of the Presidency that, as a senior member of a Government in the seventies, he participated in driving an independent President from office.  This is not the first effort by the former leader of Fine Gael to smear and slander.  We had the dubious pleasure, as early as 1979, of hearing the previously best known of his offerings when Charles J. Haughey assumed the leadership of Fianna Fáil.  I am certain it is reassuring for many of those who long <Col N="640" /> for the bad old days over which he presided that he has not lost his talent for half truths, duplicity and innuendo.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan gave an interview.  His mistake was that he did not inquire what the political allegiance of his interviewer and his mentor was, and so better prepare for an interview which may be turned against him.  His mistake was that while still recovering from a near fatal illness he did not seek more time for himself and refuse requests such as these for interviews which were of little or no benefit to him.  His mistake was that as a busy Minister presenting historical legislation before this House he did not prepare for the interview by checking his facts and recollections before facilitating the student.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I do not wish to quibble unnecessarily with the Chair but I had understood on the arithmetics of the House that it was now <Col N="641" /> the turn of The Workers' Party to contribute to the debate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entitled to an explanation.  The situation is that the debate moves from Government to Opposition.  The Fine Gael Party, because of their numerical strength, have two slots as against one for the other parties.  Deputy O hUiginn was the last to speak for the Opposition and Deputy Shatter is entitled, on that basis, to be called now.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great sadness and astonishment to the speeches we have been subjected to in the House today, by the Taoiseach, the other contributors from the Fianna Fáil side and lastly by Deputy Burke.  One would have hoped that the lessons of the past week would have been learned and understood and that we might have had a different approach from the Government benches today.  It appears that from the Taoiseach down there is not a single member of the Fianna Fáil Party who understands the importance of telling the truth in public life.  It appears there is not a single member of the Fianna Fáil Party who understands the essential primacy of Parliament and the need to ensure that things said in the Dáil by Government Ministers and by the Taoiseach are true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is not simply about Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister for Defence, having a casual discussion with a student. This debate is about the fact that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Labour in succession misled this House as to events that took place years ago. For most people outside this House what took place in 1982 is largely of academic interest but it is of some importance to those of us who want to practice democracy here.  Many people outside this House regard it as being of historical interest.  What is of importance is whether people who are currently in Government can be relied on to tell the truth.  What we have seen during the past very strange and bizarre eight days is that <Col N="642" /> the people who are in Government at present cannot be relied upon to tell the truth.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his contribution today gave a very guarded and ambivalent account of events.  It is noticeable what he omits from his speech as opposed to what he includes.  He does not deny that he phoned Áras an Uachtaráin in 1982.</P>

      <P>He does not deny that Deputy Lenihan, the current Minister for Defence, phoned Áras an Uachtaráin in 1982.  All he says now about that is that he thinks the Tánaiste did not speak to the President.  We have a different account of that on Mr. Duffy's tape.  The Taoiseach did not have the grace to come into this House and admit that last week when he accused Deputy FitzGerald of lying he was misleading the House, and very deliberately so, by trying to throw up some sort of parliamentary smoke-screen to cover up the gaffe and the untruths that had taken place during the course of the Presidential election campaign. A bigger man, a man who had a commitment to telling the truth, would have come before the House today and said: &ldquo;When I attacked Deputy FitzGerald last Thursday I was wrong; I made a mistake&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I put down this question to the Taoiseach because I was particularly impressed by the way in which the West German Government were able to accommodate the assimilation of East Germany.  I understand that Chancellor Kohl appointed a Minister of State who was responsible for the social and economic development of ties between East and West Germany.  Surely the Taoiseach would find that very useful in view of the partitionist mentality in this State?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All the questions arise from my visit.</P>
      <P>I attended the World Summit for Children in New York on 29-30 September. The purpose of the Summit was to mobilise political commitment at the highest level to improve the welfare of the world's children.  Over 70 Heads of State or Government attended, making it the largest ever gathering of world leaders. Ireland contributed £100,000 for the Summit and related activities.</P>
      <P>The Summit adopted a World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the nineties and a plan of action which elaborates on the principles contained in the declaration. Both documents focus on urgent objectives in coming years such as entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and universal coverage of immunisation programmes for preventable killer diseases.  Given the particularly precarious situation of children in the Third World, the documents highlight the need for concrete action to improve basic health, education and other social services.  The Government will take the provisions of the declaration and plan of action fully into account in determining their international and domestic policies.</P>
      <P>This unique event was an outstanding success and will, I am confident, contribute in a significant way to the future well-being of the world's children.</P>
      <P>During my attendance at the Summit I signed, on behalf of Ireland, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  A detailed examination of the terms of this convention, to identify whether domestic legislative measures are necessary to enable us to proceed rapidly to ratify it, is now under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other official business during my visit to New York included discussions with the Italian Prime Minister and current President of the European Council, Mr. Andreotti, and with former President Nyerere of Tanzania.  My discussions with Mr. Andreotti covered matters of mutual interest in the European Community with particular reference to political union and economic <Col N="646" /> and monetary union as well as developments on the international political situation. My discussions with Dr. Nyerere covered the main issues facing the developing countries at the present time.</P>
    <P>I also met the recently elected President of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in the US, Mr. George Clough Jr., for an exchange of views on matters of concern to the Irish-American community.</P>
    <P>The total cost of my visit was £10,700 approx.  I was accompanied by seven people, including two Irish children nominated by the Irish National Committee of UNICEF who participated in the activities of the Summit.  The inclusion of the children in the official party was in response to a proposal from the Summit organisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Taoiseach for his answer.  Will he confirm to the House that what he has told us is misleading because all that Ireland has done is to sign the Book of Intent to ratify the convention on the Rights of Children?  My information is that we are not yet in a position to sign the convention because we do not have the necessary domestic legislation.  Will the Taoiseach also indicate to the House what he intends to do to allow Ireland to ratify the convention, with particular reference to one of the Articles which calls on the Government to provide for proper care and attention for children who have been removed from their homes for their own protection, such as children now in detention with no proper places?  I am particularly concerned that the Taoiseach will not mislead us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that we signed the convention, as I said in my reply.  I also said in my reply that a detailed examination of the terms of the convention is now under way to identify whether domestic legislative measures are necessary to enable us to proceed rapidly to ratify the convention.  We have signed it and the next step is ratifying it. We are examining all our legislation to see if any more is necessary to enable us to ratify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the main principles of the convention, which I understand are the survival, development, protection and participation of children in society and in view of the fact that the Taoiseach has already mentioned the appalling deaths of children in the Third World, do the Government propose to increase the ODA contribution from Ireland in pursuit of the objective of the convention?  Does the Taoiseach intend to indicate how soon the examination of Irish law will be concluded and when he expects the convention to be ratified by Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the second point, I do not think it will take very long &mdash; we do not have any great problems in that regard &mdash; to ratify the convention but we are just going through all our legislation to make sure.  What was the Deputy's first question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It was about the level of Ireland's overseas development aid contribution which clearly has a major impact on chldren's survival in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it would have been more appropriate to have a detailed examination of our <Col N="648" /> legislation before signing this intent to ratify the convention instead of after it? Will he give an indication of the areas where modifications or extensions to our legislation might be needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I indicated in my reply I do not think there will necessarily be any but this is normal procedure. You sign a convention and then, if necessary, legislate to enable you to ratify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get clarification on two aspects in relation to the declaration.  The first is where part of the ambition was to establish the right to read and write.  Will the Taoiseach accept that massive resources will be required to achieve this?  The second aspect is in relation to the target to have a universal immunisation programme for children. Will the Taoiseach give me some indication as to what extra resources will be provided by the Government to help UNICEF achieve both or either of these very important programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy the figure at the moment but I can inform him, as I have already informed Deputy De Rossa, that the question of the contribution to UNICEF in 1991 is under active examination at the moment in connection with the Estimates.  What was the other point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that Ireland will not be in a position to ratify this convention until such time as we have provided proper domiciliary care and so on for juveniles who are presently before our courts and for homeless children?  Will the Taoiseach further clarify what proposals he has to ratify another element of the convention which calls for care for children and allows parents, both mother and father, to go to <Col N="649" /> work?  One of the clauses calls for proper care for children.  Does the Taoiseach propose to introduce a scheme of creches or child-minding services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should understand that ratification is a matter for legislation.  If ratification involved providing all the things that are called for in the convention, and a plan of action, where necessary, for ratification, very few countries would be able to ratify it. What ratification is concerned with is agreeing to provide what is necessary in legislation.</P>

In Question No. 5, I asked if there was any discussion between him and Mr. Andreotti concerning the amalgamation of the WEU and the EC, if that was discussed what conclusions did the Taoiseach arrive at and if the Taoiseach will clarify the Government's position after the statement made by the Minister for <Col N="650" /> Foreign Affairs which I understand is purported to indicate that the Government are prepared to consider involvement in such discussions?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>In her speech of 26 September Minister of State Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn referred to the gap between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> equality for women which exists in all Western countries, including those, like Ireland, whose equality legislation conforms to the highest standards of the United Nations and the European Community.</P>
      <P>It is precisely because the Government recognise that there are also considerable attitudinal and cultural barriers to women being able to play a full role in society on the basis of equality or equal opportunity and our desire to see them eliminated that we decided to establish a second commission on the Status of Women. The members of the commission have recently been appointed.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the commission are: (i) to review the implementation of the recommendations of the first Commission on the Status of Women as set out in that commission's report to the Minister for Finance in December 1972; (ii) to consider and make recommendations on the means, administrative and legislative, by which women will be able to participate on equal terms and conditions with men in economic, social, political and cultural life and, to this end, to consider the efficacy and feasibility of positive action measures; (iii) in the context of (ii) above, to pay special attention to the needs of women in the home; (iv) to establish the estimated costs of all recommendations made; and (v) to report to the Government within a period of 18 months from the date of its establishment. The commission, which has Miss Justice Mella Carroll as its distinguished Chairwoman, will hold their first meeting this week &mdash; in fact tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The commission have a budget of £25,000 in this, their first year of operation, and will for their duration continue to be funded at a level sufficient for them to work efficiently and effectively.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I am pleased that at least my question seems to have facilitated the announcement of the formation of the commission, which occurred just a week before the question was due to be replied to last week.  Nonetheless, it is welcome that it has been formed and that the terms are such that they will enable the commission to address the issue regarding women. While emphasising the question of addressing the position of women in the home, will the commission also address the position of women at work outside the home, because, according to the report on which Minister Geoghegan-Quinn based her remarks, by the end of this decade four out of every ten workers will be women.  Clearly facilities and assistance will be required both for men and women to alter their roles in the home and to find a role in the workforce.</P>

Therefore, it applies to all women.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputies is contained in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>There are four Bills at present before the Oireachtas which will implement commission reports.  These are the Criminal Law (Rape) Amendment Bill, 1988, the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1990, the Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, and the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Bill, 1990.  Work is at an advanced stage in regard to other reports.</P>
      <P>The commission have made a very large number of recommendations; for example, in the last three years they have published 12 reports and three consultation papers, of a very detailed kind. Each of these require careful examination in order to enable a decision to be taken.</P>
      <P>Deputies will, of course, appreciate that the introduction of legislation in this connection is a matter for the Government, and, consequently, it is somewhat misleading to speak of &ldquo;delays in implementing&rdquo; recommendations of the commission.</P>
      <P>Further, the Government have a large and urgent legislative programme, much of which is in areas not covered by commission reports: and they give the reports the appropriate priority taking account of these other legislative demands and limited resources.  Indeed, in their latest annual report the commission pointed out that they do not claim to have a monopoly of wisdom and do not expect all their recommendations to be implemented as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>The Government have no plans to abolish the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports which have yet to be acted <Col N="656" /> upon &mdash; (a) Report on Defective Premises; (b) Report on Nullity of Marriage; (c) Report on Offences Under the Dublin Police Acts and Related Offences; (d) Report on Minors' Contracts; (e) Report on the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters; (f) Report on the Liability in Tort of Minors and the Liability of Parents for Damage Caused by Minors; (g) Report on the Liability in Tort of Mentally Disabled Persons; (h) Report on Private International Law Aspects of Capacity to Marry and Choice of Law in Proceedings for Nullity of Marriage; (i) Report on Jurisdiction in Proceedings for Nullity of Marriage, Recognition of Foreign Nullity Decrees, and the Hague Convention on the Celebration and Recognition of the Validity of Marriages; (j) Report on the Service of Documents Abroad re Civil Proceedings &mdash; the Hague Convention; (k) Report on the Rule Against Hearsay in Civil Cases; (l) Report on Debt Collection: (1) The Law Relating to Sheriffs; (m) Report on Debt Collection: (2) Retention of Title; (n) Report on the Recognition of Foreign Adoption Decrees; (o) Report on Land Law and Conveyancing Law: (1) General Proposals; (p) Report on Land Law and Conveyancing Law: (2) Enduring Powers of Attorney; (q) Report on Child Sexual Abuse; (r) Report on Sexual Offences Against the Mentally Handicapped.</P>

      <P>On 8 October 1990, accompanied by the Minsters for Finance, Industry and Commerce and Labour, I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  On the same date, we met representatives of the employer organisations &mdash; the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federation of Irish Employers and the Construction Industry Federation.</P>
      <P>On 10 October 1990, accompanied by the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Food, Energy and Labour, I met representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society and Macra na Feirme.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the meetings was to discuss the scope and content of a programme for economic and social development to succeed the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which expires at the end of 1990 and to agree the arrangements for the detailed negotiations thereon.</P>
      <P>At the meetings, the social partners drew attention to areas which they felt should be discussed in the context of a new programme. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions submitted a document &ldquo;Ireland 1990-2000: A Decade of Development, Reform and Growth&rdquo; which I welcomed on behalf of the Government, as a very constructive input to the discussions.  In particular, I welcomed the concept of a ten-year strategy within which programmes for a period of years would be agreed.  At the meetings I outlined the Government's approach to a new programme.  In particular, it should:</P>
      <P>&mdash;cover all major economic and social areas,</P>
      <P>&mdash;continue the process of reducing the National Debt/GNP ratio,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;contain a commitment to reducing by 1993 the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent and to have a single upper rate and reflect the fact that severe adjustment will be necessary <Col N="661" /> in VAT and excise duties in the context of EC tax harmonisation,</P>
    <P>&mdash;stimulate continued increases in employment,</P>
    <P>&mdash;within budgetary possibilities, provide for improvement of social welfare, education, health and housing services,</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide for a combination of moderate pay increases with tax reliefs to increase take-home pay, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;contain a commitment to upholding the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy and contain a long term strategy for the development of agriculture and rural areas.</P>
    <P>Copies of the statements which issued after the meetings have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>It was agreed at the meetings that negotiations on a new programme should commence without delay.  Bilateral meetings, under the chairmanship of the secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, have already taken place between a group of secretaries of Government Departments and representatives of ICTU, employer bodies and farm organisations.  A number of working groups have been established with the social partners which are examining particular areas.</P>

First, we were all a bit disappointed that economic growth had not been translated into <Col N="662" /> jobs until we got the report of the Labour Force Survey which showed that employment to April of this year increased by 30,000.  There is also evidence now that emigration is falling very rapidly so there is no doubt that employment is now coming on stream.  In relation to the first programme, I have said again and again that between the actual pay increases provided for and the very substantial tax concessions, take home pay did increase very considerably in real terms, by between 7 per cent and 11 per cent, during the first programme.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach then if the problem facing a significant number of people in our society who are either without work and as a result living in poverty or on low pay will be addressed in any programme produced; in other words, is it the Government's intention to incorporate a minimum income concept in this agreement either by way of social welfare or by way of a minimum wage?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe in the concept of a minimum wage but I know that is a matter which is hotly discussed and debated in different societies.  My own view is that the balance of the argument is against it but I do not think we should attempt to pre-empt what ICTU in the working committees will come up with and discuss and I hope we will have good rapport on all these questions eventually.</P>

      <P>While we all applaud the list of objectives read out and welcome the fact that the Taoiseach is looking to achieve with the social partners a ten year strategy &mdash; I think that is a good thing &mdash; and that discussions are to commence immediately on a replacement for the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> would the Taoiseach not agree that one reason for the fall in emigration is the downturn in the economies of the United States and Britain and that this will have consequences for the budget of the Department of Social Welfare, in particular, next year which, in turn, will have <Col N="663" /> consequences for the Government's spending programme for next year and that before what are nowadays called meaningful discussions can be entered into the Book of Estimates will have to be published as this will be one of the key documents which will have to be referred to in the discussions on any future agreement?

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 27, 60, 62 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are deeply concerned about the plight of our citizens trapped in Kuwait and Iraq.  Since the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August, the safety and welfare of the over 400 Irish citizens in both countries has been and will continue to be a matter of very great concern to the Government.  In both countries all Irish citizens are safe. None has been detained as part of the &ldquo;human shield&rdquo;.  I can assure the House that everything that can be done is being done to tackle the problems caused to Irish citizens as a result of Iraq's actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset of the Gulf crisis, the Taoiseach and I have involved ourselves personally in the co-ordination of the national response to the plight of our citizens in Kuwait and Iraq.  As part of the EC Troika of Foreign Ministers, I visited a number of capitals in the Gulf area in the days following the invasion. The question of the welfare and safety of our citizens was specifically raised during my meetings with Arab leaders.  On my instructions, the Ambassador in Baghdad has made and will continue to make repeated and strongly worded protests to the Iraqi authorities from the Foreign Minister downwards about the situation of our citizens.  We have increased the staff of our Embassy in Baghdad &mdash; all of whom have worked tirelessly to obtain the right for all our citizens to leave Kuwait and Iraq and to make the necessary arrangements in the case of those <Col N="669" /> permitted to leave.  I very much regret therefore the recent unjustified decision of the Iraqi authorities to ask the First Secretary of the Embassy in Baghdad to leave Iraq.</P>
    <P>I have also been deeply involved in the discussions on this issue with my European Community colleagues.  At our meeting of 21 August, the Twelve member states warned Iraq that any attempt to harm or jeopardise the safety of any EC citizen would be considered as a most grave offence directed against the Community and all its member states and would provoke a united response from the entire Community.  Iraqi citizens have also been warned that they will be held personally responsible for any involvement in illegal action concerning the security and life of foreign citizens.</P>
    <P>In addition to the protests made to the Iraqi authorities on my behalf by our Ambassador in Baghdad, I myself at my meeting last month with the Iraqi Ambassador to Ireland, formally protested on behalf of the Government at Iraq's refusal to respect the rights of people under international law to travel freely, including the right of all Irish people to leave Iraq for the destination of their choice.  I informed him that such a denial of a basic human right was unacceptable and a breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iraq is a party.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to secure as many visas as possible for our citizens have resulted in 68 per cent or 79 citizens, who were in Kuwait after 2 August, returning home safely.  Of the remaining thirty citizens, four women and seven children could have availed of evacuation arrangements but have opted for the moment not to leave Kuwait.</P>
    <P>All of the 19 men in Kuwait are free to leave for Iraq but so far have chosen to remain.  Although the Embassy in Baghdad has been refused permission to make another consular visit to Kuwait, we keep in regular contact with our citizens through the valuable assistance given by those Western embassies still functioning there.  They are continuing to pass messages to the Irish co-ordinator in <Col N="670" /> Kuwait who in turn is in contact with our citizens there.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Kuwait invasion, we had almost 300 citizens living in Iraq, the largest group of whom were working for the Parc Hospital in Baghdad.  Our efforts to secure exit visas since then have resulted in 77 individuals being allowed to leave.  There are now 230 Irish citizens in Iraq including ten who have returned voluntarily.  In getting almost 20 per cent of our citizens out of that country, Ireland was the first country to be offered exit visas for the over 55 years of age category. We were the first to secure exit visas for many of our end of contract female employees.  The unique Presidential concession of freedom of movement for personnel of the Parc Hospital, subject to the hospital services being continued, should also be a major benefit to Irish citizens working in the hospital when seeking exit visas.  Overall almost 40 per cent or 157 Irish citizens who were trapped in Kuwait and Iraq after the 2 August invasion are now home safely.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the relatives of those stranded in Iraq and Kuwait are kept as fully informed as possible, I formalised the provision of information with the establishment of the Special Information Service on the Middle East.  The service collates all available information from our diplomatic missions, the European Community and other sources.  It provides up-to-date information to relatives &mdash; 12 hours a day, seven days a week.  My Department also readily agreed to provide a venue for the weekly meetings of the Gulf Relatives Support Group.  Senior officials of the Department have met with the group every week since the invasion to brief the relatives on the latest developments.  The Government have also provided to the Relatives Group an office with telephones, fax etc. for their exclusive use.  This is intended to enable relatives of people stranded in the Gulf to speak to others who are in a similar situation.</P>
    <P>Our recognition of the sense of helplessness many relatives feel is reflected in the willingness of both the Taoiseach and myself to meet the relatives committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> We have had a full discussion as to how the Government could assist the relatives in this most distressing situation for them. The meetings also provided an opportunity to explain what the Government were doing to seek the early return home of their family members.  The Taoiseach met the representation on 29 August and I met them on 11 September and again on 10 October.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of 11 September, I undertook to write to all the relatives to explain the reasons why no member of the Government could travel to Iraq in an effort to secure the safe return home of all our citizens in Kuwait and Iraq. Among the reasons set out in my letter of 14 September were the fact that the UN sanctions are specifically designed to isolate Iraq.  The holding of foreign nationals is being used by the Iraqis to blackmail individual countries to break that isolation and the solid front of international condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  The best way to prevent war is to adhere strictly to the EC and United Nations common approach against Iraq's breaches of international law.  It also offers the best hope for the protection and safe return home of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I also indicated in the letter that, for the same reasons of international solidarity, the Government would not encourage a visit to Iraq by members of the Oireachtas.  At my meeting with the relatives committee on 10 October, I reiterated that the Government could not approve a visit by members of the Oireachtas to Iraq.  At the same time, we are not in a position to stop such a visit. Such a visit has no official status.  It must therefore be regarded as strictly private. Accordingly any arrangements for the visit must be made by the Oireachtas members themselves.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the House can be assured that the Government are sparing no effort to secure the maximum possible number of exit visas.  It is, however, not within our power to bring our citizens home without the consent of the Iraqi authorities.  All pressure is being brought to bear to achieve this end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very full reply which the subject of the question warrants. From a diplomatic point of view the Minister set out the position quite clearly and it is very hard to argue with the logic of what he is saying.  Unfortunately there are people here who have sons and daughters, husbands and wives who are stranded in Iraq and cannot get exit visas.  Their reaction will not be the same and they need far more attention than the Minister has been giving them during the past few months.  It is regrettable that he did not meet them until six weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The relatives the Minister has met were not satisfied with the Minister's attitude at those meetings.  That is extremely regrettable.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is very hard for the relatives to understand why he will not agree to an all-party delegation going to Iraq when every night on television there are indications that other countries are sending high level diplomats or members of Parliament to Iraq to plead the case of their citizens who are being held hostage by the Iraqi authorities?  It appeared that a former British Prime Minister went not alone with the help of his Government but, according to rumour, the Government encouraged him to make the trip.  In those circumstances does the Minister not consider that there should be a much greater public relations effort on his part which should not be confined to Dublin?</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs are available to those relatives who live in or near Dublin but many of the PARC employees live at considerable distances from Dublin.  Does the Minister not consider that it would be more helpful to the relatives if an official of his Department would visit relatives in areas outside Dublin, such as Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford?  For many of the relatives it is a big expense to go to Dublin to see officials at St. Stephen's Green.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he did and others went from other countries. Regarding the possibility of an all-party delegation going to Iraq, I made very clear to the relatives groups our thinking on this matter.  When the Taoiseach met the relatives in August this question was raised by them and he clearly explained why it was not possible.  I did so again in September and October.  These relatives, for whom we provide every facility to meet on a weekly basis, are fully informed on everything that is happening in this respect.</P>
      <P>At the Summit meeting in Rome this weekend the Heads of State and Government decided that not only would we not promote or encourage parliamentary delegations from going to Iraq but we would discourage such delegations.  This is a very important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry is being somewhat unfair when he says that the services of the Department of Foreign Affairs are principally for the Dublin area.  That is not <Col N="674" /> so.  The Department of Foreign Affairs are in regular touch with the families. Officials take the initiative in ringing the families every couple of days.  If the Deputy wants a section of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Cork, Limerick or Galway for public relations purposes, that is another matter.  The services they are giving are excellent.  The groups of relatives the Taoiseach and I met in August, September and October understand the reason for the Government stand on this matter, but of course they have great concern for members of their families.  Many of us have personal friends and neighbours there and we all have that concern.  The Government and the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to make every effort possible to get our people home safely and quickly.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  I am conscious of the sensitivities of this matter, as are all other Deputies.  My party support the political stance of the Government in relation to Iraq and we share concern about Irish people in Iraq and Kuwait. Would the Minister confirm that Irish people in Kuwait are free to travel to Iraq if they so choose?  Are all Irish people fully aware of this and are all the relatives satisfied that this is the case?  The major concerns conveyed to me were by the relatives of people in Kuwait.  Will the normal courtesies which an Irish embassy abroad would give to any Irish citizen or Member of Parliament be extended to the Oireachtas Members who intend to go to Iraq tomorrow, barring a general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of whether Irish people in Kuwait are informed as to their position, the answer is yes.  I said in the course of my original reply that we have been refused permission for another consular visit.  During the course of the last consular visit our representative was arrested and held for a considerable period.  With regard to the proposed visit, which I discourage as I am bound to do having regard to the <Col N="675" /> communiqué from the special Rome summit on Sunday, if people do visit Iraq certainly the normal courtesies will be provided by our staff.  The staff are very busy but I would certainly hope that the normal facilities would be afforded to anybody visiting Iraq.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 26, 28, 33, 35, 37, 40, 41 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware from the answers to previous questions on Cambodia, on 7 February and 9 May, I continue to be deeply concerned about this issue.  As I explained, the core elements of Irish Government policy on Cambodia are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wish to see an immediate cessation of hostilities in order that a peaceful, just and negotiated settlement can be achieved which will allow the Cambodian people to choose their rulers in free, fair and internationally supervised elections. This settlement must be based on the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia.  We wish to see the ending of all forms of external military assistance to the belligerents and there <Col N="678" /> must be no return to power of the murderous Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.</P>
    <P>The international negotiations on the Cambodian conflict have continued throughout the summer and a considerable degree of progress has been achieved.  At their sixth meeting on 27-28 August in New York, the five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council reached final agreement on the framework for a settlement.  This comprises the following five sections.</P>
    <P>First, transitional arrangements regarding the administration of Cambodia during the pre-election period.  It is necessary during the sensitive period leading up to elections that Cambodian sovereignty be enshrined in a legitimate body which can be a source of authority and unity.  Therefore, it has been decided to establish a supreme national council &mdash; SNC &mdash; composed of individuals representative of the Cambodian people as a whole, to assume this role.  The SNC will represent Cambodia externally and occupy the Cambodian seat at the United Nations.  The SNC will delegate all necessary powers to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to ensure the effective implementation of the overall settlement. Second, military arrangements during the transitional period.  The enhanced United Nations role will require that UNTAC have a military component.  A ceasefire is of the utmost importance.  Once it takes effect the military component of UNTAC will supervise, monitor and verify the ceasefire and related measures.  Third, elections under United Nations auspices.  The people of Cambodia must be allowed to choose their rulers in absolutely free and fair elections.  The United Nations will be responsible for the organisation and conduct of free elections.  Fourth, human rights protection.  Deputies are fully aware of the gross human rights violations which were and continue to be inflicted on the Cambodian people.  Any settlement must guarantee the end of this nightmare.  The UN Human Rights Commission will continue its active monitoring of the human rights situation in <Col N="679" /> Cambodia and Fifth, international guarantees.  The states participating in the reconvened Paris Conference on Cambodia will call upon all other States to recognise and respect in every way the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability, neutrality and national unity of Cambodia and to refrain from any action inconsistent with these principles.</P>
    <P>The basic premise underlying the framework agreement worked out by the five Permanent Members of the Security Council is that the Cambodian people should be enabled to determine their own political future through free and fair elections, organised and conducted by the United Nations in a neutral political environment with full respect for the national sovereignty of Cambodia.  All the parties to the conflict have been called upon to exercise maximum restraint.</P>
    <P>The framework agreement specifically refers to the human rights abuses of the past and stipulates that there should be no recurrence.</P>
    <P>At a meeting held in Djakarta, Indonesia on 9 and 10 September the Cambodian parties accepted the framework agreement in its entirety as the basis for settling the Cambodian conflict.  They agreed to form the SNC with 12 members representative of all the Cambodian people.  They also agreed to elect Prince Sihanouk as Chairman of the SNC as its thirteenth member and that the SNC would occupy the seat of Cambodia at the United Nations.  On 12 September, I issued a statement welcoming both the framework set out by five Permanent Members of the Security Council and its acceptance by the Cambodian parties. On 18 September the Twelve member states of the European Community also issued a statement along similar lines.</P>
    <P>At a later stage difficulties arose in connection with the Chairmanship of the SNC.  These have not yet been resolved and the SNC has not yet nominated a delegation to the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>Other recent positive developments include the adoption by consensus of resolutions on Cambodia by the Security <Col N="680" /> Council on 20 September and by the General Assembly on 15 October.  Both resolutions endorsed the framework agreement and welcomed its acceptance by the Cambodian parties.  The absence of divisive and acrimonious debate, so prevalent in past years, signalled a major step forward in efforts towards achieving a genuine solution to the Cambodian tragedy.  The framework agreement now enjoys the unanimous support of the Security Council and the General Assembly.  This unanimity by the entire international community contributes an added impetus to the peace process.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a member of the UN Credentials Committee for the current session. In my reply to Questions on 9 May I outlined our position on the occupation of the Cambodian UN seat.  I stated that I found the position whereby the seat was occupied by the so-called National Government of Cambodia most unsatisfactory. I outlined two acceptable options regarding this state of affairs which might provide a suitable way forward.</P>
    <P>One option was that the seat be occupied by a delegation nominated by the Supreme National Council.  The second option was that the seat be left temporarily vacant.  The situation at the moment is that pending appointment of a delegation by the Supreme National Council the seat has been unoccupied since the session began and no credentials in relation to Cambodia have been submitted to the General Assembly.  I expect that credentials will in due course be submitted by the Supreme National Council which will at last provide for a Cambodian delegation made up of representative individuals of all shades of opinon among the people of Cambodia.  In the unlikely event that credentials are presented by the Coalition Government, the Irish delegation will oppose their acceptance both in the credentials Committee and in the General Assembly.</P>
    <P>I earnestly look forward to the day when the Cambodian seat will be occupied by a delegation of a freely-elected Government of Cambodia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Notwithstanding the positive developments which I have outlined, I remain gravely concerned about the Cambodian situation and the continuing hostilities on the ground which are inflicting terrible injuries and suffering on innocent Cambodians on a daily basis.  I am aware of allegations that arms from various sources have been finding their way to the Khmer Rouge.  I realise that it is extremely difficult to control the international traffic in arms.  I deplore any arms trafficking to the Khmer Rouge. But I believe that all the member states of the United Nations are sincere in their commitment to peace in Cambodia.  I urge, once again, all the Cambodian parties to cease hostilities and allow the momentum of the peace process to accelerate.</P>
    <P>It is imperative now that no time be wasted in implementating the steps set out in the framework for a comprehensive settlement.  I wish to see a speedy reconvening of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia as soon as circusmtances permit, in order that final agreement can be reached on the comprehensive settlement.  I call on all the parties to demonstrate flexibility at this vital stage of the negotiating process.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of Cambodia's need for long term development aid.  This need must be addressed in the context of the comprehensive peace settlement to which I have referred.  The Community stands ready to contribute to the reconstruction and development of Cambodia when this settlement has been achieved.</P>
    <P>There have been two major obstacles so far to a resumption of large-scale international aid to Cambodia.  The first was the presence of the Vietnamese occupying army.  The second was the fact that the administration in Phnom Penh &mdash; which was installed by the Vietnamese &mdash; is not recognised by the international community.  The first of these obstacles, subject to verification, has now been overcome.  We are still left with the second.</P>
    <P>I should mention that, at the EC Development Council last May, Minister of State Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn raised <Col N="682" /> with her colleagues the question of whether long term aid could be made available in advance of the establishment in Cambodia of an internationally recognised Government.  The general view expressed was that this would not be possible. I believe that this remains the case. However, there was general acceptance of the need for continued and, indeed, increased humanitarian aid.  The community &mdash; as well as the Irish Government &mdash; is continuing to provide such assistance through international agencies and non-governmental organisations. The UN also provides emergency aid to Cambodia.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Cambodian nightmare.  I cannot over emphasise the desirability of proceeding rapidly in order that the much needed economic and social reconstruction of Cambodia can commence.  I, for my part, will continue to do my utmost both in the community and the wider international arena to bring about the comprehensive and just settlement we all seek.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that very full reply.  I agree with his analysis of the situation.  For the first time for many years there is some light. However, there is a danger of it being quenched before anything comes on the horizon in Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Today's Question Time on Foreign Affairs demonstrates the necessity for a foreign affairs committee of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions are being asked on two very important subjects.  I do not quarrel with the length of the answer the Minister has given because the subject was so important they needed that kind of serious response.  I thank him for that. If certain things presumed to be happening later today have certain consequences where the people on the left move to the right and people on the right move to the left, let me make a promise on behalf of my party that we will establish a foreign affairs committee in this <Col N="683" /> House if we are in Government after the election.</P>
      <P>To comment on the last point the Minister made, things are changing in Vietnam and I would not rule them off the scene altogether.  Did the Minister say at an early stage that the UN, he and the EC are ruling out the possibility of any government being formed after elections in Cambodia with Khmer Rouge participation? That presents a problem if there are going to be free elections.  Has the Minister been asked for or would he volunteer observers from this House or from this country to make sure those elections are very open and overseen in the fairest and broadest possible way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barry when he says the situation in Vietnam is changing.  I refer the Deputy to a communiqué issued after the last meeting of European Political Co-operation in Luxembourg a week last Monday to the effect that the EC was establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam which will open the way for other things to flow which are very badly needed there.  For the last 12 months this country has played a prominent role in advocating that a relationship with Vietnam be established.  One or two countries had certain difficulties for other reasons, I would say reasons of leverage which in my view are totally unacceptable, but we pressed and we are pleased that it has now been established.  I agree with Deputy Barry on that situation and we must help them too.  I think we helped them; we said the problem of the boat people must be tackled at home rather than abroad.  You do not solve the problem by sending people home against their will.  There were many suicides and many people did terrible things to themselves in an effort not to be sent home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the future government of Cambodia, the only criteria that can be accepted by the international community are that the elections be conducted in a free and fair way and that the will of the people be expressed through the ballot box.  If the question arises as to whether observers from this House or this country <Col N="684" /> should be nominated, I would support such a request but it is a matter for the Government to decide.  In recent times we have been very much to the forefront trying to get people of like mind on the Cambodian issue to come together and talk.  As the Deputy knows, we have been involved with the Australian initiative from the beginning and through the ASEAN group in Djakarta.  The major breakthrough there, as Deputy Barry knows and has already acknowledged in this House, was at the EC-ASEAN meeting in Kuching last February when we put it on the line to them there that we were not prepared, not alone as Ireland did on its own last year, to co-sponsor the ASEAN resolution on Cambodia but this time we were prepared to vote against it and vote against the seating of a Cambodian delegation in the format as it has been up to now.  If the question of observers to see that the elections meet the criteria we want to see in operation arises, I would be prepared to recommend it.</P>

Secondly, has the Minister raised with the US, the UK, the Belgian and German Governments the disquieting reports that all four of these Governments have been assisting through either training or arms in keeping the Khmer Rouge fighting in Cambodia?

      <P>My question addressed the circumstances that might arise, and if the increased activity of a military kind of the Khmer Rouge on the ground, assisted from outside, might restrict the developments of which the Minister spoke, and which are the UN initiative.  Have his Department been briefed on the present military situation? Will the Minister make a statement on it?  Very important, has he raised at the level of the Twelve the breach of accord they have managed on this occasion, unlike the Gulf, in supplying arms and advice training to Cambodian forces such as the Khmer Rouge?</P>

      <P>I am aware allegations are being made that humanitarian aid channelled through the UN border relief organisation ends up in the hands of the Khmer Rouge and these terrorists.  I am assured the UN do all in their power to ensure that aid reaches those in need in the border camps and do what they can to ensure that aid is not given in any way to the Khmer Rouge.</P>
      <P>With regard to the element of Deputy Higgins' question that deals with the supply of arms to and training of the Khmer Rouge, we had a discussion on this within EPC and this element was referred to because of its importance. There is a clear recognition by member states of their responsibilities in this respect.</P>

      <P>What restrictions, if any, exist in relation to humanitarian aid both in terms of the agencies providing it and the areas within Cambodia which are getting it?  In view of the recent UN decision, will he not accept that the embargo which had been applied in relation to aid to Cambodia no longer exists and, therefore, that it will be in order for the UN and the EC to initiate development aid to Cambodia as a matter of urgency in order to save lives and to shorten the misery of the people in Cambodia?</P>

In addition .572 million ECU was provided for various projects operated by non-governmental organisations.

      <P>As I understand it, an embargo in relation to aid existed until recently.  My information is that there are $10 million in United Nations aid waiting to be distributed and that it was being held up because of the United Nations' own embargo; that as a result of the recent decision by the United Nations that embargo no longer applies and therefore they should be free to distribute it, and it should be done as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying, Sir, when we adjourned for lunch, that for many people the events that took place in 1982 that have been so well written about in the last week or so are largely academic and that the question of immediate concern is the credibility today of Government Ministers and the credibility of what they said last week.  There is a danger that we regard those events as too academic. Their significance, of course, was that there was an extraordinary failure in constitutional probity on the part not just of the Tánaiste but also on the part of the Taoiseach and on the part of former Deputy Sylvester Barrett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say, Sir, that one listens with <Col N="765" /> regret to the type of speeches that we have been subjected to from the Fianna Fáil side where it has been said that the Tánaiste has been smeared.  Deputy Burke, the Minister for Justice, used the extraordinary language I am talking about: &ldquo;deceit, baiting and slander&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>None of these problems, however, would have arisen if the Tánaiste, on the now famous &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme, had simply said in reply to the question that telephone calls had been made to the Park; that he was amongst those who made the calls; that this was done in the heat of the moment and that he recognises now that what was done should not have been done; that President Hillery was right in not taking the calls, or that he was right in ticking him off when he spoke to him, as was suggested in the Jim Duffy interview; that if he was President he would not take such calls either and that he would behave in the same way as President Hillery behaved.  If the Tánaiste had said that we would have no issue, and none of the problems of the Government in the last week would have been experienced.  If, after the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme the Tánaiste at that stage had a recollection, be it a mature recollection or otherwise, and said that he was mistaken in the reply he had given, or if the Taoiseach had not misled the House last Thursday, or if the Minister for the Environment had not misled the House last Thursday we would not be in the bind we are in now.</P>
    <P>Talk of smears is total nonsense.  The Tánaiste will go down in history as the first person to achieve the amazing feat of smearing himself as opposed to being smeared by anyone else.  It is most regrettable that the Taoiseach, in his reply, conducted a disgraceful attack on someone who is not even a Member of this House.  In the phrase used by the Taoiseach in reference to Mr. Duffy, &ldquo;who we are supposed to believe was doing no more than researching a thesis&rdquo;, the implication is that he was doing something else.  As the Taoiseach well knows, Mr. Duffy spoke to a number of <Col N="766" /> Members of this House and taped interviews with them.  It seems that because what the Tánaiste put on tape does not fit his current recollection of what took place in 1982 that it is Mr. Duffy that the Taoiseach wishes to hold responsible for what has happened.  It goes back to the old approach that if one does not like the message one should shoot the messenger. That is not the approach one would expect to be taken by the Taoiseach on this issue at this stage.  Indeed, I suggest if that particular extract from the Taoiseach's speech was uttered outside this House, Mr. Duffy would probably have a sound action for defamation.</P>
    <P>The problem we have is that it appears that the Fianna Fáil Party in general, the Taoiseach in particular, and indeed the Tánaiste have no concept of the need for truthfulness in public office when replying to questions on matters of significant importance.  Outside this House on the issue of whether or not politicians tell the truth, we are all tarred with the one brush.  &ldquo;You are all the same&rdquo; is the reaction one gets when one talks about politicians and trustworthiness and truthfulness. I absolutely reject that.  The problem that not just my party but the other parties on this side of the House have is that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil have given politics and politicians here a bad name by their view that it does not matter what one says, that one says whatever fits the moment and one can say the opposite the following week to deal with the following week's crisis.  It has created a crisis of credibility.  There is a credibility gap with regard to what politicians say and what the people of the country believe.  That credibility gap is particularly dangerous in a democracy because it is turning young people away from politics, from participation in politics and from acknowledging the importance of the democratic system that we have.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach and members of the Government cannot be believed when they respond to queries on this issue, how can they be believed when they give responses to other issues?  If untruthful answers had been given to try to sort out <Col N="767" /> Fianna Fáil's difficulties in regard to the Presidential election on events that took place in 1982, how can we now believe what the Taoiseach says about the background to the Goodman scandal?  How can we now believe what the Taoiseach says when this Government avoid addressing the issues created by the problems of the Gallagher group, and indeed fail to give reasons why prosecutions are not being brought?  Why is it, Sir, that when major problems of this nature arise, they become issues of the moment for a few weeks?  They might star for a few days in the media and then disappear out of sight.  There is no true accountability and what Government Ministers say is often not believable.</P>
    <P>There were great headlines some months ago about the Dublin planning scandal.  For a year and a half we are told an investigation has been undertaken in fits and starts into the problems of bribery in the planning system in the city and county of Dublin and which we are told in media reports may have affected An Bord Pleanála.  Yet in a year and a half we found it impossible to get a comprehensive statement from the Minister for Justice or the Minister for the Environment as to what is happening in that area.  Is there a scandal?  Are there prosecutions to be brought?  If we are told anything about it, will we believe what the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, or the Minister for Justice, Deputy Ray Burke, says on those issues?</P>
    <P>In no other democracy in the European Community would there be a lingering planning scandal alleged in the media for a year and a half, and a Government evading coming into the Houses of Parliament to account for what is happening. We drift from one public scandal to another.  This Government have now reached the stage where they need to be called to account, not just for the untruthfulness of what was said in this House last week but for their failure to fully and comprehensively account for a whole series of public issues on which <Col N="768" /> they have been evading facing up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, in what was the nearest thing to a soap box election speech, an after Mass speech, that we have heard so far from any of the Fianna Fáil contributors, talked about the record of the Government, and indeed the Taoiseach sought to do that as well.  In so far as this Government have a good economic record, it is because Fine Gael ensured they behaved themselves in the economic area and I suppose in fairness to them, the Progressive Democrats may have kept them under control to some extent as well, but this Government have a rotten record in other areas.</P>
    <P>The health service is still in a state of near collapse.  There are appalling queues of people waiting for heart by-pass operations. How many people will lose their lives because the health service cannot provide heart by-pass operations with the speed with which they are required? There is a total absence of necessary facilities in particular for the adult mentally handicapped, an area this Government have turned their backs on.  The overcrowded classrooms are now becoming part of a renewed campaign by teachers and parent organisations.  The Taoiseach sought to clap himself on the back about this Government's environmental achievements.  We have big lies in politics and we have little lies.  We had the lie about this time last year when the Government opposed the Fine Gael Bill to establish an environment protection agency and promised they would produce a bigger and better Bill, but what has happened?  The Government voted down the Fine Gael legislation to provide an environmental agency that we badly need but have not yet introduced legislation in that area.</P>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach wondered when did his Government promise local government reform.  He had to be reminded that his Government promised local government reform when postponing the local government elections last June, but that was last June and it did not matter when it came to the autumn.  Last week the Taoiseach forgot <Col N="769" /> about something else which now has very serious implications.  He forgot that there was a report of a constituency boundary commission for which legislation should have been introduced and which should have been brought before the House during this session to implement that commission's recommendations.  If we go to the country tonight we will be doing so with the old unreformed constituency boundaries for a second time.  This goes back to the attempt made by the Taoiseach and his party, including the Minister for the Environment, to, in effect, gerrymander the constituencies before the last general election.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of trust in this Government. They lack credibility and they do not deserve the confidence of this House. It is a very sad day that the Taoiseach came into this House today to bluff and bluster his way through what is a serious issue of confidence and credibility.  It is an even sadder day that he did it on foot of trying to blacken the name of someone who is not a Member of this House.  The Taoiseach's performance in this House today indicates his unfitness to remain Taoiseach of this country.</P>
    <P>We all know events are taking place outside this Chamber that may impinge on what happens to the Government within the next few hours.  I await the Progressive Democrat's contribution to this debate.  We know that Deputy O'Malley can tell us that more than one person phoned Aras an Uachtaráin in 1982.  I am asking Deputy O'Malley to come into this House and to put on the record whether persons, other than those who have already admitted making such phone calls, made them.  Deputy O'Malley was an insider and he had an inside track.  The Progressive Democrats have a constitutional duty to clarify exactly who is and who is not telling the truth.  Even if Deputy Lenihan decides to resign this evening, that leaves the Taoiseach and his conduct, not just in 1982 but in 1990 in misleading this House to be called for reckoning.  I believe the electorate will take a poor view of a Taoiseach who feels he can lie to the country whenever it suits him.</P>

      <P>The motion is that Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Government, and I have great pleasure in supporting that motion.  I am confident that this House will pass that motion this evening.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter talked about lies.  He is good at categorising big lies and little lies and I will not argue with him because I think he might know more about lies than I do.  In 1987 a Minister of the then Government came to Kingscourt in my constituency.  At that time there were only four seats in that constituency and Fianna Fáil were expected to lose a seat, in fact we took three out of four because what Deputy Deasy said was not believed.  He said the severely disadvantaged scheme would apply to the whole of Counties Cavan-Monaghan.</P>

      <P>Fit the moment of the day, mar dhea.  Deputy Shatter talked about telling things that fit the moment of the day.  Nothing could be more appropriate for a false and lying campaign than that statement in the middle of that election. How can we believe Deputy Shatter, who was a supporter of that Government, if he supports that kind of tactic in electioneering? People in my area whose livelihood depended upon that scheme were fooled by a Minister of that Government making that statement.  I did not believe a word Deputy Deasy said then and I do not believe a word Deputy Shatter said now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I would address myself to the general motion before the House, that of confidence in the Government.  I submit that a Government that have presided over and instigated a 4 per cent growth for four years are a Government that should get the confidence of the House. A Government that put economic policies in motion for lowering interest rates and now have interest rates lower than the European average deserve the confidence of the House.  The strong investment that is apparent all around us &mdash; north, south, east and west &mdash; is also an <Col N="771" /> indication that this House should vote confidence in the Government.  A balance of payments surplus for four years is another indication that we are worthy of the confidence of the House and of the nation.  In the inflation field we are an exemplar for Europe Government borrowing is down to 2 per cent of gross national product.  That is a significant achievement in itself, and one that is interlinked with a lot of the other points I am making and one that indicates to investors that this is a safe country to invest in.</P>
    <P>Emigration is falling.  That is a very happy thing for me to recount because I am probably one of the very few Members who, with four other members of my family, had to emigrate some years ago.  I am happy to say that all five came back and are now trying to make a living in this country.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in employment of 40,000, which is also an indicator that we deserve the confidence of this House and this country.  We are striving to reduce personal taxation and have done so.  Indirect taxation has also been reduced.  Tourism has been promoted as it never was before, and with outstanding success.  I will give two figures in relation to the construction industry, in 1990 there was an increase of 8.8 per cent and an increase of 10.8 per cent in 1989.  The industry is employing people and builders are busy.</P>
    <P>When the economic history of this period is written, my submission is that the social consensus &mdash; between the workers, trade unions, employers, farmers and the Government &mdash; will be seen as the greatest achievement, economically, of this century.  I know very good Governments &mdash; Socialist Governments &mdash; who tried to get it right.  Señor Felipe Gonzalez in Spain, a country of which I am a student, tried to get Señor Redondo and Señor Gutierrez to back him in a similar programme last year but failed.  We succeeded in doing it and we are <i>en route</i> to another plan for social and economic development.  On that account alone, this House should vote confidence <Col N="772" /> in the Government and I know that the people, if they get an opportunity, will do so.  The new programme is being put together now and I know that all thinking people in trade unions, employer and farmer organisations &mdash; and certainly in Government &mdash; are determined that the new programme will be put in place.</P>
    <P>We are providing the infrastructure for the development of the fishery industry. The ice plants at Dunmore East, Clogher Head, Ballyglass, Rossaveal, Kilmore Quay and additional capacity at Dingle and Killybegs, will aid the fishery industry. There are plans for a £20 million investment in harbours at Killybegs, Rossaveal, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth, plus 17 others.  We are investing in them because we have confidence in the fishery industry and I submit that the industry has confidence in the Government as a result.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of opening a processing factory in Boyle, County Roscommon, and another one, Clayton Love, in Church Street, Dublin.  The European Community has confidence in that industry and in the Government which was proved when they allocated £4 million for the development.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute Bill is on its way though this House, having passed through the Seanad, to develop our research agency and it will unify research and fisheries in one institution.  We have also strengthened the Fisheries Research Centre in Abbottstown.  Next week Deputies will find an Inland Fisheries Bill in their post based on co-operation and on the fact that we expect the beneficiaries to contribute to the development of this very valuable resource.</P>
    <P>Pollution control is a very important factor which is linked to fisheries and environmental development generally. We have taken very strong measures to control pollution throughout the country and I am happy that Lough Sheelin, one of the great trout lakes in Europe, is back in business this season.  We are committed to the development of aquaculture with the highest environmental standards possible.  There are 650 people working full time in aquaculture, 350 part-time <Col N="773" /> workers and about 1,750 employed in downstream activities in this industry. That is in peripheral coastal areas where no other industry could be induced to set up shop.  It is worth £45 million per annum to the economy.  We only produce about 6,000 tonnes of farmed salmon per annum.  Scotland produce 30,000 and Norway &mdash; with a smaller population than this country &mdash; produce 150,000 tonnes. There is plenty of scope for development in this area in accordance with the new provision for environmental impact assessment in all cases where that development is to take place.</P>
    <P>The legislation in regard to foreshore and beach protection is inadequate and I am ensuring that we will introduce an almost total ban on the large scale removal of sand from our beaches.</P>
    <P>I have announced a new structure in the search and rescue service.  It is a subject for confidence in the House that a helicopter, with the capacity for rescuing 15 people at a 200-mile range, will be based at Shannon.  There will be three fully equipped regional rescue sub-centres at Valencia, Malin Head and Dublin and the new division in my Department will deal with that whole area.  The marine VHF radio system was extended to all coasts by the construction of seven new VHF radio stations.  The coast radio stations have been fully computerised and control equipment updated.  Six cliff rescue units have been fully equipped and trained and the coast and cliff rescue service has been modernised and equipped with up-to-date communications and rescue equipment.  All these initiatives in the search and rescue area will make a real contribution to the saving of lives.  I ask the House to take that into consideration when they are deciding whether they will vote confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>Dumping has been dealt with by legislation and there is a Bill regarding sea pollution.  With regard to shipping, as a result of Government grants and participation in the business expansion scheme, I can report to the House that there has been an increase in tonnage in our shipping from 141,926, in 1986 to <Col N="774" /> 183,500, in 1990.  I am proud of that fact and I also submit it as a reason for the House voting confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a £60 million package for the development of commercial harbours but I do not have time to go into the details; £7.5 million has been allocated in Exchequer grants since 1987 and invested in our fishery harbours.  I announced a programme of development for Killybegs, Rossaveal, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and others of £20 million in the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>I have legislation ready in relation to vessels carrying 12 passengers or under. We are developing Dún Laoghaire Harbour since we took it in charge on 1 January 1990.  As the House knows, the Government voted £3 million for dealing with damage done by last winter's storms. A grant of £950,000 has also been made available for the north beach, Arklow.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in Deputy Lenihan. I have known him for many years and I followed him in a number of Departments in which he served.  I admire his <i>bonhomie,</i> exuberance and humanitarianism. I contested the nomination with him at a time when the Presidency was being derided and denigrated by other parties.  I am proud to back him for an office for which I have great respect.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael candidate had to be press-ganged into taking the nomination and, as a fellow Ulsterman I have sympathy for him.  He is a pawn in the power play for ascendancy in the Fine Gael Party, the people know it and show it by the amount of support they are prepared to give him.</P>
    <P>The question of ethics has been posed. I ask a serious question regarding ethical priority and the head of the Politics Department in University College, Dublin, must answer it.  Does he stand over the circus act in the Westbury Hotel and the breaking of a commitment in the name of his Department?  The letter heading was &ldquo;Politics Department, University College, Dublin&rdquo;, and it read, &ldquo;to clear statements before publication&rdquo;.  We have all helped students under these commitments and those commitments have <Col N="775" /> been honoured.  Can we with confidence, help students in future?</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dukes is as interested in education as he claimed this morning, let him look to the answer to this question. I am confident that this House will, on reflection, vote confidence in this Government.  I am also confident that the Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be elected President of Ireland on 7 November. I am equally confident that if we have to face a general election Fianna Fáil will be returned to office as a result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want at the outset to put on the record the facts about my role in the events that led to this crisis. Some weeks ago I prepared a speech on the constitutional role of the President in relation to issues such as the dissolution of the Dáil.  It did not appear at that time.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, 21 October, I was asked to participate in the forthcoming &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme.  I agreed to do so on the basis that I would seek to raise and emphasise these issues relating to this constitutional role of the President and I asked that in so far as we could influence the shape of the questions in the programme this issue should be raised.</P>
      <P>I noted that since I had written that speech Brian Lenihan had denied that he had rung the President on that occasion saying &ldquo;I wasn't involved.  I didn't do it, not personally&rdquo;.  No one had ever to my knowledge alleged that he had rung the President as distinct from Áras an Uachtaráin, but in the light of his statement it seemed to me that it would be counter-productive to get involved with him in an argument on TV on what in fact he had done that night.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, decided to make no such allegation during the programme and I adhered to this, as the tape of the programme shows.  When Brian Lenihan pointed out that no dissolution had ever been refused by a President, however, I interjected in a general question &ldquo;Why the seven phone calls to try to force him to exercise it?&rdquo;  The eighth call that night seems to have come from Deputy Loftus rather than from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To this Brian Lenihan replied &ldquo;That's fictional, Garret&rdquo;.  I called back on the spur of the moment &ldquo;It is not fictional &mdash; excuse me &mdash; I was in Áras an Uachtaráin when those phone calls came through and I know how many there were&rdquo;.  I should have said that &ldquo;I was in Áras an Uachtaráin the night those phone calls came through&rdquo; and on the following day I corrected this on television on the lunchtime <Col N="777" /> news as reported in the next day's <i>Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>I am not saying I was in the building; I am saying that my recollection is that I was told these telephone calls were made possibly before I arrived.</P>
    <P>I was most concerned that the momentary slip should be put right at once and that I should mislead nobody, as I have always limited myself on this issue to saying what I recall &mdash; that when I arrived at the Áras there had been a number of phone calls, and when I left I was told there had been eight and I was told who made them, and among the names mentioned was Deputy Lenihan.  That is all I know on the subject.  I have never said more than that.  I was very anxious to ensure that I put the record right and misled no one.</P>
    <P>On returning home late on Monday night after the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme I was interviewed by a journalist from RTE who started to ask me why I had accused Brian Lenihan of ringing that night.  When I denied that I had done so on the programme she drew my attention to the fact that the speech I had prepared several weeks earlier before Brian Lenihan had made his denials had been issued by Fine Gael, of which I had until then been quite unaware.  That was my involvement.  No plot &mdash; no trap.</P>
    <P>The fact is that no one except Brian Lenihan has ever said that he spoke to the President on that night.  What has been alleged is that he, the Taoiseach and Sylvester Barrett rang the Áras that night, and it is his specific denial of this in respect of himself on the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme that has created the present situation.</P>
    <P>A question was put to him later in the programme &mdash; not by me and not inspired by me, for the reasons I have given.  The questioner said he wanted to ask Deputy Lenihan, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Did he make a phone call or phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin... when the then Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald was seeking the dissolution of the Dáil....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> To which he answered &ldquo;No, I did not at all.  That never happened.&rdquo;  Following this denial I remarked sarcastically &ldquo;It seems to me that those phone calls were made by people who imitated the voices of leaders of the Opposition&rdquo;.  I should have known better, after a quarter of a century in the Oireachtas, than to attempt to introduce a note of humour into a matter of this kind.  There followed a denial by P. J. Mara on behalf of the Taoiseach.  He said, according to <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>Neither the Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, the Tánaiste, Mr. Lenihan nor the former Minister, Mr. Sylvester Barrett had telephoned Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>
    <P>This denial on behalf of the Taoiseach and Government has not been withdrawn despite the fact that Mr. Barrett has admitted that he phoned and that it is no longer in doubt that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste also phoned Áras an Uachtaráin on that night.</P>
    <P>Politicians in and out of Government often seek to evade questions, choosing their words with care so as not to depart from the truth but they insert an adjective or an adverb to qualify what has been alleged.  Journalists do not always, nor do Deputies on the other side of the House, note these adjustments in the replies, but they are made in order to adhere to the truth because politicians, contrary to what I am afraid has become a depressingly widespread belief, do not lie.  They will try to avoid disclosing, by various formulations, the truth, and if they are not cross-examined and cross-questioned sufficiently, they may get away with it whether in the Dáil or outside, but they do not lie.</P>
    <P>Throughout my political life I have carefully examined statements made by politicians from other parties and I have watched carefully and I can say that I cannot offhand recall lies.  I am sorry, I should not say that.  In the more distant past I can recall an occasion, and I have no intention of going back over it, but certainly, over many years I have known that politicians will be vague but I have <Col N="779" /> not heard politicians lie.  Such lies are new and unacceptable in Irish politics. Lies include allegations against political opponents that those who make them know to be false &mdash; such as the allegations by Fianna Fáil in a document of theirs about Mary Robinson, who is not a candidate of my party in this election and whom I do not support in the election. However I will not tolerate lies being told about people.  The document says that she represents those who tried to foist abortion on the Irish people.  This Fianna Fáil circular was issued on 29 October.  It asked &ldquo;Do you as a Fianna Fáil member want to see someone other than a Fianna Fáil person President of Ireland?&rdquo;  Perish the thought.  It goes on &ldquo;Do you want as a President a lady who represents those who tried to foist abortion among other undesirable things on the Irish people? I have no doubt that the answer is an emphatic no.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is not a smear. That is said by someone who knows it is a lie.  One cannot conduct any political campaign on the basis of lies.</P>
      <P>My prime and passionate concern in public life has been for integrity.  I learned the importance of integrity from my parents &mdash; from my father whose integrity was never challenged and from my mother who, despite her husband's views in favour of the Treaty, rejected it unequivocally because she would not allow her loyalty &mdash; a much abused word by those on the benches opposite &mdash; to him to deflect her from following her principles.</P>
      <P>I accept that concern for integrity is unpopular, and is seen as priggish and self-righteous by some, but only some, elements in Fianna Fáil.  The Irish people must reject this and, if given the opportunity at the end of this debate, will reject these constant attempts to dismiss as irrelevant and unimportant the obligation of politicians in or out of Government to tell the truth &mdash; the sole basis on which democratic politics can be carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> If at the end of this debate &mdash; and as I speak that end is still uncertain &mdash; the Dáil is dissolved as a result of the withdrawal of confidence from the Government by this House, I will not be standing for re-election, as I announced at the time of the general election last year.</P>
    <P>I have been proud to be a Member of this House, as my father was before me. I am, I think, the last representative in this House of the second generation of those who brought our country independence 70 years ago.  I am proud to have been given by the Irish people and the Dáil the opportunity to serve Ireland as Minister for Foreign Affairs and as Taoiseach.  I am proud to have played a part in Ireland's entry to the European Community and in the establishment of a positive Irish role in its evolution.  I am proud to have had the opportunity, with staunch colleagues from my party and from Labour, to undo the damage of Fianna Fáil's profligate increase of 50 per cent in the volume of public spending and their trebling of the national debt in the years after 1977.</P>
    <P>I am proud to have had the opportunity to move this State away from the counter-productive policy of seeking reunification of Ireland without the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland and to have initiated the Forum for a new Ireland and negotiated and signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.  If at the end of this evening it transpires that I have contributed to precipitating &mdash; even if accidentally &mdash; a general election on the issue of integrity in public life, I shall be proud that this issue may have proved to have been my own swan song.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen in the past week a most disgraceful smear campaign engineered by Fine Gael, the self-styled party of holier than thou righteousness &mdash; which again has been recited to us here this evening by Deputy Garret FitzGerald and supported by The Workers' Party and the Labour Party.  Fine Gael boasted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 27 October 1990 how they planned to set a trap for Deputy Brian Lenihan but using <Col N="781" /> the political research department at UCD where, by convenient coincidence, Senator Maurice Manning is strategically placed.  It is certainly no coincidence that material which was gathered not for direct political use but as a background thesis should suddenly be made available as part of Fine Gael's desperate attempt to survive as a political party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan, at a time when he was not fully recovered from an illness which almost took his life and when he was still under medication, generously gave his time to a student, Mr. Jim Duffy, to help him in his work.  It is now patently obvious that the portion of the conversation dealing with the defeat of the FitzGerald Government in 1982 was in many respects inaccurate.  Had Mr. Duffy sent a copy of his tape to Deputy Brian Lenihan subsequently, he would most certainly have corrected it.  On &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, the beleaguered Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Alan Dukes, in the omnipotent manner so typical of Fine Gael said he did not believe a word of Deputy Brian Lenihan's solemn declaration that he did not telephone the President but that he did believe every word on the tape.  How does he reconcile this with the fact that President Hillery did not speak to any one from Fianna Fáil that night?</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald told us that he, of course, made a mistake when he said he was in Áras an Uachtaráin when the call came through.  He has put it on the record that he should have said that he was there that night, the next night, the night after or some other night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy certainly was not there then.  He then said that he was &ldquo;told&rdquo;.  I would have thought that a man of the stature of Deputy FitzGerald would have gone on something more than hearsay when he entered such a serious challenge against a major Presidential candidate in the middle of a Presidential election.  I am afraid that was demeaning of the Deputy and his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> We now have the unprecedented situation where Opposition parties have tabled a motion of no confidence in the Government as part of a Presidential election campaign.  Never before has a so-called political crisis been deliberately engineered at such a time in a desperate effort to defeat a universally loved and respected candidate, having failed abysmally to overtake him by a series of personal attacks.</P>
    <P>The student involved has confirmed that he came under political pressure to release his research material at this time. Earlier Deputy Dukes said that the director for Fianna Fáil was looking for the information on the tapes.  Of course, Deputy Brian Lenihan wanted to hear those tapes so that he could verify, or not verify, them but he was not given that opportunity.  Apparently people in Fine Gael knew all about them at that stage. It has been further confirmed by the postgraduate student that he has not as yet checked the accuracy of his material relating to his interview with Deputy Brian Lenihan.  There is a letter to back this up, which is freely available, and which was mentioned by the Taoiseach here this morning.</P>
    <P>This validation is a normal procedure in such research if it purports to be accurate, and Mr. Duffy had indicated in writing that he would follow this procedure. He did not await this confirmation.  This raises some fundamental questions.  First, from what source did the political pressure come?  I know that the political pressure came from his associates in the Fine Gael Party.  Second, who other than the author had access to the research papers and influenced him in his decision?  Third, what are the implications for future research students from the politics department in UCD?  Will they be seen to be gathering their information for research or as in this case for political purposes?  Fourth, what does it mean in future for politics students from UCD? Will they be granted the easy access to senior politicians which up to now they have enjoyed?</P>

      <P>This is the second time in 14 years that Fine Gael and the Labour Party have acted in a manner designed to seriously damage the Presidency.  The difference this time is that they are supported by The Workers' Party.  It would be very appropriate at this point to remind the electorate of precisely how a Government composed of these two parties treated President Cearbhail Ó Dálaigh, the immediate predecessor to Dr. Hillery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1976 the then Minister for Defence, Patrick Donegan, made a statement to members of the Defence Forces in Mullingar in which he described the President as &ldquo;a thundering disgrace&rdquo;.  The reason he gave for this extraordinary and deeply damaging statement was that the President had exercised his powers under Article 26 of the Constitution by referring to the Supreme Court a Bill which had been passed by the Oireachtas.  This is, arguably, the most important discretionary power held by the President. The fact that the offensive remark was made to members of the Defence Forces about their Commander-in-Chief merely emphasised the enormity of the insult.  It was widely reported at the time that the Minister eventually offered to resign.  I should like Deputy Garrett FitzGerald to tell us what influence he had at that time in preventing him from going ahead with <Col N="784" /> this.  He was a very influential member at that stage and has something to answer.</P>
    <P>What manner of man was this President who had been so grossly insulted for carrying out his duties as he, a renowned constitutional lawyer, saw fit?  During the course of the debate Deputy John Kelly, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and himself an acknowledged expert on the Constitution, said that the President was a distinguished lawyer and had presided over the Supreme Court during a brilliant period.  He went on to outline how distinguished the late President Cearbhail Ó Dálaigh was.</P>
    <P>In spite of these very fine words the speaker, together with all his colleagues in Fine Gael and the Labour Party, went on to vote confidence in the Minister who should have been dismissed even before he had time to offer his resignation.  The only person to resign was the President himself.  He took this drastic action because of his deep concern for the office he held and his belief that he would find it intolerable to serve side by side with that particular Government.</P>
    <P>By their actions during the past week Fine Gael and the Labour Party have shown that they have not changed one iota in their attitude to the Presidency. Their candidates have put forward lists of intentions which are clearly contrary to the Constitution and designed to cause chaos, if elected.</P>
    <P>In relation to what Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has said and which has been repeated again and again, <i>The Irish Times</i> carried the statement made by Mr. P. J. Mara at that time but they misquoted as he has made clear since.  Apparently, Deputy Garret FitzGerald chooses to ignore the explanation given by the Government Press Secretary.  <i>The Irish Times</i> printed a correction the following day as part of a statement by Mr. P. J. Mara.  Therefore I would advise Deputy FitzGerald to look at the other side, not to continue to present half-truths and to speak with Deputy Dukes to tell him to do likewise because again he is spreading a lie and a half-truth.</P>

      <P>What clearly happened is that Fine Gael, trailing badly and out of the presidential race, decided they would use the presidential election to attack the Government.  They recalled Deputy Garret FitzGerald and asked him to renew his personal vendetta against Fianna Fáil and their leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey.  Deputy Brian Lenihan was to be the sacrificial lamb.  They planned the set up, set the trap and perhaps used Deputy FitzGerald knowing that he would fall in with what they had in mind for him.  Deputy FitzGerald, in his now celebrated, sly, and treacherous style, using hearsay and half-truths, set about his bitter and personal vendetta under the clever guise of feigned decency.  This man, whom former Deputy and Fine Gael Minister, Dick Burke, had exposed as misleading his own party, was to initiate the smear campaign against one of the most decent men ever to serve in Dáil Éireann.  Let history record the treacherous part Deputy FitzGerald played in this calculated assassination of Deputy Brian Lenihan's character.  To his great credit, professional broadcaster Gay Byrne has more than adequately exposed Deputy FitzGerald's treachery and innuendo in his morning radio programme.</P>
      <P>Let no one underestimate what has been achieved by the Government. Through firm decisions and strong commitment to the national interest we stabilised the economy, brought the public finances under control and created a new sense of confidence.  In the period 1987-90 the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent.  In the preceding three years under Fine Gael and the Labour Party GNP hardly grew at all.  The strong growth achieved was accompanied by a major improvement in the public finances, low inflation and a sound external account due to buoyant exports.  The prospects for sustained growth, further job creation and higher living standards in the coming years are excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> The Opposition are proposing that we should have an election at this time in the middle of a presidential election.  First and foremost this is a gross insult to the Presidency.  It shows clearly what Fine Gael were up to and what their intentions were from the beginning.  Having lost out on the campaign trail they have decided to come in here and do as much damage as they can.  What are they going to do? Already instability is creeping back in, the Stock Market is getting shaky and interest rates will go up if the Government collapse, while the prospects for investment in jobs and development would be what they were when Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in charge. They could hardly care less about that because they are intent on pursuing this vendetta and a personalised campaign of insinuation, hearsay and absolute scandal.</P>
    <P>This has been a good Government, a caring Government in which Deputy Brian Lenihan has played a particularly important and caring part.  In practical terms, they are far more caring than their predecessors, the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  Deputy Brian Lenihan is a man of great humanity and practical concern, a great supporter and active promoter of Fianna Fáil's caring policies.  He has a long and distinguished record in this House, a record of great service to the people of Ireland and has of course his own very individual and engaging personality. He has a unique ability to relate to people &mdash; the popular touch.  To suggest, as both Fine Gael and the Labour Party do that it would be more of the same or that he is a naturally retiring person is patently untrue.  He pursued a progressive and reforming approach to politics long before it became fashionable to do so.  He has clear ideas about the progressive role he can now play as President, encouraging practical patriotism and community initiatives at all levels and being an international ambassador promoting Ireland as a young and vibrant nation.</P>
    <P>This motion of confidence in the Government has arisen from the Opposition's attempt to blacken Deputy Brian <Col N="787" /> Lenihan's name and his presidential campaign. I want to put on the record that Deputy Brian Lenihan is an honest and decent man and a first class public representative.  He made a mistake and for that he has apologised abjectly and sincerely to the people.  The issue we are debating is one of confidence in the Government but the real issue is the campaign by both Fine Gael and the Labour Party to attack the Government by using and abusing the office of President but then in the long history of Ireland there is nothing new about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to listen to so much humbug, cant and talk about integrity in public life from the Government benches.  One would get the impression that the only yardstick of integrity in public life is the ability of a politician to tell the truth.  I would also have thought that there are such serious questions as the capacity of politicians to govern with fairness, to have regard for social justice and equality.  To hear some of the claims coming from the Government benches about the performance of this Government, as if it was a tragedy that we are about to lose it, if we are, is really sickening for the people who have no part in this so called economic progress.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker, the Minister for the Marine, claimed that the performance of this Government is &ldquo;the economic miracle of the century&rdquo;.  That is the kind of hyperbole which I presume has the Fianna Fáil backbenchers wherever they are, happy, after all, that they did make the right decision in the selection of a Presidential candidate because a man who is that prone to hyperbole could have led them into even greater difficulty than the mess they are now in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A quarter of a million of our people have emigrated to Long Island, Liverpool, London, Melbourne, and Maryland while one million are living at or below the poverty line and are not sharing in this economic progress.  That is the kind of thing we are supposed to applaud and <Col N="788" /> take for granted as if it cannot be gain-said. It shows how far the Government have gone since the days when Fianna Fáil claimed to represent the people with no arse in their trousers.  There are very few people on the Government benches now who are concerned about the poor, the unemployed or the disenfranchised in this society.  When the men in mohair suits took over and the problems of Fianna Fáil started we had the beginning of the manipulation of the &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; ethos which is essentially what has come home to roost here today.  Let me give two examples, one a minor one which goes back over the years and the other which brings us right up to today in terms of how that &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; ethos of Fianna Fáil has manipulated and poisoned politics in this country down through the years.</P>
    <P>The evidence of Deputy Haughey and Deputy Lenihan combining to deceive the public is not a phenomenon of last week only.  The arrogance and contempt that so often characterised the hey-day of their politics is now supposed to be flaunted as the stuff of &ldquo;Late Late Shows&rdquo;.  A great many of the people who suffered under the arrogance and brashness of Fianna Fáil at their peak &mdash; some of them very loyal public servants who suffered the lash of Fianna Fáil &mdash; do not consider that the hey-day of Fianna Fáil politics is the matter of light entertainment.</P>
    <P>I refer to a minor incident as long as 21 years ago when the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charles Haughey, combined to deceive the public on a matter of public interest. That was in 1968-69 when a particularly contentious issue arose concerning a teachers' dispute and especially controversial recommendations of a teachers' tribunal, particularly the recommendation for a unitary system of conciliation and arbitration machinery for all teachers, in which the Government were interested.</P>
    <P>In spring 1969 it became evident that all the national newspapers were carrying letters favourable to the Government's <Col N="789" /> position.  Those letters had four things in common.  They were all very short, they were all very knowledgeable, they all recommended the proposals to the teachers and they were apparently signed by members of the public.  The ASTI, although they detected a pattern, were helpless to prove anything until a teacher, a member of the union, came to an officer of the union with a letter that had been sent to his neighbour.  That letter, which had been generally circularised to the newspapers without any knowledge or consent of that neighbour, had with it a complimentary slip from the then Minister for Education.  Underneath the complimentary slip on the letter, which was dated 5 February 1969, was written, &ldquo;and with the compliments of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; who was then Deputy Charles Haughey.</P>
    <P>On investigation it emerged that the Minister for Education had orchestrated a letter-writing campaign to the newspapers. He sent the letters to the newspapers in the names of Fianna Fáil activists assembled at the time of the attempt by Fianna Fáil to abolish PR. When challenged in the House on this campaign of deception, the Minister pleaded that to press the matter could jeopardise agreement with the teachers, which, he said, was imminent as they were upstairs in his office at the time. It subsequently emerged that the letters were written by a very prominent official of the Department, now deceased, on the direction of the Minister.  Presumably as public opinion shifted against the teachers the letter-writing campaign brought chuckles wherever the high and mighty rubbed shoulders as they celebrated another stroke.</P>
    <P>This is but a minor incident in the history of stroke politics which has dominated the Fianna Fáil ethos since the men in mohair suits came to power.  The difference is that the evidence, like the Duffy tapes, has now come into the public domain.  Since the time that relatively minor incident occurred we have had the more celebrated events of the arms trial, the period of GUBU, telephone buggings and offers of financial <Col N="790" /> inducements to change the leadership of Fianna Fáil, right up to the extraordinary events in the present Seanad and the events that bring us here today.  It is time to ask why financial inducements were considered necessary to be offered by one prominent member of Fianna Fáil to another to remove his support from the then leader of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>However, it is the unhealthy relationship between Fianna Fáil and big business interests that poses the greatest threat to our political system.  This House has discussed already how the greed and lust for self-aggrandisement of one beef baron led him confidently to expect, for reasons that we have not yet been told, that he could use the highest offices of Government to shore up his fraudulent behaviour.  I have already put a number of remarks concerning that matter on the record of the House and if I have time I will come back to it.  The conduct of the Government in the separate Gallagher affair is even more inexplicable.  Having regard to the convictions secured in another jurisdiction on arguably lesser grounds and to the extent of hardship suffered by so many small depositors, how can the Government explain why the Gallagher principal can apparently escape with impunity in this jurisdiction? Why did the Taoiseach not take the opportunity of this debate to clear up the allegations, being widely levelled, that this failure to act on the Gallagher scandal is because of the nature of the links between the Gallagher Group and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Why do the Government refuse to allow a sworn public inquiry into persistent allegations of organised subversion of the planning process in the greater Dublin area?  Again, it is believed that the links between Fianna Fáil and many developers and construction companies are so inter-dependent that good planning considerations must take second place to profit and piracy of the planning laws.</P>
    <P>Even one of Fianna Fáil's own pet projects of which Deputy Haughey likes to claim proprietorship and which, it was claimed, was patented by Deputy <Col N="791" /> Haughey's favourite financial guru &mdash; Mr. Dermot Desmond &mdash; has not been clear of the cloud that Deputy Haughey's shadow casts.  I am now asking whoever is responding to the debate for the Government, to state clearly why the Government had never addressed the reason the former chairman of the Custom House Docks Development Authority, Mr. Frank Benson, was forced to resign?  May I ask if his resignation has anything to do with the saga leading to the purchase of the south block by Mr. Dermot Desmond and his friends? When the time came for Mr. Desmond to close the deal it is widely known that he could not even assemble the necessary bank guarantees.  Yet the subsequent court action initiated by Mr. Desmond faltered without explanation and the deal was concluded for £30 million. It is widely believed in financial circles that the south block could have fetched £35 million on the open market.</P>
    <P>More importantly, why has the Custom House Docks Development Authority under their new chairman, Mr. Séamus Pairceir, dropped the commitment to build a fourth block?  The State could have hoped for significant financial receipts after the fourth block becoming operable.  Why should it be abandoned at a time when one tenderer &mdash; Mr. Tony Ryan of GPA &mdash; is hopping mad at having been denied the opportunity to purchase one of the promised four blocks?  Does anyone believe the explanation of the development authority that they decided not to proceed because they did not like the design?</P>
    <P>Does the dropping of the fourth block not greatly enhance the financial prospects of those who control the other three, including Mr. Desmond?  Is it not the case that the development company &mdash; as distinct from the authority &mdash; are also hopping mad about the decision not to proceed?  Can the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, assure the House that the new chairman of the authority, Mr. Séamus Pairceir, has no connection now or had none in the past with Mr. Dermot Desmond <Col N="792" /> or any of his financial vehicles?</P>
    <P>Specifically, does Mr. Dermot Desmond not have a beneficial interest in United Property Holdings Ltd.?  Are records showing Mr. Pairceir as a director of United Property Holdings Ltd. out of date or inaccurate?  If these records are accurate is there not a manifest conflict of interest?  Since the public investment in the docks development is a matter of public interest, are not these legitimate questions to be answered in the House?</P>
    <P>This is only some of the extent of corruption that surrounds the Government. Putting it down to a question of public integrity described in the very narrow definition we had earlier is a nonsense. Now it appears that the only people between us and the Tánaiste falling on his sword are the Progressive Democrats who had to intervene on critical occasions in the past.  For example, they had to intervene on the question of the Ombudsman.  They had to intervene before the Goodman affair brought one of our major industries to complete ruin.</P>

      <P>Now, as Deputy O'Malley makes the lonely trek in leading his Parliamentary Party across to Molesworth Street he is reminiscent of the duck that hatches out on Leinster Lawn and crosses to St. Stephen's Green with her ducklings every summer.  It would appear that Deputy O'Malley is the only person standing between us and getting rid of this Government.</P>
      <P>I suppose it can reasonably be said that the Tánaiste's, Deputy Brian Lenihan, offence is that he loved not wisely but too well.  As a result of that he now seems to be locked in because his partner cannot let go.  If Deputy Lenihan refuses to resign then it would appear that the Taoiseach &mdash; for reasons it is unlikely this House will ever hear &mdash; is not in a position to force his resignation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that it is almost accepted wisdom now that one cannot be a success in business here without the support of Fianna Fáil.  It is that support <Col N="793" /> that has led us to circumstances in which we appear impotent amid the most serious charges in respect of the planning process in the greater Dublin area.  Similarly, were it not for the principal in the Goodman group of companies having the inside track, he never could have been promoted in a manner that locked in available State aids &mdash; whether from the State here or the EC &mdash; in a manner that disadvantaged competitors and threatened to bring one of our major industries to ruin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start this short intervention by apologising to the President of Ireland for an inadvertent unparliamentary description of him by me not so long ago in an interview I gave to <i>Hot Press.</i>  I want to unreservedly withdraw what I said in that interview.  I am sorry that such unparliamentary language should have been used by me, or anybody else, so far as our President is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that, despite a day that could run until 10.30 p.m. or midnight, time has been rather restricted.  So much has been said and dug up for the Government and against the Government, so many things have been commented on, that the temptation is to follow and, in so doing, the time I have to speak would not then have been used for the purpose I intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to go back to 1982 but, before so doing, I want to refer to a couple of mis-statements made in this debate by the third last speaker, that is Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  He said that he is proud to be, to have been and is the only second generation survivor of a father who fought for the freedom of this country.  All I can say to Deputy Garret FitzGerald is &mdash; if his information in other respects is as dubious as is that, and as untrue, then we should not be holding this debate at all.  I had a father who fought there as well.  I had a father who fought after the FitzGeralds and others <Col N="794" /> had helped to divide the country.  I had a father who was in jail for four years, who was condemned to death and was saved by the amnesty, who otherwise would have been executed, not for a crime committed but because reprisal executions were the order of the day under the Government of which Deputy Garret FitzGerald would be so proud today.</P>
    <P>The second mis-statement Deputy Garret FitzGerald made was in relation to his pride in the fact that he helped &mdash; I am not using his exact words because I did not write them down &mdash; to uphold the right of the majority in the Six Counties to determine the future of this country or of their future.  That is a right they never had.  That is a right they do not have. That is a right that I and many others in this House and outside it will assert is not the right of any part of this country to determine.  I have been led along this way by these things that must be refuted by the righteous, by those of great integrity who have such clear memories.  I will say nothing more; I am only wasting time.</P>
    <P>On the night of the fall of the Government in 1982 &mdash; and what I will now say is rather extraordinary &mdash; I clearly remember one highlight, that was my convinced belief that what had taken place that night was unprecedented &mdash; it had never happened before, has not happened since and is not ever likely to happen again &mdash; that is that a majority in this House could have formed an alternative Government had the President used his prerogative to do so.  Furthermore I was involved in that, with how many others I do not know.  I am satisfied in my own mind without needing any recollections whatsoever; I have tried to fill in the gaps; I cannot and I do not make any excuse for that; it happened eight years ago.  I believe that, at the instance of the President &mdash; had he used his prerogative as he was entitled to do to call on the then Leader of the Opposition to form a Government &mdash; we could have had a Government without an election. That was the President's prerogative. But what is important &mdash; and I assert it here as against all the hoo-ha I have heard about keeping the President <Col N="795" /> out of things &mdash; is that I was imbued with the idea that night that, in order for the President to have such an opportunity he had to be made aware of the fact that there was a majority other than the outgoing Government to create a new Government.  That I distinctly remember and felt very strongly about.</P>
    <P>Indeed I felt strongly about it when I was interviewed some months ago in the article in respect of which I have apologised for using unparliamentary language about the President, that is, the fact that he did not use that prerogative but held an election.  I repeat that was his prerogative, is his prerogative.  But only then did it ever happen that such was the case, that I was satisfied that night and have had the recollection ever since that I and those with whom I had been in contact &mdash; I cannot recall even one person &mdash; did get on to the Presidency, to Áras an Uachtaráin, and that we were not told of his non-availability.  My recollection is that he was not there, that he was downtown at some show or other.  I have that clear recollection and I cannot expand on it any further.  Indeed it is my further recollection that the information that there was available an alternative Government within the confines on the then membership of this House was left with whoever took the telephone call in Áas an Uachtaráin to the President when he returned.  That is my recollection.  It does not tally with all we have been hearing.  At the same time I am still convinced that, in similar circumstances, if I had the knowledge I had on that night that there was an alternative to holding a general election, I would have felt that the President should be so informed.  I make no apologies for so saying.</P>

But I remember the highlight and I remember why I was so imbued with that.  It was the first opportunity for a President to use that prerogative, but he had to have the information in order that such could be considered.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the whole performance is a disgrace in every respect in that it appears that the content of the Duffy research was known to Fine Gael &mdash; no fault to them for that because he is one of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell, who is in the House, was to be on that programme that night, but Deputy Garret FitzGerald was brought from far away, maybe accidentally, I do not know, to go on instead.  Deputy FitzGerald should answer if he knew what he was coming back for.  Added to the information he tells us he got about the number of telephone calls &mdash; which is a breach of confidence &mdash; he should disclose from whom he got it, rather than trotting out, as he has done, that he was told when he was going in that there were several calls and he was told when he was leaving that there were more calls.  He should tell the House who told him what.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, with all due deference to the President, who has been advised by all the leaders, spokepeople of all the parties, including the Government, that he should keep out of politics &mdash; of course he should &mdash; that only he and the log that was kept of the calls that night can determine whether the Presidential runner, Deputy Brian Lenihan, lied in regard to his role that night.  If the President has information as to whether Deputy Brian Lenihan rang or did not ring, I believe the public, who are being asked to determine between the three candidates before them, should have the information that is available and not be asked to vote blind because that can affect the successor of our present President. Whatever is the answer to that, and whoever made the calls, if the President is <Col N="797" /> aware of what the log showed, the public, and the voters, are entitled to know before 7 November so that they can then deliver their verdict knowing all the facts and not just innuendo from both sides of the spectrum.  Let us have the truth.  Let us have it from Deputy Garret FitzGerald who told us about the calls.  He has breached faith and confidentiality by saying that there were such calls.  Now he should go further and tell us who told him.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the intimidation charge made in respect of some unknown front bench Fianna Fáil person at the time, about which Deputy Spring is calling for an inquiry.  If this intimidation took place &mdash; I am not saying it did or did not &mdash; why was it not reported and investigated at the time, and why should it now be the subject all those years later of an inquiry?  Should it not have been put on the boards straight away by the person who knew about it including, particularly, the young Army officer who allegedly was threatened as to his future prospects?</P>
    <P>These things are merely making the muddy water even more muddy.  They are making it almost impossible to get a verdict from the people that will truly reflect their judgment because on 7 November it will not be based on all the facts that can be ascertained.  They must have them.  I should like to appeal through all the parties in this House to the President.  Rather than closing him up by saying he should keep out of this &mdash; this is dirty politics and that is a fact &mdash; if he and the log can reveal whether one of our Presidential runners made the call, or did not make the call, the public, the voters, are entitled to know.  I plead for that information.  It is only right that it be provided.</P>
    <P>I have known Deputy Brian Lenihan probably as long as or longer than most Members, longer than most political associates.  It goes back to the early fifties. In looking at the candidates I am not going to decry the other two; I am just going to talk about Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I may be wrong, but I believe that the position of a President, to a large degree acting on our behalf with no <Col N="798" /> executive powers, is for somebody who has given great service to his country.  It should be regarded in that light, an honour to the person who gave the service. The person who gave such service should by his experience over the years be well qualified to be President, to carry the position properly, to meet visiting dignatories, to do the chores of a President and attend all the ceremonies.  In Deputy Brian Lenihan we have a man who has given great service.  He has given a lifetime of service and nobody could give any more.  Secondly, his experience in the Seanad, in the Dáil, in Cabinet and in several Ministries, including in particular Foreign Affairs, qualifies him in a special way.  Those are the qualities, the yardsticks by which our Presidential candidate should be measured.  I plead for elucidation by the President from the log book of the calls received in 1982 before 7 November.  With that reservation, Deputy Brian Lenihan as a candidate is so far ahead that the other two do not even count.</P>

      <P>This is indeed a very sorry day for Irish politics.  This day was a long time coming.  Indeed, several seemingly unconnected events over many years ensured that a &ldquo;high noon&rdquo; would develop.  I am sick and sore listening to Fianna Fáil politicians over the years talking about core principles.  In the more recent history of that party, silly enough as it may be, there were certain core principles from which, irrespective of the reason, they would not move away. I remember 16 or 18 months ago, on the formation of the last Government, those <Col N="799" /> who are now Ministers in that administration were running around the country talking about how difficult &mdash; indeed, impossible &mdash; it was for them to enter into Coalition with anybody.  At the time their leader, the man who is causing all the trouble, was doing a deal with the Progressive Democrats and all of a sudden that core principle was gone to the wind.</P>
      <P>I have nothing in the world against coalitions.  They are as good or as bad as the make-up, the aims and objectives of the Government.  They work well or poorly, not alone here but all over Europe.  The poppycock we are hearing from the Government side all day about core values and principles comes very poorly from the mouths of the Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
      <P>My first interest in politics was awakened during the arms crisis in the early seventies, 20 years ago.  This is the first time I have ever spoken publicly about the arms trial and I do not intend to dwell long on it.  Lies were told by the dozen on that occasion and it had a devastating effect on the country and indeed on Fianna Fáil.  Much later we had to endure the painful transition of the Fianna Fáil leadership from Jack Lynch to Charles J. Haughey.  That was followed soon after by GUBU, the stories of intrigue, telephone tapping, the multisided Doherty affair with one Minister taping another with a view to doing him in.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil always believed in stroke politics.  Some way or another they genuinely believed that the job was not done right unless there was a stroke of some sort involved.</P>
      <P>Over the years all decent Irish people have mistrusted and despised two types of people, informers and liars.  Throughout our history we have had no shortage of informers; I will not go into that at this stage.  There seems to be a new breed of people to take over where they left off. Lying appears to be the thing to do.  If we get to the bottom of this today we will have done a good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence seriously underestimated the <Col N="800" /> intelligence of the Irish people when he appeared on television last week.  There are many questions still to be answered and I wonder if they will ever be answered.  Just how many telephone calls, and by whom, were made to Áras an Uachtaráin on that night in 1982. Unless some independent body, like the Garda Síochána, challenge some of the claims that were made here today to try to get at the truth of what happened on that night, there will be a cloud hanging over this Chamber for many a long day to come.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the love and affection that the Irish people hold for Brian Lenihan knows no bounds.  I must say I like Brian Lenihan and have never seen anything wrong with him in my dealings with him as a parliamentarian.  That love and affection, however, has been tested on several occasions.  In 1973 the people of Roscommon, his own people, did not show that much love and affection when he lost his seat.  It is a bit much to say, as some people in his own party seem to genuinely believe, that he has a God given right to sit in Áras an Uachtaráin and that under no circumstances could anybody else aspire to that high office. This day week will tell a different tale altogether.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of claptrap today about how successful this Government have been, particularly since 1987.  I agree with many speakers I have heard here in the last two hours that it is a good Government for some.  It is certainly not a good Government for many others. As my party's spokesman on agriculture, from which a quarter of the entire population of this country derive their living, I have to say that there has never been a worse year for this sector and it has not been referred to here at all today.  That side of the business seems to have been forgotten by all.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that Deputy Wilson had a bee in his bonnet about something that happened in County Cavan three or four nights ago.  I am sorry he is not here now but I hope he will hear what I have to say. He spoke about Deputy Austin Deasy telling lies in 1986 or 1987 about a file <Col N="801" /> that was sent to Brussels to reclassify land.  I was involved in that as a junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture. Eight or ten months before the general election I was asked by the Coalition Government to prepare this file which was despatched to Brussels officially on 4 February 1987.  Had this Government or the Government that preceded them the dedication or the resolve to take the time and the trouble to ensure that that application was followed up, at least another 30,000 farmers would have had the benefits that flow from reclassification and would not be in the mess that they are in this autumn.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs knows exactly what I am talking about because a fair part of his county is involved also.</P>
    <P>What were this so called wonderful Government doing for two years?  There was not a peep out of them as far as this financial benefit was concerned.  Leaving aside the controversy and what is happening today, I want to know what the Government were doing about that matter and I am glad to have this opportunity to put this matter on the floor of the House.  That file was sent to Brussels on that day with the intention of reclassifying a huge area of the country.  Subsequent events have proved that because of the withdrawal of the price support mechanisms under the Common Agricultural Policy the only other way farmers could be kept on the land was by ensuring that we had the vehicle of headage payments. Had the Government acted three years ago rural Ireland would be a different place today.</P>
    <P>The smaller things are very important. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned a small item from 20 years ago.  As late as five or six weeks ago the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, in answer to a very simple question that was asked about the file for reclassification, said that it had actually been despatched to Brussels.  We all remember that he stood up and said &ldquo;yes, it went yesterday&rdquo;.  It did not go on that occasion and he had to retract his statement two weeks later in this House.  It was just a flyer off the top of his head. That is not good enough.  That is not a <Col N="802" /> standard that is high enough as far as this House is concerned.  Those are small things but small things result in the domino effect and that is coming home to haunt the Government, particularly the Fianna Fáil members.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went to great lengths here this morning to talk about the wonders of this Government and the number of jobs that have been created.  I would be the first to admit that anything less would be of no use whatever.  In fact we have not done half enough.  We had the Presidency of the EC a few months ago. As far as photocalls were concerned, no Government ever took greater opportunity to stand smirking in front of cameras all over the world.  I do not believe they were ever so photo prone in their lives.</P>
    <P>However, it is ironic the twist that comes about.  We are currently in the middle of the most serious GATT negotiations of all time.  We had certain influence during our EC Presidency that we obviously have not got now &mdash; although I am beginning to think we did not have great influence then either.  Certainly there were a number of matters that the Taoiseach should have referred to and on which he should have done much greater lobbying with his colleagues in Europe. It is relevant, when talking about lack of confidence in the Government, to state that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have no clout whatever as regards their efforts to get across to their colleagues in Brussels the huge problems that people in rural Ireland will have to face as a result of the GATT negotiations.</P>

Suffice it to say that it appears that where we should have had influence, we did not have it.  I think &mdash; and I hope I am wrong but all the indicators point to this &mdash; that in the next four or five years we will see <Col N="803" /> the worst recession that Irish agriculture has ever witnessed.  By virtue of that and of the spending power of the 170,000 farming families, everybody involved in business, commerce and otherwise will lose accordingly.  I hope that whoever the next Taoiseach happens to be will be far more successful in his efforts to get across to the heads of the other 11 EC states that there is a special case for Ireland because of our location and our circumstances. He should try to ensure that the worst effects of the GATT negotiations will not be felt by this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this short period of time at my disposal to participate in the proceedings here this afternoon. I describe what we are at as proceedings rather than a debate.  Certainly what we are witnessing will be seen by the country as a whole as something that is totally unreal, uncalled for and unnecessary.  Over the years, I have witnessed quite a number of crises in this House, and I have witnessed them from different seating arrangements in the House.  What I have heard so far today in these proceedings is probably a new low in attacking personalities.  I say that with personal regret, that in a parliament where we are representative of the people we should have the vilification to the degree we had during the course of this debate.  On occasions like this I deplore unscrupulous mud-slinging by anybody at any time for any reason.  It is very wrong and is totally uncalled for. Some of the things that were said here today were said with such appalling venom that one would be tempted to hope that the person who is primarily responsible for engaging in this type of tactic would at some stage be at the receiving end.  I would not wish that to happen but I say to the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring, that there is no reason whatsoever to behave as he behaved here today.  I say that with deep regret to somebody who represents a neighbouring constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other things which were said here <Col N="804" /> today were so far from reality that one wonders what it is all about, what are we trying to do here this afternoon.  I have just heard Deputy Connaughton say things about the European Community that are far from the truth.  It is a pity the Deputy is not here, and I am not saying this to score a point because anything I say will not convince the Opposition. They are there for the kill.  Different parties and different groups are there for different reasons.  I think that from Deputy Garret FitzGerald's point of view, he is throwing a lifeline to Deputy Alan Dukes.  That is his business and I respect it if he wants to do that.  I am not going to make an issue of it.</P>
    <P>The Presidential election has nothing to do with this debate here today, which is an attempt to force a Government out of office, and obviously the cards have been stacked up and a Member of this House has been ensnared &mdash;&ldquo;trapped&rdquo; is the word used by the person who played the central role and who was able to bring back Deputy Garret FitzGerald from Italy a day or two before the ensnarement went into play.  That is in answer to a question raised by Deputy Neil Blaney. On receipt of the phone call by Deputy FitzGerald in Venice he said it would be very helpful to him if the statement he had prepared before he went to Venice was released for Monday's papers because it raised the issue which was later raised that night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I did not see the &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme but I heard all about it and I read the transcript of it. Deputy FitzGerald said on that programme that he was present in Áras an Uachtaráin, he heard voices on telephones and he knew the number of efforts that were made to try to make contact with the President.  That is what he said on that programme in reply to a question put to him by a member of his own party.  I accept that other parties had members there too, but when Deputy FitzGerald said he was present in Áras an Uachtaráin and the next day had to admit he was not there, that he was wrong and that he said it in jest, it brings us <Col N="805" /> back to the reality of the matter.  Even in this House, Ministers have four days notice of a parliamentary question.  I spent an hour or so answering questions here this afternoon and that four days notice is needed by anybody, even when talking about recent events not to mind events that happened eight years ago.</P>
    <P>Luckily for us our election campaigns last for only about three weeks but a person who has been campaigning for a considerable period of time is put under great stress, physical and otherwise, and it is very difficult to try to recall as quickly as one can, an answer to a question that has been well prepared and well hatched as in the ensnarement tactics agreed to by Deputies FitzGerald and Jim Mitchell. One is entitled to say, as Deputy Neil Blaney genuinely said here tonight, I was there on that night but I cannot recall what happened, and I am not under the harassment or the pressures of a presidential campaign.  I certainly cannot recall what I was doing the following day or the night before.  The whole matter is unreal; then there is the question of the way the tape was held back.  I understand that the Tánaiste was not even aware of the existence of the tape.</P>

      <P>Wild accusations have been made in this House.  I was sorry to see the limits to which Deputy Rabbitte went by way of allegations, insinuations and innuendos.  If something is wrong anywhere it should be teased out and there are ways and means of doing so.  I would welcome anything in that regard as none of us wants to see things done which should not be done.  We are all answerable to the people who elect us. We may differ in some things but I should like to think that Deputy Rabbitte's motives are as good as mine.  Indeed, I should like to think that about all sides of the House.  If something is wrong let us see how it can be put right and if something is covered let us uncover it as quickly as possible and put it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I forgot to comment on a silly little statement made by Deputy Connaughton. He said that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had no clout because they could not let the people in Brussels know what GATT is doing to small farmers.  I would have expected more from a person who may be a future Minister for Agriculture. I would have thought he understood what it is all about, how the debate on GATT <Col N="807" /> negotiations takes place and the difficulties involved.  He should come to grips with the problem in case he might have to deal with it in future.  He also mentioned a document submitted by him, as a junior Minister for Agriculture, on 4 February 1987 on the question of the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I have been present in this House when the Minister for Agriculture and Food dealt with that matter on a number of occasions and I do not think there is any need for me to deal with it now.</P>

      <P>It can be clearly said that the record of the Government is there to be seen.  Of course there are problems but the average economic growth rate has been 4 per cent per annum over the last four years.  Unemployment has fallen by 30,000, which we all welcome, although it is only a step in the right direction because a major problem faces this country in providing worthwhile employment for our young people.  However, it is encouraging to see the way things are coming on stream as a result of the progress of the Government in recent years.</P>
      <P>Government borrowing is at its lowest level for many years, around 2 per cent, which all Members, irrespective of which party they belong to, should try to maintain. There have been balance of payment surpluses for four years, which we all welcome, and I hope it stays the same for the next four years.  Inflation is at about 3 per cent and if the sort of progress made is to be jeopardised for the sake of one-upmanship, then let the people decide when the time comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> I admit that there has been a considerable reduction in income in the agricultural community.  After all, I represent an agricultural constituency in County Limerick and I know what the reductions are and how they are affecting people.  I know their worries and concerns.  It is a problem affecting us all which will require our best efforts to deal successfully with it.</P>
    <P>This is not a debate about confidence, it is an effort to destroy the presidential prospects of the candidature of Deputy Lenihan and an effort to force a general election, irrespective of the consequences. That is the sad thing about it. Is their attitude that they will deal with that when it happens?  Will we have periods of instability?  If we do not have a stable Government after the next election, will we hold another one and another one?  Is that what anybody wants?  Irrespective of what we want I am fully satisfied that the people do not want it and will not thank those who bring it about, irrespective of what is said in this House.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the tone set by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this debate and I congratulate him and the Minister for Finance for keeping their noses clean in this débâcle.  They have managed to rise above a very sordid affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Ministers are wounded when accusations are made from Opposition benches but the Minister should not forget that most of the accusations were not started in this House by the people who have the statutory elected responsibility to raise matters of public interest when it affects people in high positions of power and influence.  Any accusations made by Deputy Spring echo and re-echo sentiments expressed by the media &mdash; written and visual &mdash; by ordinary people and those in public Departments.  The proper place to discuss them is in this House.  As the Minister said, matters should be brought into the open and examined.  The Taoiseach decided today that he would differentiate between the motion of no confidence put down by <Col N="809" /> Opposition Members and his own motion of confidence which affects the Government. He said:</P>
    <P>These motions relate to statements made in the course of a presidential election campaign and those made previously by the Fianna Fáil presidential candidate.  Deputy Lenihan is not a Government candidate and this is not a Government matter.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Taoiseach put down a motion of confidence and the Minister does not have to convince the Opposition benches that they should have confidence in the Government.  It is the junior partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, who have to be convinced that the Government are wonderful, untouched by these accusations and that no lies &mdash; or untruths &mdash; have been told by anybody.  If the Minister can convince his junior members in Government of the calibre of the Government, there will not be a general election and the country will not be thrown into chaos, which the Minister said we intended.</P>
    <P>We must respond to motions of confidence on the politics of the situation and I am doing that within the limited time available to me.  However, the Taoiseach in his fine speech also said that in their campaign up to now they had deliberately avoided any personal attacks on other candidates.  That is an untruth.  When does &ldquo;now&rdquo; begin or end because the Leader of the Labour Party today indicated what Deputy Browne said in Wexford in the presence of the Tánaiste, the Presidential candidate.  Deputy Browne engaged in a deliberate smear campaign. Is he not part of the Taoiseach's entourage in this campaign?  Another example of this smear campaign arose in a document issued by the Fianna Fáil Republican Party and signed by Councillor Patrick Gavin of the Mayo East, Swinford Comhairle Ceanntair, which asked &ldquo;Do you as a Fianna Fáil member want to see somebody other than a Fianna Fáil person President of Ireland?  Do you want a President who is a lady who represents those who tried to foist abortion among other undesirable things on the Irish <Col N="810" /> people?&rdquo;.  That document was endorsed by Deputy Seán Calleary, a junior Minister for whom I have the greatest respect.  Is that a clean campaign?  Thank God the electorate recognise this as a smear campaign against Mrs. Mary Robinson.  Today's polls showed that the people do not believe the smear.</P>
    <P>The motion in the name of the Taoiseach talks about how good the Government are, and I would ask Fianna Fáil to convince their partners about how good they are.  Is this about trust, loyalty or truth?  If it is the Taoiseach should govern the country and control his Cabinet, and if there is any departure from high standards the Taoiseach should call for the resignation of the Minister or Tánaiste concerned.  We all admire friendship and affection but one must weigh loyalty to a friend against the common good.  The Taoiseach has predicted a state of chaos if there is a general election but if that happens we will ask questions, for instance, in relation to the health area.</P>
    <P>What have the Government done in relation to health?  Hospitals have been closed by this Government and the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  Whole wards have been closed during the term of this Government in the interests of fiscal rectitude.  Why have we a two tiered system?  Why are thousands of people waiting to get beds?  Because this Government have closed down wards in hospitals.  The Government have failed to provide the finances to run the health services in the interests of the sick, the old and the handicapped who will be marching the streets of Dublin tomorrow if this Government are still here.</P>
    <P>What have the Government done about housing, apart from introducing refurbishment programmes?  Money has not been provided to build houses.  In my constituency two weeks ago the county manager indicated that they would complete two houses in 1990 &mdash; I do not blame the Minister for leaving because the truth is bitter.  Two houses will be completed in South Tipperary in 1990 while 300 people are waiting for houses. A rack rent system is operating and it discriminates against any source of <Col N="811" /> income including social welfare.  Water charges are now being operated by managers in a different manner than was intended in the original Act.</P>
    <P>In the social welfare area the carer's allowance was introduced.  I do not know for whom it caters.  The Minister told the House that up to 10,000 people would qualify but he did not say that many would only get £2 or £3 because the allowance is means tested.  People providing a service for old people in their homes are being disregarded by the Government under the guise of a carer's allowance. Social employment scheme workers have been deprived of the opportunity of a Christmas bonus.  We should stimulate people to take up social employment jobs, but sections in the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare discriminate against such people creating a disincentive to work.  The Government should realise that we have to provide an incentive to get them off the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste referred to emigration as being an acceptable outlet because we have no room for all the people on this island.  About 250,000 people have emigrated since Fianna Fáil came into office. Should we tell those people that we have forgotten about them?  Can we hold out any future for them here despite whoever the President might be?</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, Deputy Connaughton described a catastrophe and referred to the GATT negotiations. What has the Minister for Agriculture and Food or the Taoiseach done for agriculture? <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of Tuesday, 30 October, indicated that that day's meeting of Agriculture Ministers was deferred after it had emerged at the weekend summit of EC leaders, at which the Taoiseach was present, that the French and the Germans would not agree to the 30 per cent cuts proposed.  We have to depend on the French and the Germans to fight our case simply because Mr. MacSharry dropped this into the Dromolin menu without approval from the Department, without consultation with his Commission colleagues or the <Col N="812" /> approval of the Council of Ministers.  We are now trying to draw back from where our Minister for Agriculture and Food and our Taoiseach have left us, depending on the French and the Germans.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the future of family farms and agriculture because of the way this Government have handled matters. The people in Tipperary, Clare, West Limerick or Kerry will be giving their answer to the Government in relation to confidence.  The vibes going through the House at the moment suggest that there might not be an election now because Fianna Fáil might have convinced their junior partners that they mean business.</P>
    <P>What else is happening in agriculture? What happened to the independent agricultural advisers and to some of our best scientists under this Government?  They have gone into voluntary retirement and have not been replaced.  To make matters worse, Teagasc have decided to remove some of their best officers and they have replaced them without interview.  That is extraordinary considering that every agricultural adviser got his post only after strict interview by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson, Minister for the Marine, made tremendous efforts to settle the rod licence dispute.  The Minister referred to his efforts in tourism and we commend those efforts, but what has happened to the promised legislation which would replace the fishing licences which cost this country something like £40 million in tourism revenue?  A year has gone by without the introduction of legislation to replace the rod licence legislation which was enacted despite our vote against it.  Many explanations have been offered as to how that happened but I think that in general the public know it was a cardinal error.  Who made that error?  This Government who are capable of making many errors do not allow us to ask why any of these errors is made.  For some reason anybody who criticises this Government is considered either anti-Irish or as having lost their responsibility to the nation.  If by any chance you are an unfortunate research student and you happen to be a member of Fine Gael you <Col N="813" /> certainly should not have the cheek to ask the Tánaiste for an interview to help you with your thesis.</P>
    <P>Surely we are not running a country where people, of whatever political persuasion, who enter into democratic politics cannot ask questions.  The Tánaiste said he was obliging the student.  He obliged him by misleading him and telling him something which was not true, and which he has since admitted was not true. If it was true, all the Members of the Government who have spoken in this House and outside and accused everybody else of telling lies can get away with that.  It is not improper for them to do so, but if anyone on this side asks questions, we are all wrong.  The Government should look into their hearts before they start looking for scapegoats either here or in the Presidential election campaign. I hope Mary Robinson wins this election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is about confidence in the Government.  The performance of this Government in two short years has transformed the future of this country &mdash; I think that has even been admitted by speakers from the other side. In terms of their achievements, the Government rank as one of the finest to have come before this House.  They have remade our economic history and have earned, not without pain, sacrifice and hard work for everyone, the confidence of the people.</P>
      <P>No matter what is being said here today, the Government command the respect of the international financial markets. International financial markets arbitrate, without mercy or compunction, on the efficiency of the economic policies of all countries.  They speak loudly and give the Irish Government a vote of confidence.  This House knows that these policies &mdash; this has been pointed out already today by Members on this side of the House &mdash; have been praised in successive reports from the International Monetary Fund, the European Community and many other international bodies.  These policies have been held up by the EC Commission as an example of what can be done by a Government with purpose and determination. This no confidence motion puts all of this firmly in the balance and at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Welcome as it is, such praise by international journals and so on is not of great consequence to us here today: what is important is that this Government have created the jobs which all of us want for the people of this country, have generated the investment which all of us know is necessary &mdash; it is necessary because of a very competitive and uncertain world &mdash; and have earned the <Col N="815" /> resources which the poor and socially disadvantaged in our society need so that they can play their full part in the future of this country.  The recklessness of recent days and weeks has led to this sad situation here today where all of this now stands in the balance.  What a price?</P>
    <P>I would like to contrast that by saying it is only four years since most commentators had written off this country, declared it bankrupt, insolvent and virtually told us to close the doors.  It is only four years since those very dark days when another Government sitting over here did not just make a mistake but deliberately went out and doubled our national debt which the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan is very much in the news.  I want to put it on the record &mdash; I will look the <Col N="816" /> Deputies opposite in the eye while I am saying this &mdash; that Deputy Brian Lenihan has had an outstandingly successful career.  As a Member of this House he has served the people and the nation for over 30 years.  Throughout that time he has done that job with distinction and has gained the respect and friendship, not alone of the people of this country &mdash; most of whom hold him dearly &mdash; but of communities all over the world.  One does not just glibly write off a career which has spanned three decades and during which Deputy Lenihan has represented his country throughout the world.  The Deputy may smile but I am talking about a man who has had the hearts of the Irish people throughout that 30 year period. Deputy Lenihan defended this country all over the world and did so with pride and dignity.</P>
      <P>His personal and political courage are impressive.  He has confronted and defeated a very serious illness and moved on to take up a democratic challenge to seek the highest office in the land.  The decision as to whether he gets that job does not rest with this House, that decision should rest with the people of Ireland who will make up their minds on it.  That is where the decision should rest for a man who has given this service.</P>

      <P>I am sure that if the Deputies opposite were 30 years in politics they would want that generosity which they are not prepared to extend today to Deputy Brian Lenihan and his family.  Indeed, he is fortunate to have the support of his very close knit family who have stayed with him through both difficult and good times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has held all the major offices of State &mdash; Justice, Education, Transport and Power, Forestry and Fisheries, Agriculture, three times at Foreign Affairs and Defence.  As the House is aware, he has served under three Taoisigh and has extensive experience of political and cultural life and he knows the people.  I would say that at both home and abroad he is regarded as a man who is and has <Col N="817" /> been a diligent and strong representative of the people.</P>
    <P>Despite recent events, which made headlines, he is still one of the best liked Members of this House and has earned the warmth and affection of all sides of the House.  The man has a certain generosity of spirit and, as the Taoiseach said this morning, he is a good man who, in his long career, never deliberately set out to be dishonest.  He made a mistake, he has admitted it and it is disappointing that people are not generous enough to accept this.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a point brought up by the Taoiseach this morning with regard to the Labour Party candidate, Mary Robinson.  For the past week there has been much talk of a constitutional crisis but did anyone ask Mary Robinson about the political crisis inherent in the following words?  Where were the constitutional party, Fine Gael, during the past few days?  Why did they not ask her this or are they too busy negotiating the transfer votes?  Mary Robinson stated to <i>Hot Press:</i></P>
    <P>As a President directly elected by the people of Ireland, I will have the most democratic job in the country.  I'll be able to look Charley Haughey in the eye to tell him &ldquo;back off&rdquo; if necessary because I have been directly elected by the people as a whole and he hasn't.</P>

Maybe before this campaign is over someone with an interest in the Constitution will have that explained and defended &ldquo;... because I have been directly elected by the people as a whole and he hasn't.&rdquo;  That represents a confrontation between a would be President and a Taoiseach of the day.

As I said, this Government rank as one of the finest to have had the pleasure and honour to serve our country.  In forcing this vote today, at a time of economic recovery, Fine Gael in particular stand accused, in my book, of national economic sabotage, of gross irresponsibility and of placing party ambition above the stability of this State. Is it not true &mdash; and think about this &mdash; that, despite all their talk of high standards and high minded puritanical lectures about morality and credibility that what is really happening here is the result of a Fine Gael plan to save Deputy Alan Dukes as Leader of Fine Gael?  Was not everybody agreed before they pulled this rabbit out of the hat &mdash; which Deputy Jim Mitchell admitted was a deliberate trap &mdash; that if Deputy Currie concurred&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the issues are about Deputy Lenihan's long service to politics or his record, but rather about standards in public life and the part truth plays as an essential ingredient in public life. Truth is the ingredient which keeps the whole fabric of society going.  Could one envisage a situation where lies and truth were interchangeable and where there was no truth between doctor and patient, teacher and student, solicitor and client, husband and wife or family relationships? If that were to happen we would see a breakdown in society.  Is it not reasonable then to say that truth is an absolute essential ingredient in democracy, in particular to parliamentary democracy such as ours?</P>

    <P>The principal issue here is not the constitutional events or the attempts to pressurise the President to act in an area, which is his sole constitutional prerogative back in 1982 but rather the truth. A series of denials were made by the <Col N="820" /> Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, over a number of days and, subsequently, all those assurances proved to be unfounded.  That is the issue at stake and that is the reason we have a vote of no confidence in the House.</P>
    <P>Where there is no truth, there is no confidence.  The most serious charge which can be laid against any of us in this House is that we deliberately misled the House.  It is recognised that this democracy cannot work unless Ministers speak the truth, unless they reply truthfully to parliamentary questions, are truthful in their commitments to trade unions, when they sign international agreements and in their negotiations in Brussels.  The country cannot be run any other way.  It has been my belief for a very long time that the ethos of Fianna Fáil under the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, has brought about a situation where we are no longer able to distinguish whether the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers are telling us the truth or telling us lies.  That is why this issue of confidence is before the House.</P>
    <P>I was not in the Government which fell on the budget in 1982 but I was a Member of the House.  When the infamous GUBU Government of Fianna Fáil fell the following November I came in as Minister for Justice.  I have a fairly good insight into what was happening during the period in office of Deputy Haughey's GUBU Government.  The first task given to me by the new Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, was to investigate the charges that the then Minister for Justice &mdash; now Senator Doherty &mdash; was tapping the phones of journalists.  I have never spoken since then about the events of those times.  Certainly the investigation led in all directions.  We had the telephone tapping, the tape recording of Dr. O'Donoghues's conversation by Deputy MacSharry, now EC Commissioner, the Dowra affair and the various moves during that period by Deputy Brennan, now Minister for Tourism and Transport, <Col N="821" /> and other people to remove Deputy Haughey from the leadership of Fianna Fáil.  There certainly was every reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>I am very careful in the charges I make and I have noticed about the Taoiseach that when the trail reaches a certain point it cuts off and goes dead and there is always a fall guy to take the blame.  I think we have a similar situation today. I know, for example, that even though the public perception is that when Bruce Arnold's and Geraldine Kennedy's telephones were tapped it was a move against those journalists, but of course it was not. The move was against colleagues of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in Government.  It was those who were speaking to Geraldine Kennedy and Bruce Arnold who were under inquisition. In particular Mr. George Colley's conversations were being sought after. When that was exposed and the evidence produced and subsequently one of the highest courts in the land awarded compensation to the two journalists offended, the trail went cold again because it stopped at Mr. Doherty's door.  Even though the transcripts of the tapes were given to Deputy Doherty, the then Minister for Justice, in Government Buildings, there was no evidence to suggest that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, ever saw them.  Is it likely, is it believable, that the Taoiseach did not know what was going on?</P>
    <P>Minister Brennan would be aware that in the course of one infamous attempt to oust the Leader of Fianna Fáil Deputies were intimidated by the Taoiseach going over the heads of his parliamentary party. Phone calls were made in the night and Deputies and their wives were intimidated all over the country.  I know as a former Minister for Justice that one Fianna Fáil Deputy had to get Garda protection because of the intimidation to which he was subject by members of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  Of course these were free-lancers; nobody was directing the operation; it all happened automatically and no one could ever show that the trail led back to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I believe the Taoiseach's attitude to <Col N="822" /> politics has corrupted public life, from the arms trial to the toppling of Jack Lynch, to the GUBU Government, to the bugging and the tapping and the taping of conversations between Ministers, to the resignations of Minister O'Malley and Minister O'Donoghue from office, to the attempted coups within Fianna Fáil and to the rigging of a Book of Estimates &mdash; another example of truth being twisted.  These are all matters of public record.  The Taoiseach's standards have infected public life and I do not think there will be a restoration of standards in public life until the Taoiseach is removed as Leader of Fianna Fáil.  I do not know if there are any people left in Fianna Fáil who have the gumption to try.  The people who tried were forced out and formed the Progressive Democrats. I am not surprised that those men who left on an issue of principle are now in partnership in Government standing today again on an issue of principle.  The issue remains the same.</P>
    <P>Because the common thread of all our unseemly crises of 20 years is the Taoiseach, it seems the way to restore standards to public life is to remove the Taoiseach.  If that cannot be done by the parties in Government or by his own parliamentary party, then the case must be taken to the electorate and if the vote tonight results in an election the issue will be the integrity of this Parliament, standards in public office and the demand by the Irish people and by Members in all parties around the House who do not want to be tarred by the same brush.  The low standards in high places that have been referred to here are confined in my opinion to a small group of people and the decent standards in this House are to be found on all sides of the House in all parties and among the Independents. Whatever the result of tonight's vote, the Deputies in Fianna Fáil and the Ministers who were given certain assurances which they repeated in good faith and found they had misled the public should think again.  I do not believe that the problems of low standards in public life in Ireland can be cured while the Taoiseach remains leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is <Col N="823" /> the issue.  That is why the confidence issue is before the House.  It is not about the economy or about the Presidential election. We have reached a situation where we and the public do not know when the Taoiseach and the Ministers speak whether we are hearing the truth or lies or a mixture.  That is why we have put down a motion of no confidence.</P>
    <P>If there is an election the Irish public need not fear that Fine Gael will not be sound on the economy.  The economic policies we sought to follow through the eighties were the correct ones.  Certainly we did not achieve as much as we would have liked.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport has reminded us that we doubled the national debt in our period in Government.  We doubled the national debt paying the interest on the national debt which had been trebled from 1977 to 1981.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It was on that we doubled the national debt, not because we went out spending wildly but because international interest rates went against us and we had to borrow to pay the interest on the debt that had been trebled over the previous four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The course set in Deputy John Bruton's budget which brought down the Government in 1987 &mdash; which was followed by Fianna Fáil with former Deputy MacSharry as Minister for Finance, underpinned by the leader of Fine Gael in the course of the Tallaght strategy, in respect of which we were much maligned &mdash; was the correct economic policy.  The principles of that economic policy have been carried forward by the present Government.  If there is a general election resulting in a change of Government, to a large extent we in Fine Gael will be travelling down the same economic road. There are not enormous economic options; the debt is still a problem and has to be controlled.  Next year's budget must reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement below what it is this year and there must be no borrowing in the <Col N="824" /> following year's budget.  But there is some leeway in a growing economy.  That leeway should be used to give tax relief to middle income earners to ensure that people in receipt of social welfare payments have sufficient on which to live and are brought out of poverty.  We must &mdash; because this is the great failure of Government policy &mdash; address new strategies to the corrosion of unemployment and emigration affecting the country.</P>
    <P>Those are issues for a general election which may or may not take place, but, if it does take place, the House can be sure that Fine Gael will be sound on the economy and, in general terms, the type of policies which have brought limited success will be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>When we came to power in 1987 there was depression in this country. We grasped the nettle, took the hard decisions necessary to bring our economy back into growth.  What a proud record we have achieved.  The nation's finances have been improved substantially.  We have honoured our commitments to social equity and to the less well off in our society.  We have made progress on income tax reform.  The balance of payments is in surplus.  Most important of all, we have restored confidence in the country, in the economy and in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trend in all the main economic indicators since 1987 shows how effectively we have come to terms with the country's economic problems.  Gross national product grew in 1989 by approximately 4.5 per cent compared with a reduction of 0.7 per cent in 1986.  Exports grew by 10 per cent last year compared <Col N="826" /> with 3 per cent in 1986.  Exchequer borrowing was reduced last year to 2.3 per cent of GNP in contrast with 12.8 per cent in 1986, and, despite recent international developments, Exchequer borrowing is still unlikely to exceed 2 per cent of GNP this year.  Overall Exchequer returns for the September quarter indicate that the 1990 budget targets will be achieved if not exceeded.  These economic achievements have all combined to improve the living standards of ordinary people.  By conditions conducive to lower interest rates and negotiating the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with the social partners we have managed to reduce inflation from an average of 12.4 per cent over the period 1980 to 1985 to 2.1 per cent in 1988, the lowest since 1960, and to a prevailing inflation rate of 2.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>It would be a disaster were this progress put at risk by the uncertainty that a general election would generate.  Now more than ever we need to be firm and resolute in Government as we face into potentially adverse trading conditions. We are the only party who have demonstrated our capacity to manage the economy in difficult and challenging times.  We alone have the experience and know-how to advance the best interests of the nation in the GATT talks, to the opening up of markets in 1992 as we move towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>There is something I would like to put on the record about events that have taken place here over the past week or two.  I should like to make it very clear that I did not lie in the Dáil.  To lie one must know that what one is saying is not true.  I told what I believed to be the truth then and I believe it now.  I told it with the strength of a man who has been assured by his close friend that it is the truth.  Therefore, does one in future seek affidavits and witnesses for the word of a friend, when one has known and trusted a man for 20 years, when he has been a gentle, good tempered man of decency, honour and care for his colleagues?  Does one challenge his word when clearly he believes what he is telling one?  I have learned a lot of lessons in politics, but <Col N="827" /> paranoia, self-protection and mistrust of colleagues &mdash; I like to think I am a little too young for those lessons.  No matter how long I am privileged to be a Member of this House I hope I will still tell the House that I have flunked the mistrust course.  I still tend to assume the best of my friends, co-workers and colleagues.</P>
    <P>In the distant past the dull times could be enlivened by the <i>auto-da-fé</i>, by the public burning of a chosen victim &mdash; flames, excitement, accusations, confessions: never mind the importance or unimportance of the crime, never mind how recent or historical a transgression, one warmed oneself at the bonfire and congratulated oneself on one's innocence. It has been a bit like that this last week with the excitement and the words being played out from radio and television screens every day.  A man fighting on is what we have seen in Deputy Brian Lenihan against the most sinister and contrived example of black politics this country has seen for many a long day.  The integrity of Deputy Lenihan, the depth of his efforts in making his case puts his calumniators to shame.  He has confounded his critics, dismissed his accusers and confirmed himself as the only candidate of real substance, talent and honour in this test.  The sad truth is that there is less in this than meets the eye: a convalescent politician spoofs a bit to a student and puts himself closer to centre stage than he was, knowing that he will be able to distinguish the truth from waffle when he sees the transcript.  How can a serious political science student who breaks faith with his contributor ever hope to offer himself as a genuine commentator?</P>

      <P>Listening to those tapes very carefully one thing becomes clear. Even when Deputy Brian Lenihan got carried away with the notion of having made phone calls to the President, Deputy Lenihan had not got a single, solitary, quotable recollection of what the President supposedly said.  He told the student what the President was like but he did not quote what he said.  Why? It was because Deputy Brian Lenihan may have wanted to colour that contribution but he clearly had not the practice to be the good liar the people opposite seem to suggest he is.  That is how little there is to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prominent public figures are usually forced to resign because they have had a hand in the till or an improper relationship or endangered national security, but no, Deputy Brian Lenihan has done none of those things.  Shorn of all the electronic excitement of the entrapment &mdash; that is what it was and that is what has been said by those who sought to entrap him; they have conceded that point that is all there is to it.  That is all it says about Deputy Brian Lenihan, and that is all it says about the Government, but it says volumes about the Opposition.  It says they know the Government are tackling Ireland's problems head on and winning.  We cannot be tackled on our track record. Instead they figure they should take just this Halloween type approach to Opposition, dress it up in old clothes, paint a little piece of initiation gore on it, knock on the Government's door and say, &ldquo;boo&rdquo;.  Better still, they have some sound effects for that, but that incendiary <Col N="829" /> is not going to deflect the Government from what they have to do properly in the national interest.  Any kind of fairminded analysis of Deputy Dukes' contribution this morning will show it had no substance.  It was nothing but an attempt to shore up his own failing political fortunes on the back of unsubstantiated corridor talk.</P>
    <P>This is a sad day and a sad week, a week which sees a good man harried and hounded by the Opposition in the House, and for what?  Where is the great ideal Deputy Brian Lenihan fell short of and where is the great crime he committed? Where is the great scandal he created? There is none.  Deputy Lenihan is a good man.  He is a warm, caring man who has been hounded by the people opposite and by the entrapment and snare they set for him.  It is all about confidence, and this debate is about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;confidence in a Government who have adopted the sound approach to economic management and a responsible approach to the management of the public finances.  It is about confidence in a Government who have met their obligations to work for social equity and the less well-off, confidence in a Government who by cutting back on public expenditure, borrowing, and an escalating burden of debt which we inherited from the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, have stimulated steady economic and social growth.  It is about confidence in a Government who have lifted our country out of the morass of depression, debt and decline into which it was sliding a few short years ago; confidence in a Government who have made progress on tax reform, who have got the economy into high gear with a growth rate over 4 per cent, a low inflation rate which is the envy of many of our EC partners and a balance of payments surplus with an increasing rate of job creation.  It is about confidence in a Government who have demonstrated their ability not only to manage the nation's internal affairs successfully but <Col N="830" /> to meet in full their responsibilities at the wider EC and international levels.  In short, it is about confidence in a Government who have won the trust and support of the social partners at home and the respect of our partners in the EC.</P>
      <P>I am convinced the Government have the confidence and support of those who matter in the last analysis.  The parties opposite with all their stratagems, machinations, plots, subterfuges and manoeuvres will never be able to deprive us of that.  We have done a proud thing in Government.  We have a proud record which we are prepared to stand over and we believe we act in the national interest. That is what this motion is about and we believe we have the support and confidence of the people in pursuing our aims.</P>

      <P>I regret to have to inform the House that this evening I requested the Tánaiste, and Minister for Defence, Deputy Brian Lenihan, TD, to resign as a member of the Government and he failed to comply with this request. Accordingly, I propose to exercise my constitutional prerogative to advise the President to terminate his appointment as a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan has been a friend, a loyal and trusted colleague, with whom I have served in the Dáil and Government for well over a quarter of a century.  He has rendered great service to the Irish people in many different capacities.  Most people in this House will understand that what I have to do I do with great sadness and great sorrow.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that, as I said this morning, there is a clear dividing line, and I think the people understand that, between the Government and the Presidential election.  I would hope that this reluctant action of mine will serve to emphasise the difference between the two, and I assure the public that I am totally supporting Deputy Brian Lenihan for election as President and I hope he will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat that, as I said this morning, the efforts by the Opposition to force a debate of confidence in the <Col N="831" /> Government on this occasion is quite meaningless and without substance.  It has no reality.  There is no public support for it.  In fact, as I understand public opinion at present, they would resent having a general election forced upon them, and the Opposition parties would no doubt.  I repeat that this attempt by the Opposition to force a vote of confidence in the Government, is simply a piece of electioneering.  Instead of letting the people decide on the Presidential election as a straightforward issue on the merits, demerits, qualities or otherwise of the candidates, the Opposition have sought, as a piece of electioneering and nothing else, to confuse the procedures of the Dáil and force out of office the most successful Government &mdash; I correct myself &mdash; one of the most successful <Col N="832" /> Governments the country has had the good fortune to have.  There is a continuing high level of support for the Government.  There is a continuing high level of satisfaction with the Government, and I believe that any suggestion that the Government should be forced out of office would be resisted and resented by the general public at this time.  The Opposition parties are not being fair to the country and a defeat for the Government, in forcing the Government out of office, would represent a major setback to the country's economic fortunes at this time.  It would have serious detrimental repercussions. Accordingly, I ask the House confidently to support this motion of confidence in the Government.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to bring forward legislation required to: establish an Overseas Development Aid Commission chaired by the President; give the President a consultative role in judicial appointments; appoint a permanent Judicial Commission chaired by the President; appoint an Environmental Council chaired by the President; appoint a National Sports and Recreation Council chaired by the President; and institute a Presidential Merit Awards Scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The last evening we were discussing this motion which calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to what would effectively extend the role of the Presidency, I had been speaking about the atmosphere and the context in which that resolution had been put forward.  I had indicated that in so far as the motion itself and the amendments to it proposed to address what had become a matter of comment, it is worthy of consideration.  Reading the motion and the amendments that have been placed to it, there is perhaps greater merit in the amendment tabled by The Workers' Party in the names of Deputies Proinsias De Rossa, Tomás Mac Giolla and others in so far as it enables some of the difficulties of implementation which might be seen in relation to the motion of establishing an overseas development aid commission chaired by the President, and many of the specific proposals, some of which are meritorious in themselves, to be examined in terms of their feasibility and desirability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the functions addressed, an overseas development aid commission, for example, is something that could more accurately be located within the framework of a parliament.  I very much regretted losing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Overseas Development Aid and Co-Operation because it had made many positive proposals which were adopted.  They discussed a charter <Col N="836" /> for overseas workers and enabled them to serve abroad and to be reintegrated without loss of status or remuneration to the positions which they had left at home.</P>
    <P>The question occurs to me whether, in the absence of an overseas development aid committee, the committee could be moved out of the parliament, and set up as a rather grand committee which would be chaired by the President of the day and which would neutralise the efficacy of those who are concerned about overseas development aid.  The same argument could possibly be applied in relation to the notion of an environmental council and a sports and recreational council.  I am not arguing against the intention to give a meaningful role to the Presidency; in my opening remarks I traced that role as it was envisaged in the 1937 Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the debate in 1937, there was vigorous comment on what the President should do.  The speech that strikes me, reading the 1937 volumes, was a significant and thoughtful one by the then Member, Mr. McCartin.  There was also virulent opposition at times because it was suggested that Mr. de Valera would occupy the role and that it would be abused.  It proved to be a false concern and what is more interesting in the 1937 debate is the manner in which Mr. de Valera was very upset &mdash; as I mentioned in my opening remarks &mdash; by the opposition directed at him, particularly by women.  It is interesting to remember that the great opposition to the 1937 Constitution came from the women of the country because it changed the 1922 Constitution by deleting the words &ldquo;without discrimination as to sex&rdquo;.  Hence, the opposition from women was that they were losing their right to participate in the workforce and would be defined as having a suitable position in the home.</P>
    <P>I will jump from 1937 right up to the present.  Women may now look forward to something much more inspiring, the idea of the State and its symbolic head being a woman who is also a person of great achievement in terms of intellectual prowess, dignity and in terms of respresenting the ethical impulse of many <Col N="837" /> people which is sometimes frustrated by the slowness of the legislative process and by bureaucracy itself.  In all the other discussions, which are over, I tried to manage a separation between the campaign for the Presidency and what we discuss in this House.  Mrs. Mary Robinson has a record of taking up unpopular causes which will, inevitably and politically, come.  They may not alone be unpopular but may bring derision, contumely and dreadful vilification on the person who espouses them but which is necessary if you believe in equality and participation.  The Presidency, even in its existing unelaborated form, will be well filled by a person of that distinction, combining a marvellous background of courage, ability and compassion.  What is interesting is that these qualities are all in the same person.  Many people have compassion and others have intellectual calibre but it is unique to have a person who combines them all.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the 1937 Constitution one speaker suggested that the role of women in Ireland should be modelled on the Polish mother who had saved the Polish language and indeed Poland.  After next week, young girls will be able to look to the symbolic head of their State and know &mdash; even as a role model &mdash; how inspiring it is that there is no post from which women will be excluded.  That in itself is an inspiring concept.</P>
    <P>Turning back to the precise detail of this motion, members of the Labour Party and I have indicated that we are very much in favour of having a very serious look at the nomination process for the Presidency.  We are equally in favour of a commission which would be broadly based and which would look at the role of the Presidency and perhaps also address areas of ambiguity which have arisen between the role defined in 1937 and in 1990.  Certainly there are procedures which are tightly defined within the realm of the Constitution and we will be well served by having somebody who is a distinguished constitutional lawyer to interpret them.  As I said last week, there are other procedures which lack the constitutional status but have <Col N="838" /> become established by convention.  A commission composed of all interests in this House and broadly from society, might look at these issues and then turn back to the rather precise functions which are indicated in the basic motion itself.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the proposers of the motion in their anxiety and I must praise them if, for nothing else, for listing a series of areas which perhaps should not have been neglected and which deserve our attention &mdash; overseas development aid, the environment, the importance of an independent judicial selection process, recreation and so on and the idea of an awards scheme.  I am not confident that these objectives could more easily be achieved without a commission having met and I am somewhat apprehensive that the removal to the realm of the Presidency of some of the concerns might be seen as an excuse for inactivity on them within the Parliament which is the place where there is effective accountability.</P>
    <P>In a curious way I am glad to be able to conclude.  I hope that by addressing issues like this an atmosphere of calm and dignity will return to the present Presidential campaign and prevail until the people exercise what is their right, their choice, next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision for the Office of President in the 1937 Constitution demonstrated more than anything else the demise of the British Crown in Irish affairs.  The creation of the post bears a remarkable resemblance to the role and powers of the president in the Weimar Republic under their constitution of 1919.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of the Crown were taken over by the President so that to a large extent he became and is a symbol of our sovereignty, independence and democracy.  The President evolved with the Constitution but has been cast as its guardian in popular belief. On this occasion it must be stressed that <Col N="839" /> the President is not in fact the guardian of the Constitution despite considerable belief to the contrary.  The President is subject to the same Constitution but hyperbole has even suggested that he is its enforcer.  He is not.  However, he does take precedence over all others.  This, taken together with his functions and powers, makes him a republic's answer to a latter day monarchy.</P>
      <P>The principal powers of the President are well known.  He may refuse to dissolve the Dáil on the advice of a Taoiseach who has ceased to retain majority support.  The exact definition of this is not contained in the Constitution nor to the best of my knowledge do we have any case law from the Supreme Court or any other court as to what precisely this means.  It is not stated specifically in the Constitution that if the Taoiseach is defeated on a budgetary matter, he has ceased to retain the majority support of the Dáil nor is it stated specifically in the Constitution that if the Taoiseach loses a vote of confidence he has ceased to retain the support of the majority of the Dáil but one can only assume that this would be the position taking it to its logical conclusion.</P>
      <P>The President may refer a Bill to the Supreme Court.  This power has been exercised by a number of Presidents.  It is important to point out that any additional powers conferred by the Oireachtas on a President may only be exercised on the advice of the Government.  One may well ask why.  It would appear that the reason is that there can be only one authority in a democracy.  To have two authorities would be to have a conflict in relation to the Executive or Legislature and that would not be desirable.  It is clearly prohibited under the Irish Constitution.  That is why the President's powers are so restricted.  The restrictions placed on the President are placed there to ensure that the Taoiseach of the day and the Government, alone with the Legislature, have the power to pass laws.  The President's ceremonial role in relation to signing Bills into law is there as a recognition of his position as head of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> It is interesting to reflect in the light of a motion such as this that the most contentious aspects of the draft constitution when debated in this House in May and June of 1937 actually referred to the powers of the President.  Many people then on the Opposition benches feared that a dictatorship would evolve. That fear gained a certain amount of credibility, but the experience since 1937 has clearly indicated that this is not the position, and that is why the powers of the President are so restricted under the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>It was outlined to the House last week by the Minister for the Environment that the conferring of additional powers, as are specified in the motion on the President, would invariably and inevitably result in a conflict between the Executive on the one hand and the President and his primacy in relation to matters ceremonial for the most part, on the other.</P>
    <P>It has generally been felt that the role of the President has in some way been demeaned by the fact that we have not had a Presidential election for 17 years. It should be recalled that there was not a Presidential election in 1938, in 1952, in 1974, in 1976 nor in 1983.  Therefore the most of the remaining powers given to the President under the 1937 Constitution appear to be for the most part what one could describe as a rubber stamp exercise &mdash; the appointment of a Taoiseach on the nomination of the Dáil, the appointment of the Government on the Taoiseach's nomination, the right to accept the resignation of a member of Government or terminate his appointment on the Taoiseach's advice and the right to summon and dissolve the Dáil on the Taoiseach's advice although the dissolution is of course within his absolute discretion.  The President can convene meetings of either House of the Oireachtas after consultations with the Council of State.  The President can sign Bills into law and he is the supreme commander of the Defence Forces.  The President has of course rights in relation to pardon or commuting or remitting a punishment in the criminal law area.  The President may communicate with the Houses of the Oireachtas and <Col N="841" /> may give a message to the nation provided it is approved by the Government. Essentially the President has two powers, the power to dissolve the Dáil and to refer Bills to the Supreme Court following consultation.</P>
    <P>As a Fianna Fáil backbencher speaking about the role of the President tonight, I feel constrained to say that this is a particularly sad time.  In speaking about the role of the President it would be remiss of me, as other speakers appear to have used this platform to boost their own candidates, if I did not at this stage pay tribute to Deputy Brian Lenihan and say that no person is more fitting for the role of President.  It is true that the Taoiseach did what he had to do, having no option left, and the Opposition benches have obtained their pound of flesh.  However, I do not think it is a matter of pride for Opposition Parties, that it is a matter to boast about or that it is a matter on which they could conceivably seek support from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan is the best candidate in this Presidential election.  He has gone through the mill.  He has served for 33 years in Irish public life.  He has served in seven different Governments and in nine different Departments as a member of the Cabinet.  He has been Tánaiste and, in addition, he is the Presidential candidate for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I find it interesting, to put it at its mildest, to observe the concern being expressed by Opposition parties for the Presidency.  The motion before us calls for the House to confer additional functions and powers on the President.  In recent days Opposition parties have also agonised over the suitability or otherwise of the former Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for this high office.  In view of all of this laudable concern it would be appropriate at this stage for me to remind the House and the electorate of precisely how a Government, comprised of Fine Gael and Labour, treated the former President Cearbhail Ó Dálaigh who was the immediate predecessor of the present incumbent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> In October 1976 the then Minister for Defence, Patrick Donegan, made a statement to members of the Defence Forces in Mullingar in which he described the President as &ldquo;a thundering disgrace&rdquo;.  The reason he gave for this extraordinary and deeply damaging statement was that the President had exercised his powers under Article 26 of the Constitution by referring to the Supreme Court a Bill which had been passed by the Oireachtas.  In effect, what was happening was that the Minister for Defence was engaging in head on combat with the President of the State in relation to what was his discretionary powers, and one of the very few which he had.  The fact that the offensive remark was made to members of the Defence Forces about their Commander-in-Chief merely emphasised the enormity of the insult.  On 21 October 1976 a motion was debated by this House calling on the Minister to resign.  The Fine Gael and Labour Parties rallied to a man behind the Minister and the motion was defeated.</P>
    <P>What manner of man was this President who had been so grossly insulted for carrying out his duties as he, a renowned Constitutional lawyer, saw fit?  During the course of the debate John Kelly, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and himself an acknowledged expert on the Constitution, said and I quote:</P>
    <P>The President, a distinguished lawyer, presided over the Supreme Court during a brilliant period.  He presided over it in a series of judgments which revolutionised Irish constitutional jurisprudence ... his standing as a judge and his absolute integrity and independence are utterly beyond question.</P>
    <P>In spite of these very apt words the result was as I have stated.  The only person to resign, the only person forced out, was the President himself and the State was robbed of one of its most distinguished servants.  Let those who would gloat over their pound of flesh tonight recall that night.  The President took this drastic action because of his deep concern for the office he held and his belief that he <Col N="843" /> would find it intolerable to serve side by side with that particular Government.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am surprised that Fine Gael and Labour have engaged in such a vicious assault on a man's integrity over the last eight or nine days.  This unwarranted attack and unceasing barrage on this man's integrity was directed against a man who had served the Irish people for 33 long years, most of them at the highest level of Government.  No man or woman in this House can point a finger at the former Tánaiste and say that, during the period he served in this Ministry or that, or served on the Opposition benches, he had anything but the greatest integrity.  It is on this basis that the former Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan, now presents himself before the Irish people and he does so with his integrity and honour intact and with a breadth of experience that no other candidate in this election could even dream to boast about.</P>
    <P>I am not going to get involved in personalising the Presidential election campaign or to say that either of the other two candidates is not a good candidate, but I do want to say that Deputy Brian Lenihan has a vast range of experience in Irish public life which has to be taken into account and that under no circumstances would this man denigrate the office of President.  He is known internationally throughout the length and breadth of the European Community and in many other countries, by Heads of State and is widely respected.  I do not believe we could have a finer ambassador for this State.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that in this role a practical knowledge of working political life is desirable.  Deputy Lenihan in his career over the past 33 years has exhibited the kind of strength of character and ability which the office of President demands.  He will never be in conflict with the Government of the day.  He knows and understands the role of President better than any other candidate in this election because he has seen political life over a long period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> Throughout the recent controversy all arguments and media representation zoned in on Deputy Lenihan.  Nothing was said about remarks later denied by another candidate.  There was no outcry in the media about that as Deputy Lenihan was hounded from pillar to post. Ultimately the Taoiseach, in order to avoid a general election which nobody wants, was left with no alternative.  I am not going to pretend that this is not a very sad night for me.  I think that most people involved in public life, regardless of their political persuasion, would have to admit that, throughout his political career, this was a man of impeccable character, and still is.  That we all make mistakes in relation to issues over a period of time, is undeniable, but what cannot be denied is the humanity, integrity, ability, dedication and patriotism of this man who was such a good servant to this country. I believe that Deputy Lenihan can and will be of great service to the country.  I believe that he will unquestionably carry out the role of President with geat distinction and ability.</P>
    <P>Today's debate and the debate in the media over the past eight days politicised the Office of President more than ever in the history of this State.  The Presidency was dragged to the front of every newspaper in the country and the President's role was in many ways demeaned by the unseemly squabble which took place and which was instigated by Fine Gael and Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  There has been much talk about not politicising the Presidency and the functions of the President have been discussed in this Chamber, which is only right and proper, but the vilification of a candidate for the Office of President, and the hounding of a man who has declared himself to be a candidate has, more than anything else, since the 1937 Constitution was approved, brought the role of the President into political life.  It is sad that that has occurred.</P>
    <P>This is very sad because the Office of President is independent of the Legislature. That is what was intended and <Col N="845" /> that is the way it should be.  Some candidates for the Office have been portraying the Presidency as something it is not.  The powers of the President are set out in the Constitution and the power to amend the Constitution is vested in the people only; nobody else has the right to change the Constitution.  Undoubtedly, one President may be more expansive than another but the truth is that the President is constrained under the Constitution and there can only be one authority under the same Constitution.</P>
    <P>The editorial in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> the day before yesterday contained statements on the role of the President.  It was stated, for example, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley was a member of the Cabinet in 1982 who decided to make telephone calls to the President.  That is absolutely untrue and, if you like, is comment gone mad.  Fianna Fáil were in Opposition in 1982.  The same editorial went on to state that it was definitely unconstitutional to make a telephone call to the President. However, the 1937 Constitution does not state that it is unconstitutional to make a telephone call to the President.</P>
    <P>The exact role of the President in relation to the dissolution of the Dáil is defined.  He has absolute discretion whether or not to dissolve the Dáil but his role, outside that bold statement, is not defined.  It is not stated, for example, in the 1937 Constitution that the President may ring the Leader of the Opposition, or call him in, no more than the Leader of the Opposition may not call the President.  The truth of the matter is that it is a fallacy to state that it is unconstitutional to make such a call. Therefore, one can only conjecture at the precise role of the President in relation to the dissolution of the Dáil.  What is certain is that he can refuse to dissolve the Dáil or, alternatively, he can dissolve the Dáil.  One would imagine that in the event of a President deciding not to dissolve the Dáil political activity would commence in this House and if some consensus could be arrived at between a number of Opposition parties and, perhaps, Independents that would give that <Col N="846" /> group a majority, that would then be communicated to the President, either directly or by some other means.</P>
    <P>The role of the President, as I said, is extremely limited under the 1937 Constitution but this does not mean that a President cannot play a very worthwhile role in society.  I have no doubt, knowing the kind of man he is, that Deputy Brian Lenihan would fill that role better than anybody else.  He has the kind of personality which endears him to people.  He likes people and, without any question, people like him.  For this reason, when the election is held many of the people who got their pound of flesh tonight will be very surprised with the result.</P>
    <P>Yes, it is clear Deputy Lenihan made an error in relation to his interview with Mr. Jim Duffy, but we all make errors. Let this much be said: should either Deputy Austin Currie or Mrs. Mary Robinson spend 33 years at the top in public life and make only one error during that period then I might well be the first to say that he or she should be President.  Deputy Lenihan, who has however temporarily, departed the role of Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, is now a candidate for the Presidency and the people will decide whether or not he should be President.  I believe, on reflection, the people will decide that Deputy Lenihan has the experience and ability necessary to be the President of Ireland. I also believe that the people, however they decide next week, will on reflection always remember the day the trap was set to destroy a man who had given 33 years of his life to them in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>It is a very sad reflection on Irish political life, and those involved in setting the trap which eventually won the pound of flesh, that those people so demeaned the office of Presidency in that way.  I do not believe Irish political life should be about the vilification or the hounding of any one man.  Neither do I believe that Irish political life is well served by mean tactics such as those.  Ultimately, the people will have the opportunity to pass judgment.  To say the least, it demeans the office of President to plant a party <Col N="847" /> political activist in an audience to lure a man into a trap.  That is a sad reflection on those involved but even though they have won the battle tonight they have not won the war.  It is my view that whatever about the battle they will, ultimately, lose the war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to appoint a broadly based Commission to examine the role and functions of the President and to make recommendations on</P>
      <P>(1)  the legislative and Constitutional changes required to make the Office of President more relevant to Irish life</P>
      <P>(2)  more democratic procedures for nominating candidates for the Presidency, particularly a provision to allow a certain number of citizens the power to nominate a candidate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move the amendment in my name and that of the other Deputies from The Workers' Party not because I see anything wrong in principle with what is suggested in the Fine Gael motion but because there is need for a more indepth examination as to how the institution might be made more relevant to people's lives.  The ideas in the Fine Gael motion are certainly worth considering.  My fear is that once election day passes next week the debate in which we have been engaged for some months will disappear and will no longer exercise the minds of politicians and certainly not of citizens. In the nature of things, politicians will address themselves to the immediate problems, not those that arise at seven-year intervals.  It is important that a commission should be established to examine the issues to which I have referred in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on the nature of the Presidency has developed and grown out of the fact that candidates have been nominated on this occasion.  There has not been a <Col N="848" /> Presidential contest for about 17 years and that in itself has devalued people's interest in or ideas about the Presidency. Clearly if a position of such importance is not contested and is simply handed on by agreement, no matter how well intentioned that agreement might be, it tends to develop in the minds of the populace the view that this position is not of much importance and that it is simply a means of compensating political colleagues for services rendered.</P>
    <P>Over the years, certainly during my time of conscious political activity, the Presidency has maintained a degree of integrity but also a degree of distance from the common populace.  For that reason there is a general feeling that it is of no importance to everyday life.  Ireland in the nineties is not the same kind of country as it was in the thirties.  The institution of the Presidency has not been reformed since then.  The Dáil and the Seanad have been reformed to some extent, minimally I would agree.  They have addressed themselves to reforming their procedures and various attempts have been made over the years to change the election system.  The institution of the Presidency has remained unchanged. That in itself requires that we should address the issue of the Presidency, the role and the responsibility.</P>
    <P>The candidature of Mrs. Mary Robinson, who was nominated in the first place by the Labour Party and has since been jointly nominated by The Workers' Party and a number of Independent Senators, ensured not only that there would be an election but also a debate on the issues concerning the role of the Presidency.  In July when I announced The Workers' Party decision to support Mary Robinson's candidature I expressed the hope that the occasion would be used not only to address the role of the Presidency but the development of political values in Irish life.  I felt there was a need to address such issues as the pluralism required in political life, the acknowledgement and acceptance of diversity, the need for a realistic view of Northern Ireland and the attitude which it was necessary to change <Col N="849" /> in relation to Northern Ireland, specifically Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution which the Supreme Court has indicated are a specific claim with legislative backing on the territory of the Northern Ireland State.  That is an area which needs examination.  It may be that those Articles can be amended or should be deleted or perhaps they should simply be replaced by a less contentious declaration of the wish of people for a united Ireland. It is a debate which needs to be developed.  In the nature of things it was not possible &mdash; although I thought it might be &mdash; for that debate to get under way in relation to the Presidency.  Nevertheless we need to develop this debate if we in this State are to hold up our heads in relation to the efforts being made to establish a working relationship between the people of this State and the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion has very useful suggestions.  I made suggestions in relation to the role of the Presidency and the nomination procedure in 1983 but they died a death because there was no Presidential campaign.  The major parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party &mdash; decided they would not contest the election.</P>
    <P>The Presidency even as it exists has significant powers.  One is the power to dissolve the Dáil at the request of the Taoiseach.  I do not intend to rehash the debate we had today on that matter.  It is a major power which needs to be refined in terms of the options open to the President and how they should or should not be exercised.  That issue could be addressed by the kind of commission I am proposing in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The other important power is the power to refer legislation to the Supreme Court.  It is important for one simple reason.  This House on many occasions has passed legislation which was subsequently found to be defective.  It took considerable effort on the part of citizens to get that legislation into the Supreme Court.  Not everybody has the resources, the finance, the ability or the patience and resilience to take such cases through <Col N="850" /> the court system to Supreme Court level. The power of the President to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court for examination, approval or disapproval, is an important one, but it is a power that needs to be refined.  As I understand it &mdash; and I am not a lawyer &mdash; if a Bill is approved by the Supreme Court in that way, even though it may have defects other than the one indicated by the President, the Bill is therefore approved and subsequently cannot be challenged as being unconstitutional. That has its advantages and disadvantages.</P>
    <P>I contend that that power needs to be refined in some way; in other words, if a Bill is being referred to the Supreme Court for examination, the area of concern should be indicated; it should be that area only that is approved or disapproved in whatever way by the Supreme Court and there should not be blanket approval of any Bill in that way.  That would be an important refinement.  It is also the kind of issue which could be addressed by the commission I propose.</P>
    <P>The other point I might make in relation to the nomination procedures of the Presidency is that at present a person who wants to be a Presidential candidate needs the support of 20 Members of the Oireachtas made up of either Dáil Deputies or Senators, or a combination of both or, alternatively, the nomination of four county councils or corporations.  Clearly that restricts the nomination of a candidate to parties that have significant support already in either local authorities or the Dáil.  Clearly also, given the nature of our political system, those who will have the power in the Dáil will also have the power in local authorities.  I have argued &mdash; I made this point back in 1983 and am pleased to note it has been taken up by others outside this House since then; indeed a Member of the Seanad, Senator Carmencita Hederman has taken it up &mdash; that there should be a procedure whereby citizens themselves can nominate a candidate.  People have argued against that proposal on the basis that there would be a whole range of candidates standing for the Presidency, that it would be impossible to have a count, <Col N="851" /> that it would be impossible to have a nomination paper people could read and so on.  There may well be a case for restricting the procedure in some way, but I would argue very strongly that, unless and until we open up the nomination procedures, there will be very little regard for or understanding of the relevance of the Presidency on the part of ordinary people.  An office to which people generally have no access &mdash; in terms of their ability to become elected to it &mdash; in itself cannot have the regard we expect the Presidency to have.  Perhaps it could be a procedure whereby, say, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or some such number of citizens, could nominate a candidate. Obviously the people concerned would have to be on the register of electors and so on.  Again it is something a commission could address and report on well in advance of the next Presidential election in seven years time.  I would go even further because, when one considers that the Presidential campaign covers the whole of this State, it would be unreasonable for ordinary citizens who do not have the backing of political parties, particularly the large parties, to be expected to be able to mount a reasonable campaign in support of their nominated candidate. Therefore, candidates nominated in that way should receive some form of financial assistance to run such a campaign.</P>
    <P>We have a procedure already under which free post is available to candidates in General and Presidential elections. There is no reason that could not be extended in certain circumstances to ensure that every citizen would have available to him or her some basic information on all of the candidates standing in a Presidential election.  If we are in earnest about making the Presidency a serious institution, about maintaining it as a democratic institution, about maintaining people's interest in our democratic system, then we should make it as easy as possible for people to be elected to those positions.  Indeed we should make it as convenient and easy as possible for all citizens to be aware of the choices <Col N="852" /> they are being offered in any one election.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Presidency clearly is one which touches on the Presidential campaign itself.  In electing a President it goes without saying that we need to elect a person who is honest, who has integrity, who is most of all, independent. As I said earlier, the experience to date has been that all of the Presidents elected or unelected have acted independently, with integrity and honesty.  There is an important lesson to be learned from the events of the past few weeks in relation to the question of how much our electorate are prepared to put up with in terms of being misled.  I will not go any further in relation to that.  But there are lessons for all of us to understand, that the electorate are not prepared to be bullied, misled or be treated as fools.  The result of the election of Wednesday next, 7 November, will bear that out.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the speaker before me on the Fianna Fáil benches still does not realise that the issue was not the question of hounding a particular person, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the man; that was not the issue.  The issue was whether or not there was a question of honesty or dishonesty in relation to things said: that is the issue.  I have already put on record today my personal regard for the man, but I would be hypocritical if I stood here this evening and said I was sorry that he had had to resign or had had to be sacked, because I do not feel sorry.  I have a personal regard for Deputy Brian Lenihan, the man, but I believe that today has been a milestone in the political life of this country, a milestone in the decline of stroke politics, a milestone in the maturity of the Irish political system.  Therefore, it has been a good day for Irish politics, not a bad one.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks before the Presidential campaign took fire, if you like, there had been a general apathy about the campaign. There had been arguments advanced to the effect that it was a waste of time and money, that the Presidency carries no powers, does not serve any function and so forth.  I have already said why I thought that was the case.  I have <Col N="853" /> been concerned over a number of years that this attitude to the democratic institutions of this State should not be encouraged by politicians in particular, not because we are the people who earn our living as full-time politicians and therefore have a vested interest in maintaining the institutions concerned.  But if we travel down the road of saying that the Presidency or the Seanad should be abolished because they cost money, do not have any real function, or that we should reduce the size of the Dáil because of its cost, because TDs are perceived not to do a particularly good job, or any job at all in some cases, that is a dangerous argument.  The logic of that argument is to say: well, this country could be run much more cheaply by one person, by one man or woman and more efficiently perhaps as well.  But we would have no democracy, no choice and it would be a very short road to the point at which we would have no elections at all.  Therefore, the argument about cost, ineffectiveness and abolition is one which should be resisted by politicians generally and by political parties in particular.  What we should be demanding very strongly, what we should be encouraging our citizens generally to seek is greater democracy, greater involvement, greater accountability, more relevance in terms of how the Dáil and Seanad operate, of how people can gain access to these august bodies and more access in terms of citizen's rights to contest and win a position in these bodies.  We should be arguing and struggling for greater democracy and greater accountability, not less.  Indeed, that debate is very lively on the European scene where the whole argument at the moment concerns the so-called democratic deficit where a parliament is elected which has very little power and where decisions are being made by Commissions and by European Councils which are not accountable to the citizens of the EC.  The whole thrust should be towards greater democracy and greater accountability and not less as would be the case if we go down the road of arguing for restricting the institutions we have and making them smaller and less costly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> I hoped the debate would have centred around the nature of the society we would have in the course of time, but it has not opened up in the way I thought. However, the debate we have had over the past week carries lessons for us and indicates the direction in which people really need our society to move.  I will conclude on that point.</P>
    <P>We have had a very useful discussion on this issue.  The debate which has been opened up by the Presidential election campaign should not be left aside after 7 November.  The way to avoid that happening is to have a commission established on the lines I have suggested which would include, obviously, representatives of the political parties, the various interest groups, employers, trade unions, women, obviously and the poor.  A whole range of interest groups could be involved in such a commission which would report back to the Dáil so that we could move in the next year or two towards amending our Constitution and bringing it up to date with the realities of Irish life.</P>

I apologise to the House for not having <Col N="856" /> heard many of the speeches but I am sure Deputies will understand why.  I have been involved in some other business that some people might be aware of.</P>
      <P>I hope the unfortunate events of the past few days, which have pleased nobody and certainly I am not happy at the turn of events, will not have an adverse reaction on this motion.  It seems that everything that has happened over the past few days confirms the importance of the issues I have raised throughout the presidential election campaign and confirms the necessity for the independence of the holder of the highest office in the nation.  To date, all holders of the office have discharged their duties with tact, judgment, courage and honour.  As President Hillery's second term draws to a close, his quiet bearing, sometimes criticised, emerges as a rare quality which now brings him and the Office he holds nothing but honour.  But past Presidents have been constrained by the limitations imposed on the Office by our failure as a Legislature to take advantage of Article 13.11 of the Constitution which enables additional functions to be bestowed on the President.  While all such additional functions can be discharged only on the advice of the Government &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; it is still possible to give the Presidency a much more substantial role than it has at present, a role which would serve our people well.  Nothing in the Constitution says that the President must be a purely passive figure. However, it is clearly the intention of the Constitution that the President should avoid conflict with the Government of the day and I share that view absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If elected President it is my intention to shake up Áras an Uachtaráin so that it would become the centre of Irish society. The Áras is far too staid and too remote from our citizens even from leading figures in our community.  I intend to change this.  I plan on making Áras an Uachtaráin the powerhouse of excellence of all things Irish and to use the enormous prestige of the office to summon forth excellence in all aspects of national life.  There are things which with energy, enthusiasm and <Col N="857" /> commitment a President can do even with present limitations.</P>
    <P>I support strongly the proposals of my party to expand the functions of the Presidency. We feel that Overseas Development Aid should involve the President. This would be done by the establishment of an overseas development commission with the President having the permanent role of chairman.  They would be entrusted with the allocation of overseas aid for specific projects out of funds voted by the Oireachtas.  It is a priority of the Fine Gael Party that Ireland would reach the UN objective of 0.7 per cent of GNP. Repeatedly the Irish people have shown not only through our great missionary tradition but also our sharpened sensitivity to famine, a great willingness to help relieve the desperate poverty and underdevelopment abroad.  Therefore, Fine Gael are committed to introducing in this House an overseas development Bill which would provide funding for this commission and an international role for the President.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also believe that the President can exercise a greater role in Irish society through legal changes without reference to constitutional amendments. While Article 13.11 of the Constitution places a restraint on the manner in which the President can exercise such powers as might be entrusted to him or her, it does not dictate that these powers must be purely symbolic or nominal.</P>
    <P>The independence of the courts from the Government is the central pillar on which all democracies must rest.  We believe this independence will be enhanced if the President is given the role to fill vacancies arising on the Bench in any of our courts.  We propose a legal change where the President will initiate a procedural consultation with the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society.  This would lead to the recommendation of a number of candidates whose names would be submitted to the Government.  The Government would then, through the President, appoint their nominees.  This change would enhance both our courts and the office of President.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> Also, in regard to the courts, there have been continuing complaints about their dependence on the Government for accommodation, staffing levels, office facilities and resources.  This, in turn, has caused delays and inefficiencies in the administration of justice.  It is, therefore, proposed that there should be established under the chairmanship of the President a judicial commission consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Presidents of the Circuit Court and District Court, the Ombudsman, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor, the chairman of the Legal Aid Board and representative of the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council.  This commission would take an open view of the operations of the courts and make confidential recommendations to Government of proposed improvements in our court system.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade there has been a marked increase in public sensitivity to our environment and heritage.  The way we protect our environment now will determine the health and well being of future generations.  This issue transcends national boundaries.  Fine Gael believe, therefore, that the President should on all appropriate occasions, including when representing the State abroad, emphasise the need for international solidarity in taking all necessary action to provide a healthy, safe, global environment.</P>
    <P>In the domestic context Fine Gael, in proposing that the President should have a specific role in the area of environmental protection, have already published a Bill to establish an environmental protection agency.  The executive functions of this agency would be carried out by an environment commissioner who would be appointed by the President pursuant to a resolution of the Oireachtas. It was further envisaged that there would be established an environment council to act as an advisory group to the commission on the agency.  It is essential that this council is independent of Government. We are proposing that the President would be appointed by statute to act as chairman of this environment council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> We are one of the few nations of the developed world which has no national system to grant recognition for major achievement in our national life, be it for public work, community endeavour, outstanding courage or sporting achievement. Fine Gael are proposing that it should be a major function of the Presidency to promote the pursuit of excellence in all facets of our national life.  We believe that it is possible to establish, by legislation, a meaningful and highly regarded system of national awards to mark conspicious service and the attainment of excellence in various areas of our national life.  Such awards should be made annually and could extend to non-citizens who have made a substantial contribution to this State or who, in their international work, deserve recognition, such as, someone who has made a substantial contribution to peace and reconciliation. This would be called the Presidential merit award scheme.  The scheme would include ceremonial proceedings for the granting of such awards and civic standing that could be granted to holders of such awards.</P>
    <P>We have one of the youngest populations in the western world.  Sport plays an increasingly important role in our national life.  The international achievement of our sport stars in recent years has been a cause of national pride and has stimulated further interest in these sports.  While the President has attended most of our major sporting events each year, Fine Gael feel that there is further potential for the Office of President in this area.  We have already published proposals for the establishment of a national sport and recreation council to be founded by national lottery finance.  We believe the President, by enactment, should be empowered to act as chairman of this council and play a specific role in promoting sports and encouraging participants in sporting activities.</P>
    <P>Finally, under the existing provisions of the Constitution the President may convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas and may address the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="860" /> with Government approval.  The President may also, after consultation with the Council of State, address a message to the nation at any time on any matter. Fine Gael believes that this facility and concept has never been fully utilised, and therefore we propose the President should annually convene both Houses of the Oireachtas for an address with Government approval.  Successive Governments have under-utilised the talents of their Presidents.  We are proposing a new style of President with new powers and functions.  I pledge, as a holder of the office, to ensure that these new and dynamic roles for the President will be carried out enthusiastically and energetically.</P>
    <P>In the short time that is left to me there is one point that I must emphasise fully. All of the proposals we have made, and all of the reasonable proposals which have been made in relation to the extension of the role of the President depend, to a very large extent indeed, on the independence of the holder of that Office and it should be clearly seen that the holder of that Office is independent.  The President is, of course, elected through a political process and we are currently engaged in that political process; but when elected the President must be above party politics, and must be seen to be above party politics.</P>
    <P>All of the proposals which I have referred to, which are the proposals of Fine Gael, are firmly based on the necessity of that independence, I will give one example: the establishment of a Presidential merit award scheme is totally dependent on having an independent President because we have already too much political patronage in this country. We do not require any more politcal patronage, and the involvement of a truly independent President in relation to this Presidential merit scheme would have the effect of ensuring that political patronage would not enter into that area. It is for that reason I emphasise once again the total importance of the independence of that Office and my commitment <Col N="861" /> to this House and to this country of my independence in that regard.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Fishery Patrol Vessels.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the report which appeared in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> this week, which indicates that the boats being used by fishery officers are unsuitable for the task of sea patrol and that these boats should be withdrawn.  This report goes on to state:</P>
      <P>for operations which involve proceeding to sea (that is beyond the limits of smooth and/or partially smooth waters) and up to twelve miles offshore, either for short or lengthy patrol duties, semi-rigid inflatable or open boats are not considered suitable, either singly or in company with other craft of the same or similar type.</P>
      <P>One feature of the tragic occurrence off Ballycotton on 7 July last is the question mark which still hangs over the particular boat used on that fateful day in which four officers lost their lives.  I have continuously requested the Department to make every effort to locate this boat and to try to ascertain the full facts regarding this tragedy.  I acknowledge the fact that three searches were made, two by the Naval Service and one by the Celtic Diving Company. It is unfortunate that two of those searches were carried out in a region not relevant to the area where the boat foundered while the third search was carried out, for a short time, in an area where equipment from the ill-fated boat was found, but again without success. I suggest that, given fair weather conditions, this search should be resumed given the fact that the exact location has been pinpointed.  I note the Minister indicated in his answer to Private Notice Questions on 10 July last, that it was very important to identify where the boat is and recover it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report which has been circulated by the Department to the fishery boards recognises that the boats being used are <Col N="868" /> completely unsuitable.  Furthermore, the open boat used that day had been, apparently, modified which could conceivably have affected its buoyancy.  I have been led to believe that these fibre-glass boats have ballast tanks built into them to enable them keep afloat in the event of an accident or emergency but in this case this did not happen and the question which must be asked is why did this safety measure not operate.  It appears that when the boat foundered it sank instantly.</P>
    <P>I attended the inquest last week into the deaths of the four fishery officers in Middleton and two very important points arose during the course of the evidence. One of the witnesses, a seaman from the <i>Eleanor Rose</i>, a fishery boat from Ballycotton, stated that when they were hailed by the fishery patrol boat he noticed the boat was very low by the stern.  One must remember that two heavy outboard motors were attached to this open fibre-glass boat.</P>
    <P>The other important point is that the jury saw fit to add a rider that these boats should not put to sea again until such time as a full review is carried out concerning all aspects of fishery patrols.  This must be a very important factor taking into consideration the contents of the leaked confidential report.  I acknowledge that shortly after the tragedy the Minister issued an instruction that all patrols by the fishery boards be stopped. It is to the Minister's credit that he acted so swiftly in this matter.</P>
    <P>The boat used in the Ballycotton tragedy was a 21-foot glass fibre boat which was a replacement for the new Sea Rider dinghy which had been sabotaged. While these Sea Riders are modern and fast with built-in safety features, it appears from the Department's report that these boats are unsuitable for fishery patrol duties at sea unless accompanied by a larger vessel or mother ship.  It would appear that these boats are suitable only for inshore rescue, a task which is very efficiently done by the RNLI, but not for the duties of fishery patrol which necessitate the taking of nets from the sea, sometimes in very rough weather.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> I realise there is an inquiry pending and I have no wish to pre-empt the outcome. Nevertheless the publication of part of this confidential report raises serious questions concerning the safety of fisheries officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall, I ordered in early July last, following the tragic loss of four officers of the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board, that an investigation should be conducted into that tragedy.  I announced on 17 August last that I had directed the fisheries boards to undertake immediately an urgent review of equipment, personnel, training procedures and vessels used for deep water patrols to ensure the highest possible safety levels.  I also indicated on that occasion that I had directed the marine surveyors of my Department to provide such technical assistance as the boards might require in the conduct of this review and in ensuring the application of the safest possible operational procedures.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting the results of that review. I am assured that pending the results of the review the boards are taking a precautionary approach and that the interests of safety are being accorded paramount importance.  When I receive the results of the review I shall consider the implications and take whatever decisions are required.  I shall inform the House on these matters as appropriate.  I am not prepared to comment in any way at this time on any documents reported to be leaked.</P>
      <P>As a separate matter the Deputy will be aware that I have directed that a formal investigation should be held into the Ballycotton tragedy.  Arrangements for the conduct of the investigation are in hand.  I would ask Deputies and other commentators to show restraint on this topic as the relatives of the deceased in this tragic case have already suffered enough.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán <Col N="870" /> Ryan gave notice of this intention to raise a matter with reference to the designation of certain units at St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this serious matter.  The following motion will be discussed at a full meeting of the Eastern Health Board tomorrow:</P>
      <P>That the de-designation of areas of St. Ita's Hospital, as appropriate, be proceeded with as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The staff of the hospital and the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped are totally opposed to this very vague motion which is being rushed through without proper consultation and agreement with the parties involved.  In the reply to a question which I received earlier today, the Minister stated that negotiations are ongoing with the staff.  That may be so, but prior to this week the last discussions took place on 24 July 1989.  It is proposed to push through this motion tomorrow night.</P>
      <P>The staff have concerns.  They are talking about promotion opportunities, the status of temporary staff, further employees and whether they will be officers of the Eastern Health Board. These are valid concerns.</P>
      <P>The patients of St. Ita's are at present covered by the 1945 Mental Treatment Act.  If the current proposals go through the authorities will have no power to detain a patient should they feel it is in that patient's interest.  This is a matter which concerns me.  Under the same Act the health boards are obliged to provide professional care.  What assurance can the relatives be given that this will be the case when the changes come into operation?  The Minister should guarantee that professional service will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to superannuation.  Under the current proposals nurses who are redeployed arising from reorganisation of the psychiatric services will be permitted to retain superannuation rights on a personal basis.  This is totally unsatisfactory for staff who will <Col N="871" /> be expected to operate under the new arrangement.</P>
    <P>De-designation requires amended legislation which would incorporate a Bill of rights for patients and staff.  These proposals should be shelved pending such legislation.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a school of nursing.  Given the major developments proposed, I recommend that this be located at St. Ita's.  I would urge the Minister to provide the necessary finance. There has been a lack of maintenance at St. Ita's and certain parts of it are run down.  The Minister must ensure that the necessary facilities are provided to enable An Bord Altranais to locate the school at St. Ita's.</P>
    <P>This is a very sensitive proposal which will have far-reaching implications for staff and patients alike and should this motion be passed tomorrow by the Eastern Health Board I would ask the Minister not to sign the order until full and detailed negotiations are concluded with all the relevant parties to the satisfaction of all concerned.  It is a most urgent development and we must get a proper solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Ryan that he need have no fears.  There is a proposal before the Eastern Health Board to de-designate part of St. Ita's Hospital so that in future patients suffering from mental handicap will not be in the area controlled under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  Deputy Ryan seems to think that is not in their interest, but all the expert advice I get in my Department and outside it and from parents and friends of patients with a mental handicap is that they do not want them in psychiatric hospitals or hospitals controlled by the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  The proposal is in keeping with the best expert advice and the wishes of the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of elderly people in St. Ita's and the same thing will apply to them.  They will have their own unit and <Col N="872" /> special programmes will be organised for them in that unit.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that a very high quality service is available to all patients in Portrane.  Of course that will continue.  He need have no fears that because they are not in areas of the hospital controlled by the Mental Treatment Act the level of service will be diminished. The whole point of the exercise is to ensure that they get the very best service and that the services develop in accordance with the most modern thinking in each area.  I want to assure the Deputy that any changes implemented will come about in an organised and planned way.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place already with staff representatives; I think they have met twice to date.  Of course discussions will continue with the staff involved.  Also, guidelines have been laid down by my Department which are available to the hospital.  The approval of my Department must be sought for the changes taking place.  Of course, I support any change the prime objective of which is the interest of the patient.  I believe that what is proposed, or that these particular changes will be in the interests of the patient.</P>
    <P>I should say that the inspector of mental hospitals will have a role to play. His advice will be sought and will be available.  The Deputy has my assurance that the high quality of service will be maintained and that there will be the normal discussions with the staff involved about the proposed changes.  At this stage it is purely a proposal that is going before the health board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore gave me a notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the long waiting lists of patients awaiting heart by-pass operations, especially the case of a mother of four children.  The Deputy has five minutes and the Minister five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="873" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment. Throughout today, we have been dealing with a crisis, the life and death of the present Government, but I should like to deal now with the life and death crisis faced every day by more than 800 patients awaiting heart surgery.  I should like to instance one such case, a mother of four children who suffered a heart attack in August 1989.  Following an angiogram it was established that she had an 80 per cent blockage and was booked into the Mater Hospital for a triple by-pass operation in July this year.  Her problem is that she is at the bottom of the waiting list.  She knows she will have to wait two years or thereabouts before her operation can take place.  I have made inquiries about the case with the surgeon concerned and with the hospital.  The information I have been given is that the only operations now carried out &mdash; two per surgeon per week &mdash; are on emergency cases only; in other words, people who have already been hospitalised who await heart surgery.  Somebody who is at home awaiting heart surgery simply is not being operated on at present.  The only way such people can get their operation, quite literally, is in the event of their having another heart attack or becoming so seriously ill they have to be hospitalised and are then treated as an emergency. Quite literally these people, more than 800 patients, live in a form of death row.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the cardiac surgeons and the cardiologists have already brought this matter to the Minister's attention. They have told him that there is dire need, that people on the waiting lists run the risk of suffering a fatal heart attack. Doctor Kieran Daly, a cardiologist at University College Hospital, Galway, has said that two of his patients have already died awaiting surgery.  Mr. Maurice Nelligan said it is difficult to quantify the number of deaths which would have been prevented had patients been operated on sooner.  He went on to state that it was unacceptable that people should have to wait two or three years when the <Col N="874" /> duration on a normal waiting list should be two or three months.</P>
    <P>I understand that the cardiac surgeons had a meeting with the Minister not so long ago to discuss their demand that the number of heart operations on public patients be increased from the current rate of 500 annually to at least 1,000 annually, the level which had existed prior to the health cuts.  I understand they were told that the deputy chief medical officer in the Minister's Department was examining the position.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is unacceptable that people must wait so long for heart surgery, quite literally living with the terror of death.  It is the Minister's responsibility to take immediate, emergency action to prevent the loss of life of patients awaiting heart surgery and to do so now before anybody loses their life simply because they cannot be operated on in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>All countries are experiencing difficulty in meeting demands for high technology medicine and surgery; that is recognised. Indeed, in relation to heart by-pass operations, we undertake one and a half times more procedures per thousand patients than are undertaken in England and Wales, therefore, in terms of the numbers of operations being performed, our figure is higher than that obtaining across the water.  I suppose to an extent it is fair to say we are the victims of our own success in that, for example, since I assumed office, we installed £10 million worth of equipment at St. James's Hospital. The cardiac investigative equipment there is the most modern of its kind worldwide.  Because that type of high technology investigation is available, more people are finding their way on to the waiting lists for heart surgery.  Indeed the same applies in Galway where there is new investigative equipment they did not have before and people there are finding their way on to the waiting lists also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the points Deputy Gilmore raised about Dr. Daly in Galway and Mr. Nelligan.  I think Mr. Nelligan is <Col N="875" /> more honest than Dr. Daly when he says it is difficult to quantify which patients may be at risk on a waiting list whereas Dr. Daly stated categorically that two patients died as a result of not having had surgery.  Patients may be on a waiting list only a week and they may die; also patients not on the waiting list, unfortunately, die and this is very difficult to quantify.  We would be fooling ourselves if we thought we could eliminate waiting lists altogether since no country has managed to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason fewer operations are taking place is that in January of this year we gave the Mater Hospital exactly the same allocation as we had the previous year to perform 750 operations. When they were given their allocation the unilateral decision of the surgeons was that they would hold patients in hospitals for a longer period.  I do not fault that decision which was a clinical one. They then decided that, in order to do so, they would reduce the number of procedure to 500.  That was their decision, not ours; we had funded them for 750 procedures.  They did not come and tell me that at that stage.  They came to me at a later stage.  We addressed the issue.  We decided we would put new beds in place so that they could bring the number back up to 750.  We allocated them the money to do that.  They put their planning in place and they commenced the renovation of the necessary area of the hospital to provide more beds. As far as we are concerned, we did our bit to ensure that they could come back up to accommodating 750 cases annually. It was entirely a decision of the cardiac surgeons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The money was provided by my department for 750 procedures this year.  The chief medical <Col N="876" /> officer of my Department has investigated the position.  I will be meeting the Irish Cardiac Society, comprised of the physicians involved in assessing patients for cardiac surgery, in the near future. Within the next couple of months it would be our hope to improve the position considerably &mdash; apart altogether from what has happened in the Mater Hospital &mdash; bringing the number back up to 750 procedures.  It is important that the House realise that the Mater Hospital is not the only hospital in Ireland where cardiac open heart surgery is performed. It is performed also at the Cork Regional Hospital where a certain number are undertaken.</P>
      <P>On the question of the patient raised by Deputy Gilmore, the place on the list and when an operation is performed is entirely a matter for the clinician; it is not a matter for us.  I want to ensure that when we have a waiting list, because there will always be waiting lists unfortunately, they are at a level we can control. I want to ensure people can get treatment when they need it.  That is what we are doing.</P>

My question relates to the issue of the rules and regulations to be enforced on members of the Defence Forces when they meet within the barracks in pursuit of their interests and issues with regard to the formation of representations and representative associations.  Under existing rules and regulations it is necessary before a meeting can take place that the permission of the camp OC be obtained and that any meeting once convened must be by soldiers in uniform, whether outside the normal course of their duties.  Consequently, whenever the representative associations under current regulations want to meet to discuss their normal business they must get the permission of their OC in the first instance.  Secondly, they must wear their uniform.</P>

      <P>This question concerns the case of a retired commandant who served for 30 years in the FCA, then served for a further ten years on full-time security duty and who was due for promotion in 1988 but due to the embargo on promotions, and the fact that he would have taken up a promotion which would otherwise have gone to the Permanent Defence Forces, was encouraged to resign from full-time security duty and continue to serve for two years in the FCA.  As a result he lost the gratuity which he would otherwise have been entitled to.  I ask the Minister of State to <Col N="878" /> examine this.  It has been under examination for some time in the Department. The Department are taking the view that he voluntarily stood down.  I am challenging that.  I believe he was greatly encouraged to stand down.  There is correspondence to show that he did not voluntarily stand down and I ask that this be looked at because he has lost his gratuity.</P>

      <P>We will have to get used to this late night spirit.  My question today on Cambodia failed to elicit from the Minister for Foreign Affairs information on the present military position there.  I asked whether the advance of the Khmer Rouge within Cambodia was of such a nature that it was imperilling the UN initiative, yet the Minister's reply concentrated on the prospects for the UN initiative.  Therefore, I want to raise the question, is the advance of the Khmer Rouge, and their likely return, not posing a threat to the UN position and is there not a danger that the representative from the Council will be a Khmer Rouge representative?</P>

      <P>My question relates to the issue of the refuelling of US military aircraft at Shannon some weeks ago.  It was reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that a considerable number of troop carriers landed at Shannon and were refulled.  The excuse given was that they were in pursuit of a UN resolution in relation to the Gulf.  My understanding is that this activity was in advance of a decision of the UN, therefore they were in breach of Irish neutrality.  Clearly a case could be made for refuelling at Shannon if they were directly in pursuit of a decision of the UN.  Indeed, it is doubtful even at this time whether the US are complying with the UN mandate.  They are currently threatening to launch a war in the Gulf.  I ask the Minister to indicate what status Irish neutrality has in this day.  How do they define it?</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has seen the Greenpeace report in regard to the visit to Irish ports between 1982 and 1989 of US Navy warships.  Is he aware that the Greenpeace report states that ten out of the 13 ships which visited our ports were deployed on naval exercises and six of the 13 were carrying nuclear weapons? The Department of Foreign Affairs say that if they are carrying nuclear weapons, or have taken part in naval exercises, they should not enter Irish ports.  The US policy is that they will neither confirm or deny that they have nuclear weapons. Will the Minister therefore do as the Swedish Government are doing and demand guarantees from ships that they are not carrying nuclear weapons?  Since it must be well known to the Irish Government what US warships have nuclear capability and what ones have not nuclear capability, will the Minister in the meantime allow in those that have not got nuclear capability and have not taken part in naval exercises and ban all ships with nuclear capability unless he has a guarantee that they are not carrying nuclear weapons?</P>

      <P>My question relates to the nomination by the Irish national group for election to the International Court of Justice of Judge Pathak of India who was the judge responsible for imposing a highly unjust settlement on <Col N="880" /> the victims of the world's worst chemical disaster, the leaking of toxic chemical in Bhopal in India in which 10,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands were injured.  In reply to a question today the Minister effectively stated that it is the Government's intention to vote for the nomination of Judge Pathak and to avoid public responsibility for that decision by claiming that the elections are held by secret ballot.  Any vote of that nature which is made by the Irish Government should not be shrouded in secrecy.  The Irish public are entitled to know how our Government vote on matters of this kind.  My view, and I believe that of an increasing number of the public, is that the Irish Government should not support the nomination of Judge Pathak because of his involvement in the very unjust court settlement of the Bhopal affair.</P>

      <P>Again I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise the case of the Birmingham Six.  I asked the Minister of State this evening if he has made any representation to the British authorities to speed up the hearing of the Court of Appeal in the case of the Birmingham Six.  The facts of that case are well known to this House.  There is no need to reiterate them.  There is a motion unanimously passed by this House in support of their innocence and demanding their release. The question that faces us and the Minister of State here tonight is whether we can countenance the six innocent men spending their 17th Christmas in custody without any hope of release.  They have made their views known.  They cannot countenance it.  I do not think any of us here can.</P>
      <P>The time to stop expressing mere concern has come and I would ask the Minister of State to consider in Government a clear and unambiguous demand to the British Authorities, including the Director of Public Prosecutions and the UK Government that they would now proceed to the immediate release of the six innocent Birmingham defendants.</P>

      <P>My question is if any <Col N="881" /> target has been set for Irish overseas development aid for 1991.  I am disappointed with the reply given earlier today by the Minister on the question of reaching the target.  Statistics show that of the 18 wealthiest states of the OECD Ireland was at the bottom of the league in terms of its contribution to overseas development aid.  In the light of these figures, is it intended to increase Irish aid?  When is it expected we will reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP?  There has been a decline in overseas development aid over the last few years and it would make great sense to institute a programme over a period of years as suggested by Trócaire.  It should be brought up first of all to the 1986 level and then annually by 0.5 per cent until the target of 0.7 per cent is reached.  Will the Minister say that that is the policy of the Government?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, 14 million children under the age of five years die every year from the effects of malnutrition and preventable diseases. An estimated 40,000 children die each day in the developing world from easily preventable illnesses such as measles and diarrhoea as well as from malnutrition. It is against this backdrop that the Taoiseach signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  He was one of 71 world leaders who went to New York on 30 September last.  My question is about the ratification process. When will the Government increase their small contribution to aid developing countries?  Our contribution stands at the smallest percentage of GNP of 18 western industrialised nations.</P>
      <P>Finally, when are we going to resolve our own disgraceful abuse of children where we throw 15 year old girls into the likes of Mountjoy Prison?  I would argue that we should stop the hypocrisy of deciding on the rights of the child while we ourselves practice such primitive measures in dealing with our own children.</P>

My question relates to the practice whereby would-be emigrants to the United States, in the event of their request for a visa being turned down, have that rejection stamped on their passport. They may only be applying for the purpose of visiting the United States.  Yet that is a permanent rejection on the passport which is the property of the Irish State.  Circumstances may change; they may wish to travel on another occasion or to another country.  The passport is the property of the Irish State.  I wonder if the Minister would be agreeable to making representations to the American authorities to find some other device by which refusal on a particular occasion could be recorded rather than the permanent defacement of the passport.</P>

A large measure of agreement has already been reached as to the scope of representation etc.  At present more than 20 items, including remunerations, are being finalised within the scope of representations.

Some nine months later regulations were brought into operation but these arrangements did not apply to any member of the FCA other than those who were engaged on full-time security duties on 1 January 1989 some nine months later.  On this basis the person named is not eligible to avail himself of the particular arrangements.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy De Rossa's question, the US aircraft in question were given refuelling permission within the bounds of established policy, that is, in the event of an international crisis and in keeping with our commitment to uphold the UN Charter; and as the aircraft were being sent to the Gulf at the request of Kuwait and Saudia Arabia in the context of Article 51 of the Charter, which provides for the inherent right of individual or collective self defence of all member states.</P>
      <P>No comparable facilities have been requested or given to any other country.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, I am aware of the practice he refers to. However, as it is an internal US matter, I have no function in regard to it.</P>
      <P>I have, however, instructed the Passport Office to consider sympathetically an application for a replacement passport which they may receive from the holder of an Irish Passport who is unhappy with any endorsement made on it by the authorities of another state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Mac Giolla's question my attention has been drawn to the <Col N="884" /> report which, as the Minister indicated in a reply submitted to Parliamentary Question No. 49, he intends to study carefully. I believe that existing procedures in relation to visits of foreign vessels are adequate to ensure that Government policy is complied with.  At first reading the Greenpeace report offers no proof that any of the US ships which visited Irish ports did in fact carry nuclear weapons.  As I said, the Minister intends to study the report very carefully.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Gilmore's question, I am aware that Judge Pathak gave a judgment which imposed an unfair and inadequate settlement on the Bhopal victims. I am not prepared to comment on the laws of another state or their interpretation by the courts.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Pat McCartan, the question of the timing of this appeal is in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is an independent law officer.  The British Authorities are, however, aware of the Government's wish for a speedy resolution of the case. I go along with the Deputy's comments that they should not spend a seventeenth Christmas in jail.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware from my speech to this House on 29 August of the Government's position in relation to the Iraqi invasion and purported annexation of Kuwait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government firmly believe that it is important to do everything possible to bring about a peaceful solution which will avoid the use of force.  This is the basis of our response to the crisis, and of the measures we have taken towards a resolution of the situation.  Our efforts to achieve such a solution include full support for UN Security Council resolutions which, <i>inter alia,</i> call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and the immediate start of negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait; the <Col N="688" /> imposition of trade sanctions against Iraq; and the demand that Iraq permit and facilitate the departure from Iraq and Kuwait of all foreign nationals.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also participated in making and implementing decisions within the European Community in relation to the crisis, and has supported the Community's willingness to assist those countries which are confronted by special economic problems arising from the carrying out of the UN measures.</P>
    <P>As part of the EC Ministerial Troika, I participated in a visit to Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt on 15-17 August where we had valuable discussions with the leadership of three countries which play a vital role in the current situation.  During my attendance at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September, I had bilateral meetings with the Emir of Kuwait and the Foreign Ministers of Syria, Iran, Oman and Turkey. The Troika of EC Ministers had discussions with the Foreign Minister of Iran, and the twelve Foreign Ministers of the Community had discussions with their counterparts within the Gulf Co-operation Council.  In all of these discussions I have made clear, either on a bilateral basis or in co-ordination with our partners in the Community, our views on the need for a peaceful solution consistent with the Resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council.</P>
    <P>The European Council, meeting in Rome on 27 October and attended by the Taoiseach and myself, issued a declaration on the Gulf crisis and the Middle East which fully reflects the position of the Government and which reiterates the Community's position relating to an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the release from Iraq and Kuwait of all foreign nationals who wish to leave.</P>
    <P>As I said to this House on 29 August, the Government recognise the sense of frustration and helplessness which is felt by many Irish people who have relatives in Kuwait and Iraq.  In concert with our partners in the Community we are doing everything possible to deal with the difficulties caused to Irish citizens by Iraq's actions.  It is not within our power to <Col N="689" /> bring our citizens home without the acquiescence of the Iraqi authorities. Through our embassy in Baghdad, and through the representatives there of the EC Presidency, we have repeatedly made clear our demands for the release of our citizens.  We shall continue, however, to insist that the rights of Irish citizens and of all foreign nationals in Iraq be respected.</P>
    <P>The measures which I have outlined are intended to place economic and political pressure where it needs to be placed; on the Iraqi authorities in whose power lies the remedy to the current crisis.  Ireland will continue to act in concert with our partners in the European Community to seek to bring home to Iraq the illegality of its actions in relation to Kuwait and the detention of foreign citizens, and its isolation in terms of the international community while it refuses to comply with the terms of the Resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council.</P>

      <P>Ireland has nine members of the Economic and Social Committee.  Under present arrangements, three members represent labour, three represent employers, two represent agriculture and one represents the social sector.  Nominations for candidates and alternates are sought by the Government from representative bodies in each of the sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July this year when the committee was being renewed, the Government asked those bodies to have regard to the concerns of women and young people <Col N="690" /> when making their nominations.  This is in line with the Government's view that as many women as possible should be represented on committees under the auspices of the European Community.  In the event, however, none of the bodies concerned nominated a woman for appointment as representative.  I am fully conscious of the absence of women among Ireland's representatives on the committee to date and I will consider what can be done to redress this situation when representatives are next appointed to the committee in 1994.  A possible approach might be to include a major women's organisation among the nominating bodies for the committee to be appointed in 1994.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report and its conclusions which were presented in 1988 and have been considered by me and by my Department with a view to adopting whatever recommendations were deemed appropriate for application in our bilateral aid programme.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report were quite numerous, almost 30 in number, and many did not confine themselves to the question of the evaluation process but ranged over wider issues such as general policy, staffing and organisational structures and social and cultural aspects of aid programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> As to the recommendation for a detailed policy statement to which the Deputy refers I would point out that statements on our aid policy have been made both inside and outside this House. In summary our objective is to contribute through our bilateral official aid programme to the Third World and to concentrate on helping the poorer countries of sub-Saharan Africa to combat the causes of poverty and distress among their people.  We have identified four priority countries &mdash; Lesotho, Sudan, Zambia and Tanzania &mdash; with a view to assisting the Governments of these countries in their efforts to achieve self-sustaining economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>As regards the members of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD many have issued detailed policy statements on their aid programmes; however such programmes are in general very much larger than our bilateral aid programme.  As regards the recommendations on the evaluation process steps have been taken to strengthen the technical capacity involved in managing the programme and also the selection, evaluation monitoring procedures used.  I might add that several measures were already in place before the report issued.  I can assure the Deputy that continuous assessment of how we implement our programme is a normal element of the work of the Development Aid Division of my Department.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the document to which the Deputy refers in which the <Col N="692" /> USSR Supreme Soviet launched an appeal to Parliaments and Peoples of the World and emphasized that the Soviet Union was prepared to extend indefinitely its 12 month pause in nuclear testing. The Supreme Soviet indicated, however, that this offer was conditional on the US Government discontinuing its own nuclear testing programme.</P>
      <P>Recently the United States has made it clear at the United Nations General Assembly that they continue to believe in the need for a US nuclear test programme. We have learned subsequently that the USSR has now resumed its underground nuclear testing, thus ending its unilateral pause in nuclear testing, with obvious consequences for the offer contained in the Appeal of the Supreme Soviet.</P>
      <P>The Government believe that a total prohibition on nuclear testing should be the first step in halting the nuclear arms race.  In that context we have called for a complete moratorium on nuclear testing and we have repeatedly called for the immediate negotiation of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  We have noted some recent positive developments, including the agreement between USA and USSR on ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty.  For our own part we shall continue to work, in multilateral fora such as the United Nations, and in our bilateral contacts to promote the achievement of an end to all nuclear testing.</P>

      <P>The Government have made clear that, while continuing to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement fully, we would be prepared to contemplate, in agreement with the British Government, a new and better structure, agreement or arrangement to transcend the existing one.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The procedure for election of judges to the International Court of Justice is laid down in the Statute of the court.  It provides for the nomination of candidates by independent national groups and for the election of the judges by the General Assembly and the Security Council from the panel of nominees thus constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> The nomination of Judge Pathak was by the Irish National Group.  This group is independent of the Government in its deliberations and decisions on nominations. Neither I nor the Government have any role in nominations.  Nomination by the Irish group does not have any implications for the support which the Government may or may not give to any particular candidate in the election.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made about the nomination by various groups, including Earthwatch, that they believe that Judge Pathak, in a decision arising out of the accident in Bhopal, imposed an unfair and inadequate settlement on the victims.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Group for the nomination of candidates for election to the International Court of Justice is comprised of the Attorney General, Mr. Justice Hamilton (President of the High Court), Mr. Frederick Morris, SC, and Ms. Skinner, Legal Adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>As regards withholding support for Judge Pathak, the Deputy will be aware that these elections are by secret ballot. I do not propose, therefore, to indicate those candidates which the Government intends to support in the election.  The decision thereon, which has not yet been considered, will be taken closer to the date of the election.  However, I can assure the Deputy that all relevant information in relation to the various candidates and the representations made will be taken into account when deciding which candidates to support.</P>

      <P>In response to the crisis in the Gulf, three specialist agencies of the United Nations, UNDRO (United <Col N="696" /> Nations Disaster Relief Organisation), UNRWA (United Nations Relief Works Agency) and UNICEF (United Nations International Childrens Education Fund) made a series of international appeals as did other aid and relief agencies for funding to assist the repatriation of migrant workers from Iraq and Kuwait. Ireland has provided IR £158,000 in respect of appeals from the European Community, Concern, the International Red Cross and Trócaire.</P>
      <P>In September, the United States made a démarche to all European Community capitals raising the question of economic support for those states most severely affected by the economic consequences of the Gulf crisis, in particular as a result of the implementation of sanctions against Iraq and Kuwait.</P>
      <P>This approach by the United States was made after a decision had been taken in principle by Ministers meeting in European Political Co-operation in Rome on 7 September to provide short term financial assistance to Egypt, Jordan, and Turkey to offset the effects of implementing the embargo.  EC Foreign Ministers decided on 1 October, to provide the sum of 1.5 billion ECU for this purpose, to be funded through the Community budget and through bilateral contributions from member states.  Ireland, as a member of the Community, will contribute through the Community Budget and bilaterally. This aid will be part of a wider international effort in which the US and others are also participating.</P>

In addition, we have raised specific incidents with the authorities of the countries concerned and will continue to do so as the need arises.</P>

To this end the Community has long supported the principle of the convening, at an appropriate time of an international peace conference.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>To date no applications for passport facilities on behalf of children who were recently adopted in accordance with the Romanian law on adoption have been received.  No passports have, accordingly, been issued.</P>
      <P>Such applications, when they are received, will be considered in accordance with the normal rules governing the issue of such facilities to children.  These rules mainly relate to the establishment of the Irish citizenship of the children and the production of the written witnessed consent of the children's legal guardians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the issue of citizenship, that of children adopted under Irish law is addressed in section 11 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956. As regards children adopted under non-Irish law, I understand that the Department of Justice is prepared to consider sympathetically applications for citizenship via naturalisation subject to certain conditions.  Applications for passports on behalf of children adopted <Col N="700" /> under Romanian law have, accordingly, to be accompanied by Certificates of Naturalisation and the children's Romanian birth certificates.</P>
    <P>As regards the written witnessed consent of the adopted children's guardians, which is required in the case of all adopted children, such consent can only be accepted from persons whose legal status as guardians is recognised under Irish law.  The Passport Office would, of course, be guided in such matters by the current law in the subject.</P>

      <P>The Government's basic position on sanctions against South Africa remains that their purpose is to encourage the South African Government peacefully to dismantle the apartheid system and, to this end, to engage in negotiations with the majority community. The intention in imposing sanctions has never been to seek to destroy the South African economy or to hurt the economically vulnerable in South Africa. For these reasons the Government have never favoured the imposition of comprehensive sanctions but have said that sanctions should be selective, carefully targeted and graduated.  The Government believe, further, that sanctions should only be maintained for as long as is strictly necessary.</P>
      <P>We believe that the sanctions and other forms of pressure imposed on South Africa by the international community have had a role in bringing about the changes we have witnessed so far.  The Government welcome these changes, which allow us to hope that substantive negotiations on a new united, democratic and non-racial South Africa may get under way before too long.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed to the CSCE process as an essential means of promoting peace, security and co-operation in Europe.  Along with our partners in the Twelve, we have put forward proposals in all the areas covered by the CSCE Final Act.  These cover co-operation in the areas of security, economics, science, technology and the environment, as well as in the humanitarian, cultural and information fields.</P>
      <P>At a time when the continent is actively engaged in surmounting its divisions, the CSCE provides a framework within which the participating states can establish a new set of relations, based on the Helsinki Principles, maintain stability, and promote co-operation among themselves. The Paris Summit next month will define the crucial role which the CSCE will play in the future architecture of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Paris Summit is expected to reach agreement on the establishment of new <Col N="704" /> CSCE institutions which will provide a political forum for deciding on future European co-operation in a wide range of fields, including security and disarmament. It is expected that a conflict prevention centre will also be established. Initially this centre will largely be concerned with the implementation of confidence and security-building measures, but it may develop additional functions, including a role in the peaceful settlement of disputes.</P>
    <P>In relation to disarmament, the current negotiations on security in Vienna, taking place within the CSCE framework, are contributing in their separate ways to increasing mutual trust and bringing about a more peaceful and stable Europe. Important agreements, affecting the levels of conventional armaments, will be concluded in the negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe.  It is expected that substantial progress will also be achieved in the negotiations on confidence and security-building measures.</P>
    <P>The results of both sets of negotiations will be placed before the Paris Summit. These agreements will represent a significant step forward in co-operation between the CSCE states on security matters.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we look forward to the commencement of discussions among the 34 participating countries aimed at establishing, by 1992, a process of disarmament and confidence-building measures open to all CSCE members who wish to participate.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a report, produced by Green-peace, which shows that nearly half of the US navy warships that visited Irish ports during the 1980s had been officially inspected and cleared to carry nuclear weapons before leaving the US and that nearly all visits were conducted by warships participating in major naval exercises in the North Atlantic; if, in view of this information and repeated assurances from successive Governments that Irish policy prohibits foreign naval vessels visiting Irish ports carrying nuclear weapons or forming part of naval exercises, he intends to introduce any new procedures to ensure that foreign naval ships comply with Irish policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that the Green-peace report to which the Deputy refers is entitled &ldquo;US Navy Warships in Irish Ports 1980-1990: their nuclear weapons and naval operations&rdquo;.  My attention has been drawn to this report which was published last week, and I intend studying the information contained in it very carefully.</P>
      <P>Our policy with regard to the visits of naval vessels is clear: permission to enter Irish territory and ports will not be granted to any vessel with nuclear weapons on board.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is our policy to issue permission for a vessel to visit provided that such a visit does not form part of a naval exercise.  This has been the policy of successive Governments and I believe that existing procedures are adequate to ensure that the conditions laid down in this regard are upheld.  These procedures are based on the clear unequivocal statement of policy by the Government and the recognition and respect of that policy by other, friendly governments.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, I shall be studying the report in detail.  However, at first reading it would appear that the evidence which it cites is almost entirely of a circumstantial nature, and that no proof has been provided that any of the US ships which visited Irish ports did in fact carry nuclear weapons.</P>

The Government Orders governing extradition which are currently in force in relation to the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands are contained in Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 1989 and Statutory Instrument No. 115 of 1989.  The first mentioned enables the state to give effect, in relation to those two countries, to its obligations under the European Convention on Extradition. The latter enables the implementation of the provisions relating to serious crimes contained in the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.

      <P>The Taoiseach had a wideranging discussion with Mr. Nelson Mandela at Dublin Castle on 2 July.  Mr. Mandela expressed his appreciation of the support given by the people of Ireland to the struggle against apartheid and spoke favourably of the conduct by the Taoiseach of the European Council discussions in Dublin in June on the issue of Twelve policy towards South Africa.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mandela briefed the Taoiseach on the stage reached at that time in the talks between the ANC and the South African Government on the removal of obstacles to negotiations.  Mr. Mandela also addressed the question of participation in negotiations and said the ANC recognised that there were other parties in South Africa and that they, too, would have to be involved in the negotiating process.  The ANC was of the view, however, that to secure a place at the table, participants should be democratically elected in non-racial elections.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mandela emphasised the importance of a black community which is united.  To this end, and despite its opposition to the Government's homelands policy, the ANC had already had talks with homeland leaders and had secured the support of the majority of them for the position represented by the ANC in its talks with the Government.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mandela also spoke of the need for external financial assistance to help the ANC meet the costs associated with the return of political exiles and rebuild the ANC within South Africa.  Mr. Mandela expressed the hope that the Government would be able to contribute financially to the ANC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, I can state that the Government have made available the sum of £25,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for his special programme to assist the return of exiles to South Africa.  Members of the ANC, of course, stand to benefit indirectly from such assistance.  It may <Col N="708" /> also be possible to consider the provision of other types of development assistance for the black community, as bilateral aid programme funds permit.  Also, the Government have and are continuing to provide assistance to the black community through United Nations trust funds, such as the UN Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa.  There is no reason why members of the ANC should not also benefit from such assistance.</P>

      <P>The Government are keeping under constant review the situation now developing in Ethiopia, where an estimated four million people are at risk from famine.  From the outset of the crisis last autumn, the Government have taken action to assist the victims.  To date this year £315,000 has been allocated from the disaster relief fund to assist emergency relief operations in Ethiopia.  In 1989 £450,000 was also provided for relief operations there.</P>
      <P>The Government remain very deeply concerned about the situation in Ethiopia and have been to the forefront in efforts by the Community &mdash; particularly during the period of the Irish Presidency &mdash; to relieve the suffering of the Ethiopian people and to bring an end to the long-running civil war there.  All the parties involved in the Ethiopian conflict have been made aware, on many occasions, of the importance which the EC attaches to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Sustained pressure has also been applied to ensure that all parties co-operate in ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches the affected areas.</P>
      <P>Ethiopia is the subject of regular discussion within the framework of European political co-operation and I can assure the Deputy that Ireland, together with the rest of the Twelve, will continue to take an active interest in the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that our priority is to ensure that food reaches those in need but that his objective is greatly hindered by the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia. Although a relief corridor by road to Tigre and a UN airlift to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, are in operation, the <Col N="710" /> relief effort cannot be fully effective without the use of the port of Massawa as a point of access for international relief. The Community and its member states have repeatedly appealed for its reopening for relief purposes and for the resumption of negotiations for a peaceful settlement between the conflicting parties. The Government will continue to support all efforts made towards achieving these ends.</P>

      <P>As I said to the House on 29 August last, in accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter, member states of the United Nations are providing support for the development of the forces being sent to the Gulf at the request of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  In our case, the refuelling facilities given at Shannon are within the bounds of established policy in the event of an international crisis.  Such facilities are in keeping with our commitment to uphold the UN Charter and to ensure that it is respected in all its aspects.  The UN Security Council, in its Resolution 661 response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, specifically cites Article 51 of the Charter, which provides for the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence of all member states.</P>
      <P>The troops transported through Shannon were provided in response to a request for assistance from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

The Sudanese Government has been made aware on a number of occasions of the concerns of the Community and its member states regarding the human rights situation in that country.  These concerns were also made known during Ireland's Presidency of the Community. In addition, work on drawing up the programme of assistance for Sudan under <Col N="716" /> the Lomé IV Convention has been postponed in the light of the serious concerns about human rights abuses there.</P>

It will be recalled that extensive arrangements for co-operation between the Community and the four other States involved, including trade or trade and co-operation agreements, already exist.

      <P>Initial discussion of how the Community could best assist the process of reform in the Soviet Union took place at the Dublin European Council in June. Last weekend's European Council reiterated the importance attached by the Community to the success of the reforms undertaken by the Government of the Soviet Union.  It expressed its will that the community should make a substantial, concrete contribution to the success of these efforts by means of co-operation in various areas.  The Commission, in line with the mandate given to it at the Dublin European Council, has been engaged in the preparation of proposals for both short and longer term assistance.  It has been instructed to submit such proposals before the next European Council, to be held on 14-15 December.  Should any emergency action become necessary in the meantime, the Council of Ministers will on the basis of Commission proposals take whatever decisions are required. Furthermore, the European Council also asked the Commission to put forward proposals for a major commercial, scientific and technical co-operation agreement with the USSR.  This would build upon the trade and co-operation agreement which entered into force in April.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully endorses the approach adopted by the European Council.  It is in everyone's interests that the reform process in the Soviet Union succeed and it is right that we in the Community support and assist the reforms being undertaken. The precise form and scope of the assistance to be offered remain to be decided; it is to be hoped that the next European Council will be in a position to take the necessary decisions on the basis of Commission proposals.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding this issue remains basically the same as outlined in my reply of 13 February, 1990. As I indicated at the time, the problem arises because BCG vaccinations are not normally administered by US health authorities.  Accordingly, when Irish immigrants react positively on being screened for tuberculosis, the US health authorities conducting the test assume that the person in question is in need of treatment for the disease.  Particular problems arise for children who are required to undergo a course of treatment before being allowed to attend school.</P>
      <P>My Department have been in communication with the Department of Health on this issue.  In addition, the Consulates General have made vigorous representations to the appropriate health authorities in the United States and these discussions are continuing.

      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax office dealing with the tax affairs of one of the spouses is the subject of industrial action due to the non-replacement of a member of staff.  The trade union which represents clerical assistants in the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes, has refused, as a matter of policy, to allow its members to do the work allocations of non-replaced officers.  Consequently, a full review of both taxpayers' liability has not been carried out in this case to date. However, the recent introduction of recruitment of clerical assistants will ease the situation.  Consideration and priority will be given to the cases which are in arrears.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have assured me that they are making every effort to resolve this matter through local negotiations with the union concerned and the redeployment and allocation of staff resources whenever possible.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the <Col N="723" /> Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 27 February, 1990 and that in consequence, she submitted a claim for repayment of tax to her Inspector of Taxes on 5 March 1990.  A cheque in settlement for £26.82 was issued to the taxpayer on 10 May 1990.</P>
      <P>A complete review of the taxpayer's liability for 1989-90 has now been carried out.  A balancing statement for the year 1989-90 was issued to her on 24 October 1990, advising her of a further repayment of tax of £230.40, and a cheque in settlement for this amount will be issued in the near future.</P>

From this comprehensive, agreed profile of the total farm enterprise, the family farm income per farm worker was then calculated by reference to standard net margins used by Teagasc, etc.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 27 June 1990 (columns 1027-1029, Volume 400) to questions regarding the passing on of benefits arising from a strong Irish pound in the form of lower prices to the consumer.  In that reply, I was able to draw the attention of this House to the latest official figures for the consumer price index indicating that the annual rate of inflation had fallen from 4.2 per cent in mid-February to 3.5 per cent in mid-May, maintaining the downward trend evident since early 1990. The latest official figures confirm that the downward trend has been maintained, with the annual rate of inflation having fallen again to 2.9 per cent as of mid-August 1990.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate of the Irish pound against sterling has weakened in recent months, returning to about the levels applying at this time last year.  Thus, the Deputy's current reference to weak sterling is not soundly based.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 5 September 1989 to 15 September 1990, that is for a total of 323 days.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> In recent years I have introduced initiatives to allow long term unemployed people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance to participate in educational courses both at second level and at third level.  Under the vocational training opportunities scheme participants may attend courses specifically designed for them which enable them to study up to leaving certificate level.  While attending the courses participants receive an allowance from the VEC instead of their unemployment payments.  I have also made regulations which allow the long term unemployed to take up full-time general second level courses while continuing to receive their unemployment assistance payments.</P>
    <P>There is also a pilot scheme in operation this year in which a limited number of places are available to enable the long term unemployed to pursue third level courses while continuing to receive a weekly payment equivalent to their unemployment assistance payments.</P>
    <P>All the education initiatives introduced for the unemployed are aimed at those who are regarded as being in the less well off categories i.e. those who are long term unemployed and in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned is not in receipt of long term unemployment assistance she is not eligible to participate in the second level scheme.</P>

      <P>The Government have again approved the payment of a Christmas bonus this year.  It will be paid during the first week in December at the same rate as last year i.e. 70 per cent of normal weekly payments.  The cost of the bonus this year is £25.6 million, an increase of £1.6 million on last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> The Christmas bonus payment will be paid to pensioners and other people receiving long term social welfare and health payments including the elderly, widows, lone parents and the long term unemployed.  It will also be paid to those receiving the new carer's allowance.  In all almost one million people will benefit i.e. 595,000 recipients and their 370,000 dependants.</P>
    <P>The bonus will mean that a couple on a full old age (contributory) pension, both aged over 66, will get an extra £75 bringing their payment in the bonus week to £182.20.  A couple with five children on long term unemployment assistance will get a bonus of £96.60 bringing their payment that week to £234.60.  A lone parent with four children will receive £181.90 which includes a bonus of £74.90.</P>
    <P>The bonus was introduced originally for elderly and other pensioners.  It was subsequently extended to include the long term unemployed in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The long term sick who are in receipt of invalidity pension are also covered.</P>
    <P>Disability and unemployment benefit are regarded as short term payments and there are no proposals to extend the Christmas bonus to recipients of those payments.</P>

He appealed against the disallowance and the appeals officer also decided that he had failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme provides for the payment of fuel allowances during the heating season to persons receiving various long term pensions and allowances.  The eligible categories <Col N="742" /> include certain persons in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate.  Persons receiving short term unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit and other short term benefits and allowances are not qualified for receipt of the allowance.</P>
      <P>The conditions for receipt of the fuel allowance also provide that the recipient must be living alone or with dependants in respect of whom increases of the pension or allowances are payable.  A person may however also qualify if any other member of the household would otherwise be eligible for the allowance in his or her own right.  In addition, in accordance with an extension of the scheme which was introduced for the first time this current fuel season, a person may now qualify if he or she is residing with a person who is in receipt of unemployment assistance at the short term rate.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate.  However, the person's wife is currently in receipt of unemployment benefit and is not therefore deemed to be a dependant for social welfare purposes or in receipt of one of the social welfare pensions, allowances or assistance referred to.  Accordingly, the fuel allowance cannot be granted in this case.</P>

The effect of this redesignation would be that the accommodation for the mentally handicapped and elderly would no longer be classified as psychiatric hospital accommodation under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945. Care programmes to meet the specific needs of these groups of patients are being developed by the board and the proposed redesignation will facilitate this process.  The Eastern Health Board has also indicated that negotiations are ongoing with staff representatives regarding its proposals.</P>

In this case, however, I understand that accommodation is available only on the evening service to Graiguenamanagh national school.</P>

      <P>My Department is satisfied that the second level education needs of students from Lifford are adequately served by the Raphoe centre and school transport to Raphoe is available to these students. The number of pupils leaving primary schools in Lifford would not be sufficient to maintain another post-primary school in the Raphoe/Lifford area.</P>

      <P>The current funding provided to County Kildare VEC from my Department for the five years from 1985 to 1989 inclusive is as follows: 1985 &mdash; £4,237,523; 1986 &mdash; £4,782,476; 1987 &mdash; £5,092,321; 1988 &mdash; £4,443,161; and 1989 &mdash; £4,414,964.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to point out that repayments to the local loans fund by the VEC ceased as from 1 May 1988.

      <P>It should be noted that matriculation requirements and course entry requirements prescribed for admission to particular courses are matters for the individual third level colleges concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from the current academic year I have reduced the academic requirements necessary under the higher education grants scheme from four to two grade Cs in higher level papers thus bringing them into line with normal matriculation requirements.  The basis for the general requirement of a minimum of two grade Cs in higher level papers in the leaving certificate examination for purposes of the higher education grants scheme is to give financial <Col N="760" /> assistance to students who reach the prescribed standard in the leaving certificate but who, because of family financial circumstances, might not be in a position to proceed to a university or other approved third level course of education.  The higher education grants scheme is, therefore, based firstly on attainment and secondly on the need for financial assistance. It is considered that these academic requirements for purposes of the grants scheme are reasonable.</P>
    <P>While there is no specific provision in the higher education grants scheme relating to mature students, there is no upper age limit in the scheme at present and it is, therefore, open to a mature student to sit the leaving certificate examination in the normal way for the purposes of qualifying for a grant on grounds of academic attainments and means.</P>

Such approval is confined to schools which fall into either of two categories: (a) those which had a four year junior cycle in the 1985-86 school year and (b) those which had a transition year course in the 1987-88 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 124 schools have been given approval to provide transition year programmes. A further 84 schools have the option of seeking approval.

      <P>I am aware of the proposals relating to future policy development for the railways which were tabled by the EC Commission at the December 1989 Council meeting of the Ministers of Transport.  These proposals, which cover a range of railway activities, including the development of a European high speed rail network and the greater use of combined transport facilities, envisage the separation of responsibility for providing rail infrastructure, including the permanent way, from other rail activities.  A more enhanced role is envisaged in these proposals for member state governments in relation to responsibility <Col N="763" /> for provision of the appropriate infrastructure. These proposals would have important budgetary implications for the Exchequer and are being studied carefully by my Department.</P>
      <P>It has also been agreed by the Council of Ministers that the development of a high speed network and the greater use of combined transport facilities should be treated as priority issues by member states.  The Commission's proposals in these areas have been the subject of detailed discussions by member states over the past ten months.</P>
