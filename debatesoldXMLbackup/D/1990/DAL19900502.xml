      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Dukes in that message of congratulations to the Garda.  In view of the paramilitary involvement in the attempted bank robbery yesterday, may I ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for Justice will be making a statement in this House today in relation to the implications for security policy?  Perhaps the <Col N="318" /> Taoiseach did not hear what I said.

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be helpful to you.  Is it the case, Sir, that you can properly say &mdash; and I ask this for information and clarification &mdash; where it appears that the House has been misled by a statement by a member of the Government that the matter does not arise now?  It seems to me that if there is confusion of that kind it is the right of the House and the Government's obligation to set the record straight immediately. It appears that there has been a difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between the statements made by the Tánaiste in the House last week and information given by a senior official in the Department of Agriculture and Food on the matter of a submission to Brussels in relation to the disadvantaged areas.  I would think if there is any confusion of that kind the Government would wish to clear this mataer up very quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter that should arise on the Order of Business. There are obviously other ways of raising such matters and dealing with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing I wish to do is to frustrate you, but I want the House to have clear information.  It appears, Sir, that the Tánaiste made a statement to the House last week which subsequent information has indicated to be untrue or inaccurate.  I know the Government would wish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes, you know full well that if Members are <Col N="321" /> dissatisfied with a Minister's, Tánaiste's or Taoiseach's reply they have a remedy in this House.  The Order of Business is not the way to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The remedy we have in this House in the event of such misleading information being given out is the protection the Chair gives to Members, and the protection of the rights of Members by the Chair has not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not inferring in any way that the Chair is lacking in its duty. I am appealing to the Chair to carry out its duty and to give the Deputies in this House the protection that Standing Orders give us.  I ask you, Sir, to put it to the Government that since there appears to be a divergence between a statement by the Tánaiste and a statement of a senior official in the Department of Agriculture and Food, you should now invite the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture and Food or the Tánaiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The reason for section 5 is to allow a period of 12 months for taking proceedings for an offence under the Industrial Relations Act rather than the six months provided for in the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  It does not make anything an offence which is not an offence before the passing of the Act, so the proposed period of one year will allow more time for the preparation and assessment of cases prior to prosecution.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 1 and 2, in the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo;, to delete &ldquo;having previously worked for that person&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or who acquires an undertaking for which one or more workers work or have worked&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two distinct points involved here.  The definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; relates to the final phrase which states, &ldquo;having previously worked for that person&rdquo;.  My amendment proposes that that should be excised.  On Second Stage I dwelt at length on why that should be the case and I pointed out how punitive <Col N="328" /> it would be if that definition was enshrined in the eventual Act.  The substitute being proposed is the phrase, &ldquo;or who acquires an undertaking for which one or more workers work or have worked&rdquo;.  There are any number of suggested cases one could mention of where it may well be possible to establish that one or more workers, work, worked, or normally worked in the past but the requirement &ldquo;having previously worked for that person&rdquo; would seriously limit the possibilities in a trade dispute at any subsequent stage.  In addition it entirely rules out circumstances where there has been a transfer of undertaking or where a new business acquires an old business in which a number of workers worked in the past.  Under the Minister's definition they are excluded.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that workers have the freedom to prosecute a trade dispute in the employment in which they had worked previously or where an entrepreneur buys the business.  Under the definition in the Bill those workers would be considered as people who never worked previously for the person who is the new owner although they may have earned their livelihood in that business. It is imperative that the Minister accede to this moderation of the definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Rabbitte I wonder if his amendment will have the effect he wishes.  While the definition seems to be badly drafted there is a danger that if we accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment in its present form it might have an adverse effect on certain workers.  For instance, it may hinder workers who had been dismissed, or purported to have been dismissed, by the employer who is party to the dispute. That is a danger I see in the Deputy's amendment.  The phrase, &ldquo;or seek to work having previously worked for that person&rdquo;, covers those who might have been dismissed and arising out of that dismissal may be in dispute with the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is provided for <Col N="329" /> in the Bill is an objective definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; for the purpose of defining the parties to a trade dispute.  An employer must be a legal entity or a person and for this reason the use of the term, &ldquo;in that employment&rdquo;, as proposed by Deputy Jim Mitchell, would not be appropriate or satisfactory.  It is not possible to define &ldquo;employer&rdquo; by reference to a particular sector or job.  I expect that the amendments being proposed by Deputies O'Sullivan and Rabbitte are aimed at the exceptional circumstances that arose in the 1959 case of Roundabout <i>v.</i> Beirne.  What happened in that case was most unusual and has not, to my knowledge, been repeated in any case in the 30 years since.  It was clearly used to get around the provisions of the legislation and I doubt if such an attempt would succeed today if it did arise.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in the Bill is sufficiently comprehensive and to amend it in the way proposed by Deputies O'Sullivan and Rabbitte would be too far reaching.  It would leave the definition much too wide.  The circumstances in the Roundabout <i>v.</i> Beirne case were quite exceptional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that what the Minister has included in the Bill is clear enough.  I acknowledge that there are some difficulties in accepting what Deputy Rabbitte has proposed but I have no doubt that the House is united in trying to cover adequately the rights of workers.  We should consider this matter between now and Report Stage.  It is my view that to include the phrase &ldquo;in that employment&rdquo; would be a correct addition to the section.  On reflection it might have been better if we deleted &ldquo;for that person&rdquo; and inserted &ldquo;in that employment&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;work&rdquo;.  There is a problem in regard to a change of ownership of a concern.  The rights of workers have to be protected regardless of the ownership of a concern.  One employer selling a company cannot sell away the rights of the workers.  I should like to give notice that on Report Stage I intend introducing an amendment to give <Col N="330" /> greater clarity to the meaning of the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate on Committee Stage because I was unable to participate on Second Stage.  We are dealing with a comprehensive Bill and the definitions are an essential requirement of it.  It is essential that they should be clear, unambiguous and explicit.  It does not augur well for Committee Stage if the Minister offers an opinion that he does not think it is likely that a person might attempt to get around the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; because since the Roundabout <i>v.</i> Beirne case in 1959 a similar case has not arisen.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the gestation period of this legislation which goes back to the former Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, who is now a member of the European Parliament for the Minister constituency, when he initiated attempted industrial relations reform in 1977, it is quite clear that we are not likely to be here again debating constructive legislation unless we get this one wrong.  For that reason, we will have to go through this Bill with a fine tooth comb.</P>
      <P>The Minister is experienced in industrial relations and he expressed the view that someone may wish to evade their responsibilities in law by virtue of being an employer, by disposing or transferring their interest which is, in effect, the intent of Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan's amendment. The Minister will be familiar with the origins of this recommendation, it clearly comes from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with whom &mdash; as recently as today &mdash; there have been discussions between officials of his Department and representatives of Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ingenuity or capacity of employers since 1959 to frustrate the legal requirements of the State as evidenced in the foods and meat industry alone has not diminished.  We are talking at all times about the worst cases &mdash; we must provide for the most extreme and abusive cases &mdash; because we only need one to frustrate the rights of a worker in a particular enterprise.  It is quite possible, in an <Col N="331" /> enterprise in dispute, where the employer is incapable or refuses to negotiate through the normal machinery of industrial relations to resolve a problem, that that person could possibly sell their enterprise to a second party and that the second party would be benefically related in some secret manner &mdash; perhaps in a contract registered outside this State. There has been evidence of that in relation to some of the meat companies which the Minister's colleague, Deputy O'Malley, is trying to unravel and the protection which this law purports to give the workers <i>vis-à-vis</i> their rights in relation to employers could, as I interpret it, be negatived.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Roundabout Limited <i>v.</i> Beirne in 1959 but he did not explicitly state whether, under the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; as set out in his Bill to which he does not propose to offer an amendment despite the fact that he has tabled amendments in relation to the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; under our law, a similar action &mdash; Roundabout Limited <i>v.</i> Beirne, mark 2 &mdash; would have the same effect.  If he can show that it will not have the same effect then perhaps we might be able to accept his assurances.  If he cannot we have no choice but to include the extension of the definition to provide for the amendment in the name of Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct in his observation that there were further meetings and it is in the spirit of this legislation that we have tried to listen to the views of all concerned because it is an important Bill.  The definition is comprehensive and it was discussed at great length.  The second employer would still be an employer in the case mentioned by Deputies Mitchell and Quinn if he had employees.  The definition is only for the purpose of defining the parties to a trade dispute.  I referred to the Roundabout Limited <i>v.</i> Beirne case because a particular decision was made in it.  However, as I said, I am happy that the definition is comprehensive although I note that <Col N="332" /> Deputy Mitchell intends to table an amendment in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious, especially at this stage of the Bill, to move forward as quickly as possible.  However, Deputy Quinn's remarks are central to this, we cannot enact legislation if the definitions are deficient.  It is not merely the Roundabout Limited <i>v.</i> Beirne case which causes me disquiet.  The Minister might well be right if it was only the case that the owner of the pub circumvented the legislation of the day by taking a lease. If that were so we could take the risk involved but I am speaking as somebody who, until very recently, was a trade union official and my responsibilities included the entire contract area.  In the contract area the definition here leaves us open to inflicting considerable injustice on contract workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my Second Stage contribution I instanced the case of the dispute in relation to contract cleaners at University College, Dublin, where what has become the norm in industry happened.  An employer came in from outside and undercut the person providing the contract for cleaning services to UCD and refused to employ the workers in place. It is a norm the trade union have tried to follow, that in circumstances like contract catering, contract cleaning and contract security &mdash; a phenomenon which is becoming more common &mdash; the workers should be kept in place.  If the law of the marketplace means that another employer comes in and undercuts the employer inside that is fine as long as he retains the trade unionists whose work it was.  We could, under the 1906 Act, prosecute a trade dispute for employment in that situation.  We cannot do that under the definition which the Minister is trying to enshrine here, the women in that dispute, for example, could not show that they were trying to work having previously worked for that person.  They never worked for the new employer, they worked at UCD, they did that work but they never worked for the new employer. There are a myriad of situations like that around the country at present and I would <Col N="333" /> be doing a considerable injustice to the people concerned if I accepted a definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; which is loaded in favour of that kind of employer.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not refuse to accede to this request because, in many cases, these are fly-by-night operators who are undercutting good employers paying the agreed terms under joint labour committees or whatever.  They are being undercut by this type of employer and we are facilitating a rash of that kind of exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; has been drawn up in a broad way and it clarifies that former, seasonal and casual workers would be within its scope.  This reflects current case law.  I accept that the Deputy knows of cases other than the 1959 case which, as I said, is regularly quoted.  The decision in that case was at variance with normal practice. I was not saying that this would be our only concern but that one case should not influence the matter.</P>
      <P>I believe the definition is comprehensive enough as it stands.  I do not have a closed mind on this issue and perhaps we can look at it on Report Stage.  I want to get this Bill right.  I accept the concern expressed by the spokespersons from all parties, and I will consider what they have said, between now and Report Stage, but I believe the definition is comprehensive enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's offer to look at this definition again is not acceptable to me.  This argument has been well and truly thrashed out and it is not as if we were debating it for the first time. The Minister will be aware, from wearing various hats, that the increase in contract employment within the State sector in the very area to which Deputy Rabbitte referred is on the increase and is frequently at the behest of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we are down to the net point at this stage.  The Minister has not offered any precise or concise criticism of the wording in the amendment.  If he has a legal drafting technical problem with the <Col N="334" /> wording in the amendment he should tell us what it is.  It is a bit late in the day for him to say that he is prepared, in principle, to look at the general question again.  The Minister has been more than well briefed about the general argument being put forward by Deputy Rabbitte and me.  Unless the Minister gives a clear undertaking that he will formally amend the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; to provide for people buying an enterprise in the manner described by Deputy Rabbitte and bring forward his own wording on Report Stage, I will have no option but to press this amendment to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy Quinn has said.  This definition is deficient and needs to be amended.  Not alone is it deficient in the way Deputy Quinn has said but the phrase &ldquo;having previously worked for that person&rdquo; will be open to very wide interpretation.  Will an employee who has worked for a person in one company also be able to place a picket or engage in a dispute involving another company which is totally unconnected with that company except for the fact that it is owned or partially owned by the same employer?  The definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is far too loose.  In committing ourselves to bringing forward any new definitions on Report Stage we need to be clear on which points we want to cover.</P>
      <P>First, we want to cover a situation where there is a change of ownership in employment to ensure that any change of ownership will not in the least change the rights and prerogatives of an employee in the enterprise which is the subject of the change of ownership. Second, I do not think the House would want to extend the right of picketing in trade disputes by employees to other employments, companies or businesses owned by the same company but not otherwise directly connected with it.  This would be a major opening up of the potential danger of secondary picketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a new definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo;.  The Minister should give a commitment to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage &mdash; we on this side <Col N="335" /> of the House can propose our own amendments, which I intend to do &mdash; which meets the points now being made about the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, the definition has been looked at and I believe it is comprehensive enough. What I was trying to do was to get a definition of employer which did not cover a number of other substantive issues.  It is an objective definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; for the purposes of defining the parties in a dispute.  As I said, an employer must be a legal entity or a person and for this reason the use of the term &ldquo;in that employment&rdquo; would not be relevant.  I believe the present definition is comprehensive enough.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte about the contract worker, under the Bill both contractors would be regarded as employers in the circumstances he outlined.  As both contractors would have employees they would be covered by the Bill.  A trade dispute does not have to be with your employer; other workers could also be involved.  This definition has been debated and looked at but that is not to say it could not be improved by way of an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.  There has been much debate on this issue outside the House.  I accept the points made by the Deputies but I still believe this definition is comprehensive enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat myself <i>ad nauseam</i>, but would the Minister not agree that the term &ldquo;worked for that person&rdquo; could be open to two directly opposite constructions?  On the one hand a dispute with a person could cease once he ceased to own the company but on the other hand an employee engaged in a dispute with a person in a particular company could extend the dispute to other businesses in which that person is involved.  Does the Minister not see the dual danger in that definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;having previously worked for that person&rdquo; is tied to the term &ldquo;seek to work&rdquo; and does not cover the other part of the definition. Therefore, it is tied into the last part of the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my understanding of it as well which is why I raised this point.  I do not know why the Minister would wish to provoke us into having to take up 15 minutes voting on this.  That is not the spirit in which we are approaching this Bill.  But, if you divide it, that is the way I see it as well, so that the second part of the definition would read: &ldquo;or to seek work having previously worked for that person&rdquo;.  How could one possibly have a trade dispute against an employer when one is seeking to work, when one did not work for that employer previously or, as it reads here: &ldquo;having previously worked for that person&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Take the traditional position on a building site, for example: how could one seek to work on the Tallaght Town Centre complex for, say, John Sisk in the traditional way when it is required here that one must be able to show that one previously worked for that employer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about an argument about the second part of my amendment with regard to the transfer of undertakings, <Col N="337" /> surely it ought cost the Minister no pain to excise the phrase &ldquo;having previously worked for that person.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might seek clarification on that point.  I am absolutely <i>ad idem</i> with Deputy Rabbitte on his objective but it might have unintended consequences.  Would he agree?  Take the case of somebody dismissed or purported to have been dismissed.  My reading of the phrase &ldquo;having previously worked&rdquo; is that it is intended to cover people in that position.  Indeed that dismissal may be the very point in dispute.  Does the Deputy not see that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point Deputy Mitchell is making but I do not agree with it.  It is just as likely to operate the other way round &mdash; that the person dismissed would be far more likely to prosecute a dispute against the old employer than <Col N="338" /> against the new one.  I do not think it is a major point but perhaps I am missing its essence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 4, in the definition of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo;, before &ldquo;connected&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;directly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are many areas in this Bill where there is what I consider to be loose drafting. I think my amendment would give greater clarity to the Bill in regard to the definition of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My second amendment is to substitute the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo;, which I feel is a more precise word, for the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to say that it is difficult to be thoroughly prepared for a Committee Stage debate when the amendments in <Col N="341" /> the name of the Minister were only circulated late last night.  When I sought them at 9.30 they were still not available. The amendments of The Workers' Party and The Labour Party were only circulated after tea yesterday also.  This, in a sense, detracts from what should be the careful consideration on Committee Stage of the precise wording of each definition.</P>
    <P>I hope anyway that the Minister will accept my two amendments, otherwise the definition could be open to loose interpretation in the future and have the reverse effect to what is intended in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel very enthusiastic about this amendment.  I would like to take this opportunity to remark that in discussing the definition of trade disputes we have all steered away from this old inclusion in the 1906 Act of worker and worker disputes.  We have done that because it is not fashionable to even countenance such disputes.  I have, however, the most serious apprehension about having excised that term because I believe it is likely to become more the case that an employer will be able to construe a dispute as worker against worker in the context of advancing technology, deskilling of trades and so on.  I instance the case of journalists and printers as a very good example of where this kind of conflct will inevitably arise and where employers would be able to say that a dispute has nothing to do with them but is between two different categories of worker, in this case, the NGA and the NUJ.  I regret my lack of guts in not putting forward an amendment on it but there is a great danger that it could be misconstrued as an indication that one somehow supports the kind of crazy demarcation disputes we had in the sixties and early seventies.  Quite frankly, I think that is a chapter of industrial history that is behind us.  There is a calm awareness on the part of most workers and most unions that that page of history is closed. We now have to confront the question of technology and I think the definition is <Col N="342" /> the weaker for the excision of that particular phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the two amendments put down by Deputy Mitchell and reply to the general point made by Deputy Rabbitte let me say a little about section 8.  This re-enacts the definition of trade disputes contained in the Act of 1906 but excluding worker versus worker disputes.  The advantage of this definition of trade disputes is that it is a longstanding and familiar definition. Any new definition would be likely to be the subject of legal disputes in particular cases as immunities in relation to picketing and organising a strike are granted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  Among the issues which the Irish courts have accepted as valid subjects for a trade dispute are wages and other conditions of employment, working conditions, redundancy disputes, improvement of statutory rights and trade union recognition.</P>
      <P>In regard to worker versus worker disputes there is little justification for permitting two or more unions to carry on a dispute with each other at the expense of an employer who employs members of the unions concerned but who is otherwise unconnected with the dispute and powerless to resolve it.  While it is true that worker versus worker disputes are small in number, such disputes can be very intractable and can have detrimental effects on employment normally out of all proportion to the numbers involved. It has to be acknowledged, however, that some worker versus worker disputes contain worker versus employer elements, which I think is what Deputy Rabbitte is saying and may continue to enjoy immunity on that count.  That is an important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment, the legal advice is that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is not necessary and could indeed give rise to legal difficulties and unnecessary complications.  The key point is that the dispute must be between employers and workers but the matter in dispute may relate to persons who are not workers, for example, workers could <Col N="343" /> have a dispute with an employer over a proposal to engage outside contractors, who would not be workers as defined in this Bill.  It is therefore necessary to retain the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to cover this type of situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the House would the Minister clarify the probable implications of the decision to exclude the workman versus workman or worker versus worker definition as coming within the umbrella of a trade dispute?  If we continue the analogy instanced by Deputy Rabbitte, a print company may find itself in a situation where the print union and the journalists' union are in dispute over the consequences of new technology being introduced by the employer in the first instance.  Is the Minister saying that, following the enactment of this provision as it stands, such a dispute which would lead to an industrial stopage, among other things, such as the failure of the <i>Irish Press</i> to be published on a particular day, the new majority shareholders of that company would be able to take legal action against one or both of the two unions for commercial damages?  Is that the consequence of this exclusion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of interpretation in any case.  If it is an inter-union dispute, the answer is yes, that immunities would be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously each case will have to be looked at on its merits.  The reason I am citing this example is that we are all familiar with the case referred to by Deputy Rabbitte; and it is a case that we can relate to and it is not so hypothetical. For example, if the new owners of the <i>Irish Press</i> make a formal declaration to the journalists of that paper that they must comply with new technology and co-operate with direct feed in a manner that works in other papers &mdash; and it certainly works in the company's newspaper in the United States &mdash; which results in severe job losses on the printing side and which provokes a response from <Col N="344" /> the NGA who are attempting to protect their employment, if this leads to a dispute between the two unions, is the Minister saying &mdash; and this is a very concrete example &mdash; that neither the NUJ nor the NGA will have the protection of this Bill when enacted against claims for commercial damages?  <i>The Sunday Press</i> has a circulation of 400,000-odd and the reserves of the NUJ or NGA would be depleted if they were open to a claim for commercial damages.  Is that a consequence of this definition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the details of the case outlined by the Deputy that there is an employer element in this dispute.  If the dispute sets out as a worker versus worker dispute and then turns out to be a worker versus employer dispute, then the unions would retain immunity. Where it is a worker versus worker dispute and there is no involvement by the employer and the employer is sidelined and suffering, they lose their immunity. This would not apply in a case similar to what the Deputy has outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us tease this out because we may not get the opportunity to discuss this matter again.  For argument sake let us consider a specific instance &mdash; I am using a specific instance hypothetically in order to put meat on the argument but I am not in any way implying that this is what the situation is in that enterprise.  The new proprietors in paper X wish to reduce the costs of production.  The journalists, represented by their union, come to an agreement as to how they will perform their duties as journalists using new technology and this enables new printing machinery to feed directly from the keyboard right through to the printed page of the newspaper which then goes through the distribution network.  The traditional job of the printers, represented by the NGA, has now effectively been by-passed.  The journalists who have agreed to this are not in dispute with the employer.  Let us assume for the purpose of teasing out this example that the printers represented by their union take action against the <Col N="345" /> journalists by either frustrating what they do or by frustrating the distribution of the printed product, the newspaper. Could this be construed as a worker versus worker dispute?  If the employer was to say that he was not in dispute with anybody &mdash; he has got an agreement with the journalists and he does not need the printers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this point initially because I have regrets about not having the courage of my convictions to table an amendment on it.  I think the Minister should look at this point on Report Stage.  It is all very well to say that immunities would only be removed in a dispute where it was expressly a worker versus worker dispute but where there was an element of employer involvement, immunities would apply. The impact of technology has implications for deskilling workers not only in the print industry but also, to a major extent, in the craft sector, and is likely to lead to a situation where union is set against union.  The employer may make a considerable investment to install the new technology and then leave the union or the individual workers to fight out among themselves who does what job. This will be very unclear and we may have to resort to the courts to clarify whether it is a worker versus worker dispute or there is an element of complicity by the employer.  This is an unfortunate situation.  Having listened to the Minister's summing up on Second Stage, I find an element in the legislation &mdash; perhaps because it was so long in gestation, which is haunted by the experience in the sixties.  Industrial relations have changed beyond recognition since then.  I do not think the worker versus worker dispute, which we would all deplore, has been a phenomenon in my experience over the past decade and more.  In the situation where the phenomenon of technological advance will accelerate it is probably a pity that we should restrict the definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this definition of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; has been <Col N="346" /> greatly expanded beyond the amendments in my name.  The points being made by Deputies Quinn and Rabbitte on worker versus worker disputes or disputes where there is a significant worker versus worker dimension indicate one of the great weaknesses of the Bill.  When we come to consider some other amendments in my name I hope the House will take that into account.</P>
      <P>For some time we have not had problems in worker versus worker disputes, where all the unions concerned are unions of Congress. This is due to the very respected procedures within Congress. The problem arises, and has arisen in the past, including the recent past to some extent, where there are several unions in the workplace but one is not within Congress.  There was a dispute in the past few weeks in one of the bus depots in Dublin involving the NBU.  While that dispute was of a disciplinary nature involving a member of the NBU and was ostensibly between the NBU and Dublin Bus, in reality a very major secondary question arises as to the relative position of the unions in Dublin Bus and their relative strength.  To some extent there was a worker versus worker dimension there.</P>
      <P>The fundamental weakness of this Bill is that it does not make provision for questions of that nature.  These are the very matters that have haunted industrial relations over the past ten to 15 years and, in my opinion, will arise in the future when expectations rise with economic recovery.  The definition of a trade dispute here allows us an opportunity to reflect more fully on those facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the amendments in my name, it seems that the definitions here are loosely drafted.  We have already had this discussion on the definition of employer and I have no doubt we will have it again on Report Stage in view of the Minister's surprising lack of openness to suggestion on it.  The definition of a &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; is not quite as loose as the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; but I think it would be greatly helped by the addition <Col N="347" /> of the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; and the substitution of the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo;, for &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  The next definition in this section is that of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;, &ldquo;person&rdquo; is not defined anywhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this matter has been raised.  As Deputy Rabbitte has said, we do not want to be haunted by the experiences and structures of the sixties.  This Bill should aim to meet the challenges of the nineties. The point was well made by Deputies Rabbitte and Quinn regarding the overwhelming changes that will take place either with the complicity of the employer or through technology.  Different unions representing different groups of workers may have to take a stand against one another.  One area that comes to mind immediately, apart from the crafts area mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte, is the clothing industry.  I was reminded of the fact that pattern cutting and designing is now done by computer while cutting is done by laser.  Large numbers of jobs in a traditional industry are being wiped out in an area where different traditional crafts and skills were used.  This Bill must address those problems rather than the problems the trade unions have overcome in the last 20 years. We should remember that the projection of work for 1999 is that manufacturing industry will have decreased to 8 per cent of productivity.  We need a Bill that will take into consideration the negotiating and industrial skills that will be needed to cope with that kind of change.  I support what has been said here and hope that when we come to Report Stage these matters will have been taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those speakers who have said that industrial relations have changed dramatically since the sixties and seventies.  Nonetheless, given the multiplicity of unions and the structures that exist, it would be unrealistic to feel that we will not continue to have some inter-union, and therefore inter-worker disputes in respect of membership and demarcation.  There are examples I can <Col N="348" /> give from my experience as an arbiter over the years of union versus union or worker versus worker disputes.  I recall one in particular that cost £5 million: admittedly, it was in the sixties.  Where it is a clear cut case of worker versus worker dispute, the immunities will be removed under the Bill.  One advantage in these circumstances is that where the unions concerned are within Congress the removal of the immunity should enhance the opportunity of congress to settle the dispute.  Congress machinery has been very effective and most disputes are solved at that level.  The absence of the immunity will bend the minds of the disputing parties all the more to reach a settlement.</P>
      <P>The point about technology is well taken.  There is, from time to time, an employer dimension.  New grades and new types of work emerge with changing technology.  It seems that an employer looking ahead, and leaving aside the worker versus worker dimension, should engage in genuine consultation before these changes take place and that might remove clashes in the future.  In other words, the workers should be involved in consultation and discussion with the employers about the introduction of new technology, if only to win the worker co-operation as we face increasingly competitive times, and to identify the common ground between the two sides in terms of the implementation of technology. Where the dispute is worker versus worker, the immunity should be removed but where there is an employer dimension we are into the interpretation area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat one point in answer to Deputy Mitchell.  The definition re-enacts the definition of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; contained in the 1906 Act but excludes the worker versus worker disputes.  The advantage of the definition of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; is that it is a long standing and familiar definition.  Any new definition would be likely to be the subject of a legal dispute in particular cases as immunities in relation to picketing and <Col N="349" /> organising a strike are granted in contemplation of the furtherance of a trade dispute.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Mitchell's amendments, the legal advice is that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is not necessary and indeed could give rise to legal difficulties and unnecessary complications.  The dispute must be between employers and workers but the subject matter of the dispute might relate to persons who are not workers &mdash; for example, workers could have a dispute with an employer over a proposal to engage outside contractors who would not be workers as defined in the Bill.  It is necessary to retain the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to cover this type of situation.</P>

      <P>In page 7, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `trade union official' means a person in the employment of a trade union or a person authorised in writing by a trade union to act for it for a purpose or purposes specified in the authorisation;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the definition of trade union official.  It is very clear from my amendment and from Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 8 that we want to clarify that in this case a &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; does not just mean an officer in the employment of a trade union but also shop stewards, branch committee members etc. who, although not employees of the union in the sense that <Col N="350" /> they are not paid by the union are acting for the union in a particular dispute. Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 8 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 7, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following definition:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `trade union official' means any person in the employment of a trade union or any person appointed by a trade union to so act under the rules of that trade union;&rdquo;.</P>

I feel the best way to clear up any misunderstanding as to who is covered by the term is by way of a definition, inserting a new subsection. The definition should be confined to paid officials of a trade union or any officer of a union or branch of a union elected or appointed in accordance with the rules of a union.  The other definitions are too wide.  For the purposes of this section the new subsection reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  For the purposes of this section `trade union official' means any paid official of a trade union or any officer of a union or branch of a union elected or appointed in accordance with the rules of a union.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is broad agreement here.  I understand the reason for the Minister trying to confine the &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; definition to the operation of section 11.  From the point of view of proper law making we are talking about a definition and it is rather untidy to have a definition confined exclusively for the purposes of this section.  We are talking about a law that will have to travel safely into the next century in which the role of trade unions, trade union officials and members of trade unions has to be given space to evolve.  Section 11 deals with the question of picketing.  If we are to try to curtail those people who can assist in the picketing process, members of a union, we maybe unnecessarily spancelling ourselves. In support of either of the two amendments and in support of what the Minister is trying to do perhaps he could see his way to bringing forward his amendment No. 35 to the definition stage and excluding it for the purposes of this section.  It may well be that it would be useful for the purposes of industrial relations to have the words &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; as including somebody appointed in accordance with the rules of that union.  If that definition were included in the definitions section it would be less restrictive.</P>

      <P>In this Bill the definition relates only to section 11.  From the point of view of being tidy it does not arise anywhere else.  It is part of and is related to section 11.  The trade unions wanted it to be clear for their own purposes that if the issue arises it is an argument arising out of section 11.  By putting it in at the definitions section it would defeat the purpose.  It is intended for the protection and clarification of the trade union under section 11; if it were put elsewhere it would not serve the purpose.</P>

      <P>I am puzzled by the Minister.  Section 11 deals with picketing. Picketing has to do with strikes, industrial action and workers.  In the definitions section, section 8, we are dealing with &ldquo;trade disputes&rdquo; definition, the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;, the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; and the definition of &ldquo;strike&rdquo;. Why not define &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; in this section?  I suspect there could be implications if we do not include the definition of &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; in this section.  I would ask the Minister to accept that this is the place where that definition should be put.  This part of the Bill is headed Trade Union Law.  This is the definitions section of that part of the Bill.  I consider that Deputy Quinn's point is correct, that this is where the definition should be.</P>

      <P>All the other definitions arise throughout the Act but &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; arises in section 11.  The desire of trade union officials was that in future anyone or the courts primarily reading section 11 would be quite clear as to whom &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; related.  It is not an issue on which I would argue all <Col N="353" /> day.  The requests were that section 11 should be made clear and that the definition of &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; would be part of section 11.  That is what the various groups and deputations asked for on Second Stage.  There was a particular request that it would be contained in section 11.</P>

      <P>May I take it then that the only instance in which a trade union official is defined is for the purposes of this section only?  Surely that is identifying it much too closely with only one section.

      <P>Unfortunately, the courts of the land will not cite private discussions between any Minister for Labour and representatives of Congress but rather the deliberations of this House.  While it is essential to have comprehensive discussions with the social partners in the formulation of this law, it is very necessary for us to realise that this House at the end of the day carries full responsibility. All of us who have some knowledge and experience of industrial relations are of the view that the less room we leave for the courts to intervene and to provide <Col N="354" /> interpretations which could not concur with what was the political thinking of the time, the better.  In this format here, which is non-adversarial in contrast to a dispute where an employer or a worker could take somebody to court or invoke the court, you get a different kind of interpretation and different motivation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell said, we have an opportunity in the definition section to define what a trade union official is for the purpose of law, not just in respect of this legislation but in respect of all labour relations legislation of which this will just be one Bill, albeit perhaps the most important Bill.  I invite the Minister to come back on Report Stage on this.  If we, the elected representatives of the people, define what we mean by &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; it will ensure for ever more that no court will muse about it and decide what it is.  Let us decide that ourselves, let us keep our business of the Oireachtas to ourselves and let the Supreme Court and others interpret what we have enacted.  Where we are clear that we want to define something and see the merits of it, then it should be defined.  It is not a big issue.</P>
      <P>There is no particular net point at present to which it is relevant other than the picketing provisions in section 11, but who is to know what will arise at some stage in future?  We have already the very topical example of the Extradition Acts where precise definitions would have avoided the situation that has arisen in the courts where the courts had to decide what was perhaps in our mind.  Let us put what is in our mind on to the Statute Book and leave aside the ambiguity and all the rest of it that comes from it.  It is a general point rather than specific.  Are we not taking amendment No. 35 as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, amendment No. 35.  I will repeat for you that amendments Nos. 8 and 35 are alternatives and amendment No. 33 is related.  Amendment No. 34 is consequential on amendment No. 33, so we are taking amendments Nos. 7, 8, 33, 34 and 35 together.</P>

    <Col N="355" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the first point, which is a broad, philosophical one.  I am not going to labour it &mdash; no pun intended. The definition section is at the commencement of the Bill and if it arises relevant to only one section that is a secondary consideration.  Definitions in one piece of legislation frequently are referred to and used in other pieces of legislation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 35 put in by the Minister I think covers most of the concerns people would have in relation to section 11 generally, but I would like clarification. The amendment reads, &ldquo;... `trade union official' means any paid official of a trade union or any officer of a union or branch of a union elected or appointed in accordance with the rules of a union.&rdquo;.  This seems to exclude the possibility of other members of a union giving support by way of picketing lawfully to their co-trade unionists unless those other members of a trade union are paid officials or officers of a union.  With increasing union amalgamation, which we hope to see in the next number of years, the numbers of people who are not officers of unions is going to increase, relatively speaking.  Therefore, consider the interpretation as distinct from the interpretation proposed by Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Mitchell.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 8 refers to &ldquo;... or any person appointed by a trade union to so act under the rules of that trade union;&rdquo;.  The Minister's amendment is confining it to paid officials or branch officers in terms of the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 propose the inclusion of any official or person appointed.  That gives a flexibility to a trade union if they decide in respect of something that they will take the assistance of other members of a union who might not necessarily be branch officers. We are into a particularly sensitive area that is subject to a great deal of litigation and has been so in the past.  There will be test cases of all the sections of this Bill.  The provisions in relation to picketing will undoubtedly be tested in the courts sooner rather than later in order <Col N="356" /> to establish bench marks in terms of interpretation and if it is found there are people on the picket line who are neither branch officers nor of the union proper, then they could be construed to be acting outside the law.</P>
    <P>I have made two points.  The first is a general one, which the Minister can reflect upon, about the location of the definition.  The more immediate point seems to be, taking the worst possible situation into consideration as we have to do, that in the area of picketing we have to anticipate some degree of litigation in the short term.  Frequently in the nature of things the Minister talks to only officials of trade unions, but it is the ordinary members of trade unions who go on strike and who support each other in terms of strikes.  On my interpretation the Minister's amendment No. 35 does not extend the intended protection to them unless they are officers of the branch or of the union itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (2) provides: &ldquo;Part II of this Act and the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1982, may be cited together as the Trade Union Acts 1871 to 1989, and shall be construed together as one Act.&rdquo; Because of the lateness of the Minister's amendment I have not had time to consult those Acts to see if elsewhere in them there is a reference to &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo;, but I am sure that somewhere amid all those Acts there is such reference. It would be invidious for us to accept the Minister's amendment here without having that opportunity.  We see the heading &ldquo;Fifth Schedule&rdquo; and after it the Acts referred to or amended by this Bill are listed, including the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956 and so on down to the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  It is much better that we insert the definition of &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; in the definition section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister's amendment might be on Report Stage expanded a little to include a person authorised in writing or appointed by the trade union. The point Deputy Quinn made is valid. We are restricting it considerably if we <Col N="357" /> confine the union to paid officials or elected officers in a particular case.</P>
    <P>This definition may affect not only past legislation, it may affect future legislation, so I hope the Minister will accept that this is the point to insert the definition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>If I am open about it the Deputy will want me to move around. During the long Second Stage debate Members stood up and declared their allegiance to certain sectors.  Their views were taken into account.  I should like to make it clear that there is no definition of a trade union official in any legislation. I will be the first Minister for Labour broad-minded enough to define a trade union official in legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I am trying to deal with the points raised by Deputies Rabbitte and Mitchell during the course of the Second Stage debate by inserting this subsection.  It is deemed extremely important that the subsection be included in section 11.  It may not make any difference if there is a reference in the definition section to section 11.  I will consider between now and Report Stage where the subsection should go.  I agree that the subsection is by its nature restrictive and how tight it should be is another matter.  Deputy Quinn made a good point when he said that in 20 years time we may have four or ten trade unions and <Col N="358" /> that as a result the provision will be too tight.  I undertake to have a look at this matter between now and Report Stage. If the provision stands the passage of time, which I hope it does, the point raised by Deputy Quinn is a fair one.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's view on this.  The law is adequate as it stands.  I have referred to this section as the milkman's section.  This concerns a growing phenomenon.  We are all aware of a milk distribution company who disemployed 700 or 800 workers and re-employed them as contractors.  They would not be covered under the Bill.  I should like to thank the Minister for acceding to the points we made on Second Stage in regard to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty in accepting the amendment in <Col N="359" /> the names of the Minister, Deputies O'Sullivan and Rabbitte.  All sides of the House recognise that there is a problem in that many employers are resorting to employment by contract or on a consultancy basis.  However, there is a danger that we will throw the baby out with the bath water.  We must have available the possibility of having work done by contract or on a consultancy basis. Many employers, such as those employing milkmen, offer redundancy money to employees and re-employ them on a contract basis.  That is one way of getting out from under all the requirements of social legislation whether we are talking about unfair dismissal, terms and conditions of employment and so on.  It opens up loopholes for evading taxes, social insurance contributions and so on.  A Bill, tabled by The Workers' Party, which addresses the question of part-time workers, is before the House at present. While I do not agree with every detail of that Bill it at least addresses another aspect of the problem that is before us now.  Many business people are resorting to what are effectively ruses to deprive workers of their rights such as their social insurance rights, their rights under the Unfair Dismissals Act, their pension rights or in regard to their terms and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>My amendment, which is an alternative to amendment No. 9, seeks to plug the loophole.  If we accept the Minister's amendment, and I will happily do so if he presses it, there is a danger that we may make it difficult for people to have work done on a contract or consultancy basis when that is the only way such work can be done.  The Minister should consider whether my alternative amendment is more comprehensive.  He should take into account later amendments which define &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; and &ldquo;consultant.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The words which are being deleted were added to the present definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; contained in the Trade Disputes (Amendment) Act 1982 in order to exclude self employed persons from the scope of the legislation.  I <Col N="360" /> accepted the points that were made to me strongly on Second Stage, that the wording of the Bill would also exclude various categories of workers it was not intended to exclude.  As Deputies have said, that is an important issue given the changes that are taking place.  Many people who would formerly have been employed under normal contracts of employment are now being employed on various other types of contracts.  We have had a number of opportunities recently to debate the types of contracts and the difficulties that arise from them.</P>
      <P>The House is debating The Workers' Party Bill on part-time workers and the Government are taking account of the excellent contributions that have been made on it and are aware of the knowledge Deputies have of what is happening in the labour market.  I am not saying that many of the developments are not desirable but they have to be watched and we must guard against abuses in contracts. I am proposing to delete the words, &ldquo;or a person who under a contract for services personally does work or provides services for another&rdquo;, and that is proposed by Deputies O'Sullivan and Rabbitte.  In the light of this amendment I do not consider that Deputy Mitchell's proposal to substitute the words, &ldquo;or a person who is a contractor or consultant&rdquo;, is necessary.  The position is adequately covered under the revised definition.  In addition, it would be very difficult to define in precise legal terms what is meant by &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; and &ldquo;consultant&rdquo; and that could give rise to more problems that it would resolve.  I hope we have covered the points and the broader scope necessary under this definition and I ask the Deputies to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about every single part of this definition section. We are rushing the Bill through the House and we may be creating problems instead of closing loopholes, which is the intention of the Bill.  If we do as the Minister says, a person employed on a once-off contract to do some work over a short period of time could be included as a person who could engage in a trade <Col N="361" /> dispute with a company or business who granted him the contract.  Surely that is not what we intend to do in this Bill?  We want people doing contract work of such a nature and continuity that in reality they are employed by the firm, to have the protection of the Bill.  We do not want to make it impossible for business to resort to a certain amount of consultancy. That is why I propose amending the section and the definition of &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; My definition reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;contractor&rdquo; means a person who under a contract for services personally does work or provide services for another other than a person who because of the kind, amount and continuity of the work done or the services provided would lead the Labour Court to deem that person to be a worker for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>I was conscious of the difficulty of defining &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; and that is why in my definition a discretion is granted to the Labour Court to say that these are workers, not contractors.  I want to give the Labour Court power to judge in individual cases rather than giving <i>carte blanche</i> coverage to all contractors which, surely, is not the intention of trade dispute legislation.  &ldquo;Consultant&rdquo; is defined similarly to &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; except that the work is done in the absence of a specific contract.  It would be better to accept my amendment and the two consequential amendments and I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with what Deputy Mitchell is trying to do but we should refer to the subsection which we are amending in the first instance, the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.  The Minister has clearly taken on board the points made on Second Stage and he should confine the exemption of the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to two very precise categories &mdash; members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  Everybody else is deemed to be a worker if they are engaged in some kind of contractual relationship or a form of employment, etc.  The concerns which Deputy Mitchell <Col N="362" /> expressed are best dealt with in new legislation regarding part-time workers or in legislation dealing with contract law.  A &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; seems to be a matter for definition within the contract itself in regard to the terms and conditions, rights and obligations, and it does not apply in this instance.  We started by asking who a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is.  A &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is everybody except a member of the Garda Síochána, a member of the Defence Forces or anybody on contract work.  That, clearly, was not our intention and we are simply deleting it.  All we are doing at this stage is defining a worker for the purposes of this legislation.  We are trying to deal with real problems but in the context of this legislation Deputy Mitchell's suggestion is cumbersome.  It is totally unacceptable to say that if we do not have the definition right we will allow the Labout Court to decide on such matters.  We must make the definitions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the intention of the Bill?  It is intended to bring further democracy to the workplace and to ensure that workers' rights cannot be usurped by small unrepresentative minorities. A situation could arise in which there are employees in a company and a group of individuals is brought in to do a certain amount of contract work for a specific period of time.  Because they enter into a dispute with their employer they could, under this loose definition, place a picket on their place of employment, thereby jeopardising the rights of the majority of the employees.  That is the danger we are creating and surely they are the kind of loopholes we are trying to close?  I ask the House to reflect on this point.  What is the purpose of this long delayed Bill?  It is to clarify the need for democratic decisions on major issues by all trade unions and workers.  We do not want to create loopholes by making no references to contract employment or consultant employment.  These are widespread ruses which should be addressed in this and part-time worker legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has adequately met this situation and if <Col N="363" /> Deputy Mitchell reflects on his submission he will conclude that it is likely to create more confusion than exists at present.  He said that we were trying to introduce more democracy to the workplace but, in the case which he postulates, it would be democracy if the smaller group of workers who are contractors or whatever decided to prosecute a trade dispute.  It is a matter for the regulatory authority &mdash; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; to decide how that dispute should be prosecuted.  It may be prosecuted, as hundreds of disputes are, in a situation where there is no impact on the main employer.  There is an arrangement whereby the union or unions representing the directly employed workers facilitate their going to work but it does not impact at all on the contract workers.  If, on the other hand, the contract workers want to get the support of the remainder of the workforce on that site the facility is there to apply for an all-out picket to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The all-out picket procedures are well established and the request will be granted and ultimately applied if, in the opinion of congress, the conditions warrant it.  The Minister's amendment adequately meets the situation and I would be happier not to start stirring muddy waters about what constitutes a contractor in the changing structure of the workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to muddy the waters any further and I take the point made by Deputy Rabbitte.  When Deputy Mitchell was speaking a question came to my mind about contract work and protecting contract workers, which is what we are attempting to do here. Could there be a possibility, not covered by this or any other Bill, that main contractors could operate from their homes and contract work out to women?  Does the law regard such a residence as a place of work which can be picketed?  Would this type of contract work be covered in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures to be followed in such cases are contained in <Col N="364" /> other sections of the Bill.  The definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Bill would adequately cover somebody working for such a contractor and the procedures they would have to follow are provided for in later sections.  Even if we were to define the various types of contractors in the labour market, which I think is what Deputy Mitchell is proposing, straight away a legal person whose wisdom may be better than our combined wisdom would find a title for a contract which we had not defined.  From our studies and from the debate on the part-time workers Bill prior to the Easter recess we found that there is a large variety of contracts in the labour market and the further we go into this area the more we find.  If we do not define &ldquo;worker&rdquo; as proposed in the Bill we will have to define all types of contracts. It may be possible to list all the various contractors, consultants, full-time contractors, part-time contractors, management contractors, etc., but it would still allow someone to very quickly upstage the definition in the legislation. If we define &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in this way we will be excluding only two very clear categories so that there can be no confusion.</P>
      <P>There was much debate on this issue in the House and we have changed our original definition as a result of this.  The definition proposed is uncomplicated.  I understand the points made by Deputy Mitchell but if I were to accept his amendments they would make the section unnecessarily complicated, which would defeat the purpose.  I believe my amendment should cover any difficulties which might arise.</P>

      <P>For every very complicated problem there is a simple solution which is always wrong.  I must confess that that is not an original thought; I read it somewhere.  The Minister said he is simplifying a complicated problem but I think he is wrong.  We should pause for a moment and reflect on what we are trying to deal with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very clear from what Deputy Rabbitte said that he is concerned, as I am, that we protect the rights of, for instance, contract cleaners.  These people have <Col N="365" /> been employed for years cleaning offices, including the offices of this House, but because they are contract employees they are not protected.  We want to give them that protection.  This type of employment has become so widespread it can only be described as a ruse used by employers to avoid the duties and obligations imposed on them by social legislation.  It is evasion rather than avoidance; they are evading their duties and depriving workers of their rights.</P>
    <P>Drivers for dairies and other firms in this city, and I am sure throughout the country, were offered very attractive redundancy deals where they ceased to be an employees in the traditional sense; they were given a few bob and the ownership of lorries.  These drivers are now employed as contractors.  Many of these men who visit me at my clinic are doing the same work they did previously and are supposed to be self-employed but they are bogged down with problems of tax and social insurance.  The Revenue Commissioners are chasing them and if they get sick they do not have enough contributions to receive disability benefit etc.  I want that ruse which is used by employers to evade social legislation to be stopped.  I believe all of us in this House want this evasion, which in tax parlance is wrong, to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another type of contractor. When I was Minister for Labour a number of consultants were employed for a short period to do a specific job. Are we going to give these people who are not part of the general work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the case of the Bord Gáis dispute the Murphy contractors were brought from England to instal a pipeline.  Should such contractors be in a position to cause a dispute which had the effect of disturbing the rights of the workers of, for example, An Bord Gáis? I want that point clarified.  I do not think we can avoid addressing this issue on the basis that it becomes a little less simple. Of course, it is less simple; it is a complex <Col N="366" /> and a complicated question which needs to be addressed.  If we do not address these questions now that we have the opportunity to do so, we will be leaving gates open.  I thought the purpose of this Bill was to close gates which should not be open.</P>

      <P>We will be discussing the part-time workers Bill and their rights under social legislation later today and hopefully under the Government Bill which will be introduced later this year. We are discussing now the definition of a &ldquo;worker&rdquo;.  Section 8 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;worker&rdquo; means any person who is or was employed whether or not in the employment of the employer with whom a trade dispute arises, but does not include a member of the Defence Forces or of the Garda Síochána or a person who under a contract for services personally does work or provides services for another;</P>
      <P>This definition includes everybody except the two categories which are excluded. The definition is as tight as we can make it.  I think the Deputy is endeavouring to cover all workers.  Perhaps he has some doubts about whether there should be some exclusions.  I do not think that can be done.  The provision here covers extremely tightly all those people coming within those provisions, with two exceptions. If this type of clause were included in the Protection of Part-Time Workers (Employment) (No. 2) Bill, 1989 &mdash; which is a different argument &mdash; when everybody would be covered, then some of the arguments being made might apply should these people have statutory cover with regard to social welfare, under the Unfair Dismissals Act, holiday entitlement and so on.  For the purposes of this Bill we are including as broad and comprehensive a category of worker as can possibly be defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Deputy's earlier point, that this may have been a quick decision.  I should stress that arriving at this definition was not a quick decision.  We went to some trouble looking for a precedent <Col N="367" /> in earlier legislation, in the 1982 Act.  We are adopting something that worked then and has withstood the test in the difficult intervening period.  It is our belief that this definition will prove successful.</P>

      <P>We move on to amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy Jim Mitchell.  Here I would seek the indulgence of the House while I advise Members that amendments Nos. 42, 44, 47, 49, 51 and 54 are consequential on amendment No. 13.  Amendments Nos. 41, 43, 46, 48, 50 and 53 are alternative amendments.  Therefore, it is proposed that, with the agreement of the House all these amendments be taken together for discussion purposes.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 13 to 19, to delete the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `major industrial action' means any action which affects, or is likely to affect, the terms or conditions, whether express or implied, of a contract and which is taken by any number or body of workers acting in combination or under a common understanding as a means of compelling their employer or to aid other workers in compelling their employer to accept or not to accept terms or conditions of or affecting employment and which has the effect of significantly disrupting the business;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In reality this amendment deals with a very important section, section 14, which is the main section dealing with secret balloting.  For example, there are five subparagraphs in section 14 (2).  I will read the first which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> (2)  The rules of every trade union shall contain a provision that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike or other industrial action without a secret ballot, entitlement to vote in which shall be accorded equally to all members who it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for the union concerned to believe will be called upon to engage in the strike or other industrial action;</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; appear twice in the subsection.  In the definitions in section 8 it is said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; means any action which affects, or is likely to affect, the terms or conditions, whether express or implied, of a contract and which is taken by any number or body of workers acting in combination or under a common understanding as a means of compelling their employer or to aid other workers in compelling their employer to accept or not to accept terms or conditions of or affecting employment;...</P>
    <P>As a former shop steward it appears to me that this definition could be construed to mean that almost any industrial action would require a ballot, even localised conflicts or decisions which can arise from day to day in any workplace. That is why I seek, anywhere the phrase &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; appears to amend it by the addition of the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; preceding it &mdash; which would then read &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo;. Then, in the definitions section I seek to amend the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; to read &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo;, adding the words &ldquo;which have a significantly disruptive effect on the business&rdquo; or something to that effect.  My concern is, that to require a secret ballot for any industrial action could be extremely restrictive of trade union rights and, in the end, be counter-productive. If one frustrates normal exchanges and avenues of conciliation in the workplace one could build up a great deal of frustration which could overflow into more <Col N="369" /> serious problems.  I would ask the Minister to consider deleting the phrase &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;, to be more precise in its definition or to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was looking at the amendments that are consequential on Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 13 and the alternatives tabled by myself and Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of definitions in this Bill we are discussing the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.  I really cannot see &mdash; and should be obliged if Deputy Mitchell would confine himself to this net point &mdash; the merit of the addition he proposes which, if I read it correctly, would mean a difference between what is in the Bill and, after his addition, the words &ldquo;and which has the effect of significantly disrupting the business&rdquo;.  That is the net point.</P>
      <P>I might make two points about that. For the life of me I cannot see how that can be construed &mdash; in Deputy Mitchell's phrase this may not be precise &mdash; as an extension of trade union rights or whatever, because that is a more restrictive definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.  Certainly, it narrows the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.  More importantly, it almost renders it impossible of application in as much as I have seen trade disputes &mdash; and I have tried to avoid this kind of trade dispute to the best of my ability &mdash; in which minimal disruption was caused as a result of that trade dispute.  If one is having a trade dispute the first rule is to endeavour to make it effective.  But there have been trade disputes in which to say that it significantly disrupted the business was not always the case.  There are any number of examples one could give of that type of circumstance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; in this Bill was to be defined as only a circumstance in which significant disruption of business occurred, there could be all kinds of retrospective litigation arising therefrom having regard to the fact that &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; is central to a number of sections we will discuss subsequently, for example, section 14 (2) (a), which deals with the rule changes that must be made <Col N="370" /> in union rule books in order to comply with the provisions of this Bill.  One of those is &mdash; and I refer to section 14 (2) (a) &mdash; that a union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike or other industrial action without a secret ballot.  If the definition can be interpreted to include industrial action which significantly disrupts business, I suggest it is incapable of being applied in all cases.  In a great many cases the intention of the union or workers involved would not be to significantly disrupt business, but rather to tweak the employer's tail, not to give him a root up the posterior.  This very often precipitates a meeting between the parties involved and to agreement.  In such cases, the taking of industrial action is not necessary.</P>
    <P>It would be unfortunate if we were to extend the definition which has stood the test of time because this would invite litigation.  It would also prove difficult in the industrial environment to observe it. At this stage I do not wish to refer to the consequences which fall into two categories. Deputy Mitchell has proposed that where the words &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; appear in the Bill they should be amended to read &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo;.  This reverts back to the definition of industrial action he is seeking to have included in the Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan and I are seeking to have the major provisions of the Bill including those on secret ballots confined to strikes and to excise the reference to industrial action. As I said, industrial action can mean almost anything you want it to mean.  For example, a go-slow or a work to rule could be defined as industrial action.</P>
    <P>To insist on a secret ballot before such action could be taken, as the Minister has done, is a recipe for disaster.  Instead of having two minute stoppages in industry, which are resolved after two minutes, we will be inviting a rash of unofficial industrial disputes.  There is no conceivable way that shop stewards in the workplace can ring union headquarters to make arrangements for a secret ballot if all they want to do is tweak the tail of the employer about some minor problem which is proving to be an irritant and <Col N="371" /> incapable of easy resolution.  This is unfortunate.  I ask Deputy Mitchell again to reconsider his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; includes picketing, conspiracy as defined and action affecting contracts.  It is necessary to include this broad definition to ensure all industrial action, short of a strike, will be preceded by a secret ballot under section 14.  I would like to point out to Deputy Rabbitte that we see this as a fundamental part of the Bill, as I said on Second Stage. Industrial action, irrespective of the type, can lead to a significant disruption of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 states that the rules of a trade union shall provide for a secret ballot before organising, participating in <Col N="372" /> or sanctioning a strike or other industrial action.  Deputy Mitchell's main amendment proposes that the rules should apply only in respect of a strike or major industrial action and he intends withdrawing this amendment.  I feel major problems could result from accepting this amendment. In the first place, it is not always clear beforehand what the effects of any form of industrial action are going to be, major or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, the phrase &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo; is entirely subjective and could give rise to great problems of interpretation &mdash; would it cover work to rule, bans on overtime and go slows? What does &ldquo;significantly disrupting the business&rdquo; mean?  The reality is that almost all forms of industrial action disrupt business to a considerable extent &mdash; that is what it is for and if it does not significantly disrupt the business it is of little use.  For these reasons we should stick to the definition in the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <P>Since I do not propose to accept this amendment Deputy Mitchell's other amendments fall.  With regard to Deputies O'Sullivan's and Rabbitte's amendments it is my intention that the provisions in relation to secret ballots will apply to other forms of industrial action as well as strikes.  Actions short of full strike action can often be as damaging and as disruptive as strikes, and indeed because of their nature can be more difficult to resolve.  It is, therefore, essential that this type of action should be subject to the secret ballot provisions.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, it is already normal practice for unions to ballot their members on proposals for many forms of industrial action short of strike action.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendments proposed by the Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be helpful. We are discussing the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; and I wish to refer to what the Minister said.  When we come to discuss the section we will speak about balloting procedures and so on but I was about to say that I am beginning to realise, with a great sense of foreboding, why Mr. John Dunne and the Federation of Irish Employers are so complacently quiet and satisfied with the Bill as published. The Minister has taken this opportunity to confirm that he intends to insist that secret ballots be held on proposals for any form of industrial action if trade unions are to enjoy the protection of this legislation.  The section states that a union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike or other industrial action without a secret ballot, otherwise they would be offside and in default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we mean by industrial action? Deputy Rabbitte has already referred to this but let us tease it out so that we know exactly what we are talking about. Industrial action means any action which affects or is likely to affect the terms and conditions whether expressed or implied of a contract and which is taken by any number or body of workers acting in combination or under a common understanding as a means of compelling their employer or to aid other workers in compelling their employer to accept or not accept terms or conditions of or affecting their employment.  That is industrial action.  Members of this House will remember the alacrity, sharpness and intelligence of former Deputy McDowell in this House.  Just imagine him or any other senior counsel acting on behalf of an employer and interpreting this section. Industrial action can be anything from demanding that the quality of the coffee in the canteen be improved to demanding that basic wages be increased.  Are we seriously to have secret ballots for every one of these?  It is just unbelievable.  This is Ceaucescu land.  I do not know who is <Col N="374" /> writing this stuff or how it has slipped in. I may be misinterpreting it but I do not think so because I listened carefully to what the Minister was saying.  He said that we will get to it at a later stage when we get to section 14 and talk about the amendment in the names of Deputies Toddy O'Sullivan and Rabbitte to delete other industrial action for the purposes of voting.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with definitions.  I respect what the Chair is trying to do to make progress so I am confining myself to definitions.  If the definition as proposed stands, literally any action such as tweaking the tail of the employer, as Deputy Rabbitte said earlier on, by any group of workers would be industrial action.  Take the example of this House.  If four or five people involved in any one section of it, at any grade, dissatisfied with, for example the quality of tapes that they are being supplied with because they are being constantly re-used and there is a buzz in the ears, decide that they want to get these improved, is there going to have to be a ballot before this happens?  If they take any kind of action, like a go slow, or just non-compliance to some degree with the normal work practice without a ballot as provided for in section 14 then they would be outside the protection of the law.  Is the Minister seriously proposing this?  If he is, he is creating a potential place for himself in history and I do not think it is the place he had in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect that we would be precipitated into this discussion so early because I was quite happy, for the reasons I outlined earlier, with the definition of industrial action as it stands. We are now, inevitably, because of the manner in which the amendments are grouped, involved in discussing the implication of industrial action and the manner in which it is included in the Bill generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it impossible to believe that the Minister is fully aware of the implications of what he is seeking to do here.  I say that in the full knowledge that the Minister's industrial experience and knowledge of industrial relations is well known.  I would <Col N="375" /> suggest, however, that he has little personal experience of what this will do in the manufacturing sector and in the industrial sector generally.  To require a ballot for all industrial action as defined in this Bill is an invitation to a rash of unofficial disputes.</P>
    <P>It is like the reference I made earlier to excising the worker against worker dispute.  We are also caught up in the fashion of the times, that it would be churlish at the minimum, to oppose the idea of a secret ballot.  None of us has done that; but to impose an obligation to have a ballot every time, say, women workers in a complex electronics assembly plant have a complaint about toilet facilities but are getting no response from their employer and are threatening to stop work, would lead to more industrial disputes and short term stoppages than we have seen in the last 20 years. That is not an exaggeration.</P>
    <P>Let me put in context what the Minister is talking about here.  We are not just talking about section 14.  We are talking about removing the immunities that apply to workers normally in a trade dispute if it can be shown or even suspected that they did not comply with section 14 of this Bill which requires the trade unions concerned to enshrine in their rule books the particular provision of section 14.  In other words, within two years of the passing of this Act all trade unions shall contain a provision in their rule books as stipulated in section 14 and if any section of that is not complied with then the immunities that are conferred on workers in a normal trade dispute are removed.  It is preposterous that that would be suggested.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly the Federation of Irish Employers who agreed with that and lobbied the Minister behind the scenes on it are doing a serious disservice to employers in this economy because the facts are that anybody who has the remotest connection with industrial relations in the private sector knows that every day of the week there are small areas where the shoe pinches and which can be resolved without any elaborate dispute, <Col N="376" /> work stoppage or whatever.  Under the definition of industrial action, however, that situation will be included here.  I am not sure that the Minister intended this. Let me refer the Minister to the words of a former Minister for Labour from his own party in 1969.  The then Minister, Dr. Hillery, made the point &mdash; and he abandoned a Bill on this basis &mdash; that it was useless bringing legislation to this House for enactment if it did not have the voluntary co-operation of the trade union movement.  That principle is as valid today as it was then.  The trade union bureaucracy, for example, might wish &mdash; many times as a trade union official I so wished &mdash; to have these terms, but to think that it would be capable of being applied in the actual industrial environment is to live in Disneyland.  In the dynamic of the private sector, in the routine day to day working of industry, there is no way an obligation ought to be imposed to set the secret ballot mechanism in train.</P>

      <P>Is eol dom go bhfuil tuairimí mar sin nochtaithe ag saineolaithe áirithe thar na blianta agus, cé gur mhaith linn go léir go mbainfí níos mó úsáide as an nGaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga labhartha sa Ghaeltacht, táim dóchasach faoi thodhchaí na Gaeilge mar ghnáthmeán cumarsáide inti.</P>
      <P>Tá caomhnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga labhartha mar bhun-aidhm ag na scéimeanna éagsúla atá á reachtáíl ag mo Roinnse agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus táim sásta tríd is tríd go bhfuil ag éirí leo san aidhm sin.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh, is ar phobal na Gaeltachta cuid mhór a bhraitheann slánú na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha.  Cabhraíonn mo Roinnse le pobail Ghaeltachta pleananna Gaeilge a ullmhú agus a fheidhmiú agus spreagtar iad freisin trí na comórtais forbartha pobail atá á reachtáil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Tá céimeanna breise glactha le tamall de bhlianta anuas chun cosc a chur le meath na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar shampla amháin de sin, tá cúnamh bliantúil á chur ar fáil anois d'Eagraíocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta &mdash; eagraíocht chomhdhéanta de mhúinteoirí agus tuismitheoirí &mdash; atá ag iarraidh tuiscint níos fearr a thabhairt do thuismitheoirí agus daltaí sa Ghaeltacht faoi thábhacht a dteanga féin.</P>

    <P>Níl aon amhras freisin ach go gcabhróidh an fhorbairt a dhéanfar amach anseo ar an tseirbhís teilifíse trí Ghaeilge le staid na Gaeilge a neartú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Tá mé sásta go bhfuil an tAire Stáit dóchasach faoi thodhchaí na Gaeilge, ach ní féidir liom glacadh leis.  Is é an fáth gur ardaigh mé an cheist ná go raibh a fhios agam go raibh leabhar á fhoilsiú, is é sin an leabhar a foilsíodh an tseachtain seo caite ag Reg Hinley, dar teideal &ldquo;The Death of the Irish Language &mdash; A Qualified Obituary&rdquo;.  Deirtear, mar shampla, sa leabhar: &ldquo;I am sure that over-attention to second language learning of Irish in the schools has deluded most Irish people into an unawareness that the native language is on the brink of extinction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith leis sin, sa tuarascáil a chuir Bord na Gaeilge ar fáil anuraidh, &ldquo;The Irish Language in a Changing Society&rdquo;, ar leathnach 101, deirtear:</P>
      <P>Thus we come back to a central thesis in the report: there is need for a major and comprehensive State initiative in the development of bilingual policy and, in the specific case of the Gaeltacht, State agents should work in line with State views, values and commitments.</P>
      <P>Cad iad na moltaí nua atá ar fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta?

Caithfidh mé a rá, áfach, tar éis cuairteanna a thabhairt ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta ar fud na tíre, nach féidir liom aontú leis an tuairim sin.  Sular thug mé cuairt ar na ceantair Ghaeltachta seo cheap mé go raibh áiteanna imeallach go leor ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ach caithfidh mé a rá go raibh mé tógtha go mór le caighdeán na Gaeilge sna ceantair ar thug mé cuairt orthu.

The technical groups are the important current phase of the programme and group one, in which Ireland will participate, will deal with the following areas: age participation in schooling, student attendance, secondary school completion rate, higher education entrance rate, higher education attainment rate and science and engineering graduates.

In defending the integrity of the person involved, and the standing in which he is held not only in Irish education circles but throughout the world, I should say he was a very important person in the formulation of the programmes.</P>

      <P>The Minister should avoid an attempt to answer what is a legitimate question about the participation of her Department by trying to defend a named official against charges which were not made against him by me or by anyone else.  Can the Minister confirm that the OECD document published on 7 October &mdash; a copy of which I have here &mdash; gave a list of the 20 countries participating in the networks, and that Ireland does not appear on that list as participating in any of the networks? Without any reference to Mr. Bill Hyland or anybody else, would the Minister simply answer the question?  Was Ireland participating in one of the networks at that time and, if so, what steps has the Minister taken to correct this OECD publication?  If we were not participating at that time, is it not the case that Ireland <Col N="387" /> is only participating now as a result of this question having been put down?</P>

      <P>Co-operation between the Department of Education, Northern Ireland, and the Department of Education, Dublin, has been and is a feature of education in Ireland.  Currently this co-operation is twofold.</P>
      <P>The Anglo Irish Intergovernmental Conference Education Committee's European Studies (Ireland and Great Britain) project, jointly organised and funded by the Department of Education, Northern Ireland, the Department of Education, Ireland, and the Department of Education and Science, England, aims to contribute to the current educational development in the three jurisdictions and also in the wider dimension of the European Communities.  The vehicular subjects are history and geography and the project currently involves six schools linked by electronic mail in each jurisdiction respectively.  The project team, in co-operation with the authorities of the respective jurisdictions, develops modular inputs in the vehicular subjects in such a manner as to create minimal disruption in the national subject syllabus but designed to achieve the project aims. This project will be examined at the intermediate and day vocational examinations for the first time in June 1990.  The project team have been requested to submit modules for consideration and insertion into the new junior certificate history syllabus for examination in 1992.  The expansion of the school network and the programme of studies is currently under active discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Anglo Irish Intergovernmental Conference Education Committee also <Col N="390" /> set up the history conferences project to revive, on a systematic and structured basis, the series of conferences organised on a co-operative basis in various locations in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland from the early seventies onwards.  Two such conferences now called CEDPATH &mdash; the Combined Education Departments' programme for the advancedment of the teaching of History &mdash; Conferences have taken place, one in Belfast in September 1986 and one in Dublin in September 1988.  The next is planned for Oxford in September 1990.  Participants &mdash; regarded as multipliers &mdash; include inspectors, key academics and senior history teachers from the three separate jurisdictions, thus ensuring widespread dissemination of the work of the conferences.  The themes of the conferences are designed to sensitise participants to the latest in scholarship and teaching in the discipline of history.</P>
    <P>Mutual understanding of various problems has been fostered by the scholarly consideration, in an appropriate ambience, of these problems and the respective perspectives on them that prevail. Reports of conference proceedings are produced and distributed in the three jurisdictions.  The influence of these ongoing conferences on classroom practice and curricular reform and pedagogy is significant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these conferences which are mostly one off events. I welcome also the project involving six schools &mdash; which is not a lot but is something. When does the Minister expect we will be teaching the same history syllabus for the leaving certificate this side of the Border as the students will be learning on the other side of the Border?  Will it be in this century?  Will we have to wait until the 400th rather than the 300th anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne before a similar interpretation and similar episodes is taught in schools both sides of the Border?</P>

      <P>I can understand that, as the Deputy comes from that area. However I cannot say if it will be in the next century; I do not know when exactly it will be. Changes in syllabi must be made in the correct way.  These come about through seminars and the dissemination of the information is gradually worked into books and examination questions, content, attitudes, etc.  It is a very long process.  I share the point of view that the more awareness, vigour and alertness students can have of the different aspects of history and how people's attitudes to history can change, the more important it is that there be a co-mingling of that.  I have said publicly that it is equally important for us to keep in correct order events as they happened and their interpretation in modern terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 57 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The day-to-day running costs of primary schools are discharged by making funds available by means of State grants and contributions from local sources.  The State capitation grant is not intended to meet operating costs in full.  Each board of management are responsible under the Rules for National Schools, for making arrangements for the collection of such funds locally, in supplement of the State grant, as will ensure that the school premises will be adequately heated and cleaned and kept in proper decorative condition.</P>
      <P>A local contribution towards running costs, equivalent to at least 25 per cent of the State capitation grant, is lodged each year in a bank account in the name of the school.  As is laid down in the handbook <i>Boards of Management of National Schools &mdash; Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure:</i>&ldquo;the sum required to meet the local contribution shall be provided by the parish community or other appropriate analogous community or body and there shall be no levy on the parents of children attending the school&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that boards of management, in general, are familiar with the above rules and bring no undue pressure to bear on individual parents with regard to the making of financial contributions. There can be no question of the payment of an enrolment or registration fee being made a condition of admission of a child to a primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of capitation grant was <Col N="393" /> increased by 11 per cent in 1989 and by 6 per cent in 1990.  The question of further increasing the grant will be considered when the 1991 Estimates are being prepared.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental principle of the free post-primary education scheme that no charge be made in respect of: (1)  instruction in any subject of the Department's programme for secondary schools; (2) recreational or study facilities of which all the pupils are expected to avail as part of the school programme; and (3)  any other activity in which all pupils are required to take part.</P>
    <P>Voluntary contributions by parents or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme are permissible under the free education scheme, provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay the voluntary contribution, and that there is no question of sanctions against pupils whose parents choose not to make such a contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply amazes me because it appears that the Department are unaware or do not accept that they have a constitutional requirement under Article 42.4 of the Constitution which provides that the State shall provide free primary education. In the first official language, Irish, it is even stronger: &ldquo;Ní foláir don Stát socrú a dhéanamh chun bunoideachas a bheith ar fáil in aisce,&rdquo;.  Ní foláir &mdash; the State must, yet the Minister says it is not required to make the full contribution.  Is she aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister a question.  Is she aware of a study done in Dublin which showed that the average cost per pupil in Dublin schools is £45.47p and from the Department of Education list of 1987-88 the contribution from the Department was £24 and from the Diocese &mdash; that is the local contribution &mdash; £6, making £30.  In <Col N="394" /> other words the State and local contributions were providing only two thirds of the cost of education.  What steps will the Minister take to ensure that the Department provide the constitutional requirement of free primary education?</P>

      <P>I have not got with me the study to which the Deputy refers. There have been so many studies of the funding but I am sure the Deputy is right in his information that there was such a study.  That was 1987-88 and since that period there was in 1989 an 11 per cent increase and in 1990 a six per cent increase in the capitation grants.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister check with the Department to see if they are fulfilling their constitutional requirement? As I understand it this is going to come up within the next year.  Is she aware that if parents do not make the contribution they are asked for for various pieces of equipment for the school, they do not have a school of equal value with equal educational possibilities as those in the areas which make contributions of up to £120 a year per family? There is inequality of education by virtue of the fact that one area provides a far better school with far better equipment than other areas.  Is this not correct?</P>

      <P>It may well be that the Deputy is putting forward his view on the point with integrity, but a school is a building and in that building there are teachers who are a major resource of that school.

The equipment is another matter and it varies from school to school but the teachers are of the same calibre and in areas which are deemed to be disadvantaged or where the pupils are deemed to be disadvantaged we have, through a series of special grants and measures which I will be referring to in another reply, made contributions and will continue to so do increasingly from now on so that any perceived inequality will be eased.</P>

      <P>Is it now a matter for the school authorities to apply for planning permission?  The plans are acceptable and the site is there, so everything seems to be in order except to apply for planning permission.  There will be no difficulty with that because preliminary discussions have already taken place with the Corporation in that regard.  As soon as planning permission is acquired will the school then commence?  That is what the parents are asking me to ascertain.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that during the past eight years or so there have been appeals to the Department, especially during the time of the last Government, for progress on this school but that absolutely no progress has been made.  Only in the last couple of years have we made significant progress. The procedure, as the Deputy should know, is that the local management board apply for planning permission after which the working drawings are prepared. When those drawings are completed the project is put out to tender. <Col N="397" /> This special school is in a deplorable condition and it is a high priority with the Department.  The Minister is determined that work should commence as soon as planning has been completed.</P>

Will the Minister agree that by relying solely, as we do, on written examinations as a method of assessment and not using other methods we are putting greater stress on the sort of skills and aptitudes that can be imparted through grind schools?</P>

The Deputy's second question related to the <Col N="402" /> assessment and examination procedures and the reliance on written work <i>vis-àvis</i> any other type of assessment.

      <P>My Department were approached recently by the De La Salle Order, who are running St. Michael's Assessment Centre on behalf of the Department, concerning the accommodation at the centre.  It was indicated <Col N="405" /> that, although the centre was registered as a place of detention for 28 young offenders in 1976, subsequent necessary alterations to the building and difficulties experienced in areas of control and management have resulted in a situation where the centre is currently incapable of coping with more than 20 boys.

      <P>It is accepted that a problem has existed for quite a number of years in regard to assessment and detention for young boys.  However, I reject the assertion that there has been a major increase in the numbers needing this kind of treatment.  Indeed, there has been a significant development in preventative measures through the provision of a considerable amount of extra accommodation for boys in this category, especially those who are homeless, as many of <Col N="406" /> them are throughout the city, especially on the north side.  We have given funding from our youth budget over the last two years to help run those centres.  We accept that there is a problem and need for development in regard to assessment and detention of young boys.  As I said, this question is being addressed by the interdepartmental group and I hope that recommendations will be forthcoming shortly on how this problem should be tackled.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 15 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>Any proposals on the lines raised by the Deputies would normally be considered in consultation with the teachers' representative bodies and the representatives of the managerial authorities.  To date no such proposals have been raised for discussion with my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the number of teachers who left the service on invalidity grounds in recent years has increased dramatically and that many of these cases were caused by stress related problems?  Does she recall a newspaper article which I submitted to her recently regarding a survey which indicated that the cholesterol and blood pressure levels among teachers were at an alarmingly high rate?  Irrespective of consultations with teacher bodies &mdash; for instance ASTI are carrying out their own survey &mdash; will the Minister encourage this <Col N="407" /> sort of work and undertake it in her own Department because the health of a significant number of her employees is very obviously at risk?</P>

      <P>In 1986 43 new disability pensions were granted at primary level; in 1987 43 were granted; in 1988 there were 47 granted and the same number in 1989.  The number is not huge in the context of the overall cohort of teachers.  The number of new disability pensions in the post-primary sector was 30 in 1986, 28 in 1987, 30 in 1988 and 30 in 1989.  These figures seem to be relatively average.  There is no doubt that teaching is stressful.  I am aware of Deputy O'Shea's interest in the matter.  The ASTI are setting up a working group to study the level of stress in second level teaching and I am sure they will be talking to us about the results of this study.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahearn has raised this question on a number of occasions.  As the Deputy knows, it <Col N="409" /> would be very difficult to implement job sharing for teachers because of the need for pupils to have the same teachers follow through on their subjects.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 21 together.  Pupils are not compelled by any departmental regulation to repeat the leaving certificate examination.  Students choose to repeat the examination in order to improve their overall performance for a variety of reasons and I do not propose to deny them the opportunity of doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that one of the basic problems in the increasing number of students who tend to repeat the leaving certificate is that generally children tend to enter second level education too early?  When pupils sit their leaving certificate they are essentially too young and immature to make the choice of a lifetime.  I believe there is some merit in going back to the concept, which was introduced at one stage, but not followed through in all schools, of a transitional year which tried to slow down the level of progress and enable pupils find their true level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We touched very briefly on this issue before the Deputy came into the House.  As the Deputy <Col N="410" /> knows, generally children are 12 years plus before they enter second level education. Out of the 850 second level schools, over 600 now provide a six year cycle of one kind or another, for example, VPTI, VPT2, a transition year and the option of a repeat leaving certificate.  The transition year is provided in a number of schools.  By order of the Fine Gael Government in the preparation of the Estimates in February 1987 which they left us &mdash; I accept that we could have changed this &mdash; the transition year was to be stopped except in schools where it was already in effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say, if I am correct in my interpretation of her reply, that she has no intention of minimising the number of students who can repeat the leaving certificate. Can the Minister say if any study has been carried out at departmental level to ascertain the reason for the high number of students repeating the leaving certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I took the Deputy's two questions together because he seemed to refer to an element of compulsion in both of them, in particular Question No. 21 which referred to the number of students who are forced to repeat the leaving certificate each year. In my reply I said that nobody is forced to repeat the leaving certificate.  It is my intention beginning with the senior cycle this year and continuing for the next two years, which will coincide with the abolition of the matriculation examination and various other measures, that a student can repeat the leaving certificate as often as he or she wants to but the combination of points from one year to another will not be allowed after 1992.  A student will be judged on the results of his or her leaving certificate in one year. Of course, a student can sit the leaving certificate examination as often as he or she wants to.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the number of students repeating the leaving certificate could be minimised if her Department allowed second level students to repeat the year of their choice?  Would she not agree further that this would be a much better option than giving students the only option they now have of repeating a very stressful year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an incorrect statement.  The Deputy must not be aware of the notification of an arrangement which was sent to all post-primary schools during last year's summer holidays and which was implemented in the academic year beginning in September 1989.  This arrangement provides for a greater relaxation of the rule in regard to repeats which was introduced in 1985.  It is now very much decided by the principals of the schools in conjunction with the parents.</P>

      <P>Young people have certain ideas on various matters but I am sure Deputy Ahearn will agree that a decision in regard to repeating the leaving <Col N="412" /> certificate examination is best left to the principal, the teachers and the parents who know best whether a child needs to repeat the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a teacher exchange scheme for permanent posts in primary schools would require the agreement of school management authorities and the teachers' representative organisation.</P>
      <P>My Department had discussions on the matter &mdash; some quite recently &mdash; with representatives of those bodies.  A difficulty arises in reconciling the implications of such a proposal with the autonomy of boards of management in making appointments in schools.  It is not clear at present how this difficulty may be resolved.  We are still talking about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if, for instance, for serious domestic reasons an exchange of posts would serve genuine humanitarian considerations and if there was no educational disadvantages to schools and the boards of management had no problem with it, that type of exchange should be authorised?  Furthermore, would she agree it might very well be in the interests of teachers' careers to change schools and teach in different types of schools in different environments?  In circumstances in which there is no objection from boards of management would she see her way to authorising that type of exchange?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have advocated &mdash; as has the Deputy &mdash; that, where the two boards of management in question were in agreement on a transfer system, they, the patrons, should so allow.  I thought that was a matter that could be resolved in that way.  However, <Col N="413" /> when it was put to the management authorities &mdash; I mean the executive wing of management &mdash; they expressed objections regarding the introduction of this exchange scheme for the following reasons: they said it would interfere with the right of a board of management to appoint the teacher most suitable for a post to their school and would interfere with the board's authority as employer. It is proposed to hold further meetings to discuss the issue in order to ascertain whether those difficulties can be overcome. If it is a case of a mutual transfer, one which receives the agreement of the individual boards of management, it seems to me a great effort should be made, that the overall management body should agree to such a mutual transfer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 51, 52, 59 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>Government approval for the Sligo swimming pool project, for which a fixed grant of £1 million was allocated, was granted on the basis that the centre would be financially viable in its operation.  It was subsequently found necessary, following discussions and correspondence with Sligo Corporation and with the Departments of Finance and the Environment, to commission a feasibility study in July, 1989 on aspects of cost-effective management, design, income and expenditure of all the proposed regional sports centres, including Sligo.  This study was completed in September, 1989.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the study was that the swimming pool, as an extension to the existing sports centre in the town, could achieve viability in its operation with an efficient design to facilitate cost-effective management supported by marketing and financial expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Sligo Corporation recently submitted revised proposals to my Department for the appointment of consultants to undertake the planning of the project.  I have had discussions with Sligo Corporation in the past week on all aspects of the planning and construction of the swimming pool project.  I hope to complete those discussions in the very near future.  In accordance with normal practice for such projects, payment of the grant will be made by my Department in instalments on foot of architects' building certificates as work proceeds.  The grant of £1 million in this case has been fixed by Government, accordingly.  It is not open to me to increase the approved amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, he himself made the announcement more than two years ago; it was an absolute, total and concrete announcement; no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; about it.  Presumably the Government conducted studies before allocating a sum of £1 million. Why then was it necessary to conduct a special study one year later to ascertain whether the entire pool was viable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the simple reason that there are swimming pool projects throughout the country utilising considerable amounts of money, many of which remain closed for many months of the year due to their inability to operate on a viable basis largely on account of bad planning and management.  The objective of the regional sports centres programme is to overcome these problems. That has now been done.  For example, on next Monday evening I will be addressing Sligo Corporation to make the final announcements on the actual development of the project.  While it has taken much longer than any of us would have wished, I am quite satisfied that the time taken has been justified in the sense &mdash; in the case of the Sligo regional centre, as in the case of all others &mdash; we will have very fine facilities.  Much thought has been given to and much research conducted overseas into modern techniques deployed in leisure and recreational <Col N="416" /> facilities and in their management.  As a result of all of this, in Sligo we will have a facility of which we will be proud. Second, we will have a facility which will be professionally managed and also will be utilised.  As the Deputy will be aware, one of the major problems experienced <i>vis-á-vis</i> leisure and sports facilities here is their number that are totally under-utilised; in fact the numbers that could be described as white elephants.</P>

      <P>It is an extraordinary admission that the Government gave £1 million for a project they did not know would be viable or otherwise and then had to carry out a study afterwards.  It is a disgraceful piece of political playacting. In view of the two years that have since expired and the fact that prices have escalated in the meantime, may I ask the Minister of State if he will make more than £1 million available now?</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, as a result of the work we have undertaken, we will build in Sligo a swimming pool for approximately £1 million.  I might add that the last swimming pool of a similar type built in this country was completed over 12 months ago at a cost of £1.4 million.  That arose as a direct result of the kind of work and research we have undertaken.  We can achieve major cost savings in construction and, more importantly, we will have a pool that can be operated successfully.</P>
      <P>I might add that a number of pools at present open at the beginning of the year, some close three months later when the local authority subsidy runs out, and remain closed for the remainder of the year.  That is the kind of bad planning and management we have striven to overcome.  I am glad to inform the House we have now succeeded in that objective and that we are now entering a new era of leisure and recreational provision and management.</P>

      <P>In response to requests from the Opposition benches, I am making this brief statement to the House on the events which occurred in Enniscorthy yesterday, 1 May 1990.  Deputies will be aware of the application of the <i>sub-judice</i><Col N="450" /> rule in this House, under which no statement or comment can be made here which might be prejudicial to any persons facing criminal charges or about to face criminal charges before the courts. Accordingly, I consider myself very constrained in what I can say here today, because, while the preferring of criminal charges is a matter outside my role, and entirely a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, there must be a strong possibility, to say the least, of criminal charges being preferred arising out of yesterday's events.</P>
      <P>A preliminary report has been received from the Garda authorities to the effect that a number of persons, at least some of whom were armed, entered the Allied Irish Bank in Enniscorthy shortly after 3 p.m. yesterday.  A short time afterwards the bank alarm was activated and this was monitored in the local Garda station.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that four uniformed gardaí were deployed outside the bank where they came under fire.  Fire was returned and one man was injured.  He is currently in a serious condition in the intensive care unit in Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda Commissioner and the members of the force concerned on the prompt and effective action taken in Enniscorthy yesterday.  Because of the likelihood of criminal proceedings being taken, I consider that any further comment by me would be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Of course, as is usual, a chief superintendent and a superintendent from outside the area have been appointed to conduct an investigation into all aspects of yesterday's events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wider issue of security policy generally, I want to inform the House that the Government remain committed to the policy of ensuring that the Garda have the necessary manpower, training, equipment and other resources to enable them to tackle and overcome all forms of criminality from whatever source, be it subversive or otherwise.  The Government's resolve on this issue will not be diminished and armed confrontations <Col N="451" /> with gardaí on our streets will only strengthen our resolution.  Armed crime and lawlessness will not be tolerated and the Government will continue to take whatever steps may be necessary to deal with the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to congratulate the Garda Síochána on the very successful operation they carried out in Enniscorthy. It is very clear that the response of the Garda Síochána to the raid was a highly professional one of which we can all be proud.  The members involved showed great skill, sound judgment and exemplary bravery in confronting and apprehending the raiders.  It is very appropriate that the congratulations of this House should be conveyed to the commissioner, Mr. Crowley, and that we ask him to convey to all concerned our congratulations.</P>
      <P>When handing out kudos we should not forget the bank staff, in particular the resourceful member who got to and activated the alarm button which notified the Garda Síochána of the raid.  When speaking about armed raids we sometimes forget the trauma experienced and the risks faced by bank staff and the staffs of other financial institutions.</P>
      <P>In speaking about the raid in Enniscorthy it is also appropriate that we bear in mind the extent of criminal activity involving the use of firearms.  The last crime report indicated that there were 672 cases of robbery and burglary in which firearms were used, an increase of 16 per cent on the previous year.  None of us can be happy with this state of affairs and even if this means putting through the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, we should take every step necessary to reduce those awful statistics. There is also a danger in modern society that we take too much for granted, such as the commitment and, very often, the bravery and heroism of the members of the Garda Síochána, mostly unarmed, who are in the front line in the fight against crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> The latest crime report to which I referred earlier indicates that on average there was no more than one incident every day of the year involving assault, wounding or other acts endangering life and like offences, against members of the force.  In all there were 429 such offences against gardaí on duty.  This is an aspect of modern life with which we must all feel very uncomfortable and which we must bear in mind when it comes to passing legislation and taking any other steps to support the efforts of the gardaí in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>In relation to the raid in Enniscorthy, I hope the manner in which the raid was dealt with by the Garda Síochána will be a clear signal to the criminals of what they can expect in the future.  The Minister has not made it clear whether there was any paramilitary involvement, but whether there was or was not, makes no difference; such acts are completely unacceptable to all civilized members of this community and there is absolutely no support for such criminal acts.</P>
    <P>Let me make one further point, and this concerns our duty and commitment to the members of the Garda Síochána. They are entitled to the best of equipment, training and leadership in their efforts to combat the awful crime figures. The gardaí themselves, through their representative bodies, have requested an examination of their organisation.  This is a longstanding request of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and, indeed, the members of the Garda Representative Association at their conference which is being held in Killarney have requested that a commission of inquiry be established for that purpose.  It is also appropriate that this House should support the Garda Síochána who want to be as efficient and effective as possible in the last decade of the century and into the next century.  Therefore, I suggest the Garda request is a reasonable one and the response of the Minister for Justice, that that is a matter for the Garda themselves, is not a fair one.  It is they who are making this request and, accordingly, it deserves our full support.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the morale of the Garda <Col N="453" /> Síochána is sky high after this very successful operation in Enniscorthy.  Let us build on this, encourge full support for the efforts of the Garda Síochána among the general public and take on board the reasonable request made by the Garda representative associations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure your warning came a little late.  I am grateful to the Minister for responding so speedily to Deputy Spring's request this morning for a statement on this matter.  I would like to begin by adding my voice to those which have congratulated the Garda Síochána on their speedy and effective action in Enniscorthy yesterday.  We are very fortunate to be served by a highly dedicated Garda force.  Their bravery yesterday in a tense and difficult situation when it appeared they were outnumbered but still managed to arrest all suspects was a credit and a tribute to the force, in particular to the gardaí of the Wexford-Wicklow divisional area.</P>
      <P>It appears from what we have read that the secret of success in yesterday's action was the speed with which the gardaí were able to respond.  Perhaps it was also fortunate that the gardaí sent to the scene were properly equipped and trained in the use of firearms.  Clearly there are lessons to be learned and applied from these factors and I trust the Minister for Justice will ensure that those lessons are correctly applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have a difficulty with what we might wish to say about this operation. Having regard to the fact that there undoubtedly will be prosecutions and trials, I would not wish anything I might say at this stage to prejudice the outcome of a fair trial for anybody, but it does appear from media reports that there was a paramilitary connection to the <Col N="454" /> attempted robbery yesterday.  If this is so, then there is even more reason to congratulate the gardaí involved.  For too long the Provisional IRA have used terror, robbery, extortion and other methods of thuggery in the Republic to finance their evil deeds in Northern Ireland.  If this is the case, in addition to yesterday's Garda operation foiling a bank robbery it resulted in a severe blow being dealt to the Provisional IRA's activities.  We will all be considerably better off as a result.  Lives may well have been saved in Northern Ireland as a result of the speed and effectiveness of the gardaí yesterday, and for this we are all in their debt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for acceding to the request from Deputies on this side of the House and giving us the opportunity to comment on the excellent work of the Garda in Enniscorthy yesterday. As a Deputy who was critical of certain aspects of the Garda's operation in Athy last January, and who still believes certain questions remain to be answered about that affair, may I now offer my congratulations to the Garda on their handling of the bank robbery in Enniscorthy?  I also wish to tender commendation to the staff and members of the public who helped and confronted the raiders in that operation.  Indeed, it would seem that the Wicklow-Wexford division of the Garda Síochána have much to be proud of and happy about, particularly if we have regard to the fact that in recent times they were also responsible for detecting a large consignment of explosives close to Arklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable, of course, that a raider was seriously wounded in yesterday's incident but it may be that the disciplined and decisive response of the Garda on this occasion prevented further casualties and even loss of life among innocent members of the public.  We do not know for definite yet but some reports suggest that those involved were either members of or associated with the Provisional IRA.  No doubt had the raid succeeded the money would have been used to buy more arms and explosives and cause yet <Col N="455" /> more death, destruction and misery for the people of Northern Ireland.  Against that background the decisive action of the Garda is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the worrying increases in the use of firearms by armed gangs especially in recent years and the serious problems that this has created for the Garda.  As we said at the time of the Athy affair.  The Workers' Party support the right of the Garda to use reasonable force, including firearms, to deal with these armed gangs.  It is significant that those who acted so effectively in Enniscorthy were ordinary uniformed gardaí to whom firearms had been issued.  Indeed, their efficiency compares favourably with several operations carried out by what are supposed to be highly trained units within the force. There are lessons in this for the Garda and for politicians.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would hope that despite the increase in armed crime we will continue with a generally unarmed Garda force to whose members firearms can be issued when necessary.  I also hope that despite the pressure from the Garda associations the Government will proceed rapidly with the Bill to abolish the death penalty. There is no evidence here that the operation of the death penalty is a deterrent to attacks on the Garda as experience during the IRA campaign in the forties showed.  My congratulations to the gardaí in Enniscorthy and to all gardaí who have toiled so long and so hard, often giving up their lives in the campaign against terrorism and armed thuggery in this country.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Relations Bill, 1989: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P>In page 7, lines 13 to 19, to delete the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo; `major industrial action' means any <Col N="456" /> action which affects, or is likely to affect, the terms or conditions, whether express or implied, of a contract and which is taken by any number or body of workers acting in combination or under a common understanding as a means of compelling their employer or to aid other workers in compelling their employer to accept or not to accept terms or conditions of or affecting employment and which has the effect of significantly disrupting the business;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy J. Mitchell.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress we were dealing with the wider issue raised by Deputy Mitchell's amendment to the definition of the term &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;, the consequent impact of the use of that term in subsequent sections of the Bill and especially the implications for section 14 which is the section dealing with the requirement for trade unions to bring their rule books into line with this Act and provide expressly for a secret ballot in the event of a strike or industrial action.  The net point at the end of that discussion was that it was most unwise of the Minister to seek to include in the Bill the term &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; as defined in, for example, section 14.  Far from having the desired effect of minimising the effect of industrial rupture, the imposition on trade union members to go through the process of a secret ballot when often the industrial action involved no more than a minor issue affecting a minority of workers which would not warrant putting in train all of this process for a secret ballot, would only be likely to invite further ruptures of industrial peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot more to be said about it and presumably we will return to it.  I would like to allow the Minister to respond to the case that has been made from this side of the House.  Maybe this has its origins in the experience of the Civil Service unions and some white collar worker unions but in the real world of manufacturing industry and of the industrial environment outside of the <Col N="457" /> more formal practice in the Civil Service unions, the effect of this inclusion would be to invite fractures of industrial peace rather than prevent them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment before us has enabled us to discuss what I consider to be an important aspect of this Bill.  It gets very much to the core of the Bill because section 14 is really at the core of the Bill.  I tabled amendments seeking to change the term &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; to &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo; and added the phrase &ldquo;which has the effect of significantly disrupting the business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte highlighted some uncertainty I had about my proposals. On that basis I have indicated my willingness to withdraw my amendments if the Minister would be willing to consider this whole question and come forward on Report Stage with some better definition.  While Deputy Rabbitte's comments are compelling, to confine balloting only to striking or to picketing would be a mistake when, in other circumstances, there can be serious industrial initiatives or actions.  I hope that between now and Report Stage the Minister will take on board the comments being made by Deputies Rabbitte, Quinn and me and come forward with a more acceptable definition of the phrase &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This morning I went further than the definitions because I thought it was important to do that.  I will certainly have to look at the points made by the Deputies, well made points.  Industrial action involving a strike is one area which is clear enough.  Industrial action of other types is another area.  Deputies Rabbitte and Quinn have pointed out that because of the way the legislation is phrased at the moment very small industrial rows that might last 20 minutes or even only five minutes are included.  I know, a Cheann Comhairle, that we want to proceed through as many sections as we can, but there is a point here and I certainly will look at it, not necessarily to limit it <Col N="458" /> to cases of strike action only because there is more to it than that.</P>

It is important to make the point that arising out of Deputy Mitchell's amendment the discussion was broadened by the Minister. Deputy Mitchell's amendment related only to the definition in the Bill but the Minister broadened its scope to a whole series of consequences throughout the Bill.  There is a distinction between the definition which Deputy Mitchell sought to change and the import of the amendments by Deputy T. O'Sullivan and myself elsewhere in the Bill and especially in section 14.  It is a distinct <Col N="459" /> and different point, and I am quite happy to accept the Minister's commitment on it while entering that caveat and reserving my position until Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell made a point on the major industrial action, which is the keypoint of section 14.  Very sensible points have been made on this very important limited area and I will consider them.</P>
      <P>You cannot take a simplistic approach to this legislation.  A change of one word in a small section can have huge repercussions on another area, and that is why the legislation has to be interpreted as a whole.  Everybody knows that in the sequence of discussions on industrial relations that have taken place over the years there was a commitment by all Governments to talk to the social partners and try to achieve balance.  There was no intention ever to enact legislation which would favour one side or another. I had to be conscious of that.  This Bill has benefits for employers and also for trade unions, and we have to achieve a balance which will help the economy and industrial relations overall.  If we lived in a perfect world one could outline in a definition the perfect way to proceed. Indeed I would be bringing forward a different Bill.  This point should be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 30 to 36, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 (1) does no more than re-enact section 2 of the Trade Union Act, 1941, <Col N="461" /> which confined immunities associated with trade disputes other than for conspiracy to authorised trade unions, their members and officials.  My problem is with section 9 (2).  I am dumbfounded that this has attracted so little scrutiny. This is one of the most important issues in this Bill and I believe that the significance of it has been misread, misunderstood and glossed over.  First, we have been discussing the very important issue of what constitutes industrial action.  Second, under section 11 there is the question of secondary picketing, which is critical to this Bill.  Third, there is the question of what is contained in section 9 (2).  In my view section 9 (2) is probably the most serious point of the three priorities I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies, especially the Opposition spokespersons, to look again at the construction of section 9 (2).  I suspect that they took it, as I did initially, that this was designed to deal with what I call the &ldquo;mad hatter phenomenon&rdquo; of the one-man picket who for a grievance, real or imagined, places a picket which stops the entire operation at Dublin port, or somebody like the very colourful lady who waves her crucifix in the air outside Clery's.  This does very little harm to anyone and adds colour to the city. However if she were to transfer her picket to Dublin port and other workers were not to pass her, this would be a different matter.  I thought that this subsection referred to that and I believe many others think it refers to that and that it is a good thing that we are putting an end to that phenomenon which, I repeat, is the spectre of the sixties haunting this legislation.  I do not believe that phenomenon of the sixties has been repeated in recent industrial history, as far as I can recall, but that is not only what this section says.  Section 9 (2) states that where in relation to the employment etc. ..... of one individual worker, there are procedures which are normally availed of in the employment concerned, or agreed procedures for the resolution of disputes, including dismissals, sections 10, 11 and 12 shall not apply until these procedures have been resorted to and <Col N="462" /> exhausted.  What that means in layman's language is that the immunities conferred by sections 10, 11 and 12 do not apply in the event of one individual worker being dismissed.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a myriad of disputes where the cause was the dismissal of one worker, most often the worker who was instrumental in trying to organise the plant, employment or enterprise and as a result of putting his or her head above the parapet and trying to form a trade union &mdash; to which workers have a constitutional right &mdash; he or she was dismissed. There are a myriad of other examples but I am just setting out this one.  I am sure the House knows that this is a growing phenomenon.</P>
    <P>It is only a short ten years since the Industrial Development Authority were telling foreign companies coming into this economy that their workers would be expected to join a trade union.  At that time a very high percentage of the total workforce in Ireland were members of trade unions and the IDA asked these companies from the United States, Japan and elsewhere, where there is a different culture from ours, to accept that.  That position has completely changed.  The IDA no longer do that but I am not quibbling about that because that is not the IDA's job; it is the job of the trade union movement.  The number of anti-union employers and non-trade union establishments is growing by the week. Some of these employers are hostile to the concept of becoming organised into a trade union and very often the person who tries to organise it is dismissed as a result.</P>
    <P>You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, may well share the vagueness but good intentions of some of the contributors to the Second Stage debate on this Bill, when all kinds of speeches were made by Deputies who were full of good intentions but, with respect, they do not know a great deal about industrial relations.  They may ask what is the problem, and if one goes through certain procedures, if that will not solve the problem.  In effect, this provision removes the sanction of strike action in the case of a dismissal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> Employers may no longer fear strike action in the case of a dismissal because by the time the individual worker who is acting on behalf of his colleagues goes through all these procedures, the prospect of a trade dispute in the real world is nil.  Many good trade unionists and shop stewards will be penalised as a result of this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred earlier to The Workers' Party Bill on part-time workers currently before the House.  He will recall that in my introduction of that Bill I instanced a number of contracts, to which Deputy Barnes adverted earlier and in her contribution to that Bill that set down procedures referred to in this section.  If we take the case of 7-Eleven &mdash; I did not name it in the House when introducing the Bill but it has been named since at the shop workers' IDATU conference &mdash; young workers coming into employment are asked to sign a contract which is unbelievable and indescribable. Nobody in this House, the Minister included, will deny that.  There are procedures there which, according to the owner of that establishment, are inherited from the United States.  The young people who so desperately need work agree to sign the contract.  That contract contains a whole series of procedures in terms of the kind of dismissal that I have postulated.  It is beyond doubt that for any person dismissed, who would have to observe those procedures in section 9 (2), the sanction of strike action does not apply.  Effectively the provision removes that sanction.  That is a great shame.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to dealing effectively with the mad-hatter type picket but I would remind the Minister and Deputy Mitchell, both of whom have adverted to their experience in the trade union movement, that we have always operated on the basis that an injury to one is an injury to all.  That is still a cardinal principle notwithstanding changing fashions in the trade union movement.  Where somebody seeks to organise an employment and gets the bullet as a result of <Col N="464" /> doing so, his colleagues, in showing solidarity and in attempting to retain him or her in employment, go through the normal procedure with a view ultimately &mdash; it seldom comes to that &mdash; of taking strike action to protect that person.  I cannot believe this could have been the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>I can see how attractive this is to the FIE.  It is one of the reasons for their acquiescence to this Bill.  This is one of the most serious anti-union measures I have seen in recent years.  It entirely changes the balance of power as between worker and employer.  The worker has no sanction but to withdraw his labour, and that sanction is being withdrawn in this section.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and to take on board my amendment.  Otherwise this section will be inoperable in reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Rabbitte.  I could go through the procedures that one worker can adopt within his union at great length.  When all the procedures have been exhausted, whatever action is necessary can take place in the normal way.  I do not understand some of the points made by the Deputy.  He commented at length on the provision in section 9 (2).  This subsection is intended to remove legal protection in disputes concerning one worker, as well as industrial action by one worker, where the procedures normally availed of in the employment concerned have not been resorted to and exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions would apply to dismissal as well as to other grievances. Where there are no agreed procedures or where procedures are not normally availed of, there will be no loss of immunity for one person strikes.  If there are no procedures that govern the rights of the worker, the worker does not have to concern himself even though it is only a one worker dispute.  Where procedures have been exhausted and no resolution to the dispute found, the strike can be organised on behalf of the single worker provided the majority of those expected to be called on to strike vote in favour of action <Col N="465" /> and provided one week's notice of the action is given to the employer.</P>
    <P>Some of the things we spoke about in regard to the actions of the sixties have not happened.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte there but I am afraid his suggestion cannot be applied.  It would be grossly irresponsible to this House not to do something to try to deal with this issue. What we are doing is providing that where there are no procedures a worker can go ahead and he is covered by immunities, that if he exhausts the procedures and gets nowhere he can go ahead and that if he is a member of a union his union committee or his executive committee can sanction a strike in the normal way. The power of the picket is graphically illustrated in the ability of a single worker to place a picket without warning and to have such a picket respected by other workers.  That is going over the top.  I respect pickets.  I have been involved in both sides in this respect but in the case of, say, unfair dismissals, there are many other procedures which normally trade unions resort to, be it the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court conciliation service so one worker does not have to resort to a picket without first going through certain procedures. Incidents of this kind can cause grave damage to the country.</P>
    <P>In my amendment to this section, after consultation with both sides, a change is proposed.  It was in further consideration of the subsection that the phrase &ldquo;procedures which are normally availed of in the employment&rdquo; could be open to different interpretations and could lead to some confusion and perhaps a disadvantage to some individual worker.  I am therefore putting forward the amendment which comes up in this group of amendments. It is a much tighter amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister and also to Deputy Rabbitte. I am not sure that I accept the concern Deputy Rabbitte has put on the record.  As I understand subsection (2), the intent is to confine it to the Madhatter syndrome, so to speak.  In the amendment in the name of Deputy Toddy <Col N="466" /> O'Sullivan we were trying to establish that the reference to procedures would only refer to procedures which were provided as a collective agreement on such grievances and that there were procedures that would exist.  That covers one area of concern.  The Minister's amendment is an improvement on the original wording in section 9 (2).  It is a broader definition than the one normally availed of which could be construed tightly in a particular circumstance.  My understanding of this is that in the Madhatter situation, if there are procedures they have to be exhausted before any industrial action in the form of a picket or whatever by that individual worker would enjoy the protections of sections 10, 11 and 12.  However, the amendments will refine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I further understand, and this might be at the base of Deputy Rabbitte's concern, that where there are no procedures in a particular place of employment either by custom or by practice or in any written form, the provisions of section 9 (2) will not prevail and that, therefore, the protections of sections 10, 11 and 12 will not be suspended or abrogated.  Deputy Rabbitte is correct to focus attention on this issue.  If procedures are formally written out they have to be adhered to.  If precipative action is taken in advance of those procedures being properly exhausted, the person who does so cannot expect the protection of sections 10, 11 and 12.  Likewise, if there is a practice of procedures or a custom they have to be availed of.  If, for example, in a new employment where there are no procedures, no practice, no custom or no tradition, and somebody is trying to do exactly what Deputy Rabbitte referred to, organise a union in an area, and is summarily dismissed as a consequence, the protection of sections 10, 11 and 12 will prevail and can be invoked by the individual workers and their union.  That is leaving aside the rights of redress that person may have under the unfair dismissals legislation; if they were there for more than two years they would have protection in that context though we are not necessarily talking about what may <Col N="467" /> happen to them but about the bona fides of a strike that may be precipatated by such a dismissal.  That is my interpretation of what that section is about and perhaps the Minister would avail of the opportunity to respond or confirm that that is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what it is about.  The section applies only where agreed procedures are used through custom or are in practice.  If there are no procedures the section does not apply. The immunities would reapply where the procedures had been exhausted.  If the employer does not make an attempt to resolve the issue the section does not operate either.  The section is not designed to get at a worker unfairly in an individual case where he does not want to follow any procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In any other section of the Bill I would be loath to delay its progress through the House but this is a major issue and it has not been responded to.  I would ask my colleagues to reflect again on the argument I am trying to advance.  Essentially, the Minister has responded by making two points.  First, if there are no procedures there is no problem, one can go ahead and ballot. Second, if the procedures are exhausted one can go ahead and strike.  There are fatal flaws in that response.  No employer is so naive as to think that, after the passing of this legislation, he will have no procedures.  The employers who have the most lengthy, tedious convoluted procedures and steps that one must go through are the anti-union employers, employers who set out deliberately to put all these steps in the way.  I instanced the case of 7-Eleven.  I have the details here but out of a wish not to inflict them again on the House I will not read them into the record again.  This is typical of the kind of specimen contract that is being drawn up and which young workers in particular are expected to sign when they come into employment.  What is happening now in Irish industrial relations is what has already happened in Britain and is <Col N="468" /> happening in the labour relations agency in Northern Ireland, more lawyers are intruding into the practice of industrial relations, more companies are retaining lawyers for advice, it is the handiest nixer one could have.  If ever the situation presents itself, if the people of Dublin South-West ever reject me, I may have to set up some kind of consultancy to protect my earnings.  In that situation any lawyer worth his salt can draft a set of procedures which means that the sanction of strike is effectively withdrawn in the case of a dismissal that I have put forward here.  It is not really a response to my argument to say that if there are no procedures there is no worry.  Of course there will be procedures.  There are procedures already, and any company or employer who, after the enactment of this legislation does not immediately go back to the drawing board and draw up procedures is a fool, and I do not think many employers are foolish.  Therefore, unfortunately, the shop steward who raises his or her head is victimised.</P>
      <P>The second half of the response is: &ldquo;What is the problem?  If the procedures are exhausted can he not go on strike?&rdquo; In reality, in the case I am putting forward, the period that would elapse between the dismissal and the procedures being exhausted could be anything from three months to seven months, and in industrial life it is simply not on &mdash; as I know as a dismissed worker &mdash; to go back seven months later and ask for the support of your colleagues.  It just does not work in practice and, with all due respect, the Minister's response does not deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn introduced the Unfair Dismissals Act, and there are two points to note.  The first he pointed out himself, that is, that one has to be in employment for two years before having the protection of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  Secondly, the data are there, and any assessment of the performance of the Employment Appeals Tribunal shows that even where the tribunal are satisfied that the worker was dismissed unfairly, reinstatement is seldom recommended. Lawyers have now advanced the principle <Col N="469" /> of irretrievable breakdown of relationships, and recommend damages rather than reinstatement.  Again, the Employment Appeals Tribunal do not provide a way out in the circumstances I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement will rue the day this section is enacted because effectively it will mean that the person who will try to do the job on the shop floor for the trade union movement will find himself or herself without a job, with no thanks, and no effective capability on the part of the trade union to respond to protect that person's employment.  For that reason I ask the Minister to rethink his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In a number of cases with which Deputy Rabbitte would be more familiar than most of us, it is almost more difficult for trade unionists on the ground to get anywhere when there are no procedures.  At least where you have procedures you can start playing the match on the pitch because you know where the pitch is and what you are trying to resolve.  However, I am not too sure that we will rue the day when we will have a move towards written procedures. In the vast majority of places it will be a big advancement to have written procedures which a trade union can negotiate because they will be binding on the employer as well as on the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand a little more clearly from Deputy Rabbitte's second contribution that really we are talking about firms, companies or employers who will have nothing to do with unions in the first place and will be out to breach all the normal practices.  Even in the case the Deputy cited in this House during the debate on the Protection of Part-Time Workers (Employment) Bill, the workers on the ground will not, as he said, get anywhere. These firms have used those written procedures to their advantage and are obviously winning concessions in that regard.  The example cited by the Deputy has proved that by having written procedures you can advance the position of the workers, and I hope that is the way we will go.  I acknowledge that if an employer <Col N="470" /> will not have written procedures, or will have written procedures but will not give any input to his workers, you can have difficulties regardless of what is in legislation. Whatever Acts we passed, and even if we had an Act just about that person, we would not resolve the abuses of such an employer.  We have to look in a fair way at an area that was, is and will be creating difficulties.  That fair way involves allowing immunities in a case where procedures, customs and practice are followed, and where they are exhausted the immunities will apply.  We must try to force people to adopt procedures and to follow them.  In time that will prove to be useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The deletion of this paragraph as proposed by Deputy Rabbitte's amendment would undermine greatly one of the central purposes of the Bill which is to take any immunities away from wildcat pickets.  I have listened carefully to Deputy Rabbitte and as I see it his amendment is throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  If he has some of the concerns he has expressed, it might have been better had he put down an amendment dealing with the circumstances where wildcat strikes would not be covered rather than dealing with it altogether. It would be too fundamental a change to the purpose of the Bill to be supported.  Perhaps he will consider not pressing the point now but coming forward with an amendment on Report Stage to deal with some of his concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point, I tried very hard, with expert assistance, to provide for wildcat strikes without impunging the rights of the kind of shop steward and worker I am talking about here but I was unsuccessful.  I note that Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan's amendment No. 16 provides for one aspect of what I am trying to do.  I think the Minister misunderstood the point I am making.  It is not that written procedures represent an advance &mdash; maybe in the old days many agreements were not written <Col N="471" /> down, but merely because they are written down, to presume they are an advance or that they order the conduct of industrial relations is not wise.  The procedures I am taking about are unilaterally constructed.  That is the point. The young worker going into 7-Eleven or wherever is asked to sign a document that has these provisions and procedures in it devised by the employer, tailored to meet the employer's needs and there is no input by any trade union.  They are not procedures that are worked out between a union and an employer.  I would have a lot less concern in such a situation.  As far as I am concerned it is fair game, let the union deal with the problem.  We know the extent of this phenomenon throughout the economy and it is growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, one of my last assignments before I left the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union was to go to Killorglin to talk to an American insurance company who were considering setting up there.  The best I could get was that two years after they were set up they would talk to me again.  They told me they were not unionised back in Minneapolis and they could not contemplate the business of white collar workers in the electronics field joining a trade union. It was beyond them and I had to accept that the priority of providing employment in Killorglin as compared to my saying that the employees must join the union now, had to win out.  Sooner or later the normal dynamic will look after itself.  If anybody raised a head there and was sacked under section 9 (2) the sanction of strike on the part of colleagues would effectively, be withdrawn.  That is regrettable. While I failed to draft a suitable amendment I am sure the Minister, with the expertise available to him, will not fail.  I regard this as one of the most important issues in the Bill.  I am not in disagreement with Deputy Mitchell about the wildcat phenomenon and I am open to any advice to provide for it. However, I will not agree to anything that dilutes the rights of workers to form a trade union.  That is the net effect of <Col N="472" /> the provision in the Bill and I must continue to press my point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other amendments on this issue.  I have not heard the Minister refute authoratively what Deputy Rabbitte has said.  We need to tease out the issue because we are talking about taking away rights from a certain category of workers, rights which they have enjoyed since 1906.  We are now about to delimit the exercise of those rights and the protection of them in a certain area.  We all agree on what the proper circumstances should be but Deputy Rabbitte's concern is that the spillover effect of this provision, as interpreted by him, could go much further and would cause problems.</P>
      <P>I should like to tease out this issue.  Let us take the case of a person who signs an employment contract along the lines suggested by Deputy Rabbitte and, after a period of time, is dissatisfied with the terms of engagement or with the fact that he or she cannot organise a union.  It is my understanding that under a subsidiary contract one cannot sign away the basic rights one enjoys under the Constitution. One of the rights a person enjoys under the Constitution is the right to free association and the right to join a trade union. Therefore, any contract between an employer and an employee that would <i>inter alia</i> prevent an employee organising or trying to bring a trade union into a business could be deemed to be unconstitutional. Will the Minister tell me if that general provision applies specifically in the case of a concern like that referred to by Deputy Rabbitte in Killorglin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of a person who is summarily dismissed for breaching the conditions of a contract and it is known to fellow workers that he or she was trying to improve the working conditions in the place of employment.  The terms of the contract between the employee and the employer may exclude such activities.  The workers in that plant may hold a meeting and decide by a majority to go on strike in support of that colleague and I should like to know if that strike will have the protection of sections 10, 11 <Col N="473" /> and 12.  If it does not we are embarking on a very dangerous road because that is not how I interpreted those sections.</P>
    <P>A dismissal may be construed by other workers as being unfair or unreasonable and they may decide, after due deliberation and a ballot, to go on strike. They may do so on the basis that what happened to that worker could have happened to one of them.  That strike may be sanctioned by a trade union and I should like to know if the Minister is saying that the provisions of section 10, 11 and 12 will not prevail.  If he is saying that, we will have to have another look at those provisions on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The employees may sign contracts separately and privately and it may be that one of the terms of the contract is that an employee cannot agitate or suggest to fellow workers that a trade union should be organised in the place of employment.  However, after a period of time an employee may suggest, because of dissatisfaction with the way the employment is progressing, that a trade union should be brought in.  If it becomes known to the human resource manager that an employee proposed to colleagues that the union should be brought in, that employee may be carpeted.  It may be pointed out to him or her that a provision in the contract stipulated that he or she should not encourage others to join a trade union.  The employer may give that individual notice and pay any money due. When that worker goes to his or her locker to collect his or her belongings and tells fellow workers that he or she had been fired those workers may down tools on the basis that a personal grievance was not involved.  They may feel that the <Col N="474" /> individual was articulating the views of all workers.  They may decide to strike until such time as the individual is reinstated and negotiations are opened.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that such action by those workers, who do not involve a union, is not covered by those sections?  Will the effect of section 9 (2) be that those who go out on the picket line will find themselves served with personal injunctions by management and liable for damages if traders and others do not pass the picket resulting in losses to management? Will they be open to civil action for damages because they do not enjoy the protection of sections 10, 11 and 12? If that is the case this is a potential mine-field. If that is the worry Deputy Rabbitte has, and I think it is, we need a clear response from the Minister.  If our fears are confirmed we will have to put down a very strong marker at this stage and examine it further on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn made the point that even if a person has not been in employment for 12 months he or she can go to the tribunal under the unfair dismissals legislation if they are dismissed for reasons of union activity.  The other important point is that immunities in our laws apply only to members of trade unions.  That is the position under the 1941 Act and is a position for which the trade unions have always argued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The basis of a real doubt has been established in the minds of other people who, like myself, did not recognise this section for what it was.  For example, at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow I will be at the Employment Appeals Tribunal on behalf of a constituent of mine trying to allege a case of constructive dismissal, the kind of situation which I have every day of the week.  It would not be proper for me to adduce the circumstances in the House.  There may be a case of a person in an established plant where the trade union has never been successful, apart from getting half a dozen sleeper members &mdash; the rest may be sleeping but that is neither here nor there &mdash; and there is no collective agreement or agreed procedures.  One, two or three people then conclude that they ought to form a union but under section 9 (2) the employer can pick them off one by one without any fear of a collective response from their colleagues.  Do not let anybody in this House tell me that it does not happen; it has happened many times in my personal experience.  If two children come down to Liberty Hall this evening from McDonalds and say they want to take out union cards &mdash; notwithstanding what happened in McDonalds a few years ago &mdash; the same situation applies because this does not refer to a sole worker in employment, it refers to one individual worker of a group.  Therefore, the organiser can be dismissed and told to go through the procedures.  What procedures? The procedures unilaterally drawn up by a hostile anti-union employer are fundamentally anti-worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is marvellous for a person to be able to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and say that he or she has only been employed there since leaving school, that they do not have two years' working <Col N="476" /> experience but since they are contending that the offence is dismissal for trade union membership they only require 12 months and are now trying to make a case based on being sacked.  Even if he were successful the chances of being reinstated are in the statistical data from the Employment Appeals Tribunal &mdash; significantly fewer than one-third of the successful cases merit reinstatement.  Perhaps he will get damages.  What damages do you get after working for nine months for McDonalds or indeed working for a couple of years for any employer? It is not worth counting the amount.</P>
    <P>There is an old principle that the injury to one is an injury to all.  Me today, may be the rest of you tomorrow.  The rights of workers to combine to exercise their constitutional right to form a trade union are being eroded to the point of being eliminated in this section because, by the time the worker has been taken through these procedures and has exhausted them, the prospect of any collective action by the members has gone out the window and the person concerned has lost his job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Non-union workers could not take collective strike action because they do not have immunities. How does that change their position?  If they are in a union the procedures will not be unilateral.  If a worker is active in a union and is dismissed he can take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Act, even if he has served less than 12 months. In the Bill we set out to control the position where there is a one man picket which tends to happen where there are trade unions and negotiated procedures. A worker can take unilateral action and cause great disruption which tends to be the case rather than the isolated case about which Deputy Rabbitte spoke which is in a non-union house and has no immunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstands the position.  I was not referring to a non-union house where the immunities do no apply anyway.  Non-union houses have become organised as <Col N="477" /> a result of a dispute.  The position is that you may get a half a dozen members who may have been sleeper members for a very long time or they may just walk in off the street to you, but it is the fact of taking action against a particular worker that causes the rest of the workers to join. This means that they are no longer a non-union house, they are members of the union and conferred with the immunities. I am sure the Minister knows the difficulties in the health service where general trained nurses do not have access to the Rights Commissioner or the Labour Court machinery.  In my recent memory the success of the non-INO unions &mdash; my union and the LGPSU &mdash; in organising general trained nurses was often provoked by disciplining on the ward. Because a nurse has no redress open to her she has to get the support of a few of her colleagues and go to the union.  This will no longer be a non-union hospital and sanction of the withdrawal of labour makes sense even to the uniquely authoritarian figure, that is, the matron.  With all due respect, the Minister did not reply to my question.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a non-verbal reply across the House to a point raised by Deputy Quinn.  I think there was a nodded response by the Minister, which indicates a worrying reply.  If a trade union go through the procedures, have a vote and go out on strike in respect of one person, that strike will not be covered.  I want to ask the Minister if that is a correct understanding of the section.</P>

      <P>We are referring to two different kinds of procedures and we would not want to get confused.  I described the situation where a person is dismissed in a non-union house for trying to organise a union.  If the rest of his fellow workers are incensed at this decision they can come together and make two decisions.  First, they may decide to join a union and be recruited by SIPTU or some other union, to whom they can articulate their concern.  If they want that person reinstated but have been told he will not be reinstated, they can tell the union they are prepared to take strike action.  There are no company procedures of the kind referred to in section 9 (2) open to them at that stage because there are no procedures for collective action in that previously non-union house whose members have now decided to join a union in the heat of their anger at the action taken.  The union official will say to this group of people, &ldquo;you are all signed up members of SIPTU and I agree with you that the only way we can get management to talk to us is to take industrial action in the form of a strike, or to threaten it, and under the provisions in section 14 of the new law we have to hold a ballot&rdquo;.  If the new members of that union recruited in the heat of anger because of their perception of the treatment of one of their members, decide to authorise their union official to threaten strike action, will they enjoy the protections of sections 10, 11 and 12?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing exclusively with this amendment even though we are taking a number of amendments together.  Section 9 (1) reiterates the provisions of the Trade Union Act, 1941 &mdash; the exemptions and immunities are provided only for members of recognised trade unions.  Given the implied right of association and non-association, as <Col N="479" /> expressed by the Supreme Court, it seems that the subsection may be invalid constitutionally and will be open to challenge. I am not a lawyer and I do not know if this will be the case.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with part of the issue which is being teased out here.  Should it not be part of good industrial relations legislation to specifically and positively exclude any contract of employment which provides that a person may not be a member of a trade union?  Surely it is a basic right of any person to associate. This has been stated by the Supreme Court in more than one case.  Perhaps we should include a specific provision in this section, which is the place to do it, which will specifically rule out any employer who offers employment on the basis that the person concerned cannot belong to a trade union.  The introduction of such an amendment on Report Stage will go some of the way towards meeting the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Mitchell has reminded us, we are debating a number of amendments together.  The provisions relating to procedures are far broader and can be interpreted in many more ways than the old wording which led to confusion in disputes.  This does not clarify Deputy Rabbitte's point but it clarifies the other amendments put down to this section.</P>

      <P>If the Minister gave me any positive indication of what he was going to do I would not take up the time <Col N="480" /> of the House in having a vote on this amendment.  I suggest, with the utmost respect, that neither the Minister nor his advisers foresaw the points I raised on this section.  The only other possible construction one can put on it is that they well foresaw them, but I should not like to accuse them of being so partisan as to have included the amendment deliberately. I am reluctant to take up 20 minutes of the time of the House in a vote.  I do not know why I should be so reluctant because I understand that when Deputy Ahern was in opposition it never gave him undue worry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's advice.  The Minister should take on board the arguments which have been advanced and come back on Report Stage with an amendment.  There is no point in the Minister hanging his hat on the argument that where no procedures apply there is no problem.  Any employer who, after the enactment of this Bill, does not provide in the contracts of employment of his workers procedures which will obviate this problem for him will be a fool.  I repeat, &ldquo;a fool&rdquo;, and I do not believe that employers are fools.  There will be a host of consultants out there advising on the best type of procedures to implement.  The FIE will distribute them off computer to all their members; they will receive them in the post the following morning.  Therefore, I refuse to even contend with the position that no procedures constitute the answer.  What happens when there are procedures? From experience of the industrial relations mechanism &mdash; which will not change substantially under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; I contend that one would be indeed fortunate to exhaust them after four months after which time the prospects of any kind of solidarity action from one's colleagues to protect one's employment or redress one's grievance will be nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all in favour of cooling off periods as required by this Bill &mdash; that seven days' <Col N="481" /> notice must be given; it has been a rule of my own union operated for years.  I am all in favour of that kind of thing. However, this is a different matter altogether. A serious injustice is being done to the trade union movement.  Trade union officials and activists from virtually every union have been in touch with me, as recently as this morning, IDATU and the vintners and grocers, because this is precisely the kind of phenomenon with which they deal every day of the week.  I predict there will be a growing awareness of the defects of this section.  Again, I ask the Minister to rethink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that what we are endeavouring to do here, on the one hand, is clearly to remove from legislative protection the Madhatter-type strike.  I do not think anybody is in disagreement with that but, in so doing, we want to avoid circumstances already adequately described.  How do we achieve it in law in the drafting of legislation? Deputy Rabbitte has said he has endeavoured to draft an amendment or an addition and has been unable to do that so far.  The Minister is of the opinion that what has been articulated is perhaps more excessive than is warranted in the sense that it is a circumstance unlikely to arise. It is quite clear from Deputy Rabbitte's professional experience in this area that some, not all, employers will have a comprehensive set of procedures providing for redress in the event of dismissal, including recourse to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Those procedures, drawn up by the employer unilaterally, signed by an anxious prospective worker, will be those interpreted by a defence lawyer when an action for damages is being taken against individuals who would be members of a union under the provisions of section 9 (2).  How do we avoid that situation because procedures will be in place, albeit unilaterally drafted and signed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that amendment No. 16 in the name of Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan might provide part of the answer because, at the end of section 9 (2) where it says: &ldquo;... where those <Col N="482" /> procedures have been resorted to and exhausted&rdquo;, the following would be added: &ldquo;provided a collective agreement on such grievances and procedures exist&rdquo;.  In other words, the addition of those words would avoid the very dark scenario to which Deputy Rabbitte referred, which is that in the first instance the rules would have been drawn up unilaterally and written by an employer, that there would have been no input whatsoever. The words are carefully chosen: &ldquo;provided a collective agreement on such grievances and procedures exist&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting we should necessarily accept this today because this is complex territory.  Nonetheless it is my belief it would meet the need of what has been articulated but may open another door about which we are unclear.  Perhaps this should be re-examined and teased out further on Report Stage.  I should like the Minister to take this amendment on board.  The net point he has not satisfactorily answered is that if somebody tries, through a union, to call a strike on foot of a dismissal by an employer &mdash; who had signed an employment agreement with attendant elaborate procedures, including redress after dismissal, for whatever reason &mdash; then that strike action would be in breach of those procedures; it would be precipitous because the procedures would not have been exhausted.  As Deputy Rabbitte rightly said, after three or four months the heat would have gone off and the effective action would have little chance of success.  I contend that amendment No. 16 would meet the legitimate fears of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>What we are saying is, simply, one will only lose the protection of sections 10, 11 and 12 &mdash; and this is what this amendment means &mdash; if one ignores or fails to fully exhaust procedures and take precipitate action, including a picket in a strike.  We are saying that one will only lose the protection of sections 10, 11 and 12 if one fails to exhaust the procedures, provided those procedures themselves are deemed to be fair, and the best way of ensuring they are fair is that they be collectively negotiated and agreed by both sides, but, <Col N="483" /> in the event of one taking action &mdash; those procedures having been so agreed &mdash; then the protection of sections 10, 11 and 12 would obtain.  I believe that amendment meets the legitimate concerns and argument voiced here.</P>

      <P>We have debated this at some length.  Obviously Deputy Rabbitte feels strongly about this section.  I know he is being very supportive of the Bill, as is everybody in the House.  I am not here to use the force of numbers or delay the House 20 minutes by way of division because, as Deputies are already aware, the Bill contains a great number of sections. I have been consulting my advisers. I do not know how we can achieve what the Deputy wants but certainly we are prepared to re-examine the matter and communicate our views.  There is not much point in my saying I can certainly do it.  I have a view on some earlier suggestions as to how I can meet Deputies' requirements but, frankly, I do not foresee an easy way of overcoming this one.  However, by way of being helpful, I will have another look at it with the help of my advisers.</P>

      <P>I know we are talking about what is contained in a set of procedures. Here perhaps I am arguing against a position I took earlier, which was that one cannot have a subsidiary contract under which people sign away some of their rights to go to law, including a court of law, which must be construed as a fundamental right.  Perhaps that is the reason the Minister is not accepting it.</P>
      <P>It seems the more we can keep the courts out of industrial relations matters with regard to a set of procedures the better.  Section 9 relates to the Madhatter strike syndrome rather than the courts of law.  We may have opened up another dimension, which it was not anybody's intention, but is it not possible for those procedures to confine themselves to the various levels of conciliation and arbitration right up to the Employment Appeals Tribunal?  On another occasion &mdash; if we do not do so on this occasion &mdash; we may want to reduce the number of appeals to courts of law which follow on foot of Employment Appeals Tribunal hearings which employers frequently make as they have the stronger muscle.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of merit in the proposals being made by the three Opposition parties and I ask the Minister to outline his reasons for not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I also look forward to the Minister's explanation as I cannot see any reasonable reason for not accepting <Col N="486" /> one or other of the amendments.  I do not mind which one is accepted.  I would draw the opposite conclusion.  I think this affirms the case I made on section 9 (2). If we are to include the right of access to a court of law how can the Minister's advisers seriously advise him that there is a prospect of strike action?  As I am not sure the Minister heard the point let me repeat it.  If one keeps open the option of going to the civil court at the end of all the procedures we discussed, how can the Minister's advisers seriously tell me that the arguments I made on section 9 (2) are invalid?</P>
      <P>Where a case ends up in the civil courts following the procedures laid down, no unfortunate worker could finance such a case.  The ordinary worker could not afford to take a case to a civil court.  A big factor in the operation of the Unfair Dismissals Act is that employers are now appealing decisions to the Circuit Court and workers are unable to pay the legal costs involved in such a defence.  The procedures are already unwieldy, but despite this the Minister is refusing to stipulate that it may not include an appeal to a court of law.  This is unreasonable and confirms that it is the employer's lobby who are behind this section.  They want to ensure the procedures are the end of the road, and they want to leave open the option of drafting into these procedures the right of access to a court of law if they so wish.  This is an important point.</P>

We do not envisage any person or group taking a legal case but to show how flexible I can be &mdash; I am not so sure Deputy Rabbitte is as flexible given the views he has expressed &mdash; I would be quite prepared to stitch it in if, as Deputy Quinn and Deputy Mitchell seem to think, it would strengthen the Bill.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for proposing this rather innocuous change in wording from the <Col N="488" /> negative to the positive is a philosophical one with which the Minister, his advisers and colleagues are no doubt very familiar. The question which must be posed is whether this Republic in the last decade of the 20th century can see its way to giving its workers the right in law under the Constitution to withdraw their labour in a positive manner &mdash; the fundamental right to strike &mdash; and to confer that right upon them in positive terms as against the rather negative, begrudging, Victorian manner in which it is expressed in the 1906 Act, a classic piece of British fudge, both intellectually and legislatively, which is at variance with the civil code in every other member state of the Community.</P>
    <P>Most people in this House are aware of the long and elaborate debate which took place on whether we should change the 1906 Act and on the probability that section 4 of that Act was unconstitutional. It was a very good thing for industrial relations, the trade union movement and employment conditions, that a High Court action on that point was resolved privately.  Had the matter gone through the full legal process, there is no doubt &mdash; and this view is shared by a wide section in legal circles &mdash; that the immunities section of the 1906 Act would have been found to be unconstitutional. Along with Deputy O'Sullivan I have attempted to provide an amendment which does minimal damage to the text and intellectual structure of this legislation while at the same time making the right to withdraw one's labour a positive right rather than an Act which is considered not to be actionable.  The reason for making this point is self-evident.</P>
    <P>For most of us in this House the only thing we have to sell is our ability to work.  We should be allowed use this asset and the right to work in a positive manner.  If the European Social Charter and the social dimension of the European Community are to mean anything and if the rhetoric still rebounding off the walls of Dublin Castle is to make any sense in the last nine years of this decade, and as we head towards the next millennium surely this sovereign Republic can confer <Col N="489" /> a positive right to strike upon its people. If one reads the text of what is proposed one could imagine one was reading some kind of Dickensian penny dreadful.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) states the following:</P>
    <P>An agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be indictable as a conspiracy if such act committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime.</P>
    <P>We know the history of it over the period of the last century coming into the compromise legislation that was drafted in 1906.  We know the imperial background in Victorian and Edwardian England that produced that kind of thinking and that kind of language, but do we need to enact it now?  I would respectfully suggest to the House that we do not, that the effect of the amendment proposed and of the consequential amendment would be to make the section read that any agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall be lawful if such an act committed by one person was within the law.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is accepting this amendment.  Therefore I will allow him to quickly respond.  I do not want to have an extended debate on this because the net point is clearly set out by me.  In the document circulated in 1986 of the outline of the principles of the proposed new trade and industrial relations legislation to which this draft legislation now in front of us bears considerable similarity, the question of positive rights prevailed over the immunities argument at that time.  The Minister has seen fit to change it and to go for an immunities-based system in relation to the right to strike.  I reject that for the reasons stated and people who know me could expand on the sort of arguments that would give support to that rejection but, in deference to the House, because of the amount of time we have already spent here and since I have made this argument elsewhere, I will not repeat it <Col N="490" /> now.  There is a subsidiary argument as to why we should move from the negative phrase &ldquo;shall not be indictable as a conspiracy&rdquo; to the positive phrase &ldquo;be lawful&rdquo;.  That argument is in relation to the possibility of liability for unions, because while some actions may be lawful in the sense that they are not criminal acts, they could be open to the question of liability and that has been referred to at some length.  It will surface later on as we go down through this legislation.  In proposing this amendment on behalf of the Labour Party I would urge the Minister to accept it.  It has been carefully phrased so as not to disrupt the logic and the internal language of the legislation. We have gone through this with our own legal advisers and it does not have a knock-on effect anywhere else in the Bill but stands alone and is self-contained.  It is the kind of language with which I believe the Minister would prefer to be associated rather than what is in section 10 (1).</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not accepting this I want to say briefly that I support the amendment by Deputy Quinn which is rather neatly drafted and which I would urge the Minister to take on board.  Section 10 effectively re-enacts the immunities concerning civil and criminal conspiracy provided in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act which, whatever about the way it sounds, really provided that a strike would only be a criminal conspiracy after that Act if the participants committed acts which would be individually unlawful.  It is unfortunate that the opportunity is not taken to amend section 1 to provide that an agreement or combination to break contracts of employment would not be actionable.  Since a breach of contract is actionable if done by one person alone, a conspiracy to break contracts of employment is actionable despite section 1 and it is for that reason that I have tabled amendment No. 20 which would seek to include the words &ldquo;in tort&rdquo; at the end of section 2.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate that but I suggest that they are connected because one deals with criminal conspiracy and the other deals with the liability to civil conspiracy of a third party who may be damaged as a result of the dispute.  However, I will not labour the point seeing that the distinction is drawn but I do think there is merit in modernising the language and expressing it in positive terms as is suggested in Deputy Quinn's amendment.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In rising to speak on this I am doing what I did when we were discussing the Bill on the Army, making an appeal for the sensible and logical use of the English language. I do not know whether it is the draftsman but there seems to be a hangup about continuing to use archaic language. Daniel O'Connell would have taken this in one mouthful in his day.  The same system seems to continue.  It is not the Minister's fault.  I presume it is the legal draftsmen who say that if there is no negative in one cannot go to court and defend it.  If the Minister can do anything for the sake of the English language I would be glad.  Perhaps the people drafting the legal documents would take some notice of what is being said.  I am all in support of bringing in something that reflects 1990 and not 1890.</P>

      <P>The subsection re-enacts the first paragraph of section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, as amended by section 5 of the Act of 1906 which has itself been repealed and re-enacted.  This is necessary for clarity and for technical reasons also.  After the repeal of the combination laws in 1824 trade unions were no longer <Col N="492" /> criminal so far as statute law was concerned. Section 2 of the trade union Act, 1871, clarified that trade unions were not criminal at common law.  However in 1872 it was held that a strike might amount at common law to a conspiracy to coerce or molest an employer in the conduct of his trade or business notwithstanding that no individual criminal acts were involved.  As a result of this decision the Royal Commission on Labour Laws was appointed in 1874 and following its report of 1875 the Act was passed nullifying the decision and, as part of section 3 of the Act of 1875 which has been re-enacted, only covers the act of combining and in no way gives any immunity for acts that would be criminal if committed by one person.  For example, the section does not change the law on breaches of the peace, unlawful assembly or rioting.  Unfortunately I cannot accept Deputy Quinn's amendments because they reduce the concept of positive riots into provisions based on immunity and I am advised that this is not appropriate.  What is provided for in section 10 is an immunity for certain actions which might otherwise be actionable as a conspiracy.  It does not make lawful acts which are unlawful.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the first amendment.</P>
      <P>The second amendment also attempts to introduce the principle of positive rights in section 12, and a close reading of the first two lines of that section will show that the proposed amendment would render the provision meaningless. For that reason I cannot accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 50, after &ldquo;actionable&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in tort&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment goes back to the question we have been dealing with concerning the implications of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  Following the enactment of that legislation a strike would only be a criminal conspiracy if the participants committed acts what would be unlawful regardless of the strike.  As we know, the judges were successful at the time in undermining the effectiveness of that Act in two cases in particular: the Quinn <i>v.</i> Leatham case and subsequently the Tafe Vale case which had such severe political repercussions on the neighbouring island and which led to the election of the Liberal Government in 1905 and subsequently the enactment of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Quinn's amendment was not accepted, section 10 (1) provides protection for criminal conspiracy situation.  Section 10 (2) relates to the situation for civil conspiracy and to the possibility that a third party who considers himself to be adversely impacted on by a trade dispute may sue a group of workers who go on strike in breach of contract.  I am advised that the neatest way of protecting against that situation is to merely add at the end of section 10 (2) the words &ldquo;in tort&rdquo;.  In other words, acting in pursuance of an agreement in contemplation of a furtherance of a trade dispute &mdash; I agree with Deputy Browne about the archaic language &mdash; shall not be actionable unless the act if done without any such agreement or combination would be actionable in tort.  I hope the Minister can take that on board.</P>

      <P>The subsection re-enacts section 1 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, without amendment.  The section provides protection against liability for civil conspiracy to those acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. A number of court judgments after 1875 developed a new civil liability for conspiracy which exposed workers to the possibility of being sued for damages for being involved in a strike.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the case of the Tafe Vale Railway <i>v</i>.  the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants of 1901 which found that a trade union could be sued in its own name for actions of its officials.  The Royal Commission was established in 1903 and the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, was passed.  Section 1 followed the <Col N="497" /> recommendation of the commission.  Section 10 (2) is a re-enactment of section 1 of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906.  The subsection provides that: any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute is not actionable unless done by one person.  The subsection has stood unamended since 1906.  It has stood the test of time and should remain as drafted.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;, or where that is not practicable, at the approaches to,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this group of amendments is to clarify beyond reasonable doubt where it is possible to place pickets.  This applies in particular to multi-employment locations such as ports, airports, shopping centres and industrial estates. Section 11 (1) states:</P>
      <P>It shall be lawful for one or more persons, acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at, or where that is not practicable, at the approaches to, a place where their employer works or carries on business,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seeking to amend that provision by <Col N="498" /> deleting &ldquo;, or where that is not practicable, at the approaches to,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 24 proposes to give workers in these circumstances the right to place a picket outside their place of employment provided it is a public place or outside their place of employment, provided it is a place to which the public normally have access, even though it may be on private property, provided the owner of that private property has not indicated in writing his objection to their being on that private property; I have in mind places such as ports, airports, industrial estates and shopping centres.  Failing the first two provisions workers have a right to place a picket adjacent to or at the nearest approaches to the place of employment where it is not practicable or possible to attend at a point closer to the entance.  This is an important proposal.  My proposal is a better elaboration of the point.  It is clear and does not take away from the rights of workers.  It prevents a situation recurring whereby a dispute with one employer, for instance, at a port or industrial estate could affect the other employers and employees in that industrial estate, port or shopping centre even though they are in no way concerned with the dispute.</P>
    <P>I recall that when I was Minister for Transport we had a dispute involving dockers with the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Pickets were placed at the entrance to the port.  Even though the port is owned by a public authority it is considered private property and is not considered a public place.  The dockers had no alternative but to place the pickets at the entrance to the port thereby nearly scuttling entirely the B &amp; I Line and seriously damaging a number of other companies such as Coal Distributors.  The B &amp; I Line at that time were striving to survive and get over very acute difficulties. Indeed, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; if I remember correctly &mdash; was very much involved with the trade union in the B &amp; I Line.  Due to circumstances beyond their control a picket was put at a place which affected their business.  Not only were their own workers reluctant to pass <Col N="499" /> the picket, although in the case of Congress unions that restriction can be got over by the all out picket procedure, but many suppliers and many passengers refused to pass the picket.  The strike which lasted only five, six or seven days &mdash; and could have lasted much longer &mdash; cost the B &amp; I Line a fortune because of the diversion of business.  That should not be the case.  The manner in which the Bill is drafted leaves that possibility open.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to extend rights by saying that not only have workers the right to place pickets on a public place outside their employers but they have the right to picket on private property of this type unless the owner of that property withdraws in writing that permission.  For instance, if the B &amp; I Line were on strike and the reverse was the case, the workers would picket outside the B &amp; I offices in the port rather than at the approach to the port.  On the other hand, if the Port and Docks Board said, &ldquo;No, you must not do that and here is a letter saying we will refuse you permission&rdquo;, the picket has to go on at the entrance to the port.  I hope the Minister and the House will see the wisdom of this provision and will agree to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Mitchell's concern in moving this amendment. He is worried about the question of picketing at multi-employment complexes, as he has been explaining to us, in ports, airports, industrial estates and shopping centres.  I share his concern and I emphasise that the wording of the Bill was advised with such situations in mind. The present wording will achieve the same end but in our view in a much less complicated way than the arrangement proposed by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear has been expressed that the use of the words &ldquo;at the approaches to&rdquo; will lead to picketing at the entrances and approaches to multi-employment complexes. That ignores the words which come immediately before those words, namely, &ldquo;at, or where that is not practicable,&rdquo;. The test to be applied is <Col N="500" /> whether it is practicable in all the circumstances to picket at the individual employer's place of business inside the complex.  It normally should be possible to arrange that the picket be placed directly at the premises of the employer involved in the dispute.  Only where the owner of a complex objected to the picketing taking place inside the complex would the saver come into effect and the picket would be placed outside.  If an employer should choose to exercise his rights to prevent trespass onto his property that is clearly recognised in Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  However, as I have said, the Deputy and I are in agreement on what we are seeking to do.  I am satisfied that the wording in the Bill will achieve this end in a less complicated way.  We have had discussion and representation on this because of the practices involved.  We have looked at this closely and we have been advised that the section will achieve what both Deputy Mitchell and I are trying to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial estates, shopping centres, ports and airports, even though they may be under public authorities, are private property and picketing cannot take place within the boundaries of that private property unless we amend the Bill along the lines I have proposed.  The Bill as drafted only perpetuates the present position where the entrance to the employment covered by the trade disputes exemption is the entrance to the port, industrial estate, shopping centre or other multi-employment location.  It is not the entrance to the employer themselves.  It is the entrance to the whole complex, as it were, and that is a serious flaw in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will accept that the Bill as drafted does not cover the point.  I hope he will see that if there were a strike <Col N="501" /> tomorrow in the B &amp; I Line or in some other company in the port of Dublin the pickets from such strike would be placed at the entrance to the port with very serious effect not only for other employers in the port but potentially for the country in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to property rights, normally without difficulty an employer waives the right and allows a picket to be placed.  We are emphasising that where that is not practicable the approaches would cover the position.  To attempt to define it in an over-complicated way would not achieve anything more.  I am not arguing with the point of principle the Deputy is making.  It is our advice that this wording will have the same effect both in law and in whatever way it will operate.  I know too well what has happened on occasions.  My advice is that this wording will overcome the difficulty in so far as it can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the amendment and on section 11 &mdash; one cannot logically debate the amendment without having regard to the implications in a broader sense &mdash; the Minister in this instance, in marked contrast to section 10 where studious attention was paid to re-enacting the verbiage and text, so to speak, of the 1906 Act, is now proposing in relation to section 11 to change the 1906 Act in respect of picketing quite substantially.  He might explain to the House either now or when debating the section why he has seen fit to change it.  I think I know some of the reasons but I would like to hear the current up-to-date reason it has been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will need to talk this amendment through clearly because this is another potential flashpoint of industrial relations with regard to picketing.  There has been a great deal of hysterical talk over the years regarding picketing and the rights of picketing, much of it influenced by the intemperate language which comes from across the water from current supporters of the &mdash; at last &mdash; declining Tory administration but it has coloured the judgment <Col N="502" /> in some employment and employer circles here.  I hope the Minister when replying on the amendment will clarify what is in the mind of the drafting people who wrote into this section &ldquo;where that is not practicable, at the approaches&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; mean in this instance? If you had an industrial premises opening onto the footpath and there was a gate on the footpath, the footpath is common territory, the employer is not in private ownership, therefore the picket could go there, provided it was not causing obstruction to traffic, in compliance with normal civil law requirements as administered and exercised by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Secondly, if there is a factory in an industrial estate there will be some kind of approach outside the gate and if the employer refused to allow the picket to go inside the curtilage of the property owned or leased by the company the picket can be placed at that approach. There is a clear point there.  However, suppose to maximise the impact of the picket, the strikers, the pickets, decided to put a picket on the entrance to the entire industrial estate because from their point of view this is highly practicable, it may be a more effective point to focus attention on the fact that they are in dispute with this company.  I understand the 1906 Act made no restriction as to the location or confinement of pickets although subsequently over a long time legal cases gave definitions.  I have not been persuaded by the logic of the argument Deputy Mitchell put forward in respect of his amendment, but I would like to hear the Minister outline what is intended by the phrase &ldquo;where that is not practicable, at the approaches&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me to give an explanation of the section but we will be dealing with that later.  The principle behind this is that an individual or union, the strikers, will have to picket their own employer.  In a case where an employer puts forward his or her property rights and refuses to allow a trade union to picket on his or her premises, it would not be practicable for the strikers <Col N="503" /> to put a picket on the gate or the entrance to that property.  I am allowing for that because it would be equally unreasonable that they could not picket.  There are other circumstances that relate to that position.  Strikers, acting in furtherance of a legitimate industrial dispute, who have gone through the procedures in total, and who wish to place a picket but are in some way frustrated by some group from so doing, are covered by the phrase, &ldquo;where that is not practicable&rdquo;.  Otherwise, they picket the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely convinced by that argument.  It is ironic that the 1906 Act, born out of the anti-union climate at the beginning of the century, is less restrictive than what is proposed in the Bill.  Major changes are contemplated in picketing policy.  The 1906 Act permitted peaceful picketing &ldquo;at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be&rdquo;.  We know that the courts subsequently tightened that up, and quite properly so.  That arose in the case of Irish Dunlop Ltd <i>v</i>.  Power, and Datsun Ltd <i>v</i>.  O'Loughlin, and none of us have a complaint about that.  However, under the 1906 Act once the act is in furtherance of a dispute there was no restriction on the premises which could be picketed and there was no restriction on the number of people picketing.  When the matter was tested the courts stipulated the maximum number of picketers, that picketers should conduct themselves in a peaceful fashion and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to tighten this up and, conceivably, he could create serious problems in the case of IDA industrial estates, large shopping complexes and so on.  I should like to instance a case in my constituency that has been the subject of a row for many years, the construction of the Tallaght town centre which finally, after being designated a tax-free zone, got going.  That occurred after the two local authorities concerned had to cave in and hand over the fee simple to the developer.  In fact, we will now have the first major town centre in <Col N="504" /> Ireland that is private property.  If there is a dispute with any of the anchor tenants at that location the developer, it seems to me, will be perfectly within his legal rights to remove a person from the site. He will be able to remove that person to such a distance, bearing in mind the vast area involved, that he might as well be waving his picket at the moon.  The picket will have no impact.  The ideal thing was to be able to place a picket adjacent to the person who was being picketed.  If the firm being picketed was, for example, Quinnsworth, the name of that company could be written on the picket board in order to indicate to people that the dispute was with that company.  I am sorry that this provision is being tightened up. While I have some sympathy with the motivation of Deputy Mitchell's amendment, it is my view that it will only serve to tighten the matter further.</P>

If we are concerned about Guinness, for example, the position is clear because it involves a one-employer place but if we are talking about Clonshaugh Industrial Estate, the Pearse Street Enterprise Centre or the port of Limerick that is a different matter.  &ldquo;A place&rdquo; is not defined.  I understood that the purpose of the legislation <Col N="505" /> was to see to it that workers who were not involved in a strike were not dragged into it, but that major loophole has not been closed.  The Minister owes it to the House, and to himself, to come up with a clearer definition of what &ldquo;to attend at a place&rdquo; means, particularly where we have multi-employment locations.  We have mentioned ports, airports, industrial estates and shopping centres, but in other places such as medical halls there could be more than one employer.  In an undemocratic way a small minority could affect the livelihoods of a big number of workers who were not involved in a strike.</P>

      <P>We have established that it is not a right and it is open to a union to interpret this phrase and picket at the entrance to an estate, as happened on many occasions.  We must not assume that all owners of such private property will waive that right and we must not assume that all trade unions in all circumstances will interpret the law the way the Minister would like them to interpret it.  The reality is &mdash; and we must remember this &mdash; that we are essentially dealing with problems in regard to unions out of the mainstream.  In the vast majority of <Col N="506" /> cases this Bill is not needed in respect of unions belonging to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because we already have very good procedures and practices in relation to them.</P>
      <P>We should remember the main flash-points of the dreadful industrial relations period over the last 15 years.  This Bill clarifies beyond doubt that workers have the right to picket private property unless permission to do so is specifically withdrawn in writing.  The Bill should seek to enhance the situation whereby workers who go through normal procedures regarding balloting, etc., are fully supported by law.  Bad practices and habits should not be supported by law whether they come from unions or &mdash; as is more often the case &mdash; management.</P>

      <P>You cannot legislate to overcome employers' property rights. That is why the wording is in that form. If workers cannot picket their place of work &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; they picket the approaches to it.  Perhaps there have been employers who indicated that the individual premises could not be picketed and that the picket would have to be put on the approach to it but it does not happen very often.  In the vast majority of disputes, the picket is where it should be and does not disrupt other people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that in defining the legislation in a more restrictive way we might create problems for ourselves by driving people outside the law.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to President Hillery when he was a Deputy in <Col N="507" /> this House and the famous ESB emergency legislation.  Unless there is a broad social consensus within society on the observance of law in regard to industrial relations, the fact that an industrial relations law may be on the Statute Book or that a particular provision may be restrictive, does not mean it will be effective. I do not think that anybody would necessarily disagree with that.</P>
      <P>I do not support Deputy Mitchell's amendment although I see the necessity for the &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; clause having regard to modern conditions and the way in which business is run.  For example, a small tenant in a shopping mall may want to go on strike but the manager of the centre may not allow him to have a picket in the middle of a pedestrian mall&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have to place the picket outside.  It may not mean that there is an antipathy on the part of the manager towards the nature of the dispute, it may just be the sheer practicalities of trying to run the shopping centre, which is that person's concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 (1) does not necessarily cause me any problem although there is a separate amendment in regard to businesses.  The real problem referred to in Deputy Mitchell's amendment is the one he mentioned earlier regarding the deep sea dockers at Dublin Port.  The dockers decided that they were not exercising sufficient industrial muscle on the DCH and the port authorities, they came further up the river and put the picket on the access to the B &amp; I container and passenger ferries.  Will the Minister indicate how this legislation would have impacted on that situation?  The Minister is familiar with the dispute as it was in his constituency and everybody in the industrial relations world was aware of the precarious position of the B &amp; I.  The docks had been a source of difficulty for some years, indeed the former chairman of the Labour Court had undertaken a fairly substantial report in relation to <Col N="508" /> working conditions and how they might be improved.</P>
    <P>What sanctions, if any, are contained in the Bill against somebody who is not practicable in relation to where they put a picket at the approaches to a place of employment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>An injunction can be taken out against them if they picket other than in the designated area.  The port dispute was particularly complicated because deep sea dockers are not in one spot.  Where is a docker's place of work? I have discussed this with many people and I have come to the conclusion that you cannot write everything into law.  If this Bill had been enacted at the time of the dispute the dockers would not have been in a position to picket anywhere except at their place of work which certainly would not have included the B &amp; I headquarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Deputy Quinn asked the Minister a question about the last strike at Dublin Port.  When he asked what the employers would do if the strike occurred under this legislation the Minister replied that an injunction could be brought against them.  When I was Minister for Transport I remember pleading with the Dublin Port and Docks Board not to go into court under any circumstances because the end result would be that the workers would go to prison. We witnessed that before when they were ultimately sent home in taxis.  There should be no place for the use of injunctions as a means of trying to prevent industrial disputes.  We should keep these disputes out of the High Court so far as possible.  We should be seeking to avoid what my mother used to call &ldquo;the occasion of sin&rdquo;.

      <P>Deputy Quinn may have greater experience of these matters and perhaps he will elaborate on them later for my benefit.  Does the Minister not agree we should be trying to avoid the use of injunctions or creating the circumstances where injunctions might be resorted to?  I want to refer to a typical case where injunctions are sought.  Many employers may be affected by a picket but one employer, his business and workers may be so badly affected, even though they have nothing to do with the dispute, that he is forced to seek an injunction to prevent the picketing.  Any sensible person should realise that this is a grave possibility, and is something we should try to exclude.  I submit, in the absence of any definition by the Minister of the term &ldquo;attend at a place&rdquo;, that my proposal is very reasonable and provides fully for the rights of workers while, at the same time, respecting the sort of legitimate worries employers might have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate my reply to the question asked by Deputy Quinn in case it is perceived in the wrong way.  I said an employer could seek an injunction but I do not believe this is the road to go down.  I do not think we can provide in law for all aspects but this section covers the situation fairly tightly. If everybody stuck to the Bill and followed every word in it there would be no difficulty.  However, regardless of what is in the Bill that will not always happen. The legislation provides that workers should place a picket on their place of work.  In cases where this is not practical, for whatever reason they will find a suitable area to place the picket regardless of what I or anyone else may say.  I am trying to be practical in what I am doing. If I provide that they can put a picket 50 yards this way or that way nobody will abide by it.  People who will be trying to sort out a strike in 20 years time either with the Labour Relations Commission <Col N="511" /> or in the Labour Court will laugh when they check what we said in this House. My practical approach to this issue is based on a lot of discussion and advice. I accept totally what the Deputy is trying to achieve &mdash; I have taken those views into account &mdash; but I believe the section as it stands is adequate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked about the purpose of section 11 (1).  This section re-enacts section 2 (1) of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906 which makes peaceful picketing lawful.  It provides for picketing at a person's house, except where business is carried out.  I believe this provision is acceptable to everyone.  I think Deputy Rabbitte said it would be a pity to change what is in the Act but he subsequently said he would not be against this change. It also confines picketing to a worker's own employer except in the circumstances set out in section 11 (2).  I believe this is a reasonable balance.</P>

I have given a concrete example.  Will it be lawful for a member of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement who supports the adoption by a trade union of a boycott of South African fruit, vegetables or goods to act on his own behalf in support of a dispute by being in a picket?  Could the management say that because there were only three of their employees in this picket, the others were not employees, they were therefore, in the context of section 11 (1), outside the law and take an injunction against them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I want to deal with the question of <i>pro rata</i> rates of pay and employment conditions, one of the main provisions of this Bill.  The principle of <i>pro rata</i> rates of pay and employment conditions is something which, to a limited extent over the past couple of years, part-time workers in well organised trade union employments have been securing; there have been some gains made.  The Labour Court has tended to confirm <i>pro rata</i> rates of pay and conditions.  There are a number of Labour Court recommendations to that effect &mdash; for example, in the case of the health services, the <Col N="513" /> most recent example being the two Labour Court recommendations and subsequent agreement reached between the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the Department of Education regarding part-time teachers.  The Teachers' Union of Ireland are to be congratulated on that achievement.</P>
      <P>There are also cases of good employers who apply <i>pro rata</i> rates of pay and conditions to part-time workers.  Unfortunately, the case of the good employer in these circumstances is more the exception than the rule.  The circumstances in which the vast majority of part-time workers find themselves are more usually in employments which are not organised by trade unions, in which the employer is only too willing &mdash; as has been repeatedly demonstrated here in the course of the debate &mdash; to apply conditions of employment much less favourable than those applicable to a full-time worker and to pay the lowest possible rate of pay.</P>
      <P>IDATU, mentioned here recently highlighted at their recent conference the case of young workers being offered appalling contracts of employment in the 7-Eleven group of stores.  It is precisely these workers who need legal protection. Otherwise they will be unfairly treated.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk on the idea that, if one regulates part-time employment, one will discourage employers from recruiting part-time workers.  That raises a fundamental question as to the kind of employment being encouraged. When somebody says that, by providing legal protection for part-time workers, one is discouraging employment, what they are really saying is that they are in favour of cheap labour.  As John Blackwell pointed out in his paper, the principal motivation for employers to take on part-time workers is that such workers cost less.  If we allow a position to continue in which part-time work is not protected by law, in which the rights of part-time workers are not guaranteed by law, in which they are not protected against unfair dismissal, this economy will slide into being a cheap labour one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> The only hope both the Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare offered part-time workers was the promise that, at some future date &mdash; and, as I pointed out yesterday, that is much more likely to be in the distant future &mdash; legislation will be introduced, very probably forced on the Government by the European Community, to protect part-time workers.  In the meantime part-time workers will not enjoy legal protection.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government are serious about their intention to protect part-time workers by law they are afforded an opportunity now to withdraw their opposition to this Bill, allow it to go on to the next Stage and amend it as they see fit.</P>

      <P>This Bill covers a most important area, one in which most public representatives would have had experience of the problems of part-time workers.  In response to what Deputy Gilmore had to say &mdash; when, in a sense, he questioned the resolve of the Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare in this regard &mdash; I have to say that when I read the Bill before the House in October last I thought first it was a Government Bill. Having finished reading it I noticed that it was a Private Members' Bill submitted by The Workers' Party.  With all due respect to the people who brought it forward I felt it was very simplistic, that there would be no way in which a Government would be able, on the one hand, to implement its provisions because of stringent financial circumstances or, on the other hand, to legally enforce some of its provisions.  Nonetheless it is right that it be introduced so that this House be afforded an opportunity to discuss its contents, also the general question of part-time workers with which most of us have had some involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a number of people <Col N="515" /> who from time to time have experienced serious difficulties in their part-time posts whether in the private or public sector. It appears even people employed in the public sector have experienced grave difficulty, particularly in education, when they are let go in June when a college closes and do not know over the summer months whether they will be re-employed in September.  That uncertainty has caused considerable concern in recent years.  I have no doubt that others have mentioned this.  The fact that they are not entitled to any of the major social welfare benefits causes problems.</P>
    <P>In conducting research in this area in preparation for this debate, I was surprised to discover that we here have a very low proportion of part-time workers in comparison with other EC countries.  I accept that for quite a number of reasons part-time work is increasing.  We should examine carefully why it is increasing and also ascertain the reason that, originally, we had such a low rate of part-time work here.  At the same time we should examine thoroughly the other types of legislation pertaining in other EC countries, indeed those without the EC, to learn how they take care of what, in their countries, would appear to be a much bigger sector.  I imagine the increase has been brought about largely by the changing circumstances of our society.  Most of our part-time workers here are female.  I suppose the reason is that most of them would be married women who would be desirous of working for part of the day and would want to tend their children or home before and after.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason we have more part-time workers now than heretofore is that increased technology in industry has led to fewer and fewer people being needed in the workplace.  To a certain extent the part-time facility does help in this respect.  There is no doubt that, in future years, we will have to devise better ways and means of dealing with employment countrywide because of increased leisure time.  This is something we, as a Parliament and as a nation, must accept.</P>
    <P>I was asked at a meeting to find out <Col N="516" /> how many people were employed on a full-time and part-time basis in a large retail outlet in my area but I could not get this information.  I contacted both the Department of Labour, who were unable to help me, and the Revenue Commissioners who, for obvious reasons, were unwilling to give me this information. This is something a Bill of this nature would have to look at in great detail if we are to be able to learn how many people are employed on a full and part-time basis in various firms and different sectors.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter in much greater detail when introducing the legislation he intends to bring forward than was possible in the Bill before us tonight.</P>
    <P>That is one reason the Bill should be rejected and why we need to examine this area in greater detail.  In the case of one retail company which went out of business, part-time workers had no rights whereas rights were afforded to those employed full-time.  Social welfare, unfair dismissals and redundancy should all be looked at in great detail.  Last night the Minister for Social Welfare stated that the adult dependant ceiling is being increased.  I welcome this move as difficulties have been caused where the wife is earning over £50 per week and the husband's social welfare payments are reduced.</P>
    <P>The part-time job incentive scheme introduced a number of years ago has worked well although it probably has led to an increase in the numbers working part-time.  However it meets the needs of those who have expressed a desire to work for part of the day.  It should be borne in mind by the Government and the country at large that this trend is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>This Minister said last night that the National Pensions Board are reviewing the area of part-time work.  I laud this move.  As I said earlier, it is not possible in this short Bill to get at the nitty gritty of what is involved in part-time work and the problems that may be encountered.  I commend the Minister for organising the seminar in May 1989 from which Mr. Blackwell's report emanated.  I am aware <Col N="517" /> that the Department found this to be a most interesting and rewarding seminar and because of this other seminars should be held with greater input from both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers have expressed conflicting views on this topic and obviously it is up to us, as politicians and the Government to strike a balance between the need to allow people to work part-time and the need to ensure there is sufficient legislation to protect such workers.  I have to be honest and admit that there is insufficient legislation on the Statute Book at present to ensure that part-time workers are not discriminated against.  As most Members of the House are aware, they are discriminated against in some sectors.</P>
    <P>A balance also needs to be struck between the contribution paid by part-time workers and the benefits payable to them.  This is another issue not dealt with in the Bill.  The Minister should investigate this issue in his discussions with employers, employees and other interested groups.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the question of equal treatment.  We should all strive to guarantee this but I do not believe the section is strong enough, and it is doubtful if it would stand up legally.  This is another issue the Minister and his Department should look at in greater detail.  This area has been in a backwater for too long.  It is high time we made it a priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has taken a very firm initiative and I hope he brings forward legislation as quickly as possible. Perhaps the movers of this Bill will be seen by some as jumping the gun, but it may provide the impetus for the Department of Labour to bring forward their proposals more quickly.  I ask the Minister to ensure that they do this because many people find themselves in limbo.  It is vital that we introduce proper legislation. There is plenty of legislation on the Statute Book covering unfair dismissals and redundancy which protects those in full-time employment but there <Col N="518" /> is very little legislation to protect part-time workers.  It is high time we put such legislation in place.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Bill is not the correct one; it is too simplistic.  Even before I heard what the Minister had to say last night I felt this Bill was far too simplistic. A much more detailed examination should take place before legislation is put on the Statute Book.  It is not acceptable for someone to say accept the Bill and amend it on Committee Stage.  We need to adopt a root and branch approach and carry out a very detailed investigation into the problem.  Such an investigation has not been carried out up to now and before we introduce legislation this should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been indicated by other contributors to this debate, this Bill provides us with an opportunity to discuss what is a very serious issue, the need to introduce legislation which protects part-time workers.  No Member of this House or anyone outside it doubts the need to bring forward such legislation.  When such legislation is brought forward it will have to be very detailed and specific if it is to mean anything to part-time workers. During the years there has been much debate about the way in which part-time workers in specific sectors have been treated in the past.  It has been acknowledged in a number of debates, for example, on the contract cleaning area, supermarket employers and the security industry, that there is a dearth of legislation on the Statute Book aimed at protecting part-time workers.  We are now involved in a continuation of that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that whatever legislation is brought before the House is adequate.  There are glaring omissions in the legislation with regard to part-time employment and the protection of part-time workers.  I am happy enough that as a result of the debates that have taken place in the last couple of years employers and part-time workers in certain sectors seem to have succeeded in developing a better relationship so that the lot of the <Col N="519" /> part-time workers has improved.  I particularly refer to one of the major supermarket chains where the second generation management now in place seems to have taken on board the need to improve the lot of part-time workers because there are very big numbers employed in some of these major areas. That has happened because of the concern expressed by Members of this House and by other contributors to the debate. It was made known that we could not accept a continuation of a situation where part-time workers worked unsocial hours for paltry remuneration.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his commitment to introducing appropriate legislation to protect part-time workers. In the past year and a half he has embarked on a programme of consultation with interested parties who have a contribution to make towards the drawing up of legislation of the kind we are now discussing.  He has to involve the trade union movement because they certainly have something to say about this issue. He has to involve the employers because they would have a contribution to make; and he has to involve, as far as he can, the part-time workers themselves through meetings with individual groups of them or through contributions that we might make to the debate.  He has to take all this into account in formulating legislation that will take account of the needs of part-time workers.</P>
    <P>In doing that we must recognise that the opportunities for part-time working here are limited by comparison with those in other EC countries.  We have only reached half our potential in this area and have a considerable distance to go.  There is considerable scope for the creation of part-time jobs for people who need that type of facility.  We know from certain surveys that have been carried out that although there are people working in part-time employment because they cannot find full time employment there are considerable numbers working in part-time employment because, for a variety of reasons, it suits them.  We must take account of that so that the legislation <Col N="520" /> we introduce does not lead to a retrenchment in the creation of this type of opportunity. In the past ten years there has been considerable growth.  The number of people employed in part-time jobs has grown to 72,000 which is a doubling of the numbers from 1979 to 1988.  There is a whole range of service sectors out there capable of providing such opportunities, and for the vast majority of part-time workers it is exactly what they want.</P>
    <P>Part-time employment is very wide ranging and in introducing legislation we must be specific about what we are trying to do.  There is, of course, regular long-term part-time employment.  Then there is the short period of part-time employment such as summer work for students and office work for secretarial people which can sometimes be of a much shorter duration.  I am not so sure that we can satisfactorily group all those together without impinging on the opportunities that might develop in the years ahead. Part-time work is not all the same.  There are differences and it could complicate things if any legislation in this area proved inflexible and incapable of differentiating between the various types of part-time employment.  It is important that the Minister bring in legislation that will be helpful to those in part-time employment and give them greater protection.</P>
    <P>I have already said there has been a great deal of abuse in certain sectors of part-time employment.  It is important to recognise the different shades of part-time employment.  We must understand that there are people who can only work part-time and sometimes it is necessary in terms of the individuals themselves or of their family circumstances that they do participate in this type of employment. We must ensure that any legislation introduced does not constrain the growth of part-time job opportunities.  We should learn from our fellow member states in the EC.  We have only tapped the surface so far as the creation of part-time job opportunities is concerned.  We must realise that we lag very far behind some of the more advanced EC countries.</P>
    <P>The opportunities for part time employment lie in the services sector. <Col N="521" /> Part-time employment in these areas is frequently taken up by people who are seeking full-time employment and it frequently leads to full-time employment. It might suit some people to spend a considerable lead-in time in part time employment and, as circumstances change, they may find themselves drawn into full-time employment.  That is a beneficial aspect of part-time employment that is rarely mentioned.</P>
    <P>Part-time employment not only concerns the employee but we also have to look at it from the employer's point of view to see how best they can benefit from the availability of part-time employees.  From my experience, small entrepreneurs when starting out are not in a position to take on a full-time employee.  They might be starting off as a one man business and they would not have the resources to take on a full time employee.  It is the old story, they have to walk before they can run.  They can employ someone on a part-time basis, but if this becomes too complicated it might not be possible for the small businessmen to take on a part-time employee to get the business off the ground.  The development of these small businesses has frequently lead to increased job opportunities.  We must be concerned that we do not make the legislation so restrictive that it becomes a disincentive for a potential employer to take on part-time employees to do a job which may become a full-time position in the future.</P>
    <P>The services sector is the growth area and there are certain long established areas of the services sector that need to take another look at the manner in which they treat their part-time employees.  The remuneration, the unsocial hours have to be taken into account and I would like to see an attempt to include those issues in future legislation.  I do not think we can confine ourselves only to the issue of remuneration and the other issues currently covered by legislation for full-time workers.  The flexibility of part-time employment is crucial and we will have to take this into account when the legislation is being drawn up.  As I said earlier, if we make it so restrictive as to be <Col N="522" /> unworkable we will find that instead of allowing the sector to grow and develop to the benefit of the economy and workers we will cut off an opportunity for workers at a time of scarce employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Last evening when I listened to Deputy Gilmore making his contribution I was disappointed that he was unnecessarily critical of the Minister's tardiness in bringing forward legislation.  It is well known that the process of consultation on this legislation is well underway and he has spelled this out in this House on a number of occasions.  This was also referred to by the Minister during his contribution and by other Members.  I think this was necessary.  I agree that it is urgently necessary to bring the legislation forward and the Minister is committed to doing this.  The Minister has made very considerable progress over the past number of months and the legislation is with various Government Departments for consideration, which I understand is the normal procedure when Government legislation is being brought before this House.  Legislation of this type impinges considerably on other Government Departments.  Last night the Minister for Social Welfare outlined his contribution to legislation of this kind and what he has to do to make legislation of this kind workable.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers expect to benefit from the legislation and I do not think they will thank us if we participate in bringing forward flawed legislation.  I believe the Bill has some serious omissions. The way that remuneration is dealt with is cumbersome and I see it as a prerogative of the trade union movement or representative organisations to take up this issue.  I do not see why the remuneration of part-time workers should be tagged on a proportionate basis to the remuneration of full-time workers. This issue should stand alone and I think that remuneration and working conditions should be decided through the normal channels.  It is a defect in the legislation to try to tie the remuneration of part-time workers with the remuneration of full-time workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> In conclusion, I welcome the opportunity which this debate has afforded us to discuss a process which had begun some years ago under the present Minister for Labour.  We have yet to learn a great deal about the legislation that is required.  The consultative process is nearing an end and I accept the Minister's commitment, when he made a statement in this House saying that he intends to bring forward the appropriate legislation, which is now with the various Government Departments, to Government and to the Floor of this House during 1990 and to quote the Minister &ldquo;at the earliest possible opportunity this year&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is a good and timely measure and it is a credit to The Workers' Party that they have brought this Bill before the House.  We have all heard the cliché, and we have read it in the media every day of the week that &ldquo;a rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo;.  It was one of the favourite expressions of a former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass.  A great many other politicians of lesser stature used this cliché as a means of getting out of awkward situations when they ran out of ideas. The rising tide concept and the famous table that Deputy Lenihan refers to as a solution to the Northern conflict are mythical creations.  The cliché of the rising tide might be a useful maritime principle but it certainly does not apply to workers or indeed part-time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been said that a rising tide helps to create employment and provides for better wages and conditions.  All I have seen as a result of the rising tide is increased profits.  We can see this very clearly in Britain and Ireland in the past decade or so, where nothing has been done to bring justice, equality and fair play to the marketplace.  During the past five years politicians, industrialists and <Col N="524" /> economists in Ireland have constantly told us that the economic tide has turned and that prosperity for all is just around the corner.  It is a long time coming and it is not in sight yet.</P>
    <P>How often have we heard about the need to create the right climate for growth and economic expansion?  We have been told that this growth will come very shortly.  We are also constantly told about the need to create freedom in the marketplace to allow for the full play of market forces which is seen as a prerequisite for the creation of jobs and the improvement of wages.  This cry has been taken up by all sides in an uncritical way. The full play of market forces is a Thatcherite doctrine which prevails in Britain and anybody can see that this has been a disaster for the British economy.  It has polarised British society, with unemployment and poverty on one side. Unfortunately we have slavishly followed the British model during the past decade and we did not have the ability to think out a separate economic strategy.  Too often in the past what passed for economic policy was only a hodge podge of borrowed ideas.  We have borrowed the Thatcherite model with all its disastrous consequences.  Part-time workers have been among the most exploited of workers in both Britain and Ireland. Hotels and restaurants are classical examples of exploitation of part-time workers both young and old.</P>
    <P>I listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently and the spokesman for the Irish Hotel Industry spoke about their great difficulty in finding workers for hotels and restaurants and that they were undertaking a recruitment campaign in London to attract Irish workers living in Britain to come back to Ireland to work in the industry here.  I read also a press report on the same news item that the hotel industry were spending large amounts of money in going to London and placing advertisements in the British press to attract hotel workers to come and work in this country.  This report on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and in the newspapers was treated in a most uncritical way.  There was no explanation as to why hoteliers are <Col N="525" /> going to Britain, spending good money to recruit staff to the industry at a time when there is almost a quarter of a million people unemployed in this country and tens of thousands of our workers, young and old, are desperately seeking employment in foreign countries and working in those countries, particularly America, often illegally.  They are travelling to Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Germany and Holland to seek work at a time when this recruitment campaign is in progress.</P>
    <P>People in any other society would say this is very strange and would ask why it is happening.  What is wrong that our people are leaving the country to seek employment elsewhere?  They go through the trauma of emigration and endure great costs, dislocation and alienation, while, at the same time, hotels are crying out for staff.  No one put a finger on the central point of this question.  The reason these people are leaving is that hotel staff are badly paid in too many cases.  Part-time workers bear the brunt of this exploitation in hotels, restaurants and the catering industry generally.</P>
    <P>Cleaning firms are often equally badly treated in this respect.  How often do we see early in the morning part-time workers cleaning the most ostentatious buildings, banks, universities, factories, offices of managing directors and so on? These people, young and old, often widows, deserted wives and so on, work in palatial offices where very highly paid executives are employed while they are only paid a pittance.  There is a great contrast in the wages paid to managing directors and cleaners who clean out their offices but nobody takes much notice of that.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the qualifications and regulations of bodies such as the Employment Equality Agency, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and so on do not apply to part-time workers.  Some of these firms engage highly-paid legal advice to find loopholes in the law to ensure that they escape their obligations under these Acts, and that applies on all sides.  These people do not mind spending <Col N="526" /> money on legal advice to help them to evade their reponsibilities in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister also knows very well that part-time workers should not only be covered by the European social charter but there should be a special charter for them and that is what this Bill is about. There is need for common standards among the workforce across Europe, not only for full-time workers but also for part-time workers.  That is essential.  All of us know the truth of what I am saying because these people come to us as public representatives.  The Minister knows more about this than most of us because he works hard in his clinics in that regard. Everyday people come to him with examples of gross exploitation among part-time workers.  This must be brought to an end as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Flood speak earlier about the need for flexibility in relation to part-time workers.  The trouble is there is too much flexibility in the present legislation and this Bill aims at remedying that.  Part-time workers are often told they will be contacted when they are needed.  This is an employers' charter, with the unemployed people being exploited.  These people must take part-time work in order to survive but they have no protection whatsoever under the present legislation.  This Bill attempts to give protection to them.  It is a good and timely Bill and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember well the period when married women started to move back into the workplace.  These women were often regarded by men as women who just wanted a few extra bob for themselves &mdash; pin money is what it was called.  The male workforce, who conjured up the title pin money were often disparaging in their remarks.  They felt a little resentful and threatened by the presence of women on the shop floor. Unfortunately, for the vast majority of women the term pin money was often a convenient cover to hide behind because they were not just out for the extra few bob but were in desperate financial need. For economic reasons they were being forced out of the home to earn money to <Col N="527" /> meet even the basic household budget.  It is worth recording that many a family would have starved were it not for the valiant efforts of brave women who abandoned their expected roles as &ldquo;housewives tied to the kitchen sink&rdquo; and re-entered the workforce.</P>
      <P>How far have women progressed since the late fifties and early sixties?  There are about 100,000 regular and occasional part-time workers, both men and women.  About 72 per cent of part-time workers are women and this highlights the fact that women are much more vulnerable to exploitation by employers than are men.  The level of exploitation of the low-paid workforce is a scandal.  This Bill from The Workers' Party is an attempt to get the Government to recognise that it is morally wrong for them to do nothing but stand idly by while employers underpay their part-time workers.  The vast majority of part-time workers have no protection against unfair dismissal or redundancy; they have no entitlements to holiday or maternity leave; they have no protection under the minimum notice against dismissal and they are only insured through class J insurance.  All of these restrictions will have to be changed.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, said in his address that in line with the Government's commitment in the Programme for Government he has already begun a review of the insurability of part-time workers and that by late summer he would prepare comprehensive proposals for the social protection of part-time workers.  I would like to believe the Minister but I am sure he will do as before: nothing, unless organisations such an FLAC push him into the European Court of Justice, drag him screaming before the European Community and expose the Government for their total disregard for sections of the European Community Directive on Equal Treatment for Men and Women in Matters of Social Security &mdash; Directive 79/7/EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could have proved his intent a couple of weeks ago when he introduced the Social Welfare Bill, 1990, <Col N="528" /> but no attempt was made in this Bill to redress the position.  As a result of the case of Cotter and McDermott <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare, approximately 40,000 married women are entitled to back payments of approximately £20 million on account of the disgraceful way the previous Government botched the implementation of the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women.</P>
    <P>Despite the clear obligation to implement the directive by 23 December 1984, it was not until 1986 that the State undertook its implementation.  The delay in implementing the directive meant that between 23 December 1984 and 15 May 1986 the State continued to discriminate against married women in relation to rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, injury benefit, invalidity pension and unemployment supplement.  Furthermore, women who were unemployed between 23 December 1984 and 25 February 1986 were cut off from unemployment benefit after 12 months as against 15 months for men.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister done in relation to the Ruzius <i>v.</i> Willbrank decision of the European Court of Justice?  Why should the Minister wait years to supposedly begin a review of the insurability of part-time workers when we have the European Court of Justice decision on the question of part-time workers and their social insurance?  One of the major areas of discrimination against part-time workers is the question of their eligibility for social insurance cover.  The majority of people who work for fewer than 18 hours per week are considered to be part-time workers for social insurance purposes. Many part-time workers are not allowed to be in the full PRSI-class A, therefore, they are not entitled to employment benefit, disability and other benefits.  This discriminates against women because the large majority of part-time workers are women.</P>
    <P>In the case I referred to, the Court of Justice of the European Communities held that a rule which discriminates against part-time workers, where such a measure affects a much larger number of women than men is in breach of the EC <Col N="529" /> directive on equal treatment for men and women on social welfare unless it can be justified on grounds unrelated to sex.  The Minister is probably very familiar with the points made by my party colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, in highlighting those cases and issues.  I will not repeat what he said but I would attempt to conclude by stating that the exploitation of part-time workers, and particularly women in Ireland today, is basically the same in scale as is the exploitation of blacks by whites in South Africa.  It amounts to a conspiracy by employers and Government to keep labour costs low, without any restrictions on the ability of employers to make profits.</P>
    <P>When Government Ministers and Fianna Fáil TDs claim how successful they have been in bringing about an economic upturn let them remember on whose backs financial rectitude fell and whose sweat allows £2 billion in profits to be repatriated each year.  Let them also remember that the rising tide has not lifted all boats, that left behind, high and dry, are not only the low paid workers but the approximately 100,000 regular and part-time workers.  There is nothing so vicious as the exploitation of the vulnerable &mdash; people desperate for work in order to survive &mdash; who take low paid part-time work often under deplorable working conditions and who are then cynically exploited.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28 April 1990 which had a report which coincides with this Bill, entitled &ldquo;Salon fined £140 for underpaying woman&rdquo;, as follows:</P>
    <P>A Dublin hair salon convicted of underpaying an apprentice for two years was fined £140 under the Industrial Relations Act yesterday.</P>
    <P>Marshall Salons Ltd. of Fade Street had already paid £1,634 in outstanding wages to the apprentice following their conviction at a previous hearing at Dublin District Court.</P>
    <P>Yesterday District Justice Desmond Hogan imposed fines totalling £140 for failing to pay Ms. Rebecca Roche (22) <Col N="530" /> proper remuneration, failing to register her as an apprentice or keep proper records and failing to display employment regulations.</P>
    <P>The prosecution was taken by the Department of Labour after Inspector David Peckham discovered shortcomings in the records kept of employees at the company's premises in Dawson Street.</P>
    <P>I congratulate them in the presence of the Minister.  The frightening part of the report is that:</P>
    <P>The court heard that although Ms. Roche worked 51 hours a week she only received the 40-hour weekly rate of about £30.  This rose to £40 in the third year.</P>
    <P>She had two half hour breaks a day which were usually interrupted by calls to do salon duties and was paid the incorrect weekly wage for two brief periods.</P>
    <P>Ms. Roche of Upper Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, worked with the company from February 1987 to April last year.  She then left to attend an art course.</P>
    <P>Ms.  Sinead Gaffney, another apprentice at Marshalls, told the court that staff were too afraid of losing their jobs to complain to management.</P>
    <P>That gives us a clear picture of the exploitation that we over the last few days have been arguing exists in our city.  I will conclude on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech by the Minister for Labour at the opening of the debate on this Bill is a clear indication of the absolute necessity for this legislation. The figures quoted for those in regular part-time employment were 39,477 to 72,000 in 1988 and in addition a further 15,200 were employed on occasional part-time work in 1988.  The growth of part-time work is further illustrated by the fact that in 1977 4.4 per cent of the workforce were in regular part-time work whereas in 1988 this figure had increased to 7.8 per cent.  I would respectfully suggest that the figures could be doubled <Col N="531" /> because there are many thousands in part-time work for whom there are no records.</P>
      <P>All workers need the protection of the law.  The fact that many workers have this protection is as a result of years of campaigning by trade unions and, indeed, by enlightened persons in Parliament, even in the Dáil.  This Bill is an endeavour by The Workers' Party to extend the protection of the law to a body of works who are now without legal protection, those who work fewer than 18 hours per week, most of whom are way below the poverty line.  It is important to recognise that many people have completely ignored the problems facing part-time workers and many are of the opinion that if one does not like one's condition of employment one can simply go to another job.  Unfortunately, many part-time workers do not enjoy the protection won by their full-time colleagues.  The trade union movement has been campaigning for the past five years for the extension of similar protection to part-time workers.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an effort by The Workers' Party to have the protection of law extended to those who are without legal protection, those who work fewer than 18 hours per week, many of whom are existing on levels way below the poverty line.  There is no doubt that employing workers for fewer than 18 hours per week can be very attractive as the employer can then hire and fire with impunity.  This can create an atmosphere of fear in such workplaces with employees reluctant to seek improvements in their wages and conditions.  There is also no doubt that the absence of adequate protection for part-time workers encourages people to remain in the black economy.  There is no advantage in most cases for part-time workers to come in from the black economy. A measure such as this could have a very positive spin off by making it attractive for part-time workers to come into the white economy, therefore increasing revenue from tax and PRSI payments.</P>

    <P>I list the Redundancy Payments Act, <Col N="532" /> the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981, the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, the Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973, and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 as well enacted legislation being implemented in the interest of workers.  Unfortunately, however, a large number of part-time workers do not benefit from such legislation and unless we implement legislation of the kind we are discussing here, that number is likely to increase further.  Recently I had occasion to give advice to a person who was forced out of employment by what is known as constructive redundancy.  The State pays redundancy.  The employer told this person that he could employ two young people for what it was costing to employ him because he could pay them whatever he liked and he would not have to pay PRSI or any other contribution to the State.  It is galling to see that in the co-operative industry management who have benefited substantially from EC grant aid and otherwise and from the benefit of a good solid workforce are now saying to their workers: &ldquo;We will make you redundant and re-employ you as part-time workers&rdquo;.  We had this attitude wholesale in respect of people working in forestries and we should recall that these forestries were planted by our forefathers and are now in the hands of Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I make these points to illustrate the problem there is in this country and the need there is for legislation for the protection of part-time workers in an effort to prevent our own employers going down that road.  We have seen cases of it in all our towns and villages.  In my own town there are 25 young people in employment not one of whom is registered for PAYE or PRSI.  That is the most appalling thing that could ever happen.  One would never have envisaged it happening in this State.  It must be rectified and it can only be rectified by adopting The Workers' Party Bill.</P>

      <P>This is The Workers' Party's first time ever to get <Col N="533" /> Private Members' time, so naturally we all want to get in on the act.  We brought in this Bill because it deals with the most exploited section of the workforce.  I am somewhat disappointed that the Labour Party did not throw themselves more wholeheartedly behind the Bill because of its importance and the people it is trying to protect.</P>
      <P>Part-time workers are found in all sorts of areas, in shops, cafés, garages, farms, bars, offices etc., but they are not all in back room areas or back lane businesses. There are doctors' receptionists, dentists' receptionists, solicitors' assistants, public service workers, health workers etc., all in the same category of take-it-or-leave-it jobs, in jobs that can be exploited or, in the words of the FIE, &ldquo;that have flexibility&rdquo;.  In other words, they are without any protection; you take them on, lay them off, tell them to go here or there, to do this or that, in the most flexible manner, and they have no protection of the law and they need the protection of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister and others have pointed out, the number of part-time workers has doubled in the past decade, but currently their numbers are increasing even more rapidly.  The FIE have said clearly that they favour the flexibility of the part-time worker, therefore the vast majority of new jobs are likely to be part-time because of the flexibility they give. Furthermore, while such workers continue to be unprotected by the law, the type of protection we want to give them is entitlement to equal treatment with the full-time worker in terms of employment and working conditions and the same rights as the full-time worker in the matters of lay-offs, dismissal notices, selection for redundancy and whatever else, and that they be treated not less favourably than full-time workers.  Because they have not got those protections at the moment, increasingly employers are laying off full-time workers in order to take on part-time workers, so it is essential for the full-time worker as well as for the exploited part-time worker that part-time workers be given the full protection <Col N="534" /> of the law because their jobs are threatened also by the so-called flexibility of the part-time worker whom the FIE, the employers, are so anxious to retain.  The Minister recognises this and has said he is bringing in legislation, but last autumn it was to be early this year, now it is later this year or at the end of this year and it is moving off further and further.  The Minister states that it is important that the Unfair Dismissals Act be extended to those who work less than 18 hours a week.  That could be done very rapidly and it should be done immediately.</P>
    <P>In an interview in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 4 February this year with correspondent Martin Fitzpatrick, the Minister said his legislation would include the proposal that if a person works for one employer more than 1,000 hours he or she will be covered by the Act and will be able to go to an employment appeals tribunal with a grievance.  I say to the Minister straight away that that would mean immediately that part-time workers would all be let go after the 1,000 hours, which would be approximately 18 months, because then they would become entitled to be covered by the Act.  It is essential that they be covered by the Act from the time they go into their jobs and that they get a statement setting out their conditions of employment and full coverage.  Unless something of that nature is provided it will be the same as the 18 hours, as soon as they reach the 1,000 hours they will be subject to dismissal.</P>

      <P>Without question there is a need for legislation to be introduced to deal with the position of part-time workers.  Not in all instances but certainly in some, part-time workers have been discriminated against and are being discriminated against this very day in several areas of the employment sector and that is more marked in certain areas than in others.  To this extent I welcome greatly the debate on this issue here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exploitation of any worker, regardless of whether the worker is part-time or full-time, must be condemned by <Col N="535" /> all right-thinking people in a democratic society.  The problem of part-time workers in Ireland and the difficulties they experience have grown as the economy has expanded.  Between 1977 and 1988 the number of regular part-time workers increased by 83 per cent from 39,400 in 1977 to 72,000 in 1988.  Therefore, Members of this House, trade unionists and employers must recognise the requirement to bring in legislation to deal with the problems faced by many part-time workers.</P>
    <P>Labour law introduced in this State in the last 20 years has been quite progressive. Many of the Bills which were brought in by various Governments at different times have been a tremendous relief and the basis of justice for full-time workers.  That they have not applied to part-time workers is perhaps because we have to date failed to grasp the nettle of this problem.  There is a clear divergence of views between the FIE, on the one hand, and the unions, on the other.  We have to strike a balance here, and I agree with the Minister that it is necessary to have <i>pro rata</i> entitlements for part-time workers.  It is extremely difficult to legislate for part-time workers in the same way as one would for full-time workers if only because of the severe practical difficulties which arise in such a process. Practical difficulties such as these serve neither the part-time workers nor the employers.  It is necessary to introduce legislation to deal with this area as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important and complex question the House should address is to what extent in the market-place for jobs there are part-time jobs which could in all reality be full-time.  It would be totally wrong for an employer to employ part-time workers on a regular basis when it would be apparent that a full-time job could be made available.</P>
    <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act has worked excellently in relation to full-time workers.  I agree that that Act should be applied to part-time workers as well.  It would have the effect of discouraging employers from summarily dismissing <Col N="536" /> part-time workers, and this has been a problem.  It has been estimated from the 1988 labour force survey figures that the 18 hours threshold has the effect of excluding approximately 20,000 employees or 2 per cent of the workforce. The status of part-time workers has been identified in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as an issue to be addressed.  We all know the Minister initiated a review of this situation.  I do not think the solution lies in introducing legislation which would give part-time workers the same entitlements as those in full-time employment. That could have the effect of reducing the number of part-time jobs available.  To that extent the cure may prove to be worse than the disease and that would be the greatest pity of all.  I have no doubt that there exists an idyllic solution to most problems and, presumably, some people will say that an idyllic solution to this problem will emerge in future years.  At present there is an urgent need to bridge the gap between the divergent views.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister has plans in mind to put before the House to deal with this important issue and it is my hope that in doing so he will strike a balance which will meet the divergent views midstream. With a bit of luck part-time workers will get their rights without the number of part-time jobs being reduced. There is a need to strike a balance and it appears to me that the Minister's proposals will be designed to do that.  I have no doubt he will give a worth-while measure of statutory protection to part-time employees without impeding the growth of that sector of the employment market.  It is my wish that the position of part-time workers, and their contribution to the workforce, will be recognised on the Statute Book so that they will be protected in a fair and just way.</P>
    <P>We should address the problem of the extent to which part-time jobs in the market-place are replacing full-time jobs. When we have done so we should address the question of <i>pro rata</i> entitlements for part-time workers.  I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to the <Col N="537" /> debate if only because there is a considerable number of part-time workers in my constituency, particularly in tourism. Some employers have been found to be fair but others have been found to be unfair.  It is correct to say that to a large extent the people most exploited in relation to part-time work are women and I am confident that when he introduces his proposals the Minister will address that problem.  It is easy to put forward radical proposals to deal with any problem that arises in Irish society in the hope that those proposals will solve the problem.  However, very often radical proposals do the opposite.  They create bitterness and a divergence which not only adversely affects the problem they seek to address but affect employers and their position.  It is my hope that the legislation which the Minister will bring forward will be fair and will build a consensus which is so necessary to give a severely exploited section of the Irish workforce their just entitlements.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who participated in the debate on the Bill.  Most of the comment was reasoned and well informed.  It was generally positive and even speakers on the Fianna Fáil benches who indicated that they were opposed to the Bill recognised the need for such legislation.  I am disappointed that the Government have decided to oppose the Bill which seeks, primarily, to introduce reforms and to extend existing legislation to workers who are part-time rather than full-time. <Col N="538" /> The Government have decided to oppose the Bill despite the fact that their own backbenchers have admitted that such a Bill is badly needed.  For many years we have been hearing promises of legislative action to deal with the plight of part-time workers but successive Governments have failed to act on those promises.  In fact, it has fallen to The Workers' Party to raise this issue on the Floor of the House and use the first slot of Private Members' Business they have qualified for after nine years in the House.  I am proud we have brought the Bill forward and used our first opportunity on Private Members' Business to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the debate we have had over four nights but I should like to summarise some of the main issues that were highlighted.  The number of part-time workers is growing and all the indications are that the proportion of part-time workers in the labour force will continue to grow.  Precise figures are very hard to come by but the best estimates are that there are now close to 100,000 regular or occasional part-time workers in the Irish workforce.  The nature of the workforce is changing rapidly and there is clearly a need for legislation to protect them and to keep up with the changing trends.  Employers are looking for a flexible workforce and there is nothing wrong with that provided the workers concerned are not exploited and that all employees are given protection under the law in regard to their basic rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, those who work less than 18 hours per week have virtually no rights under the law and this makes the employment of those workers very attractive for unscrupulous employers. They can hire and fire such staff with impunity.  They do not have to give notice of dismissal or provide redundancy payments. They do not have to provide holiday pay or grant maternity leave.  That can often create an atmosphere of fear in the workplace, as was outlined by a number of speakers during the course of the debate, with employees reluctant to seek improvements in wages or conditions for fear they will lose their jobs. It creates unfair competition for those <Col N="539" /> employers who look after their employees in terms of pay and conditions and exercise a degree of social conscience in relation to how they treat those who work for them.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the absence of protective legislation for part-time workers encourages those in the latter category to remain in the black economy. In that respect the Bill, if passed, could have a positive spin-off effect by making it more attractive for part-time workers now in the black economy to regularise their position.  There is also an issue of sex equality involved in the Bill.  Many part-time workers are in the service industries in which there has traditionally been a majority of women workers.  It is estimated that about 72 per cent of part-time workers are women who work in the retail trade and the cleaning industry.  In many supermarkets the majority of those employed are women and by passing this Bill the Dáil would be taking a step which would benefit women workers.</P>
    <P>While there have been great advances in the treatment of workers over the years there is still much to be done in relation to wage levels and workers' rights.  The debate on this Bill commenced before Easter and in the period since then there has been a number of developments which emphasise just how much still has to be done.  Over the Easter period a number of trade union conferences were held and delegates heard of the appalling treatment of a number of part-time workers.  The 7-Eleven stores and their lie detector tests were dealt with; it was an issue first raised by Deputy Rabbitte in this House when he moved the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was also a statement from the Federation of Irish Employers in their April bulletin strongly opposing a statutory minimum wage on the basis that this would presumably, put some of their members out of business.  It seems extraordinary that employers can, quite blandly and without batting an eyelid, claim that they have a right to exploit people on slave wages in order to stay in business.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The Dublin District Court, as Deputy <Col N="540" /> Byrne pointed out this evening, heard a case in which an apprentice hairdresser had worked for 51 hours for as little as £27.  That is a slave wage.  A case cannot be made on behalf of the FIE that that is just.  All these events clearly show that there are employers who do not have a conscience about exploiting their workers if they believe they will get away with it. The advances in wage levels and working conditions that the workforce have won over the years have, in the main, had to be forced from reluctant employers by the power of the trade union movement. If it had not been for the trade union movement children would still be working in coalmines; indeed, in some parts of the world, they still do, obviously because the free market values, much vaunted in this House, rule unchecked.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to produce the promised legislation to extend protection to part-time workers has been directly due to the hostility of the employers.  However, the Government have a duty to ensure that employers are not allowed to exercise a veto over the improvement of the lot of part-time workers.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there have been many promises to help part-time workers but no action.  No Minister has promised more &mdash; and delivered less &mdash; than the Minister for Labour in this regard.  When we first sought leave to introduce this Bill in November 1988 it was voted down by the then Fianna Fáil Government but the Minister indicated that he was initiating a review of the situation of part-time workers and accepted the principle that legislation was needed.  Replying to a question on 14 March 1989 the Minister indicated that discussions with the ICTU and the FUE were going on.  On 2 November last the Minister informed the House that his proposals for legislative reform were now at an advanced stage and that he hoped to have the Bill ready for introduction in the new year.  We are now more than four months into the new year but there is still no sign of the Bill. More and more part-time workers are beginning to ask what the Minister is up to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> Everybody recognises that the Minister is a very capable and astute politician; he has managed to portray himself as the friend of the working class but that image is beginning to wear a bit thin.  He has acquiesced in the watering down of the European Social Charter, he introduced an Industrial Relations Bill which is clearly aimed at seriously restricting the rights of the trade union movement and he has failed to deliver on his promises to part-time workers.  The Minister's first loyalty is to Fianna Fáil and if their needs dictate that he must dance to the FIE tune &mdash; as in the case of the part-time workers &mdash; he will be the first on the floor.  It is clear that the Minister cannot serve two masters, the employers and the workers, at the same time.</P>
    <P>If the Government agree with the aims and objectives of this Bill they should not oppose the vote at the end of Second Stage.  They should allow it to proceed to Committee Stage where they could table any amendments they believe necessary. The Government would have an automatic majority on any committee so what have they to fear?  The inescapable conclusion is that the Government are opposed to the principle of the Bill, not the detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare said that the Government oppose the Bill because they want a more balanced approach.  Indeed, the Deputy who spoke just before me also mentioned the question of balance.  Where is the balance between an employer who has all the power of the law behind him and a part-time worker who has no rights whatsoever and who can be sacked on the spot?  There is no balance there.  Surely the duty of this House is to redress the imbalance between the part-time worker and the employer and not to attempt to achieve a spurious balance of interests where none exists?</P>
    <P>My final words are an appeal to the Progressive Democrats.  When we attempted to introduce this Bill in November 1988 the Progressive Democrats voted for the motion in support of the Bill but they failed to put a speaker forward during this debate.  I hope that <Col N="542" /> their much vaunted integrity and honesty will prevail and that Deputies O'Malley, Molloy, Harney, Clohessy, Quill and Wyse who voted for the Bill on the last occasion will be consistent and again vote for it tonight.</P>
    <P>I ask the permission of the House to share the time left with Deputy McCartan.</P>

      <P>Thank you for giving me this opportunity to conclude this debate on behalf of The Workers' Party. It is the first occasion we have had the use of Private Members' Time in our years in the Dáil.  It is significant that we have taken the opportunity of trying to advance the cause, as best we could with the resources available to us, of the ever growing sector of the workforce, the part-time and much exploited worker.</P>
      <P>I should like to address the overall tenor, approach and argument advanced by the Minister and those who spoke from the Government benches on the whole approach to part-time workers and their rights.  The approach is wrong because it is coming from the point of view of the so-called entrepreneur employer as opposed to the point of view of the worker.</P>
      <P>When one is dealing with fundamental rights and entitlements to protections in law which should be made available to people, the issue or concept of balance should not arise.  The right is there or it is not.  When one begins to talk about balancing the Act between the two interests, the only aspects of the equation that should be considered are those who have little or nothing to lose, namely, the part-time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy De Rossa said, there is no balance in this debate.  When the Government talk about the need for flexibility in the approach to the issue of how far rights should go, they are really talking about how far they should curtail them if rights for part-time workers are established. When they talk about flexibility in the workplace and in work practice <Col N="543" /> they really mean allowing a situation to continue where the employer has the flexible opportunity to employ or to fire, as the case may be, those workers who simply do not have the protection of the law to establish their position.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate reference was made to costs and the argument was put forward by the employers' organisation that to give rights to part-time workers would mean a loss of employment because of the increase in costs.  Considerations of that sort should not be introduced into this debate.  We must get the fundamentals right in the first instance: are people entitled to rights?  If so, we should say that and establish those rights.</P>
    <P>It has also been said that we have to have regard to the national concern, to employment figures and the balance of trade.  If we follow this approach it will <Col N="544" /> simply mean it will be a lot longer before the legislation promised by the Government will ever see the light of day in this House and a lot longer before the rights of part-time workers are established on a fair and equitable basis.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Leader of The Workers' Party in thanking all the Deputies who have contributed to the debate and, in particular, those who will support this Bill.  I want to say to those members of Fianna Fáil who have supported the principles contained in our Bill that if it is defeated it will be up to the Government to see that the long-promised Bill of the Minister is brought before this House without any further delay.</P>

In the absence of a clear definition or an undertaking by the Minister that he is prepared to introduce one on Report Stage, I must press my amendment. As I said on Second Stage, the purpose of the Bill is to close off many of the loopholes and gaps in industrial relations legislation during a period of industrial peace, away from the heat of battle.  Unfortunately too many opportunities are being lost and too many gaps <Col N="547" /> are being left in the legislation.  We cannot expect this industrial peace to last forever.  It is quite likely difficulties will arise in the future when expectations begin to rise once more and as other pressures build up.  Unless the Minister is prepared to accept some amendments, including this one, too many gaps will be left in the legislation with the result that very little of a lasting nature will have been gained during this period of industrial peace.</P>
      <P>I regret the Minister has not been more forthcoming on this amendment.  I ask him again to consider accepting this amendment, which is very clear, or at the very least, to bring in an amendment on Report Stage along these lines or at least defining more clearly the phrase &ldquo;to attend at that place&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I do not disagree with all of what Deputy Mitchell said.  However, I do not think this amendment would have the desired effect for many reasons. Given the wording it would be virtually impossible to apply the amendment to picketing arrangements.  Normally a trade union employ a picket in the most effective way within the law.  It would be impossible to word a Bill of this nature to cover every eventuality, including a picket on a shopping centre.  At the best of times it is difficult to employ a picket in an effective way at such a place for many reasons.</P>
      <P>I am very familiar with the docks situation because I am a harbour commissioner appointed by Deputy Mitchell when he was Minister &mdash; I thank him for that.  In the case of Drogheda docks, of which I know every inch, it would be virtually impossible to picket the entire area given the number of entrances and exits.  The most effective way for dockers to win a strike would be to ensure that no one loads or unloads a ship.  This normally would be the main objective. Therefore pickets in a docks area would have to be moveable.  As we can see it is simply not possible for us to stipulate that a picket be located at a certain location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the adjournment reference was <Col N="548" /> made to Dublin Airport.  I can recall many disputes in Dublin Airport and in most cases the people involved placed their pickets on the main road.  Their objective was to stop their own members reporting for work and to halt the operation in which they were involved.  That was all they could achieve.  They were not in a position to stop people in cars going to and from the airport or boarding planes operated by other airlines.  While the sentiments expressed may be all right, I do not think it is a very practical amendment and for that reason I could not support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the thrust of Deputy Mitchell's remarks is wrong in terms of regretting the Minister not availing of this opportunity to tighten up the law on picketing.  As was pointed out before the adjournment if we take all of section 11 together this constitutes a major change in the law on picketing, which has been in place since 1906 and I traced some of that history.  No doubt when we come to deal with the relevant sections we will all express a view on the wisdom of the Minister in proposing these far reaching restrictions.  I think Deputy Mitchell is wrong in regretting the Minister not availing of this opportunity to tighten up the law in this first major revamp of industrial relations law in a very long time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment is more restrictive and, as Deputy Bell said, a trade union will seek to employ a picket where it is most likely to be effective.  It is unwise to try to define, as Deputy Mitchell seeks to do, where a picket should be placed.  I do not hold the same view about amendment No. 22 in his name which I will be happy to support but in this case I ask him to have a rethink and let us proceed with the next amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised by what Deputy Bell and Deputy Rabbitte have said.  I think they misunderstand the purpose of the Bill.  They have said that the intention behind this amendment to use Deputy Rabbitte's expression, is to <Col N="549" /> tighten up the law.  I never used that expression but what I did say was that we should try to close off the gaps and loopholes.  It is my view that this Bill will not apply to unions affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but rather to unions who are not so affiliated.  This Bill will not be as effective as the internal procedures and practices of Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It will, if it remains unamended.  Amendments have been tabled which could change that.  For whom are we trying to legislate here? We are trying to legislate for the non-Congress union but we are missing the boat on each section.  In doing so there will be the possibility that a majority of unions could be stampeded by a minority of unions and a majority of workers could be stampeded by a minority of workers. I could give many classic examples of this.  At one stage we nearly lost a State company with 2,100 jobs through the actions of one non-Congress union at Dublin port.</P>
      <P>Later we will discuss amendments the purpose of which is to provide for consultation between unions where at least one union is not a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for such provision when it comes to Congress unions.  If this Bill is not enacted the situation could be worsened. Internal Congress procedures and practices which are very effective could be undermined.  These deserve to be not undermined but reinforced and that is the purpose of these amendments.  Nobody would want a situation where unions, whether they are in Congress or not, would have no choice but to picket at a place where other employers or employees would be affected maybe with the result of ruining those businesses.  That is very close to what happened when I was Minister for <Col N="550" /> Labour.  Extraordinarily, Deputy Rabbitte was the branch officer of the ITGWU as it then was dealing with the B &amp; I workers' point of view; Deputy Quinn was the Minister for Labour and I was the Minister for Transport.  I do not think Deputy Bell was around.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to leave you out of this, a Cheann Comhairle.  Both Deputies Bell and Rabbitte have an acknowledged first-hand experience and expertise in this area but I would ask them to at least reflect on the purpose and if the wording of my amendment can be improved upon I would be very willing to consider changes to it for Report Stage.  We are, however, in danger of leaving open all the loopholes we are supposed to be addressing in this Bill. We cannot force unions to be in Congress but we can arrange things in such a way as to make it highly desirable for unions to be in Congress.  Then Congress is master of its own house and the Congress procedures and rules can be recognised and not affected by law.  That is the way I would like to see it.  Under our Constitution we cannot force unions to belong to Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not want it, but so long as there are unions of a significant size about who do not want to belong to Congress and so long as there is the possibility of breakaways in the future we will have a problem with no laid down procedures and practices accepted by all unions whether they are in Congress or not.  There will always be the unions who are &ldquo;upping the ante&rdquo;, that will be more militant so as to poach members, etc. as we have had in the past. <Col N="551" /> It would be naive to think that will not recur in the future.</P>
      <P>To return to the amendment, I believe that leaving the present phrasing, &ldquo;to attend at, or where that is not practicable at the approaches to,&rdquo; in the Bill is asking for trouble.  It is far too imprecise.  What we should be trying to do is to make it more precise.  I would ask the Minister to look again at this matter for Report Stage to see if he can come up with a wording that meets my concern about this Bill.</P>

      <P>Let me give one example with which even the Ceann Comhairle will be familiar.  A shoe company in Drogheda was located in the yard of the then Irish Oil and Cake Mills and there was a common entrance to the two units. I had occasion to sanction an official dispute there as had the other union, the Irish Transport Union.  The picket was placed by the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers' Union outside the entrance but we did not expect the workers in the Irish Oil and Cake Mills to stay out of work. It would not have made any difference whether it was a Congress union or not. We would not put a picket up to stop people from going in to another company that was not involved in the dispute.  The name of the company and the name of the union were displayed on the banner.</P>

      <P>It might be said that extreme cases make bad law but in my view it is one of the loopholes we should be trying to rectify now that there is a pause in industrial strife.  We should take advantage of this because many things are now possible that would improve the whole industrial relations climate from the point of view both of workers and employers and that is not possible in the heat of the battle.  That is what we should be trying to do and that is what I would like us to do in this amendment.  I ask the Minister to consider looking at it to see if he can be more precise about the meaning of the phrases &ldquo;to attend at&rdquo; and &ldquo;at the approaches to&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I went through this in some detail before Private Members' time and I said then I understood Deputy Mitchell's concern.  The Deputy has explained in great detail about the possibility of picketing multi-employment complexes.  I share his concern but I would like again to emphasise that the wording in the Bill was devised with this type of situation in mind.  The fear that the use of the words &ldquo;at the approaches to&rdquo; will lead to picketing at the entrance and approaches to multi-employment complexes ignores the point I made.  The phrase &ldquo;to attend at&rdquo; is very definite, and where that is not practicable, it is to be somewhere else in the immediate location.  The section covers all unions whether or not they are members of the ICTU.  We are dealing with primary picketing, and everyone is subject to the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said it would be enough to leave it all to Congress rules because they would cover everything. That is just not so.  That is not the point. That is why we have had the employers' organisations demanding that we should not have secondary picketing of any type whatsoever.  They could, if they had a voice in here, quote cases where that <Col N="553" /> would make good sense.  I did not go down that road of just banning secondary picketing forthwith.  Some Members of the House received submissions from them in that regard but that is not the way I sought to go.</P>
    <P>There are only two unions effectively outside Congress.  In their own way they are well organised.  Other well organised unions who had been outside Congress are now within Congress.  I do not want to dwell on the distinction between Congress and non-Congress unions because by and large the procedures of all the unions are responsible.  It is not up to me to be critical of them in any way.  The law covers all unions once they have a negotiating licence.  I do not want in any way to be frivolous with Deputy Mitchell but if I was trying to cover the ports I might have to be specific and say, at the particular crossroads of Mayor Street and New Wapping Street, to avoid the B &amp; I port, and if I was referring to the airport I would have to say, at the junction to Collinstown Cross, you cannot do that in legislation.  It would be quite clear to someone reading the legislation that the words &ldquo;at the approaches to&rdquo; did not <Col N="554" /> mean some place that was not in the district and it is clear that it means somewhere in the immediate vicinity.  I understand that Deputy Mitchell spoke on this on Second Stage.  I know that he speaks from experience and I understand he had to deal with the hot potatoes of the day in the port.  The advice from the trade unions and employers and the practitioners on both sides is that while this may not cover every single definition, which is impossible to do, it is comprehensive enough to cover the position.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Mitchell to accept this point.  I cannot in any way stop him from bringing forward an amendment and if he thinks there is a tighter amendment, that is his prerogative.  We honestly do not believe there is and we think we have covered the matter as best we can.  We have had a long debate on it today and I think we have covered the position.</P>

      <P>The substance of these amendments is one of the issues which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions raised with me.  I have obtained legal advice to the effect that it is not necessary to refer specifically to the past tense.  The situation the Deputies are referring to is already covered by the wording used, which is in the present tense.  It is a matter of looking at a case objectively and asking whether it is reasonable to regard a particular location as a place of business of the employer involved in the dispute.  I do not think it is necessary to have an amendment along the lines proposed as <Col N="557" /> it would convey the impression that it was quite legitimate to picket a location where an employer had carried on business in the past.  In the event, the wording as it stands is adequate and the amendments are not necessary for the reasons I have stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking amendments Nos. 22 and 23 together.  As the Minister is probably aware the ICTU have had some reservations about the wording of this section.  It was felt that by including the words as contained in both Deputy Mitchell's amendment and that of Deputies O'Sullivan and Rabbitte, this would effectively make that situation more secure.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at it to see if it is possible to tighten up on that on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister elaborate on what he said earlier?  What about the employer who moves business and seeks to dispose of the property, where the new owners then seek to injunct a picket at that employment?  Is this issue provided for in the section?  It is not clear to me that it is provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In a change of ownership the picket placed on the premises of a new employer, even under the present situation, would most likely be injuncted on the basis that it was not in furtherance of a trade dispute because the new employer would not be in a position to influence the outcome of the dispute with the previous owner.  This is what happened in the Bayzana case. Even if the amendment was made it would not cater for the situation for which the Deputy is trying to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that correct?  A firm could close down in one place, move elsewhere, sell that property and leave the picketers high and dry.  That is precisely the situation I envisage arising and it is one which I think would be grossly unfair to a workforce.  The reason I included <Col N="558" /> specifically the words &ldquo;at the commencement of the dispute&rdquo; in my amendment was to prevent a situation arising whereby an employer ups and goes and sells the property and where someone else tries to seek an injunction because he is not the employer and is not in dispute with those workers.  To my astonishment the Minister confirms that that is the situation and that that can happen. Surely my amendment would prevent that happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very reasonable amendments.  The amendment in the names of Deputy O'Sullivan and myself is somewhat neater than that of Deputy Mitchell.  I agree with the thrust of what Deputy Mitchell is seeking to do.  I wonder if the phrase &ldquo;after the commencement of the dispute&rdquo; is more limiting than the phrase &ldquo;or normally worked or carried on business&rdquo;.  It is absolutely essential that it is not only lawful to conduct peaceful picketing where the employer works or carries on business but if, for whatever reason, he has left&mdash; there may be reasons other than liquidation or going out of business &mdash; he may transfer his business to a different location and somebody may acquire this business in a transfer of undertaking.  We had that discussion at the early stage in terms of definitions when we talked about &ldquo;or who acquires an undertaking for which one or more workers work or have worked&rdquo;.  I do not want to make a meal out of this.  We all understand what is at issue.  I cannot see how one could reasonably restrict people to the present tense, to people who work in a business that is operating at present.  A liquidation or a similar situation must be provided for.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;it is reasonable for those who are so attending to believe&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;those so attending believe&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point is the difference between the subjective test and the objective test. The Minister's wording is more onerous <Col N="560" /> in so far as it requires the people so picketing to have a reasonable belief that the second employer is assisting the undermining of the dispute.  It ought to be sufficient for the picketers concerned to be able to rely on an argument that those so attending have an honest belief that that is the case.  It is a less onerous proof than is required in the objective test.</P>
    <P>One cannot deal with amendments Nos. 26 and 27 without referring to what many people would say is the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the Bill.  There has been considerable discussion on section 9 (2), section 11 (2) and about industrial action, which are the three most important elements of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which I had hoped we would get to earlier, is central to the entire purpose of the Bill and amounts to a very serious restriction on trade union rights and changes entirely the balance that has obtained in this country up to now.  I voiced the opinion, with all due respect, to people outside this House who one might have expected to be more vocal on this, that they did not readily understand at the time, they were so pleased that we did not seem to be going down the Thatcher-Tebbit road that they were more moderate in their response. When you study this you find it is very restrictive indeed.  It is a lawyer's paradise inasmuch it invites court action.  The phrasing adopted by the Minister that pickets may attend at the place of employment of the secondary employer only if they believe he is acting &ldquo;in a way calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their employer who is a party to the trade dispute,&rdquo; is seriously regressive from the point of view of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I instanced a number of cases on Second Stage which would be put outside the provisions of this section.  For example, in the case of a post office dispute, if a company of private couriers are brought in you could not say they are <Col N="561" /> directly assisting An Post but they are certainly undermining the strike and their action is calculated to frustrate the strike. They are interested only in getting a share of the action, they are not interested in helping An Post.  There is any number of examples one can postulate where some other employer comes in, not for the purpose of assisting the first employer, but for the purpose merely of getting a share of the action, and the net effect of it is to undermine the dispute.</P>
    <P>I submitted amendment No. 27 and will withdraw it in favour of the latest wording which, I suggest modestly, is very good.  It is that where the workers attending, and so on, believe the employer is acting &ldquo;in such manner as to have the effect of frustrating the strike by either directly or indirectly assisting&rdquo;. It is not merely &ldquo;directly assisting&rdquo;, but what I omitted to deal with on Second Stage because I did not see the point at the time was this word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo;.  Who is supposed to be able to say the second employer calculated to frustrate the strike?  The employer might well have been saying he was getting on with his own business.  He might have the effect of undermining and frustrating the strike but he did not set out to do so.  It was not calculated to do so.  Therefore, that again invites litigation.  Much more important, it will rule out the protection of the legislation in many situations that will arise. It does not share the harsh class language of the Tebbit era but in a far more subtle way it imposes similar restrictions on the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>In summary, on amendments Nos. 26 and 27 I am saying that where section 11 (2) provides that these pickets may attend &ldquo;if, but only if, it is reasonable for those who are so attending to believe at the commencement of their attendance and throughout&rdquo; that the employer has acted in a way calculated to frustrate the strike, I would prefer to see the less onerous term in law which is that they hold an honest belief.  How are the average pickets to determine that it is a reasonable <Col N="562" /> belief in the sense that they will act on their instinct?  It is very often difficult to prove that another employer is undermining the dispute.  There are many examples of that which we can go into if there is a wish to do so.  In the case now being advanced by the Labour Party in Britain their spokesman Tony Blair has come up with the phrase &ldquo;where there is an honest belief.&rdquo;  That makes it better.</P>
    <P>The most important single amendment to this Bill is that this calculated attempt by the employer to undermine the strike etc.  should be changed to provide that the secondary employer is acting in such manner as to have the effect of frustrating the strike by either directly or indirectly assisting the first employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must agree with my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, on this.  This is one of the most fundamental and important sections of the whole Bill; it is the meat of the Bill.  I have grave reservations about the wording of this section.  I came in here eight years ago after nearly 30 years in business when the situation in industry and services was different.  It has changed rapidly especially in the last ten years.  Companies used to employ transport and maintenance people of their own.  Now hackers are transporting goods.  Work is subcontracted out to engineering companies which was normally done by fitters and electricians. Services that were formerly provided by the companies themselves in the industries are being subcontracted out, particularly in the last couple of years. Companies no longer employ their own security men.  A typical example was here in the Dáil when a dispute took place in relation to our own security staff here. If another security company had been brought in here to carry out the security duties there would be no sense in talking about calculation.  It would be a clear attempt to break the strike.  The trend in the section suggests an attempt &mdash; I am not saying deliberately &mdash; to safeguard <Col N="563" /> the interests of the employer rather than those of the workers in the strike.</P>
      <P>I am very worried about the wording, and I appeal to the Minister in the strongest way possible to accept at least the spirit of the amendment set down to this section.  Substantial subcontracting is developing now within industry and the people concerned would have to try to safeguard their own interests because they would not be directly involved within the company in dispute with the men.  The unions have difficulty enough at the moment coping with that from an industrial relations point of view. If we use the words in the section we will be adding further confusion and will only succeed in having an enormous number of strikes finishing up in our courts.  As a trade union official the one thing I dreaded was getting legal people involved in disputes.  In such cases the only winners were the legal people.  Certainly, those on strike did not win.  In fact, even employers did not win.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the Minister should have a serious look at this.  If he does not change the provision the Bill will not be worth the paper it is written on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy stated, this is an important section.  I should like to put the background to it and my views on the section on the record.  Subsection (2) deals with secondary picketing and has three main aims: to clarify the existing legal position so that the law is once again a guide for conduct, to regulate secondary picketing more closely and to define secondary picketing in clearly understood industrial relations terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precise legal position in regard to secondary picketing is unclear but is generally thought to be as set out in the case of Ellis <i>v</i>.  Wright (1978) where it was held that for a picket to be lawful there must be a &ldquo;clearly discernible connection between the premises picketed and the dispute in the sense that the employer or workman affected by the <Col N="564" /> picket is directly connected with the dispute&rdquo;. This interpretation limits the extent of the protection given to picketing in section 2 (1) of the Act of 1906, but is still vague enough to allow for considerable confusion as to what constitutes legal secondary picketing in particular cases.  This is especially so in proceedings for interim and interlocutory injunctions.  The danger with this lack of clarity is that the law will fall into disrepute and no longer act as a guide to conduct.  Therefore, the clarification provided by this subsection is extremely important for industrial relations practice.</P>
    <P>Another aim of the subsection is to regulate secondary picketing more closely and not to extend it.  The broad &ldquo;clearly discernible connection&rdquo; test of case law will be replaced by a more precise statutory statement on lawful secondary picketing.  The subsection provides that secondary picketing will be lawful if, but only if, it is reasonable for the picketers to believe that the second employer has acted in a way calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their employer who is a party to the trade dispute. Merely filling a gap in the market left by a strike-bound employer will not give rise to lawful secondary picketing.  The second employer must actively seek to frustrate the strike by direct assistance to the employer in dispute; for example, by filling orders on behalf of the first employer or by providing services to the first employer's customers on behalf of the first employer.</P>
    <P>The subsection also changes the basis on which the connection between the first employer and the second employer is judged in secondary picketing, from a mixed company law/industrial relations basis to a straight industrial relations basis.  The present test can give rise to complicated questions of company structure such as who controls the company and whether one company is legally related to another in such a way as to be <Col N="565" /> able to bring pressure to bear on the first company to resolve the dispute.  The legal relationship between companies, especially in large groups of companies, will not be obvious to picketers or strike organisers.  However, under this subsection the picketers will have a simpler question to answer, more directly related to their industrial relations experience, &ldquo;Is it reasonable to believe that the second employer is acting to frustrate the strike?&rdquo;  The law will thus become a better guide to conduct with workers having a clearer idea of what is and is not lawful in a particular dispute.</P>
    <P>In a court hearing an objective test would apply to the reasonableness of the picketers' belief that the second employer had directly acted to frustrate the strike or industrial action.  It would not be sufficient for the picketers to rely on a sincerely held personal belief that the employer was acting thus; they would have to show good cause for that belief.</P>
    <P>The subsection provides additional safeguards in that picketing must be in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute and must be peaceful.  Intimidation, breach of the peace, obstruction, trespass, riot and so on would continue to be illegal in the case of secondary picketing as in all picketing.  In addition, sections 14 to 19 will apply to secondary picketing so that a dispute undertaken without a ballot and a majority in favour will not give rise to lawful secondary picketing. Also, the second employer will be entitled to a week's notice of the picketing.  If this is not forthcoming the second employer will be entitled to seek an injunction against the secondary picketers.</P>
    <P>If secondary picketing was outlawed completely employers would have wide scope to circumvent the effects of legitimate industrial action.  While employers have a right to make every effort to circumvent the effects of a strike directed against them in a democratic society this cannot be an absolute right and must be balanced by the right of workers to bring <Col N="566" /> economic pressure to bear to further their legitimate claims.  Under the subsection only employers who directly involve themselves in the dispute by acting to frustrate the strike will be subject to secondary picketing.  In addition, if secondary picketing was outlawed there would be a problem of enforcement with the possibility of creating martyrs.  I do not seek to get involved in that.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have stated, picketing is a controversial and emotive issue.  We spent a great deal of time discussing this issue when preparing the Bill.  There has been much pressure on me from the employer side quoting reasonable arguments, from their point of view, to outlaw such picketing completely but, as I have indicated on many occasions, that would be going too far.  In fact, that was the main source of employers' lobby and pressure in regard to the Bill and before proposals were circulated to outlaw secondary picketing.  Members, particularly those who have experience of these issues, are aware of the depth of feeling there is among employers about this.  I have taken the middle ground and set down what I believe to be a fair approach to secondary picketing and that is that it should be permissible where it is reasonable for those workers picketing to believe that the second employer was acting in a way calculated to frustrate the strike by assisting their employer directly.</P>
    <P>Were I to accept the amendments proposed I would be loosening up this and moving away from the objective test of having a reasonable belief and a concept of direct assistance which are central to the proposal to regulate secondary picketing in a balanced way.  I apologise for taking so much time on this issue but I was anxious to deal with the section which is central to the Bill.  We have spent a considerable amount of time seeking a balance in the section.  In my view we have found the correct balance, one which, perhaps, neither side will love but <Col N="567" /> it can function and undertake the task I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, almost 12 hours after we started the debate on the Bill, that there is any point in spoiling the ship for a hap'orth of tar.  As the Minister has admitted, this section is the nub of the Bill.  Certainly, it is the centre-piece of the employers' lobby and it deserves to be teased out.  The employers' lobby on this, I am saying quite calmly, has largely succeeded.  The Congress of Trade Unions are aware of that and the trade union movement generally will become more aware of it if it is enacted in its present form.  The employers' lobby have effectively got what they wanted because it does not take any great ingenuity to circumvent a dispute if the section is enshrined in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to talk about this all night and, important and all as I think enshrining the subjective, as distinct from the objective, text of what may be in the minds of the people attending at the place of the second employment in the Bill is, I am prepared to trade that with the Minister in return for him accepting amendment No. 27.  In my view that is the most important amendment that could be advanced.  I should like to explain to my colleagues in Opposition why I say that. We are talking about a section which will make it lawful for a person or persons to picket the place of an employer other than the employer with whom they are in dispute because they have a reasonable belief that he is acting in a manner to undermine the effectiveness of their strike.  It will be a lawyers' paradise if it remains as it is at present.  Whatever is in the minds of the people who came to picket, to be able to prove in certain cases that the employer took this action in a calculated way will be virtually impossible. Most importantly, it does not cover a whole range of situations.  There is a requirement that he must be seen to be directly assisting the other employer, he <Col N="568" /> may be doing no such thing but it could still have the effect of undermining the dispute.  I cannot claim the credit for the drafting but it is expertly done and it purports to replace that phrase by the following one: &ldquo;that the employer ... in such manner as to have the effect of frustrating the strike by either directly or indirectly ...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What possible objections has the Minister to that wording?  He said on the one hand he has refused to abolish secondary picketing in this country as has effectively happened in Britain but, on the other hand, he will not accept an amendment which says that secondary picketing may continue but in very restricted terms.  My amendment is very restrictive; you would have to be able to prove that the secondary employer had the effect of undermining the strike and directly or indirectly assisting the first employer. They are very onerous criteria to meet. It is far more restrictive than the present situation.  If this section was enacted with my amendment it would be far more restrictive than anything on the Statute Book at present.  It would provide for secondary picketing but in a very controlled and restricted way.  Any persons leaving the picket line of the first employer would have to be satisfied that the secondary employer had the effect of damaging their strike and that he was doing so and assisting the first employer. That is very restrictive and I plead with the Minister to take its sense on board because, otherwise, this will be an employer's Bill.  Will the Minister at least acknowledge that it is lacking in balance? I know he spent the past two days in Killarney and I know what that can do to the most resolute person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Rabbitte in appealing to the Minister to take a very serious look at this.  The section was drafted to protect employers' interests and there is no doubt that the Bill will not work if that is not altered.  A company could be manufacturing the same product in two different locations in a town or city and if there is a picket on one factory management could switch production to the other company leaving the workers to picket an empty building.  As things stand they could not place a picket on the other company although they could be manufacturing exactly the same product. The strike would be killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that people from a separate company could legally and properly go into a factory which was being picketed to collect machinery and so on and if the company was picketed the picketers would be in breach of the law although the other company would be breaking the strike.  It is a long time since 1906 but if the Bill is enacted in its present form the situation will be even worse than it was under the old Act.  I am sure Congress made a substantial submission to the Minister in regard to this Bill and that they conveyed their worries about <Col N="570" /> this section.  I am sure the Minister's colleague sitting behind him who has handled industrial relations in UCD agrees with Deputy Rabbitte and me that if the wording is not altered it will be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to amendment No. 27 because it is very close in many respects to amendment No. 28.  They would both be effective.  I could spend the next hour outlining circumstances in which this will not work and it will mean that every employer and trade union will spend half their time in the court.  If the Minister does not alter it there will be unofficial disputes and the substantial reduction in the number of strikes will not be maintained.  Trade unions and employees in a trade dispute will be frustrated, there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be a real and concrete test of the circumstances in which secondary picketing can be allowed and we have outlined those circumstances. Deputy Rabbitte said his amendment is well drafted, I am not arguing about that and I accept he is not claiming credit for it.  However, it does not achieve the balance required in this matter.  I do not want to repeat all the arguments but that is our view.  The tightening of case law was leading us down that road before we drafted the amendment and the employers are not happy because not banning secondary picketing is disastrous from their point of view.  I am clear that to do that would tilt the balance one way and to change the section might tilt it the other way.  We are trying to find an area in the middle and, following much discussion, this is what we have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am obliged to listen to the points made by the Deputies.  I have listened to the arguments put forward by them and by the legal side on this issue.  I have legal submissions on this aspect which go both ways and refer to all the difficulties which can arise.  The parliamentary draftsman put a lot of time into this section and <Col N="571" /> understood what I was trying to do.  I do not propose to be either the parliamentary draftsman or a legal expert but having listened to the arguments put forward on both sides I believe, and I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will agree with me, that this is the best balance possible.  I think Deputy Rabbitte will accept that the people who drafted this amendment were not working from a middle of the road position.  I am not being critical of them in any way.</P>

I will be reflecting on the points made by the Deputies but this is a fundamental and important section and to tilt the balance either way could give rise to all kinds of difficulties at all levels. I have to be honest and straight about this issue rather than taking up other stances and putting forward different arguments.  I am convinced that this is a middle of the road solution.  If we were dealing with a different kind of Bill perhaps I would do other things.</P>

      <P>The Minister was right to resist the somewhat hysterical demands of some employers for an all out ban on picketing.  He was also right to resist the amendments proposed by Deputy Bell and Deputy Rabbitte.  I have considered this matter very carefully and I believe the Minister has got the right balance in this section.  I wish I was as happy about other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bell's concerns have been exaggerated.  I have the greatest respect for Deputy Bell, who is a man of considerable judgment, but I have to disagree with him on this occasion.  I intend to support the Minister.  I do not follow the amendment in Deputy O'Sullivan's name &mdash; it is getting late and perhaps <Col N="572" /> I am tired &mdash; whereas the intention of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is clear. This is a matter of judgment and balance, and I agree with the Minister on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, to coin a phrase, one could say that Deputy Bell and myself are representing the SIPTU tendency here but I do not think this would make our arguments any less valid. I cannot understand how the Minister and Deputy Mitchell think the balance is just right.  After all, we all recognise that this provision is far more restrictive than the one which obtains at present.  If my amendment is accepted, secondary picketing would be acceptable but greatly constrained and limited by the condition which is the essence of my amendment. I cannot follow how it would tilt the balance because the criteria set down in my amendment are very onerous.</P>
      <P>This is the reason &mdash; Deputy Bell reminded me of this when he was referring to the later amendment in Deputy O'Sullivan's name &mdash; I toyed with the idea of just proposing the deletion of the phrase concerned.  I also toyed with the phrase &ldquo;directly or indirectly assisting their employer, etc.&rdquo;.  However, I felt that if I was to have a realistic chance in this House of convincing the Minister to take this point on board, it would be better not to propose the deletion of certain words but to propose an amendment which would impose serious restrictions on where and how secondary picketing might take place.  I appreciate that it is very late but, as Deputy Bell has said, this section goes to the very heart of what we are talking about.  I agree with him that it will be employer's legislation if it goes through, and I do not believe this is the intention of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is completely unreasonable, in a world of multinational companies and multicompanies within a particular holding group, to say that workers may picket at the primary site or location &mdash; we had all the discussions about where exactly <Col N="573" /> they should picket at the place of employment, etc. &mdash; and restrict them, as is intended.  If, as Deputy Bell said, an associate company within a group, takes over the production of some other aspect, especially in an era of electronic media, telecommunications, and so on, they will have absolutely no difficulty in contriving to undermine a strike and will be able to carry out the work with minimal damage. Incidentally, this is the point I was making in regard to Deputy Mitchell's amendment this morning when he spoke about having to show that substantial damage or industrial disruption would be caused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little disruption may be caused because a group of companies could so order their affairs that the strikers would be entirely impotent and could not so picket.  This would happen without referring at all to the situation I used as shorthand for a whole lot of disputes of this kind, for example the UCD cleaning dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the UCD cleaning dispute a contractor took over the contract and the cleaning women prosecuted a trade dispute against the new employer for employment.  I do not understand how they could do that in the circumstances envisaged here?  As I have said, the Minister should give us an undertaking in this regard.  Amendment No. 26 is important but in the interests of saving time I will be happy to withdraw it.  However, I am anxious that the Minister will take the essence of amendment No. 27 on board. If he can come up with an amendment which is better drafted than amendment No. 27, which I doubt, then I ask him to do so.  Otherwise, there will be serious disenchantment in the trade union movement about this section.  As Deputy Bell has said, the important point at the end of the day is that it will be inoperable because of the restrictions envisaged here.  This section takes no account of the <Col N="574" /> structures of industry today, no account of the phenomenon about which Deputy Bell spoke, of a company, for example, Burlington Industries, that had at least four major plants in this country at one stage.  Therefore, if there was a strike in the Kerry plant of Burlington Industries one could conceive of circumstances in which production would be moved or divided between the remaining three plants and the lads in Kerry would be left picketing until kingdom come &mdash; if the House will forgive the pun &mdash; and could do nothing about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I might reiterate for the benefit of the Minister the serious worries we have about this.  An employer's representative here might contend that the Bill, if amended, would appear to be a trade union Bill.  There is not a lot wrong with the position as it stands but this will render it a hell of a lot worse.  All it will do is create problems for the Department of Labour who will be very busy if this section, as drafted, is passed. Whatever the wording that must be found I appeal earnestly to the Minister to seriously re-examine this and to have further serious consultations before this Bill is passed.  I predict that if it is passed as drafted, employer organisations, employers in general, companies &mdash; particularly those with the largest manpower, expertise, legal back-up and so on &mdash; will draw horses and carts through it, and that section in particular.  That section constitutes the meat of this Bill; that section is what this Bill is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the building industry there is the widespread practice of employers who do not pay the rate laid down by the joint labour committee or under the registered agreement for the industry.  Unions are obliged to take on cowboy employers in an endeavour to force them to pay the correct rates.  In fact, they are obliged to undertake the work which should be undertaken by the Department in following up employers, forcing these cowboys to pay the correct rates and apply <Col N="575" /> the correct conditions of employment. That is the position.  How does one deal with it?  In many cases the Department cannot deal with it.  As my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte will well know, sometimes it takes two years to have a case considered by a joint labour committee, or to reach a registered agreement for the industry.  By that time the relevant employer may be closing one site, opening another, or moving from one subcontracting site or location to another. The only way trade unions can follow that up to ensure that such people apply correct rates of pay is through the traditional trade union means.  On the basis of what is contained in that section, such action would be rendered illegal.  It would not be possible for a trade union to operate effectively, say, within the building industry, for a start, because they would be totally immobilised.</P>
    <P>As I have said at the outset, because of the overall change in subcontracting arrangements in the building and transport industries every manufacturing company now will have hived off its transport and services people and they no longer employ electricians, or provide all sorts of services formerly provided within the industry.  There has been this astronomical development of subcontracting work within industry and the services. Unless the trade unions are allowed to operate in circumstances in which they can take the necessary industrial action against an employer who &mdash; whether he be a subcontractor or any other type of employer &mdash; actually frustrates and defeats a dispute, by providing the requisite service, transport or whatever the position will not be redressed.  On the basis of the provisions of this section all of that activity would be deemed to be illegal.  The only people who will gain anything from it will be the legal profession. As I have already said, the one profession we do not want to bring into industry and strikes is the legal profession <Col N="576" /> because they will be the only people who will win.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Bell about this flight out of business into subcontracting and so on &mdash; something we discussed and tried to provide for earlier in the day &mdash; is something about which all sides of the House should be concerned.  It was partly addressed, in a related way, by The Workers' Party Private Members' Bill on part-time work &mdash; the resorting to ruses to avoid the obligations of social legislation whether that be social insurance, income tax, conditions in terms of employment, unfair dismissals or whatever.  We must ask ourselves why industry is doing that.</P>
      <P>Employment generally and the effect of the aggregation of legislation on employment have not received sufficient mention.  Sometimes it is my opinion that the trade union point of view is shortsighted; at times, to some extent, it takes a tribal attitude to what sounds right in its cause but which in fact can be very damaging to its cause.  If we could put the clock back, say, ten or 15 years then, from a trade union point of view, we might well think differently.  I say that as somebody who is very committed to the rights and strength of trade unions.  The greatest undermining of their strength is unemployment.  Yet it can be contended that the unintended effect of much of what we have passed here in recent years has caused unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time that has been facilitated by the fact that one can employ people for fewer than 18 hours and get away without honouring certain social commitments.  One can opt for the ruse of employing people under contract for the very same work in which they were engaged as employees.  But now one is not responsible for their taxes, social insurance and so on, when the employee does not have rights under the Unfair Dismissals Act and so on.  It is a point that has not received sufficient consideration as yet within the trade union <Col N="577" /> movement although I must say that the development of thinking within that movement and the general concern for the national interest have been more evident there than on the part of any other major industry in this country for a long time.  That deserves to be said.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Mitchell believes&mdash;and I accept that he does, and thank him for his support on our Private Members' Bill to which he referred &mdash; that this subcontracting phenomenon is something about which we all ought to be worried and address, then I suggest that he look again at the amendments I am advancing here.  How can one possibly provide for circumstances in which, for example, a different contract catering company comes into this House, makes a better tender, under-cuts J. D. Carroll, who is here already, and takes over the catering service in this House?  If that company decide not to employ any of the workers who have been doing the job for many years, there is no conceivable way such employees could prosecute a trade dispute under the provisions of this section. One could not prove that they are directly assisting the first employer because they are manifestly not directly assisting the first employer.  The only reason the new catering company came in here was to get the business for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy, I had an earlier amendment which said: &ldquo;or who had been the employer at the commencement&rdquo;. Therefore, if there was a change or takeover I specifically raised that point as a means of dealing with that contingency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not permit one prosecuting a dispute against, say, Campbells Catering, the new company, because then the only people who may picket here are those who have a reasonable belief that the new employer, Campbells Catering, acted in a manner <Col N="578" /> calculated to undermine their strike by directly assisting the primary employer. They are not there to directly assist the primary employer, quite the opposite; they are there to take away his business. Therefore, the contract workers who lost their jobs may not picket.</P>
      <P>The entire phenomenon Deputy Mitchell has identified is not provided for in section 11 (2).  It is one pressing, additional reason the Minister should indicate that he will take on board, if not the actual amendment, then its essence.  I might emphasise &mdash; as has Deputy Bell &mdash; that this is really what this Bill is all about.</P>
      <P>This was the third attempt, and not mine, at drafting an amendment.  It is a very carefully drafted amendment and if Deputy Mitchell examines it carefully he will note it is quite restrictive.  The Minister has available to him advisers as expert as my own, including Deputy Hillery on the Government backbenches, who I am sure would be prepared in private to offer him a view that the argument being made, especially by Deputy Bell and I, is well founded and that the trade union movement will, as I said earlier, rue the day they did not press the Minister more aggressively, although I am well aware they have made submissions and met with him when they begged him to change this.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the very strong feeling on this matter.  As this issue is so important and goes to the very heart of what we are talking about, it is important that he gives us an undertaking to take it on board.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Inner City Crime.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I have asked permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment is that I wish to outline to <Col N="579" /> the Minister the frightful situation prevailing on the streets of Dublin today.  As a public representative in a constituency covering a large portion of inner city Dublin I am well placed and qualified to bring to the notice of the Minister the concerns of my constituents, my own views on what is happening, why it is happening and what steps need to be taken to rectify the matter.</P>
      <P>First, just as the reasons people get involved in crime and vandalism are complex so also are the steps required to remedy this problem.  I am not a politician who demands instant change or solutions, rather am I asking the Minister to direct the Garda Síochána along a certain policing path radically different from the policing policies of today.  Two small reports, given a column inch of space, appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> today and it is important that we take note of them. The first states that two people were injured in incidents in Dublin's inner city last night and that a garda was brought to hospital with a head wound when 40 youths stoned and destroyed a Garda car after a youth was arrested on a street I will not name.  It went on to state that the gardaí escaped from the riot with their prisoner.  It further stated that on another street a youth was stabbed but not seriously hurt after two young men had attempted to rob him.</P>
      <P>The second report, under the heading &ldquo;Youth detained&rdquo;, stated that a 14-year old Dublin boy was given three years detention in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court yesterday for what Mr. Justice Roe called &ldquo;a dreadful and unbelievable&rdquo; attack on an elderly woman who was stabbed several times in the face after she remonstrated with a gang breaking into a parked car in another street in the north inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a coincidence that these reports appeared on the day I have been given an opportunity to speak about crime and vandalism and policing methods in Dublin inner city but as a representative <Col N="580" /> of the south inner city I do not ever want to have to come to the House to ask the Minister for Justice why things have been allowed to get so out of hand that there are newspaper reports of events, similar to those occurring in the north inner city, on the south side.  There is no doubt what took place in the north inner city last night was bad.  I hope we will learn of the reasons why such events occurred in the north inner city so that we can prevent such events occurring on a regular basis in the south inner city.</P>
    <P>Inner cities have been written about all over the world.  The population of the inner city of Dublin is rapidly declining with people being rehoused in the outer suburbs in both public and private housing, the reason being very little private housing is being constructed in the inner city.  We have also witnessed a massive decline in traditional industries within the inner city and the demise of Dublin Port resulting in large numbers of people becoming unemployed.</P>
    <P>The social fabric of the south inner city is mainly comprised of two working class communities.  The first of these live mainly in huge impersonal inner city flat complexes, built in the thirties and forties. The others live in private housing estates consisting of small two or three bedroomed houses built in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  The crime being perpetrated is of a &ldquo;petty&rdquo; nature, such as house break-ins, handbag snatches, the stealing and subsequent burning of stolen cars and the sale of drugs.  Unfortunately, there is severe vandalism of the private housing stock which is one of the issues I would like to highlight tonight.  It is important to point out people do abandon their homes in an effort to escape an unfriendly environment and it is time someone recognised this fact and did something about it.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to visit the following areas to see what I am talking about for himself, where almost every second house is for sale but for which there is no buyer, while the remainder <Col N="581" /> are either boarded up or abandoned with steel bars on all the windows.  I am sure the Minister would be moved to do something. For example, the Minister might visit Ruben Street, Haroldville Avenue in Rialto, Eugene Street or Fingal Street, off Donore Avenue.  He might witness the wrecked artisan dwellings of Rialto Street.  That is just to give a flavour of some of the streets of traditional working class cottages and private homes in my constituency which are under tremendous pressure.  Not only are there the visual signs of the houses that have been wrecked and vandalised and the living reality of the type of environment that exists down there, there are the residents who have to stay put, unable to sell their houses because they are in &ldquo;low demand&rdquo; areas who feel threatened and abandoned. Can the Minister imagine the frustration, anger and fear of a resident in Maryland, a former local authority housing scheme which is now virtually privatised, who has had her home broken into, the windows broken and metal bars and catapults used to cause extensive damage to her roof?  This woman is facing the real prospect of having to give up work altogether because of her fear that the house will be totally wrecked.  It is an end of terrace house which tends to be most vulnerable.  She cannot get a buyer for the house because the area is known for its vandalism.</P>
    <P>Drugs are being sold openly at a road reservation at Weaver Street in the Coombe despite the fact that it is regularly reported to the Garda.  My constituents can see the drug dealing that is going on, and so can I if I have the time to go up on a Friday between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  Nothing changes for these residents who are looking at this, and they are getting very frustrated.  Many people report crime to the Garda and more and more of them are becoming frustrated with the apparent lack of response.  Visitors, staff and patients &mdash; pregnant women &mdash; are regularly mugged or have their handbags snatched at the <Col N="582" /> Coombe Hospital in Cork Street.  The residents see the unfortunate victims and wonder where are the Garda.  Statistics will show that every Thursday and Friday night handbag snatches occur along the River Liffey at Usher's Quay.  The victims are usually rural civil servants heading for the railway station and home and the young handbag snatchers escape through the flat complexes and streets in the area.</P>

Is there a policy of abandonment of parts of Dublin south inner city?  I ask, while there remains goodwill on the part of many residents towards the Garda, that that goodwill be tapped.  Neighbourhood watch is a non-starter in the flat complexes.  I am demanding a properly trained and staffed community police force who would be on permanent duty in both public and private housing schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would let me have one more minute to make my final point.  High speed, high tech policing is not the answer.  Gardaí with proper training and social skills capable of providing socially disadvantaged communities with a sense of security are needed.  In passing let me say that it is nearly impossible for a tenant of a local authority house or flat to get home or contents insurance so every loss they have from break-ins is a total loss.  I am asking the Minister to concede that a special policing policy must be developed for inner city areas, that there must be more gardaí to respond to the emergency calls and general calls for information and <Col N="583" /> assistance, that community policing, although costly, must be allowed to develop, along the lines suggested by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and outlined by inspector Nally, and that there should be more visual presence of foot patrols.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Government colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, regrets very much that he cannot be here personally to respond to this and the next debate, both relevant to his Department.  The House is probably aware that the Minister is attending the Garda and Prison Officers Conferences this week.  It is an indication of both his and the Government's respect and appreciation of the services constantly rendered both by the Garda and the prison officers that the Minister has given this week to these very important conferences. I need hardly say that one of the highest priorities of the Minister for Justice, is to ensure that the people of this country should be allowed to live their lives and go about their everyday business in peace and security.  There is no doubt that the early part of this decade saw that peace and security seriously threatened by an upsurge in crime.  Successive Ministers for Justice and successive Garda Commissioners, have striven to have that trend reversed.  The policies pursued and the measures taken in the fight against crime have proved successful, in that the provisional figures for 1989 indicate that the level of recorded indictable crime has decreased in the Dublin Metropolitan Area by approximately 16 per cent in the period since 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister on taking office was very conscious that the fight to curb crime was a major priority.  In conjunction with the Garda Commissioner, he identified the practical steps needed to increase visible Garda presence on the streets of our towns and cities and thereby reduce the <Col N="584" /> fear of crime.  These steps were incorporated into the crime-fighting package, which was announced by the Minister, in November 1988.  The package was based on a simple, but effective concept, i.e. that the way to keep the criminals off the streets, is to put more gardaí onto them. The following measures are being taken: two hundred and fifty civilian clerical staff will be appointed to release gardaí from office work so that they can perform outdoor crime prevention and detection duties.  A number of these clerical staff have already been recruited.  It has been agreed that there will be 200 additional promotions in the Garda Síochána to posts at sergeant, inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent level. An estimated 250 gardaí across the ranks of garda, sergeant and inspector, who would be due to retire on reaching 57 years of age before the end of 1991 are being enabled to serve until they reach 60 years of age.  The pace of recruitment of 1,000 trainee gardaí is being accelerated; 348 trainees will be taken on during 1990, which is 50 more than originally planned and 260 young men and women will become fully attested members of the Force this year, commencing with the first group of about 86 next month.  Most of these 86 young people will be allocated to the city centre areas.  There will be more money in 1990 for Garda overtime, vehicles, technical police equipment, uniforms, radio communications and computers.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, the policy of bringing the Garda Síochána and the community into closer, more effective and mutually beneficial contact, continues.  In the Dublin area there has been a major expansion of the community policing scheme.  This approach to policing is regarded as very effective by the public who can see the Garda on the beat and get to know them personally and, most importantly, can rest easy knowing there is somebody there to call on, if assistance is required.  The scheme not only acts as a valuable link between <Col N="585" /> the Garda and the community, but also serves to allay the fears of the more vulnerable members of society.  Earlier this year this scheme was extended to the north and south city centre areas.  It is hoped that it will prove as successful there as it has proved in all other areas where it is in operation.</P>
    <P>Another important development in making the Garda Síochána more accessible to the community was the recent opening of the new Garda office in O'Connell Street, Dublin.  This office gives the Garda a high profile in the main street of our capital city and does, I think, in many ways symbolise the Garda attention which is now being focused on the inner city areas.  The Minister is satisfied that the way forward in dealing with the inner city crime and indeed all crime, is through a combination of extra Garda activity and community involvement. The Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner propose to continue to tackle the problem in this way.  Indeed, the most recent statistics indicate that there was a substantial reduction in crime in 1989 in the Garda divisions of Dublin north central and Dublin south central, by comparison with 1988.  The provisional figures for 1989 indicate a decrease of over 24 per cent in the north central area and a decrease of over 7 per cent in the south central area.  The preliminary indications for 1990 are that this reduction in the level of crime is being maintained.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Justice is heartened by this development.  However, he cannot be completely satisfied as long as any level of serious crime remains and as long as any member of our community is forced to endure either the fear or the reality of crime.  The Minister is in constant contact with the Garda authorities in the matter, who are, of course, keeping the position under active review.</P>
    <P>The approach I have outlined is only one aspect of the overall war that is being waged against the criminal, and many of the other measures taken against the <Col N="586" /> criminal will have a beneficial, if indirect effect, on inner city crime.  I am referring to the increase in prison accommodation which is also provided for in the crime fighting package and is designed to ensure that those convicted of serious offences serve the full sentence imposed on them by the courts.  I am also referring to a number of Bills, which are currently before the Oireachtas and which will help greatly in the fight against crime.  These include the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989, which prepares the way for the introduction of the new technique of genetic fingerprinting; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, 1989, which will curb the availability of offensive weapons; and the Larceny Bill, which will help to tackle the problem of receiving stolen property.</P>
    <P>In addition the Minister will continue to see to it that the Garda authorities have at their disposal, all the resources they require, including adequate finance for overtime and the most modern and comprehensive equipment to enable them to engage fully in the battle against the criminal.  New strategies to deal with crime will be evolved as circumstances change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has given very stark details of crime in this area.  I appreciate this very much and I am confident that this information will be of assistance to the Garda Síochána in their constant efforts to combat crime and drug abuse. If Deputy Byrne or indeed anybody else in his area has firm information, on crime, they should, of course, bring it to the attention of the Garda, either to the local gardaí or gardaí in the city.  For my part, I will bring the Deputy's points to the immediate attention of the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is satisfied that everything practicable is being done to deal with crime.  Our citizens can be sure of this and they can also be assured that the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner will continue to give the problem the required level of attention <Col N="587" /> and will not lose sight of the real concerns and fears of our citizens.  I am confident that, with community co-operation and support for the Garda, together we will succeed.</P>

      <P>The position is that staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>The staffing of Our Lady of Loreto girls national school, Tallaght, for the current school year, 1989-90, was determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September 1988.  The enrolment of 246 pupils on that date warranted a staff of principal plus six assistants for the 1989-90 school year.  The school also has the services of a remedial teacher and a special class assistant.  The posts of seventh and eighth assistant in the school were discontinued week ending from 31 August 1989, due to falling enrolments. The two teachers concerned were placed on the Dublin diocesan panel for redeployment from 1 September 1989.</P>
      <P>The eighth assistant was redeployed to another national school from that date while the seventh assistant claimed an exemption from the panel rule on the grounds of maternity.  The exemption applies for a period of six months before and nine months after the birth of her child which in that teacher's case expired on 15 February 1990.  The teacher was, therefore, obliged to accept the first offer of employment received after that date.  She was offered a post in a national school in Drimnagh and took up duty there after the Easter vacation.</P>
      <P>The retention of the teacher in Loreto girls national school, Tallaght, after the expiration of her maternity exemption was not warranted by the enrolment in the school.</P>

      <P>For a candidate to be eligible for the award of a higher education grant the reckonable income of the candidate and of the candidate's parents or guardians must be within the income limits set out in the relevant scheme.  For the purpose of the scheme reckonable income means gross income from all sources, less any sum paid by way of contribution to a superannuation fund, and excluding also children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts, holiday earnings of the candidate and payments <Col N="431" /> under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
      <P>For self-employed persons the income to be reckoned includes the profits from business/farming activities, including lettings of land, equipment etc., after deducting expenses incurred in earning these profits, such as rent, rates, wages paid out, repairs to machinery and equipment, purchase of seeds, fertilisers, business interest and stock relief.  When reckoning expenses which may be taken into account as expenses incurred in earning profits no amount shall be included in respect of depreciation, including capital allowances such as on plant or equipment, expenditure on the construction of fences, roadways, holding yards, drains or land reclamation, expenditure on construction of farmhouses or farm buildings, expenditure on the construction of business premises or expenditure relating to personal use, e.g. the elements of expenditure relating to personal use contained in such items as light, power, fuel, telephone, insurance, motor expenses and bank interest and charges.</P>
      <P>The basis for assessment of reckonable income of self-employed persons, under the higher education grants scheme for the 1989-90 academic year is in keeping with the arrangements I have outlined above.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that neighbourhood watch schemes are reviewed from time to time by those involved in individual schemes.  The clear indications are that the schemes are effective and worthy of continued community support.  In fact, the support for the schemes is evidenced by the growth of neighbourhood watch in this country &mdash; there are now 909 schemes involving some 180,000 households throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It is not of course possible to attribute, with certainty, a change in the level of criminal activity to any particular measure such as neighbourhood watch. However, the Garda authorities consider that neighbourhood watch is playing a significant role in tackling crime, particularly residential burglaries which provisional figures for 1989 indicate have dropped by over 17 per cent since 1984.</P>
      <P>However, it is important to make the point that the benefits of neighbourhood watch cannot be judged by statistics alone.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that neighbourhood watch has been particularly successful in involving the community in crime prevention, in enhancing relations between the Garda and the community they serve and in promoting a greater sense of security especially among the more vulnerable members of our society.</P>
