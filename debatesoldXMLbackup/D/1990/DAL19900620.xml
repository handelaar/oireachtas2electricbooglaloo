      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 7, 15, 16, 17 and 4.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Business shall be interrupted at 12.00 midnight.</P>
      <P>(2)  The sitting shall be suspended today from 6.30 p.m. to 7.00 p.m.</P>

      <P>(4)  The Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 17 shall be taken at 10.00 p.m. and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.00 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>(5)  No. 4 shall be taken at the conclusion of No. 17.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the interruption of business at 12.00 midnight on the basis that the Government should reorder today and Second Stage of the Broadcasting Bill so that Bill, now utterly changed from the one which was originally brought into this House, can be properly and democratically debated before we go on to Committee Stage. I oppose, therefore, the interruption of business at 12.00 o'clock tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday you will recall that I brought to your attention my concern about the manner in which business was ordered.  This morning I want to bring it to your attention that I am not particularly pleased about what has happened today.  At 10.15 a.m. an Order of Business was delivered to our Whip's office and when we came into the House a second Order of Business was delivered, changed from the first.  Can the Taoiseach try to ensure that the Order of Business as delivered in the first instance is the Order of Business for the day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the arrangements for the taking of today's business, specifically the arrangement relating to No. 16, the Broadcasting Bill. The Bill which is being brought forward today for Committee Stage debate has no relationship to the Bill we debated on Second Stage.  The Bill should be withdrawn and the new Bill which the Minister seeks to introduce should be reordered for Second Stage.  It is ridiculous that we are being treated in this way by the Minister and the Government.</P>

I know that there are ways that the Chair has for dealing with Deputies and Ministers who mislead the House but I should like to know if there are any ways the House can have for dealing with Ministers who mislead the public as, for example, in the case of the Government Whip this morning who told the most outrageous untruths on an RTE programme to the extent that he totally distorted the situation.  For the record it should be known that the Government looked for 13 pairs last Friday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P>In page 11, subsection (1), lines 18 to 20, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  to draw up and issue codes of practice in relation to which the following shall apply&mdash;</P>

    <P>(iv) the Board shall, before seeking the consent of the Minister for the issue or approval of a code of practice, consult any Minister of the Government or other person or body that appears to the board to be appropriate or where the Minister so directs,</P>
    <P>(v)  where the Board issues or approves of a code of practice it shall publish a statement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of its issue or approval of that code, identifying the code in question, specifying for which provisions of the relevant statutory provisions the code is issued or approved and the date from which the said code shall have effect,</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We were talking yesterday about codes of practice.  While we welcome the functions of the board as proposed in this section, I would not be surprised if the Minister did not agree to our <Col N="330" /> amendments which seek to delete the reference to codes of practice in section 10 (1) (c) and replace it with a new section and my fear in this regard is shared by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In other legislation, there is a statutory basis for codes of practices and minimum standards are set down.  Section 10 (1) (c), as worded is inadequate.  It is desirable that there is a consistent legal basis under legislation for codes of practice.  For example, the most recent legislation dealing with codes of practice is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. The two sections in that Act which deal with this issue are sections 30 and 31, which contain detailed provisions on codes of practice.  It is essential that we amend this section.  Otherwise the codes of practice issued by the new board could have little or no impact on the unsatisfactory position that exists under the Trustee Acts of 1888, 1893 and 1958.  The Minister admitted in his introduction to the Bill that these Acts were not passed with pension schemes in mind.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is passed as it is worded at present, there could be disturbing cases such as that of the H. Williams workers who had to use costly and lengthy court procedures to remove trustees.  The situation which prevailed in that case should never recur in the future.  A number of workers there had to go to incredible lengths, bringing the case to the High Court where a formula was arrived at to replace trustees of the pension fund.  It is interesting that some of the so-called trustees did not seem to know they were trustees of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be sufficient to say that the board would set down the guidelines for the codes of practice.  They should be built into the legislation, which would bring the procedure into line with other codes of practice legislation such as the example I gave heretofore.  I ask the Minister to take on board amendments Nos. 12, 14 and 15.  I wish to emphasise the importance of laying down a statutory basis for codes of practice which will be drawn up by the new board, to ensure that they have a real impact.  Otherwise, pension fund members would be no <Col N="331" /> better off after the Bill is enacted than they have been heretofore.  Our amendment states that failure to observe the provisions of a code of practice issued by the board or compliance with such a code will be admissible in evidence.  I take the same view as Congress in that this matter is important and hence I would ask for the support of amendments Nos. 12, 14 and 15 in my name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we are all aiming at the same objective.  It was the Congress submission in particular that drew our attention to the problems regarding codes of practice in the past. There have been problems down the line with the legal status of codes of practice and that matter should be more clearly specified in the legislation.  We in Fine Gael have adopted a different approach. The functions of the board and their capacity to operate effectively will be one of the central elements in the Bill and the success of the Bill will depend on it.  Of that list of functions, none is more central than the rules and guidelines the board will issue to trustees.  The legal cases and the problems that have arisen in the past have been due to a total lack of clarity in that regard.  This Bill supersedes the trustee legislation and will govern pensions from now on.  It would be unsatisfactory to leave the issuing of guidelines and codes of practice entirely to the board.  They should be laid down specifically in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have sympathy with certain parts of the amendments proposed by my two colleagues in the Opposition parties, I suggest that some of their proposals are unduly cumbersome and would involve great delays in processing codes of practice. We have established a board and we should rely on them to make certain decisions but it is important to specify, in <Col N="332" /> the terms laid down in my amendment, the broad areas they would cover.</P>
    <P>I referred yesterday to the case of a person who is a member trustee.  While this Bill, certainly in later sections, specifies particular duties for trustees, it does not say that in order to carry out those duties a person must be appointed in a certain way.  The whole area of appointment, apart from the later references to member trustees, is completely vague and will be left entirely to the board when setting down their codes of practice.  The trustees are essential to the success of the Bill.  A person reading this Bill would have no clear idea of the Dáil's thinking in relation to the way in which trustees should be appointed and should carry out their functions, other than the broad duties referred to in later sections.  This is inadequate unless it is specified that codes of practice lay down minimum standards regarding the appointment and election of trustees.  Under the existing law there are many good schemes and many have very detailed deeds and rules.</P>
    <P>I have a British one here &mdash; The Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund &mdash; that affects people in Ireland.  It was sent to me by somebody who had read the Bill and who was concerned that there was nothing in it about the appointment of trustees and management committees. The current practice in many cases is that there is a management committee representing workers and employers who decide on the method and number of trustees and who go about appointing them.  An arrangement is made for regular committee meetings and everybody knows what is going on.  I imagine the board will do this but it would be desirable &mdash; to use a phrase that is used in other lobbying on this Bill &mdash; to have it fairly transparent because it is a central element of the Bill.  The minimum we should require of the board in the appointment and election of trustees is that any member of any scheme should know they have a right to that kind of information; its availability is something that is required by law of anybody involved in a pension scheme.  In amendment No. 13 in my name &ldquo;committees, <Col N="333" /> management&rdquo; should read &ldquo;committees of management&rdquo; but it amounts to the same thing and perhaps the Minister would accept that correction.  The frequency of meetings is a major issue.  Standards can be set but it is possible to have only an annual meeting which would be totally unsatisfactory in relation to ensuring that anybody who was a trustee was in a position to perform their functions because it would require waiting until the year was ended.  If there is not a statutory requirement to meet more regularly, would it be valid, for instance, to complain to the board that the scheme was not being managed properly by reason of there not being more regular meetings? It is important that that issue and the nature and content of information be clarified.</P>
    <P>Trustees must be given the tools by which they can perform their function adequately.  The Bill would be more effective if this amendment were adopted.  I would be very interested in hearing what the Minister has to say.  He must have received substantial representations in relation to this section.  He must be aware of the problems that have arisen in other legislation.  He has not submitted any amendment in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We should clarify what exactly we are trying to achieve in these amendments and what I have been trying to achieve on behalf of the Labour Party by means of amendment No. 11.  Section 10 (1) (c) as presented proposes a requirement on the board to issue guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of trustees of schemes and codes of practice on specific aspects of their responsibility. That is a welcome provision but we are setting up a board which we hope will be autonomous to a large extent.  However, we do not want them to be so autonomous that, unless we put in a strengthening provision, such as I have suggested in amendment No. 11, the Minister will not be answerable to the House in respect of any code of practice that may be laid down by the board.  That does not mean I do not have faith in the board but I want the Oireachtas to have access to <Col N="334" /> consultation.  To clarify the requirement in relation to the Oireachtas I am suggesting that the Minister should be responsible.  In my amendment I have specifically said that if the board want to do anything they will do it in accordance with the Minister's approval, in consultation with him and with his consent, which is not bureaucratic but it would be normal procedure that a statutory board, if they are laying down codes of practice, would at least have regard to what Government consider is the appropriate code of practice.  I am also suggesting a procedure to be followed in the event of their wishing to change a code of practice where they would be obliged to publish their proposal in official documentation which would also be available to the Oireachtas.  We would then have an opportunity of putting down a question, if necessary, to a Minister to ascertain if he was satisfied with a particular aspect of the code of practice.  If we do not have that requirement it means that apart from requiring the board to set up a code of practice, the code of practice would not have statutory foundation and this would make the legislation deficient.  That is the reason congress had suggested using a system of advice in relation to a code of practice in law in the previous legislation which was enacted in 1989.</P>
      <P>If the Minister examines each of the subsections I have suggested in my amendment, he will see that they are exact replicas of the previous legislation on the welfare and safety at work legislation where the Minister put in a requirement regarding the code of practice. There is nothing bureaucratic about this requirement, there is nothing obstructionist about it, but it allows the Oireachtas to have access to any changes that the pensions board may lay down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final requirement of my amendment is also vital in that non-compliance with this requirement would be admissible in evidence.  If there was to be a case we have already agreed that failure to comply with the law is a serious offence, and yesterday evening we increased the penalties.  The final subsection of my amendment seeks to ensure that failure <Col N="335" /> to comply with the regulations shall be admissible in evidence.  This should at all times be in the jurisdiction of the Minister and by extension of that democracy is accessible to us in the Oireachtas by way of parliamentary question or otherwise or, indeed, by direct representations because the Minister will have a statutory obligation in this respect to the House. Whereas if we allow the codes of practice to remain within the jurisdiction of the pensions board it will be outside the Minister's competence to be answerable to this House in regard to them.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this board are not yet sure what their proper and full role will be.  Perhaps they would not want to be restricted too much as regards the codes of practice they may lay down.  The least they should have is the advice of the House and suggestions from this side of the House.  They should have the courtesy and the obligation to consult with the Minister if they want to introduce codes of practice of which we are unaware.  I am anxious that the provisions in this Bill will protect the rights of people who are beneficiaries under pension benefits. That is my only concern.  For that reason I submitted amendment No. 11 in that format on the basis that the same Government, but a different Minister, have accepted this code of practice.  After the discussions I had with congress, they agreed that this is the appropriate way to deal with the matter.  If the legal binding being sought is not given, congress is of the opinion that any other code of practice that would be issued by the board would have little or no impact on current practice.  They are suggesting it should be dealt with in this way.  The other two Deputies have approached the same problem in a slightly different way but the end result would be the same.  My amendment is the first one and I am putting it on the basis that it is the correct one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main difference between this legislation and the other legislation referred to by the Deputies is that under this Bill the Minister will have <Col N="336" /> very extensive powers, particularly by way of regulation.  If we are not happy with the position the Minister may make regulations.  One of the functions of the board, as laid down in section 10 (1) (c), is to provide clear guidance to trustees in the exercise of their duties and responsibilities where and as necessary.  The board have said that there is a need for this flexibility.</P>
      <P>Deputies fear a situation which may arise but I do not believe it will.  It has not arisen to date.  Great progress has been made and I am quite certain that the incoming board will make further progress which would be to everybody's satisfaction.  Nonetheless, if we are not happy about the position, the Minister may be challenged in the House and regulations introduced, but we do not want to go about the matter that way.  The way we want to go about it is for the board to issue guidelines to the trustees on the way schemes should be run.  There are a great variety of schemes and I am quite certain that the one cited by Deputy Flaherty would not be suitable in many other cases.  There are 25,000 voluntary schemes upon which agreement has been reached between the members, the trustees and those supplying the scheme. We do not want to tie them down too much.</P>
      <P>The Bill which runs to 56 pages, contains 79 sections and three Schedules, provides for a comprehensive regulation of occupational pension schemes.  Provision is also made for the introduction of detailed regulations which will prescribe how effect is to be given to the main provisions of the Bill.  The board is then charged, in accordance with section 10 (1) (c), with giving guidance to trustees as to how they should discharge their duties and responsibilities in the light of these detailed legal requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I envisage the board, in consultation with all the various interests involved with occupational pension schemes, will draw up guidelines and codes of practice which will clearly lay down what best practice should be in relation to the various areas to which these guidelines and codes of practice refer.  These however <Col N="337" /> can only serve as a guide covering the majority of cases to which they apply. Exceptional cases will arise constantly for which the general guidance provided would not be appropriate and which may not even have been envisaged by the board when the guidelines or codes were being drawn up.  The advice I have received from organisations representing those who administer pension schemes is that it would not be possible for the board to draw up guidelines and codes of practice that would cover every possible case, especially in the initial stages before experience is gained in implementing the legislation.  To attempt to do so would result in the guidelines and codes of practice becoming exceptionally long and complicated and in need of almost constant revision.</P>
    <P>If the type of statutory provisions proposed in the amendments in relation to codes of practice were made the whole purpose and nature of the board's function in this area would be changed.  The codes of practice instead of being drawn up as guidelines in clear, easy to understand language and designed to cover normal cases in the areas to which they apply would have to be drawn up instead as quasi-legal instruments.  They would not then simply be offering guidance but laying down rules which trustees might consider they had to comply with irrespective of the appropriateness of such rules in relation to cases which would be of an exceptional nature.  Given that there are 25,000 occupational pension schemes there will be many such exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>I have stated from the outset that I want to avoid over-regulation that could jeopardise the future development of occupational pension schemes.  The amendments proposed in relation to the issuing of codes of practice would lead to such over-regulation as the board could in effect end up having to lay down quasi-legal rules designed to cover every eventuality in the areas to which the codes of practice would apply.  In this context Deputy Ferris referred to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.  Codes of practice which have a statutory basis are necessary for <Col N="338" /> the type of situations covered by that Act as, unlike the case of pensions, there are no detailed legislative requirements in this area.  Accordingly, codes of practice have to be relied on to flesh out the basic rules laid down in the Act.  That brings me back to the initial point I made that extensive powers and controls are being provided under the Bill which may be implemented when necessary.</P>
    <P>A more relevant situation is that governed by the Insurance Act, 1989.  Sections 56 and 61 of that Act provide that the Minister may by order prescribe codes of conduct.  I understand, however, that it has been decided to opt for voluntary codes in this regard because of the difficulties which would arise if such a code was given a statutory basis.  I am satisfied that the provisions of this Bill and the detailed regulations to be made thereunder will provide adequate legal safeguards for the pension rights of members of occupational pension schemes.  Section 58 of the Bill sets down clearly what the duties and responsibilities of trustees are in relation to the administration of pension schemes.  There is also a considerable case law in relation to the application of the Trustee Acts.  What is required in addition is guidance from the board as to how trustees can best exercise their duties and responsibilities in the light of these comprehensive and detailed legal requirements.  I am satisfied that section 10 (1) (c) provides an adequate basis for such guidance to be given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty has proposed an amendment which would involve the addition of two subsections to section 10. I do not consider the proposed subsection (3) is necessary.  Amendment No. 56 which I am proposing and which we have already discussed provides for the selection by members of funded schemes of persons for appointment as trustees.  I am satisfied that it would provide an adequate statutory basis for member participation in the election of trustees which is the main concern in this regard.  I have already explained the reasons in some detail.</P>
    <P>Codes of practice in relation to the <Col N="339" /> other matters referred to in the proposed subsection (3) can be issued by the board in accordance with section 10 (1) (c), if considered appropriate.  The extent to which codes of practice should be laid down in relation to these matters and the form they should take are best left to the new board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty has also proposed a new subsection (4) which provides that codes of practice be admissible as evidence. It will be possible for reference to be made to codes of practice issued by the board, where relevant, in cases before the court where the exercise by trustees of their duties and responsibilities is at issue.  I was also concerned about this aspect of the matter and was thinking of introducing an amendment but I have been assured that this is unnecessary.  To specifically provide for this in the Bill, as proposed by the Deputy, would confer a status on such codes which would result in their being treated as quasi-legal instruments.  I have already spelled out the reasons why I consider that this would be undesirable and I am opposed to the amendment proposed by Deputy Flaherty for the same reasons.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns of the Deputies in raising these points but I would like to assure them that adequate provision is made under the Bill for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in this regard.  Essentially, what I want to do is to provide the board with the power to proceed to issue guidelines and codes of practice.  I will ask the board to bear the views of the Deputies on this matter in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on this matter too long as it is clear that each of us is deciding on what we are ultimately going to do.  I would like to address some of the questions raised by the Minister. He has asked us to give the board a chance and let them recommend codes of practice for trustees and indicate what their responsibilities should be.  He also argued that given the fact that there are 25,000 voluntary schemes in operation <Col N="340" /> we should not be too hard on them and should not be too concerned about putting the matter on a proper legislative footing.  I would disagree fundamentally with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying there is more than an adequate legislative footing. There are far more powers in this than in any of the Health Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister claims he can amend by regulation.  Many regulations will have to be made as a result of the complex nature of this Bill.  The Minister claims he can police matters by regulation but that is not satisfactory.  We must give the codes of practice a firm statutory basis.  If something serious goes wrong it will be too late for the Minister to discover that he will have to issue a regulation to go over ground lost.</P>
      <P>The key elements of the Bill are the functions of the board and the functions and role of the trustees.  We are looking for a relatively minor alteration to section 10 because of our collective fears that regulations in themselves will not be sufficient and that codes of practice established by the board will not have a sufficient legal basis.  The Minister seems to suggest that our recommendation would lead to the over-regulating of the system by providing rules rather than guidelines.  I reject the argument that we are asking for over-regulation but because of the nature of the 25,000 schemes we need good law underpinning the codes of practice to be established by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is interesting but I still have many reservations.He indicates that he has made a decision in principle to leave these guidelines loose and does not feel it necessary for them to have a legal standing.  The view on this side of the House is that they should have a legal standing.  The Minister argues that powers eleswhere in the Bill sufficiently protect members and that it is not necessary to tie up the guidelines in this way. <Col N="341" /> This indicates the need for one of the other amendments I have proposed regarding the need to have a member of the legal profession on the board.  Much of the board's activity will be legal or quasi-legal and the board will benefit from legal expertise.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to sufficient protection elsewhere in the Bill in section 58.  He also refers to the power to have member trustees, suggesting that this would be a protection.  However, the provision for member trustees is open-ended, with no clear date of implementation.The Minister is simply taking power under the Bill, with the hope that it will happen.  My amendment on this matter was ruled out of order last night because we had already begun debate on that area.  My concerns were justified but we can come to it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to the experience of a pension fund where there was a member trustee appointed by the members who had been given absolutely no information about the scheme. The group of trustees had never met since its appointment.  There was reference to the H. Williams case where they did not even know they were trustees.  Giving responsibilities to trustees tightens up matters because they have to perform certain functions.  They must ensure that contributions are received and properly invested and that arrangements for payments are properly made.  They must also ensure that proper membership and financial records are kept.  There are other duties regarding registering and disclosure of information.  I suppose it would be extremely hard to fulfil these functions without meeting regularly.  If the administration of these functions is handed over to an insurance fund there is no clear indication of what would happen with the trustees.  Who could argue in a court case if the trustees meet once a year or once every three years that they are adequately monitoring a scheme?  We should have codes of practice which would require at a minimum quarterly meetings of trustees.  What standards will the board have if their guidelines and codes of practice in relation to the way <Col N="342" /> trustees perform their functions are not legal documents?  We would have to see how courts would react.</P>
    <P>The argument that other sections of the Bill give adequate protection is doubtful. The position of trustees will be unclear since the guidelines will not be legal guidelines.  What trustees are asked to do to indicate that they are performing their function is still unclear.  There could be member trustees and a reasonably operated scheme but without the level of communication we would hope for.  Perhaps the Minister would say why he feels the Insurance Acts are a more appropriate model.  The ICTU made a strong case that codes of practice are becoming a feature of much legislation and that consistency is desirable.  I have pointed out some problems that could arise if these matters are not more clearly specified. Congress has said it is essential that there should be clarification, otherwise the board's codes of practice will have little or no impact on current practice.  Congress feel that the second part of the amendment regarding the failure to observe the provisions of the code of practice is necessary, to be consistent with other legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not reassured us that his approach is the proper one and that the approaches we are suggesting would not be more effective, while not being too limiting or demanding on the board. In issuing codes of practice it would be desirable to expect that they would be implemented.  The board members will have a very deep level of expertise in relation to the management of schemes, with the association of the representatives of the pension funds and of the industry.  It should be within their remit to set minimum standards and say whether there will be quarterly meetings of trustees; and they should be able to make arrangements regarding a general meeting of workers and management to discuss the issue.  Some of these very basic matters would not be unduly expensive, cumbersome or demanding on any scheme, apart from circulating a letter to members making a commitment to set <Col N="343" /> aside a board meeting and maybe providing a meal for the trustees.  The Minister has not convinced me that his approach is better than that suggested from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear about the difference between the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and this Bill.  We are providing all the powers here. In Part V, sections 53 and 54, we are spelling out in law duties and responsibilities.They are all in the Bill with full legislative power.  In the same way the trustees and their duties are spelled out clearly in sections 58, 59 and 60.  We are providing much more comprehensive legislative grounding for what is being done.  Deputies are trying to get me to go further and to put all these operational matters into very tight, legalistic provisions.A board will have to work these out in the first instance and see what guidelines are necessary or desirable.  If we do not accept that, then let us say so and we will vote on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne keeps saying he does not like the idea of doing so many things by regulations.  That is fundamental to the Bill and every technical specialist who knows anything about the matter says this is the best way to handle this.  If Deputies do not agree, let us have it out, disagree, and say we will vote on it, and let them vote against it.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an enormous piece of legislation with vast new provisions in law for a voluntary sector.  Some of our EC partners will not do this and we are trying to convince them that it should be done. I know the best way to go about it is to provide the basic legislation and then provide the regulations which will have the flexibility to implement it.  If Deputies do not agree that that is the best way to go about it, then we will have a difference of opinion and that will be the end of it. There is no point going on and on about this regulation.  That is fundamental to the Bill and we are approaching it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne says the scheme could collapse.  That cannot happen.  That is <Col N="344" /> covered in the legislation.  We are talking about codes of practice which are very generalised but are within this legislation. Do not broaden it into something it is not.  All the powers and the safeguards are provided here and spelled out very clearly.  Throughout the whole country they are recognised as excellent.  It is a huge step forward and we need not worry about all this detail.  Can we not trust a board?  Normally I am told that I should give the board powers and not have the Minister taking all the power.  I am giving the board powers and saying they have the freedom and legislative base to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>I understood Deputy Ferris' concern and note that these were the kinds of things he wanted the board to bear in mind.  I have said I will convey his views to the board, although I know the board will look at the debates in the House and consider them.  We can go on discussing this forever.  This morning we wasted an hour going around in circles.  The sooner we get this legislation into practice the better.  It is excellent legislation, very broadly based with enormous new powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that possibly the way forward is to call a vote.  Probably I will because maybe that is the appropriate thing to do.  There is little difference between what the Minister is saying and what we are saying. Section 10 (1) (c) provides that the board shall issue guidelines on duties.  I have suggested nothing different in my amendment.My amendment provides that they &ldquo;draw up and issue codes of practice in relation to which the following shall apply&rdquo;.  I do not say what is to be in the <Col N="345" /> codes of practice.  The board may, as they think fit, approve of any code of practice or part of a code of practice drawn up by another body.  I am not tying up the board unduly.  I am saying any code of practice they issue under that section shall provide practical guidance with respect to the requirements or prohibitions of any of the relevant statutory provisions. There is nothing wrong with that.  It is already in law anyway.</P>
      <P>My amendment provides that &ldquo;the board shall obtain the consent of the Minister before issuing or approving a code of practice,&rdquo;.  If any Minister tells me the Bill is strong enough to ensure the implementation of the codes of practice, the Department and the Minister will have to patrol the legislation and the codes of practice to make sure they are in accordance with what he wants.  My suggestion would oblige the board at least to consult and to get the Minister's approval, and when they get it, if they want to change those codes of practice because in practice, they may be found impracticable, then they would need only the consent of the Minister.  I see nothing wrong with legislating in that way.</P>
      <P>I have not suggested what they should put into the codes of practice, I am suggesting that, when they come up with a scheme on the codes of practice, they will seek the approval of the Minister.  That is the end of the story.  If I or my colleagues discover that, even if the Minister approves of codes of practice, they are not in keeping with what we feel they should be, then we can bring the Minister back here by a parliamentary question or otherwise.  It is a very simple procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment may sound cumbersome because it is a repetition of a section from another Bill, but at least the board will have to consult and get the Minister's approval.  Any Minister should need that power, and we want him to have it because once he has it, we will have access to it.  If he has to bring in other regulations to change a code of practice, then we are getting nowhere.  If we do not strengthen section 10 (1) (c) the codes of practice will have no statutory basis, no basis in law, and nobody will be <Col N="346" /> able to do anything about a group of trustees or a board if their regulations or sets of guidelines are not in accordance with what is laid down here.  In other words, I am seeking the approval of the Minister to any code of practice set down by the board for their trustees.  I thought we could reach agreement on this amendment but as we have not I will have to press it to a vote.  I hope that regardless of the outcome of the vote the incoming new board will know the views of this House on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he could make regulations but I do not think there is any provision for the making of regulations under section 10. As I read it, we will have to depend on the board to set down guidelines on the duties and codes of practice for the trustees.  The Minister said he believes that under other sections sufficient demands will be made on trustees in meeting the provisions of preservation, disclosure, etc., and ensuring that people are adequately protected.  I made a very specific point about where this will not be the case.  In any debate on this issue all that will matter is whether there is a problem with any member and because there will be no standards in relation to how often they should meet and the kind of information they are given it will not be possible to prove that they are not carrying out their functions properly.  As I said, trustees may meet only once every three years and still be complying with the other provisions of the Bill.  I do not think this would be desirable and it is necessary to have some standards in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying the Minister should be involved on a daily or weekly basis &mdash; this would tie up the board &mdash; but we should indicate that we expect the board to set down guidelines for the trustees on how often they should meet and the information they should have.  I know from experience that this can be a problem for a minority of pension funds &mdash; obviously the majority of schemes comply with the guidelines and manage their affairs properly &mdash; and it is necessary to set down <Col N="347" /> guidelines on how often trustees should meet, how committees of management are established and the information they should have.  I do not think that would be an undue burden on anybody.  I cannot envisage any code of practice which would not provide for these matters. There are other codes of practice which need not be regulated for but we should set out in the Bill how the board of trustees should carry out their functions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has clearly decided he does not want to give the trustees a legal standing.  He said that everybody in the country is happy with this but this is clearly not true.  Congress has lobbied us quite heavily about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Codes of practice regarding trustees shall lay down minimum standards regarding the appointment or election of trustees, committees, management, frequency of meetings, and <Col N="351" /> the nature and content of information which they are to be supplied with.</P>

    <P>I will not press this amendment to a vote but I should like to record my concern regarding codes of practice.  In schemes that have run into difficulties the experience has been that the function and operation of trustees have caused the greatest problem.  It would be a fundamental flaw in this Bill if we leave that area confused and dependent on guidelines which will not have legal standing.  For members of schemes to be able to operate them properly and to adequately protect themselves it is important that the operational standards expected of trustees should be set down and have legal standing, which is the case elsewhere in the Bill relating to demands made on schemes and funding disclosures.</P>

      <P>I support the previous speakers in relation to the weakness of the subsection dealing with the general responsibility of trustees.  I had practical experience in this area in a recent case. A company was bought by someone in Britain and they also bought the pension <Col N="352" /> fund.  The new owner appointed himself and his financial controller as trustees of the scheme.  Within two years of buying the company they wound up the pension fund and left the unfortunate employees without the pension they expected to get on reaching the age of 62 or 65, depending on the years of service.  It is extraordinary that trustees, who are supposed to act in the best interests of the members of the scheme, are not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this section refers to the duties, role and responsibilities of trustees of a scheme.  The responsibilities of trustees of a pension fund are primarily to the members of the fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain to the Deputy that a whole section is devoted to the functions and responsibilities of trustees, which covers the matter.  There is not an inadequacy in relation to the powers and functions of trustees.  This section just relates to the functions of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the board's guidelines to trustees and I am arguing along the lines of other speakers.Anybody dealing with trustees of a pension fund should have some statutory control over their activities.  If a man or woman works for 35 or 40 years in a company which is subsequently bought by someone who winds up the pension fund, with the result that its profits go to the coffers of the company, it is morally wrong and legislators must ensure that it is not allowed to happen.  I am aware that up to now there was no legislation governing the activities of trustees but in this section we are talking about the functions of the board, which are to issue guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of trustees of pension funds.  I am availing of this opportunity to point out the practical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another Member of the House told me of a similar situation in which he was involved with a company which he sold. The new purchaser promptly wound up <Col N="353" /> the pension fund.  This is sharp practice and has nothing to do with good business; running a company that way typifies bad management.  I will also speak on the next section dealing with the responsibilities of trustees and I will speak on every opportunity I get to point out this practice should not be tolerated.  We are talking about people who give many years of their lives to a company and who look forward to getting a proper pension in their old age, to which they are entitled. Sharp practice of any kind, particularly on the part of so-called trustees, should not be allowed I ask the Minister to make certain that he uses this legislation to prevent this kind of thing in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions outlined in subsection (1) are similar to those recommended in the first report of the National Pensions Board.  The board will have a supervisory and advisory function and their main function will be to monitor and supervise the implementation of the new requirements by occupational pension scheme.  This section adequately provides for the functions of the board in a very consistent way with the report of the National Pensions Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 10, apart from the reservation with the amendment expressed by my colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett, I refer also to the functions of the board in section 10 (1) (d) which reads: &ldquo;to encourage the provision of appropriate training facilities for trustees of schemes;&rdquo;.  That will be vitally important, particularly in the case of member trustees, if the provisions of the Bill are to really protect them.  It will remain possible for persons handling schemes, for employers who may have a desire to engage in subterfuge of one kind of another, to run rings around people. It is a very specialised, expert area.  Those who have been endeavouring to come to grips with it in unions will freely admit that it is an area requiring great expertise. The issue of education is vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister considers an additional amendment I request that it would not simply include trustees of schemes but <Col N="354" /> that the board should be requested to engage in some general educational function for members of schemes also, perhaps running annual seminars.  A requirement of this kind might be asked of the board because trustees may not even be a member of the scheme.  If members are to be adequately protected the information they receive will not be of great value to them unless there is a degree of education associated therewith.Those of us who have tried to come to terms with the provisions of this Bill know just how technical is the whole area and no doubt the Minister after a couple of years of close relationship with the overall issue also realises this and that if members are to be adequately protected they will require much information.  I know the unions are engaging in that educational process to a degree but, in the case of people who are not unionised, it would be advisable to add that function to the board.  I ask the Minister to consider it.  I might add that I will be tabling an amendment to that effect for Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>It is really a standard provision.For example, somebody could leave a bequest to the board, some insurance company or whoever.  Normally Deputy Byrne would be asking me to cater for all of these contingencies. The subsection really just provides for circumstances in which such a gift might arise.  For instance, somebody might want the board to set up a trust for something, say to have some students undertake a study into some aspects pertaining to their area of study, when they might set up a trust for that purpose.  It is a general provision and is safeguarded both ways because subsection (2) reads: &ldquo;The Board shall not accept a gift if the trusts or conditions attached to it would be inconsistent with its functions.&rdquo;  Therefore it will be seen that it is covered both ways: one, they may do it and, two, they may not do it if it is not appropriate.  The provision is to be found in many Acts.  It has nothing to do with Ministers, or gifts from Ministers.</P>

      <P>Concern has been raised by the Irish Association of Pension Funds and a couple of other bodies in relation to how the chief executive will operate, bearing in mind the experience of other boards, with regard to sufficient powers being delegated.  I wonder whether the provisions of section 15 (4) adequately meet the case?  I am wondering whether the Minister has received such representations in relation to the chief executive, the adequate delegation of functions to him and whether the provisions of that subsection would be adequate to meet those concerns?  From their experience with funds it is the association's belief that the chief executive would be required to operate more than simply on administration; he would have to have a substantial level of power delegated to him if he is to perform his function adequately.  Would the Minister say whether the section, as drafted, adequately responds to such representations or whether he anticipates a problem arising in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>The chief executive shall carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of the Board and perform such other functions as may be determined by the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> The board can be requested by the Minister, so that there is a connection in that way to what the chief executive may be doing.  They are the normal functions of the chief executive and, as far as I can ascertain, are adequate to cater for any circumstances that might arise.  On the question of adequate consultancy, legal advice or whatever, in the first instance it would be a matter for the board and for the chief executive to take such advice as may be deemed to be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather the National Pensions Board recommended that the chief executive have certain specific powers reserved to him to allow speedy action, where required.  I would imagine that would relate to circumstances in which legal action was involved, such as the sudden winding up of a scheme or a sudden crisis occurring within a scheme. I presume the Minister can ensure that the board should delegate such powers. However, the Irish Association of Pension Funds were concerned that it should be clarified that sufficient powers can be delegated, so that the chief executive could initiate action as required.  For example, they recommended that the board would delegate such powers at its first meeting &mdash; I know that would not be a subject for the Bill &mdash; but that the chief executive would be obliged to report to the board as soon as possible having undertaken any serious action.  We felt there might be a necessity to take urgent legal action occasionally and perhaps the Minister would say whether such circumstances would be adequately covered in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Pensions Board did not propose that in legislation certain functions be reserved to the chief executive officer.  They were concerned that the chief executive officer would have flexibility to act immediately but that is a matter for the board.  I do not anticipate there will be any difficulty in that regard.  As far as the board are concerned that would be one of the principal tasks of the chief executive officer who <Col N="358" /> will be responsible to the board.  Given the kind of people who will comprise the membership of the board I am certain they will maintain close contact with anything that might happen.  Really it is more a question for the board themselves and the manner in which they carry on their activities.</P>

It proposes to make any employee or ex-employee personally liable regardless of their responsibility and capacity to respond.  It could happen that a person would not have the information but because of the way this section is drafted they would be liable to an offence.  Secondly, the person might be ill or might not be in a position to give the information for various reasons.  It is important that a specified time is laid down, as proposed in another amendment in my name.  Other Acts specify a particular time and in this case we would have to suggest what is a reasonable time. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>

I accept the principle of what the Deputy is saying.  Section 18 of the Bill provides that the board may carry out investigations into the operation of pension schemes.  Subsection (2) gives them power to require an employer or the trustees, to furnish specified information within a specified period.  Deputy Flaherty's amendment would insert the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; before &ldquo;specified&rdquo;. The draftsman advised me that the amendment is not technically correct. The phrase &ldquo;within such reasonable period as may be specified&rdquo; would be more appropriate, and the amendment would be acceptable on that basis.

      <P>I want to record my satisfaction that the draftsman has at last come around to the way of thinking of the Members of the Oireachtas in regard to this section.  It is now worded correctly and does not discriminate against people who, under past legislation, would have been debarred from membership of the board or staff of the board if they were nominated to stand for election.  In particular it applied to people in the Seanad who could be nominated without their knowledge and could be removed from the board on a technicality.  This section ensures that people can hold these positions until such time as they are elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas or nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann.

      <P>This section states that the Minister may from time to time advance to the board out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas such sums as he may determine for the purposes of expenditure by the board in the performance of their functions.  That seems <Col N="362" /> to meet the point I was concerned about yesterday.  It is clear that if the expenditure of the board became an excessive burden on the members, who would be the main subscribers to the cost of the scheme as initiated, it would be open to the Minister, under this section, to advance money to share the cost of the administration.  That may not be the Minister's thinking at present.  As I have said, the experience elsewhere has been that these schemes may consist of a very large number of staff and can involve very heavy costs which, in other countries, are carried by the Exchequer rather than by the schemes.  If that situation was to arise here or to prove a problem, this section gives the Minister power to respond.</P>

    <P> (4)(a)  The person or any of the persons holding an oral hearing under this section may, by giving notice in that behalf in writing to a person, require the person to attend on such day and at such time and place as is specified in the notice to give evidence at the hearing in relation to the question to be determined by the Board or to produce at the hearing any documents in his possession, custody or control relating to any such question.</P>

    <P>(c)  A person to whom a notice under paragraph (a) has been given <Col N="365" /> and who refuses to give evidence or gives false evidence at an oral hearing under this section or refuses or wilfully fails to produce any document to which the notice relates at such a hearing shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000.</P>

    <P>I hope this amendment will meet the views expressed here by Deputy Ferris and Deputy Byrne on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to insert a new section in Part II of the Bill setting out the procedure in relation to the determination of disputes by the board.  The Bill, as originally drafted, provided under paragraph 24 of the First <Col N="366" /> Schedule that the board should regulate by Standing Orders, or otherwise, such procedures.  I have now decided that in view of the significance of many of the board's determinations concerning matters involving pension schemes these procedures should be dealt with under this part of the Bill dealing with the establishment of the pensions board itself.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides that any question falling to be determined by the board shall be determined by it, in its absolute descretion without or after an oral hearing.The board may consider that in many cases an oral hearing would not be warranted.Any interested party may make representations to the board concerning any matters submitted for their determination.Where the board consider that an oral hearing in the case is warranted they may authorise one of their members, or a member of their staff, to conduct such a hearing.  Such persons will have the power to take evidence on oath from witnesses.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) deals with the procedures for giving notice to persons to attend such a hearing.  Subsection (5) provides for the possible reimbursement of expenses to persons in attendance at such hearings in cases where it is considered appropriate.  Subsection (6) provides for the making of regulations to deal with other procedural aspects of the board's business.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a welcome improvement on the proposed legislation.  It meets the points made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who pointed out that the board can make a decision which can be of vital significance and is the final arbiter in any conflict in relation to rights and entitlements under the Bill.  It was important that the mechanism by which this would be done should be contained in the legislation.  While the Minister has not spelled out other areas in the legislation I welcome the fact that he has adopted this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that natural justice is seen to be done for members where a <Col N="367" /> decision is made that they are entitled to increases or reductions in their pensions which obviously would have an effect on their living standards.  Where that has been decided the procedures by which they may make their case should be clearly outlined and &mdash; to use that phrase again &mdash; should be transparent.  People should see that justice is being done and that they have every opportunity to represent themselves in the manner in which they have become accustomed in other proceedings.  This includes the possibility of legal representation which may be desirable given the nature and scope of the issues which may be decided by the board in relation to individuals or groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for accepting that there is such a need and for making provision for this by way of his own amendment.  I am stunned by the number of amendments which are consequential on this one and we may need some time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment which is both complicated and detailed proposes to insert a new section in Part II of the Bill.  When I saw the list of amendments I realised that the Minister was making an attempt to meet the reservations expressed by congress and other interested parties.  This amendment will strengthen an area of the Bill about which congress were extremely worried. Subsection (4) (c) states that a person on summary conviction shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000.  I ask the Minister to tell us if in setting that figure he took into account our views on the question of fines, and if he will indicate if it is in keeping with the increased penalties we had suggested and to which he had agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The new section meets some of the major reservations expressed by congress and the procedure now laid <Col N="368" /> down is quite comprehensive.  I would like to ask a number of questions in relation to it.  It appears that the appeals body is structured in a formal way.  Can the Minister tell us on what basis an application will be decided at an oral hearing?  I also seek clarification on whether guidelines will be laid down on which applications should go before an oral hearing.  Given the issues involved, it is clear that this is a legal matter with those attending at hearings as witnesses having to take an oath.  The amendment also states that the person concerned may bring a legal representative with them.  It, therefore, appears to be a quasi-judicial appeals structure.  I ask the Minister to indicate who will decide what applications will go before an oral hearing and what appeals mechanism will be available to someone whose application for an oral hearing has been rejected.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of the amendment states that the person or persons holding an oral hearing may order a person concerned to pay to any other person concerned a reasonable sum in respect of expenses occasioned by the person in relation to the hearing and any such sum may be recovered by the person concerned from the other person concerned as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  I seek clarification on where this would leave the small man going before the board to claim that he is not receiving his pension entitlements.It is possible that he may have to employ actuaries or some other professional person to make the case for him. Is he likely to be met by an offputing list of expenses which would have to be met if he wishes to have his application dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The board will decide whether an application should go before an oral hearing.  I do not want the matter to come back to the Minister.  The board will have to decide in accordance with natural justice with the Minister having the power to give them instructions, if necessary, on the way in which they should carry out their duties.  Naturally, both I and the House would be concerned <Col N="369" /> that the arrangements they will make will meet the needs of the ordinary member. This would be a matter for the board in the first instance.  I am quite sure that this is the way they would want it to be conducted, particularly given the fact that the trade unions and the workers will be represented on the board.  I will have a look at the penalties listed before Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the preservation of benefits and states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualifying service&rdquo;, in relation to a member of a scheme, means the aggregate of every period of reckonable service whether or not continuous in each case...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give the example of a married woman who returns to the workforce. She left her job at higher management level to get married, but on her return she can only obtain a position at a lower level, such as a clerical officer.  I would like the Minister to inform the House which income will be taken into account in deciding on her pension.  Will her pension be based on her average earnings before first leaving employment or her average earnings on her return to the workforce?  Is provision also being made for the transfer of pension entitlement from one company to another?  Would her service in the previous employment <Col N="371" /> be taken into account in deciding qualifying service?  Will my fears be confirmed that there is no such right even though the Minister may say there is?  Will the example I gave cover every other scheme relating to any other employment in respect of which rights to long service benefit have been granted under the scheme in substitution for accrued rights under such other scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the rules of the scheme.  They will have to be considered.She will have to know them in advance and base her decisions on that knowledge.  On the question of preservation, it depends on whether the person is going back to the same occupation, or to a different company, or to a lesser job in the same company, or to a lesser job in a different company.  The Deputy's question depends on the rules of the scheme.  The preservation will ramain the same.</P>

      <P>No one-off sum has been allocated by my Department to meet the costs of the agreement between the trustees of the Chester Beatty Library and the former director.  The precise terms of the agreement are confidential in accordance with the settlement made between the director and the trustees.  My Department and the trustees will share the cost of the agreement over a period of three years.</P>
      <P>Pending determination of the future management structure of the library, a part-time administrator on behalf of the trustees has been appointed.  As soon as a new management structure and system has been determined, arrangements, including the placing of formal advertisements, will be put in train to fill the post of whole-time director.  The essential qualifications and specifications will be determined in the light of the new management requirements.</P>
      <P>The trustees furnished their recommendations on the development of the library on 15 June 1990.  This is now being considered in my Department in the context of the consultant's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific issue of tenure of office, <Col N="373" /> the trustees have indicated that they have no objection in principle to appointments being limited to a term of years.  The question of the adoption of the consultant's recommendations in this regard is being discussed with the trustees.</P>

In the normal course of events the proper procedure is to settle the management structure and recruit a new director into that.  To recruit a new director and create a management structure around him would not be in accordance with the best management principles.</P>

      <P>The Director of the National Museum advises that the original Cross of Cong is an extremely delicate structure of wood, cladded in decorative metal plates and, hence, is too fragile to be considered for loan.  If a formal request is made and appropriate conditions of care can be provided in Castlerea, the lending of the museum's copy of the Cross, itself a very significant artefact which was acquired by the National Museum in the 1930s, will be considered.  That replica was lent for display during the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park in 1979 and was also made available for liturgical ceremonies held at Abbey-knockmoy, County Galway, in August 1989.</P>

      <P>I assure the Taoiseach that the conversation to which he referred was taken to be a formal request to the director of antiquities for the Cross of Cong.  Referring yesterday to the Moy-lurg Cross, the Taoiseach said it was a good thing that these objects should be displayed in their appropriate background.I would suggest that an appropriate place to display the Cross of Cong would be in County Roscommon.  After all it was commissioned and made for Roscommon Abbey in 1123.  In keeping with that the Taoiseach has said about displaying such objects in the appropriate backgrounds, does he not think it would be appropriate that it should be displayed on this special occasion in Castlerea?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The final stage of that campaign consists of the publication of a series of studies, commissioned from independent experts, which looks specifically at the impact of the single market on ten of the most important sectors of the Irish economy.  Eight of these studies have <Col N="377" /> now been published and widely disseminated to interested parties and are on sale.  The remaining two studies in the series will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>Five or six weeks ago the Minister for the Marine indicated in this House that the report would be with the Cabinet within weeks.  The report is with his Department since 13 February 1990.  Sitting to present that report were officials of his Department, the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Departments of Defence and Finance.  Why has it taken so long for the report to be submitted to Cabinet? Is something sinister happening in the background seeing the promise given by the Minister over five weeks ago has not been fulfilled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I wish to take Questions Nos. 7 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 28 Spanish registered fishing vessels were arrested in the period 1 June 1989 to 1 June 1990.  Fines totalling £203,507 have been levied in 11 of these cases.  The remaining cases are still pending.Five of these arrests involve vessels which were previously arrested for fishery related offences.</P>
      <P>I have written to my counterpart in Spain drawing his attention to the recent very serious incidents involving Spanish vessels off the Irish coast and I will be pursuing the matter further when I meet him shortly in Spain.</P>
      <P>I have already explained to the House during a recent Adjournment debate the detailed steps taken to deal with recent incidents off the south coast.  There have been four cases involving foreign vessels reported to my Department since the beginning of the year.  All four incidents occurred outside Irish territorial waters. I would like to stress once again that I will not tolerate interference with Irish fishing vessels going about their legitimate pursuits in Irish waters.  Notwithstanding current uncertainties surrounding international law as it applies on the high seas, I am satisfied that our ability and determination to protect the Irish fleet from intimidation and harassment have not been impaired.  The Navy's active and heightened presence off the south coast will help ensure as far as possible the continuing safety of the Irish fleet.  To date, I am pleased to note, the Navy's interventions have restored a significant degree of order to current fishing activities in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main aim at this juncture is to obtain the active support and co-operation of those member states directly involved with a view to bringing this deplorable intimidation to an end.  In so far as the legal issues relating to these incidents are concerned, I would like to <Col N="383" /> assure the House that such issues are being urgently reviewed in consultation with the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the Minister's reply that Spanish fishermen believe it is worth while poaching in our waters.  There have been repeat offences by some vessels and so far as I am aware &mdash; I am not too sure of the number &mdash; 28 arrests have been made. Does the Minister agree that there is a need for more vigilante in our coastal waters?  I requested the Taoiseach to call in the Spanish Ambassador to put to him our serious concern regarding the activities of Spanish vessels off our coast.  I know the Minister has written to his counterpart in Spain but does he not agree that the Spanish Ambassador should be brought in so that he can be informed of the seriousness with which this House regards attacks on Irish fishing vessels off our coast?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy's suggestion can be considered. However I should point out that in recent months our Naval Services have mounted an intensive fisheries surveillance operation in this area.  The subsequent speedy arrest by the Navy of a number of foreign vessels on fishery related offences allegedly involved in this interference and the civil actions which ensured have helped to diffuse a threatening situation and restored a considerable measure of order to current fishing activities in the area. There have been no further reported incidents of late and I have no doubt that the intensive follow-up operation of the Naval Service will continue.</P>

No resources will be spared in preventing such incidents and those involved will be well aware from the action taken to date of our determination to stamp out this practice altogether.  The various State services concerned have been brought together at senior level by my Department to identify further practical measures which can be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Considerable progress has been made in recent years in the development of the Irish fishery harbour infrastructure. However, significant investment is still required to ensure that harbours and piers will be capable of supporting a modern sea going fishing fleet and all related downstream activities located in their vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I am committed to the concept of establishing the five fishery harbour centres as locations where the whole chain of undertakings from the catching through to the landing, auctioning, processing and marketing of the catch as well as the servicing of the fleet can be catered for.  In addition, my aim is also to develop other important fishery harbours at strategic locations thus providing a solid infrastructural base, and all necessary back-up, repair and service facilities, for the efficient exploitation of fish stocks.  My overall policy is to develop a fishery harbour infrastructure comprising the five Fishery Harbour Centres; <Col N="385" /> a number of strategically placed other major harbours at which significant catches may be landed; and a number of smaller harbours and piers catering for needs which cannot be satisfied otherwise, either because they would add to the congestion problems at the larger harbours or because the landing facilities in question are located adjacent to fishing grounds or mariculture sites.</P>
    <P>The total investment proposed for the development of fishery harbours in the period 1990-93 is of the order of £20 million.  This includes a programme of infrastructural improvements at selected harbours costing £15 million, towards which an ERDF contribution of £7.5 million through the Operational Programme for Rural Development has been sought.</P>
    <P>In addition, an application for grant aid, 50 per cent of total cost, under EC Regulation 4028/86 has been approved.  Under this regulation the Commission may grant Community financial aid for the provision of facilities at fishing ports with a view to improving the conditions in which products are obtained and landed. Aid sought consists of £1.71 million for BIM's ice plant programme and £1.995 million for other fishery port facilities.</P>
    <P>My Department has an open-port policy in relation to foreign fishing vessels.  However, landings by such vessels in Ireland are dictated generally by market forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister recognises the difficulties which exist in regard to the condition of harbours throughout the country.  While I appreciate that the five harbours directly under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Marine are given priority treatment by them does the Minister not agree that there is a need at this stage for his Department to take a much more direct interest in what is happening to other harbours?  Is the Minister in a position to tell the House the number of additional harbours he intends to develop, where these are located and the criteria under which they will get special recognition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take priority and oral Questions Nos. 9 and 13, respectively, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the plastics dumped or landed on our coasts originate on land as domestic refuse or at sea by the throwing <Col N="387" /> overboard from ships of operational wastes.  There has been no assessment made by my Department of the tonnage involved but maritime local authorities would have some details of the amounts of refuse collected from their beaches.</P>
    <P>The Government contributed towards the cost of the European Coastwatch 1989 which undertook a survey of our coasts in September last year.  It provided very useful information on the extent of the problem, showing that plastics washed in from the sea is a problem even. in the most remote and otherwise unspoilt areas of our coastline.  The sampling method used was to divide the coastline into 5km blocks and each block was then subdivided into 0.5km units. The survey showed that 59 per cent of the units had general plastics such as bags, pieces of buckets and so on, 25 per cent had plastic/nylon fishing gear and/or poly-strene and 18 per cent had plastic beer can 6-pack holders or packing straps.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine, conscious of the damage that may occur, is tackling the problem of disposal of plastics in the marine environment on a number of fronts.  Firstly, the Government's Environment Action Programme specifically addressed this issue and made a commitment in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Indiscriminate disposal of ships' waste in the Marine environment must be terminated. Harbour authorities will, therefore, be required to instal facilities for receiving ships' waste in all ports.  The provision of such facilities will enable Ireland to accede to the MARPOL Convention and legislation for this purpose will be brought forward in the current year; this legislation will contain provision for enforcement and penalties.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am pleased to say that the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990 has just been published and was circulated to Deputies last week.  The Bill, when enacted, will give effect to the International Convention for the prevention of Pollution from Ships, commonly known as <Col N="388" /> MARPOL 73/78, by which (i) the dumping of plastics will be prohibited, and (ii) facilities must be provided at ports for the reception of plastic, food, oily and other wastes from ships.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of this legislation my Department have written to all port authorities urging them to provide facilities at the earliest possible date.  My Department have also been in touch with the Chamber of Shipping to ascertain the needs and requirements of shipowners with regard to reception facilities.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in anticipation of the enactment of the Sea Pollution Bill, and mindful that awareness of the damage a seafarer can causes is crucial to the prevention of this pollution, my Department, in conjunction with the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, launched a poster campaign to discourage seafarers from dumping over the side. The poster graphically highlights the adverse effects ships' garbage, especially plastics, can have on marine life and safety at sea.</P>
    <P>My Department have sought to achieve the widest possible circulation of the poster; it has been circulated to all schools in the country, seafarers, fishing vessels, fishery co-operatives, yacht clubs and merchant vessels.  I am gratified with the response the poster campaign has generated and am satisfied that increased awareness of the problem, particularly among the younger generation, has been achieved.  I must compliment those environmentalists who assisted my Department by giving talks and presenting slide shows across the country in an effort to increase awareness of the harmful effects of dumped plastics in the marine environment and on our coastline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Minister of State in complimenting those who held slide shows throughout the country on the dumping of plastics; and also to compliment the Department on the most effective poster they have mounted.  Is the Minister in a position to give an indication to the House of the amount of damage caused <Col N="389" /> to the different species of fish around our coast and to sea mammals?  Research indicates that substantial damage is being caused by plastics and that many fish are being killed.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I wish to take Questions Nos. 14, 46 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>There have been 36 arrests of foreign trawlers by the Naval Service since the beginning of the year on fishery related charges.  Of these, ten have been for illegal fishing.  Legal proceedings have been initiated in all ten cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Penalties applying under Irish law to fishery related offences are already among the most stringent in the Community.These penalties include confiscation of catch and gear as well as, in certain circumstances and at the discretion of the courts, forfeiture of a vessel which is before the courts on a second <Col N="396" /> indictable offence.  I have no proposals to revise these penalties at the present time.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The position in regard to the registration of fishing vessels is that, under the Merchant Shipping (Registry, Lettering and Numbering of Fishing Boats) Regulations, 1989, owners of registered fishing boats were required to apply for re-registration of their boats not later than 31 January 1990.  This new registration system will come into operation with effect from 30 June.  Responsibility for administration of the new register is vested in the registrar general of fishing boats.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the registrar general that the arrangements for the bringing into operation of the new system are well advanced and that the aim is to issue shortly appropriate certificates to all eligible applicants who at this stage have met the required conditions.  It is expected that the vast bulk of applicants will fall into this category.  In the remaining cases, registration will depend on applicants providing the registrar general with such information, evidence, etc., as may be necessary to satisfy him that the applicant's boat is entitled to be registered.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 31 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Consideration of this matter concerns my Department in so far as land reclamation requires a lease under the Foreshore Act, 1933.  There is provision for the holding, if necessary, of a public inquiry under section 2 (8) of that Act. To date there is no application for such a lease under consideration, for the area at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire, or any other area in Dublin Bay.  If one were made, for reclamation of an area in excess of 10 hectares, an environmental impact assessment would be a mandatory requirement.</P>

Can the Minister give us an assurance that, first, no decision will be taken by the Minister for the Marine about this matter prior to receiving the advice of the Interim Harbour Board and prior to the proposals being put on public display?

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `advertising' shall mean advertising, other than promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting its own commercial activities;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By way of introducing the amendment may I say that what we are dealing with today is an extraordinary situation.  We had a Bill which was published by the Minister subsequent to a public outcry about the nature of the proposals in the Bill.  The Minister then brought forward a range of amendments to his own Bill which totally changed the whole concept of the Bill and totally changed the Bill in terms of how the Minister intended to cripple RTE.  I sought on 8 January to introduce a Standing Order 30 motion in this House which you ruled as not being eligible on that day.  In any event a decision was made on that.  The purpose of that motion was to seek the withdrawal of the Bill by the Minister, and to have a new Bill introduced and to have the Minister's new proposals debated on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 1 of the explanatory memorandum reads:</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Minister for Communications, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, may pay, in each financial year commencing on 1st January, 1991, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, up to 25 per cent of an amount equivalent to net television licence fee receipts to the Independent Radio and Television Commission, with the remainder being paid to Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>It goes on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Radio Telefís Éireann the Bill provides that the total daily times for broadcasting advertisements and the maximum period to be given <Col N="470" /> to advertisements in any one hour shall be determined by the Minister.  The Minister may also direct by Order that total revenue to be derived by Radio Telefís Éireann from advertising, sponsorship and commercial promotion in its broadcasts in any year may not exceed an amount determined in such Order.  A resolution must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before an Order under this section of the Bill can take effect.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that the intentions of the Minister have changed for a variety of reasons.  I understand some pressure was mounted on the Minister and the Taoiseach not only by the Progressive Democrats but also by other sections of the community, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and journalists.  I also understand that persons in the print media indicated that they were dissatisfied with the Minister's proposals. Nevertheless, the Minister proceeded with the Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendment <Col N="472" /> No. 1 deals with advertising.  The Minister's proposals in his new Bill are clearly based on the concept of advertising. What the Minister has introduced by way of an amendment is a Bill which attempts to cripple RTE by restricting the number of minutes of advertising it may sell in any one hour and the amount of advertising revenue it may take in any one year.  I argue that in order for us to consider that proposal in its entirely we must have the opportunity to engage in a Second Stage debate and the opportunity to express our views on what the Minister is proposing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that amendment No. 1 deals with advertising and the definition of advertising.  In relation to taking the licence money from RTE and giving it to commercial private stations, the Minister said when introducing the Bill &mdash; and I quote from column 1574, volume 399 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I have, however, been impressed by the more reasoned arguments from those who are concerned about the potential impact this might have on the very concept of the independence of the new services, on the dangers of ending up supporting inefficiencies, on the general undesirability of opening up new areas of public funding, and the example that such a decision might have for other sectors of the economy. I am also influenced by the consideration that to make available public funding to the independent broadcasting sector could be seen as creating a further distortion between the electronic and print media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain why it was only after nearly two weeks of public <Col N="474" /> debate that he felt his Bill might have this effect.  How did he come to the conclusion that he should bring in this Bill in the first place?  On what basis did he make his decision?  Did he decide on the basis of inspiration or was the Bill drafted by someone outside the Department? Where did the proposals come from seeing that he had to ditch them within days of publishing the Bill?  These are questions which might have been answered if the Minister had not guillotined the debate on 7 June&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when he deprived this House of the opportunity to make an adequate contribution to the debate on the Bill.  He did not respond to the Second Stage debate.  He stood up for 30 seconds and said he was closing the debate by way of a device which was totally undemocratic in terms of how Parliament should deal with its business. I ask the Minister to indicate how the sections which are now being dropped were arrived at and who he consulted on the matter.  Various people I have spoken to in the media have indicated that they were not consulted in that regard.  It would be interesting to hear who was consulted.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This brings me back to the concern I expressed last week that some of this advertising revenue might leak out to external broadcasting services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was in relation to the section where he proposed to give himself power, by order, to cap RTE's advertising revenue. The valid argument was made by all sections of the community that this would have the effect of driving advertisers to outside broadcasting stations.  For example, UTV was referred to.  The fact that no alternative Irish broadcasting station was available to pick up that revenue was not adverted to, except in so far as he stated that it was his hope that TV3 would be up and running at an early date and that this service, combined with <Col N="475" /> other Irish media, would absorb the diverted revenue.  He said that in any event the risk of leakage was more acceptable than the diversion of licence fee funds to the private sector.  That was an extraordinary statement for the Minister for Communications to make.  On the one hand he argued that he wanted to provide an independent broadcasting service which would have an Irish ethos and which would be capable of competing with other broadcasting services who are beaming their signals into the State and on the other hand he argued that it was better that they should pick up the advertising revenue rather than have licence fee funds diverted to the private sector.</P>
    <P>In the original Bill he did not advocate one or the other but proposed both to divert the licence fee funds and cap advertising revenue.  The Minister should explain why he guillotined the debate on 7 June and why he did not answer the points made by Deputies who spoke at the beginning of the debate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is an experienced Member of the House.  I understand the Deputy sought the permission of the House to deal specifically with his amendment and not have it combined with a number of other amendments which were somewhat similar.I thought he did so in the spirit of the Standing Orders which govern debate on Committee Stage where Deputies must confine themselves to what is in the section, not to what might have been in it. I am sure the Deputy appreciates that. The fact that something was omitted or not dealt with on Second Stage does not automatically qualify it for discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

How are we to know if the Minister has further amendments in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister choose not to reply at the end of Second Stage justifying any amendments he had in mind.  It is perfectly normal for the House to ask what <Col N="477" /> Bill we are dealing with.  Is it the first Bill which suggested interfering with the licence fee and advertising, or the Bill that dropped the attack on the licence fee and moved to advertising, or the Bill that attacked FM2, or the Bill that does not now attack FM2?  The onus is on the person who moved the Bill.  The decent thing to do would have been for the Minister to bring in a Bill stating his intentions in relation to broadcasting policy but to thrust the House into the realms of abstraction and discuss amendments to Bill A, Bill B, Bill C and Bill D&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are in quite an extraordinary situation where the Minister has cut short a debate on Second Stage of the Bill he published and we are now in the preliminary stages of Committee Stage of a Bill which was not published.

      <P>We are talking about advertising.  This Bill falls into two main parts &mdash; sections 2, 3 and 4 and the rest of the Bill.  The Minister proposes to delete sections 2 and 3 and section 4, which deals with advertising.  The amendment in the name of Deputy De Rossa tries to define advertising and I submit that it warrants wide-ranging discussion.  Not only is the Minister traipsing in and out of Bills but he is also traipsing in and out of different plans for broadcasting, just like the three little maids from school in <i>The Mikado.</i></P>

The Chair does not see any reason to depart from the established traditions of debate in this House since the House was established.

      <P>On a point of order, the relevance of this amendment depends on the intentions of the Minister with regard to a series of specific sections in the Bill. In the context of teasing out what is meant by &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; and the capping or restraint which it is envisaged the Bill will impose, it is of some relevance to know what is happening in regard to other sections and to have some insight into the Minister's thinking.  I particularly raised sections 2 and 3 and any interaction with other amendments.  There is a curiosity which should be explained to the House.  I will conclude by saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only thing I am raising is the definition section which Deputy De Rossa has placed with us and the invitation to the Minister to explain his thinking.  We now have the Minister acting as the Opposition as well as the proponent of the legislation because the <Col N="481" /> Minister has circulated amendments proposing to delete sections 2 and 3.  Amendments have been tabled by other Deputies opposing those sections.  The Minister appears in the final versions of the amendments to be opposing a series of his own original sections and it would help the House if he would give us some insight into his thinking, what he is opposing and what he is proposing.</P>

If the Government side were reasonable we would be reasonable.  If they are going to be unreasonable we will be unreasonable. This Bill is a shame.  It is penalising success in RTE.  The Minister does not know what he is doing because he is jumping <Col N="483" /> from one plan to another.  He has no plan.  He is all &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; action.  We are asking you, Sir, to allow the Minister to reply to our reasonable requests from this side of the House.  Will the Minister live up to the word given by the Taoiseach and by the Government Chief Whip that more extended Committee State contributions would be allowed?  Clearly the Chair has not been told that by the Government, but will you ask the Minister if the Taoiseach said that, if the Chief Whip said that and, if so, can we agree it?</P>

      <P>We have the amendment before us as proposed by Deputy De Rossa. I cannot accept the amendment, firstly, because the meaning of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; is well established in commonsense terms. It has never been necessary to define it in any broadcasting legislation heretofore. Secondly, the definition proposed is discriminatory <Col N="485" /> since it seeks to put the options open to the Authority with respect to the promotion of their own commercial activities on a more favourable plane than the independent broadcasting sector.  Finally, the intention of the definition is inimicable to the objective of section 5 of the Bill which is to achieve a harmonised approach to self promotion among all broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>As we get to each amendment I will be delighted to tease out the amendments with the Deputies, and this applies to the section.  I will be looking forward to a very constructive Committee Stage debate in the normal sense of Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address myself to this amendment as co-sponsor of it with Deputy De Rossa.  The purpose of the amendment is to give a very specific definition to the concept of advertising.  I am astounded to learn from the Minister in the very brief and &mdash; let me say &mdash; somewhat dismissive, if one can interpret or discern dismissiveness in this House, attitude of the Minister towards a very reasoned proposal from our group.  The very reason we seek to introduce &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; is that the Minister has made it such an issue.  He has suggested in his reasons for rejecting it that there has never been such a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in the legislation to date and for that reason he sees no reason how to contemplate it.  That is totally at variance with what the Minister is intending or seeking to intend to do in his legislation.</P>
      <P>It is well worth looking for a moment at some of the difficulties we had in trying to address the concept.  There is no clause at any stage in the existing legislation. However, when the Minister circulated his Bill and, coupled with it, his explanatory memorandum, he indicated at a number of junctures exactly what he had in mind with regard to the concept of revenue from advertising as far as RTE would be concerned.  Section 4 of the Bill as originally circulated and for the moment as it stands, subsection (3) provides and I quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, it is impossible to address oneself to any amendment without making some reference to other sections of the Bill. The Bill, if it is of any value at all, is an integrated piece of legislation and if we are going to argue any particular amendment clearly we must make references to other sections.  That is what Deputy McCartan was doing and I think it was unreasonable of you to interrupt him in the way you did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will certainly welcome that.  The point I was making related to the central importance of this concept of advertising in the Minister's plans.  In the original Bill, as circulated, the Minister had proposed allowing himself to make orders under section 4 (3) directing that the total revenue to be derived by RTE from, and I quote: &ldquo;advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasts in any year shall not exceed an amount...&rdquo;.  This proposal was expanded on in the explanatory memorandum.The Minister, in his amendments, sought to replace section 4 in its entirety and abandoned the mechanism of making orders in this area.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the Minister's concept of advertising.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister told us a little more about his intentions in the area of advertising and what he regards as advertising revenue for the purposes of RTE's work.  He said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Apart from ensuring that any codes of practice drawn up incorporate various international obligations &mdash; such as the extensive provisions on advertising standards in the EC Directive on Broadcasting Activities adopted last October &mdash; it would also be my intention to address certain unfair practices &mdash; if not abuses &mdash; practised by broadcasters in this area, about which the print media in particular have made numerous representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, for example, I will be making sure that cross-service promotions &mdash;<Col N="489" /> for example promotion by RTE of its radio services on its TV service &mdash; count as advertisements for the purpose of complying with the 7.5 per cent advertising time limit.  Likewise promotion of commercial activities &mdash; such as the <i>RTE Guide</i> or video-cassette compilations &mdash; will count as advertising.  RTE have a number of current practices in this area which they do not count as advertising for time limit purposes.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about commercial promotion in the form of prizes, etc., made available on programmes which blur the distinction between a programme proper and advertising and to that extent are exploitative of the public.  I would envisage addressing such issues in the code of practice to be drawn up.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's concept of advertising and the way in which he wishes to address this whole issue.  He has no hesitation whatsoever in making very firm statements and giving clear indications of what he understands by advertising but he has not at any stage attempted to introduce such a concept into the Bill to define advertising.  He was afraid to put is views into the Bill in some form which would have enabled us to address the issue and seek, if possible, to amend it.</P>
    <P>The notion of advertising in the area of broadcasting contained in our amendment will show that the Minister has departed from all notions of commonsense so far as RTE are concerned. He has attacked us for doing this, which I believe is a further illustration of the contempt in which the Minister holds public broadcasting, this House and the concept of a contribution from the Opposition.  In section 5 (3) of the Bill as originally circulated the Minister proposed that he alone should draw up the code of practice.  He said, &ldquo;I will consult with RTE but I will decide&rdquo;.  The Minister will decide by his own hand, without any reference, other than consultation with RTE, what advertising will represent <Col N="490" /> from here on in.  He will make no reference back to this House.  He will decide by the sheer power of the pen at this desk what exactly advertising will mean for RTE as a public broadcasting authority from the enactment of this Bill onwards. In short, the Minister is seeking to regulate RTE, free from any debate in this House or amending legislation, as he is currently obliged to do.  That is the commonsense the Minister wishes to introduce to this legislation and to the notion of controlling and directing RTE through the capping of advertising.</P>
    <P>It was to head off that heavy handed, undemocratic and totally nonsensical concept of the Minister that we specifically put down amendment No. 1 which states that advertising shall mean &ldquo;advertising, other than promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting its own commercial activities&rdquo;.In other words, we are seeking to ensure that the Minister will not have the very free and open hand he has always wanted in regard to the future of RTE and their commercial operations.</P>
    <P>That desire on the part of the Minister to simply have a free hand and do what he wants with RTE was illustrated here in the debate on the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, when he proposed deciding on all of the licences and having absolute control on the issuing of licence in the independent sector without any reference to the commission who were contemplated.  At least that debate had a good impact in that it brought the Minister back to democratic control.  If our amendment is successful, we hope it will have the effect of curtailing substantially the opportunity the Minister will have of having the free hand he has always wanted over the everyday workings of RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his brief and almost matter of fact response to the moving of the amendment by Deputy De Rossa, went on to suggest that it would, as a definition, in some way restrict the hands of the Authority appointed by him.  What a ridiculous proposition from a Minister who has kicked the Authority, and RTE <Col N="491" /> management, around like a paper football since he took office.  Over the coming days, if not weeks, we will illustrate how the Minister, more than any other Minister in the history of broadcasting, has restricted RTE, and its Authority, in its every-day affairs.  What comes to mind is the application by the RTE Authority to extend the broadcasting hours of Cork Local Radio to weekends.  Up to two hours before they were to begin their Saturday and Sunday broadcasting they understood that they had the off on that proposal.  The Minister does not have any function in that area and did not need to be consulted but he was notified by management as a matter of courtesy.  The Minister went to Cork and was, it is said, got at by the independent broadcaster in the area and lo and behold when he returned to Dublin on a Friday the message was sent to RTE that there would be no weekend broadcasting for the Cork station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave as his second reason for rejecting any concept of defining advertising in the Bill that it might seek to restrict the Authority.  I was describing the Minister as one of the most restricting Ministers in the history of broadcasting in this State and I was <Col N="492" /> giving an example of that by referring to the application by 2 FM to split their airwave.  They wanted to provide a different service to different locations.  It was a simple request to carry a particular service on the FM band and another service on the medium wave band but the Minister, who tells us that we should not restrict the Authority, responded by saying, no dice, no play, no game.</P>
      <P>Another argument put forward by the Minister is that our amendment would uneven the pitch yet again between the commercial operators, the print media and RTE.  In his speech the Minister said that the print media had made most representations to him in regard to this.  I do not necessarily accept that but I will take up their position on the basis that the Minister has put forward that view.  The view of the Minister with regard to advertising, and the capping of it, is that he should level the pitch.  The print media have their own licence fee, their own cover charge which, on a daily basis, is in excess of that received by RTE; is almost double that of RTE.  RTE Radio, on the other hand, does not receive any cover charge, no licence fee.  Why are they being drawn into the net of advertising capping?  Why is their advertising capacity being restricted when they are not involved in the cover charge?</P>
      <P>The Minister wants to separate 2 FM from RTE 1 but if he is in the business of separation he should consider separating TV generally from radio and apply the principles of the even pitch.  He should recognise that there is, from his warped point of view, an argument to be made for that.  He holds the view that because TV receives income from licence fees and advertising it should in some way be limited in its functions.  Those arguments cannot and should not apply to radio.  Is the print media subjected in any way to advertising limits?  Does the Minister propose introducing any regulations to ensure that the print media carries a certain percentage of contributions on the Irish language, social affairs or news and current affairs?  He is seeking to impose those restrictions on radio and television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the print media, if it <Col N="493" /> could have its way, would cover each page with advertisements and forget about providing a news service.  There is no doubt that the quality of the print media in regard to news coverage has seriously deteriorated; some are worse than others.  There is no level playing pitch when it comes to the issue of capping the revenue from advertising as far as the print media is concerned.  There is no intention to introduce any minimum percentage coverage as the Minister is seeking to introduce into the broadcasting area.  The Minister should explain why he has one attitude towards one area of the media and a different attitude towards another.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Minister's proposals on advertising will be felt in many ways. Many of the proposals will be fundamental to the future performance of RTE.  Let us look briefly at what the Minister is suggesting.  In his amendment the Minister states that his specific proposal for the limiting of advertising in the future is that the 10 per cent current daily rate available to the public broadcasting authority will be reduced to 7.5 per cent with a consequent reduction in the amount of time in any one hour from seven and a half minutes to four and a half minutes.  What will be the impact of that proposal?  Clearly, it will increase the cost to advertisers as less time will be available to carry advertisements.  That point was made succinctly by the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in their reaction to the Bill.  They state that the Bill in its truncated and amended form will be far worse as far as RTE as a public broadcasting body is concerned than the Bill which was circulated originally.</P>
    <P>The impact of what the Minister is doing bodes worse for RTE than what was originally circulated.  It was a clever piece of footwork on the part of the Minister to attempt to be seen responding to some of the representations made to him. He opposed two of his own fundamental sections and took them out of the Bill. Consequently, his actions were welcomed.However, what is left &mdash; and what the Minister seeks to introduce &mdash; will have far worse implications for RTE in <Col N="494" /> their commercial and viable operation in future.</P>
    <P>Advertising will become far more expensive.  In this regard the Confederation of Irish Industry, in their response to the proposals, indicated that in time the cost to the advertiser will be passed on to the consumer and that the goods and services advertised on television will become more expensive because the cost will be passed down the line.  They oppose the provisions in the Bill and the Minister's intent.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the opportunities in the independent commercial sector for the making of films and advertising will be severly restricted.  Let us briefly look at the figures in this area.  The RTE Authority in their newsletter <i>RTE News</i> tell us that over 50 per cent of their operational costs, or £44.373 million, is spent on &ldquo;contract, short term and programme participation employment&rdquo;.  They make the point that in the period from 1985 to 1989 the increase in temporary employment contracts from RTE rose by 69 per cent and, inevitably &mdash; because this is the greatest variable factor available to the management in RTE &mdash; they will suffer drastically as a result of the loss of revenue and the necessary introduction of cutbacks.  There will be a loss in the area of the independent commercial operation and RTE oppose this provision and concept of restriction of advertising which the Minister intends to introduce.</P>
    <P>There will clearly be a loss of work, revenue and jobs in the advertising sector.  There will also be a loss of opportunity to the many charitable organisations who operate often at no cost or who get a very good rate or deal from RTE.  One of the points made by 2FM is that Daffodil Day which hopes to raise £1 million will probably have to be dropped because of the Minister's concept in regard to advertising.  It will have a draconian effect on the services provided by RTE.  For that reason, we must restrict the Minister's concept of advertising and there must be a common-sense approach, not based on a capricious act of a vindictive Minister, but on the commonsense, everyday working of RTE <Col N="495" /> and their practices built up over the years as a result of practice and work in the field in response to what the public want.</P>
    <P>RTE have developed all these services, ideas and aids to the community.  They include voluntary, charitable, cultural and other areas over the years in response to what has been demanded from them. It is not the kind of service that can be dismantled in a day as a result of a throwaway response from the Minister.  The Workers' Party's proposals, in restricting the hand of the Minister by introducing a very definite concept of advertising in the Bill, are trying to preserve the security and future of the services provided by RTE.  In the context of defending the services provided, I will look very briefly at the role of 2FM&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, 2FM is a unique service in its own right which, like all the other services provided by RTE, has emerged as a response to what the public want.  The Minister was quite right in saying that it was originally designed and established to take on the pirates, which it did with gusto.  It learned so well that it is now quite clear that 2FM are more than a match for the pirates.  Nonetheless, RTE, in setting up 2FM, provided a service to the community which <Col N="496" /> is unrivalled in any other broadcasting nation.</P>
      <P>RTE services have been developed peculiarly in a very strong, sponsor-orientated way.  The roadcaster service, &ldquo;Lark in the Park&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Beat on the Street&rdquo; provide on the spot entertainment for those involved, mostly in relation to charity functions.  The pop concerts, Dublin City Marathon, the &ldquo;Beat Box&rdquo; children's programmes, the Christmas food appeal and Daffodil Day are very costly operations and resulted from a strong relationship between 2FM, their producers and management and sponsorship in the field.  The clear, undiluted message coming from 2FM is that all those events will have to be scrapped if the Minister's concept of advertising capping applies to sponsorship.</P>
      <P>I must revert to the original Bill as circulated.  Section 4 (3) states that the Minister will make orders curtailing total revenue derived from advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion.  These matters are not mentioned in the Minister's amendments and we must go back to his Second Stage speech to understand that it is clearly what he has in mind.  Indeed, some of the language used by the Minister in this regard is unbelievably insulting to the long years of service and the unbelievable social contribution made by RTE and 2FM.  The Minister referred to &ldquo;unfair practices, if not abuses&rdquo;.  That is the language of the Minister for Communications who has maintained a daily &mdash; if not hourly &mdash; interest in what goes on in RTE since the day he took office.  We will illustrate how he sent memos and directives to the management of RTE to tell them how to run their business.  He now says that everything he watched over and approved over the last three years is suddenly a potential abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Minister talking about?  In response, I challenged him to tell us so that we may understand fully where he is going with his motion of advertising.  Is the roadcaster service that visited his constituency and many other locations on many occasions &mdash; at the behest of the <Col N="497" /> Minister and his party Members, all of whom with one exception, are missing from this House today &mdash; an abuse?  Is that unfair practice?  Is the &ldquo;Lark in the Park&rdquo; that has provided concerts for young people in this city and around the country an abuse or an unfair practice? In the Minister's view, what charity functions are unfair and abusive in practice? What about &ldquo;Beat Box&rdquo;, the Christmas food appeal, or Daffodil Day?  What about the Marathon run by tens of thousands of people around this city annually, one of the single largest participative sporting events with such a beneficial effect throughout the health education programme of the Department of Health and others?  Is that an abuse promoted by 2FM?  Is that an unfair practice?  If so, let us be absolutely clear what the Minister is talking about.  Or is the Minister confining that concept to cross-commercialisation?Is the Minister trying to tell me that the <i>Irish Independent</i> does not tell us what will be in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> or that any one of the daily newspapers does not tell us what will appear in their evening editions, or <i>vice versa,</i> what will be appearing in their periodical publications, or, indeed, what goes on throughout the whole network of control that Independent Newspapers have over their provincial operations? Where is the level playing pitch as far as the print media are concerned?  Where is the restriction on advertising in the print media in cross-commercial promotion? The Minister's attempts to dress up his proposals as concepts of abuse or unfair practice are outrageous in the extreme.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are utterly and implicably opposed to the notion that RTE, in trying to promote themselves within the radio and television network, are doing any more than any other component of the media might be expected to do.  In fact that is exactly what any one of the commercial radio stations and RTE networks will do when they gain control in general, or in limited form, when the real ownership behind Century Radio came into the open, when we begin to understand the fingers that are in so <Col N="498" /> many pies within the so-called independent sphere of radio and television. Then we will see Century creeping in telling us what TV3 will do, or <i>vice versa.</i> Then we will hear, on Century Radio, what some of the so-called commercial independent radio stations will be doing, and <i>vice versa.</i>  Where is there to be found anywhere in this Bill the Minister's proposal to level the pitch of cross-commercialism with regard to the independent stations?  It is not included.  In the sphere of advertising, as far as this Minister is concerned, the only organisation to be hit, capped or curtailed is the public broadcasting one, which is clearly what is happening.</P>
    <P>It is also quite clear that the cutback in revenue to RTE &mdash; which we are told will amount to at least £10 million if not up to £12 million in the next year &mdash; will have an enormous impact on those persons on contract to the broadcasting Authority. That is why we seek to introduce our amendment with regard to advertising. That is why, in our view, it is essential that such things as promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its services, should not be included within the Minister's concept of advertising.  The Minister was going to include it in the original Bill but omitted it.  Then he stands up here in the House, with contempt, to inform us that we are defeating commonsense by attempting to introduce a definition.  That is playing hot and cold on this issue; it is playing with the lives, the jobs of the people within RTE and with its future viability and cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I might give the House some idea of what it means in terms of the future prospects for 2FM.  All of their current disc jockeys and presenters are on contract, people like Gerry Ryan.  Perhaps the Minister would like to get rid of that particular gentleman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In doing so, let me explain to the Minister one of the other fundamental reasons The Workers' Party seek to restrict and clearly define the concept of advertising.  If the Minister has his way, on his notions of advertising, we will be spelling out the loss of jobs in RTE, we will be dismissing people from their employment, we will be rescinding contracts.  That is the direct import of the Minister's concept in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might quote briefly from the most recent edition of <i>RTE News,</i> described <Col N="500" /> as being issued by the Public Affairs Division of RTE and which carries the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Authority itself:</P>
    <P>To achieve the cutbacks necessary to stay within the proposed revenue budget and continue to meet the fundamental obligations of meeting our costs and providing for capital proposed in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 it will be necessary to achieve the £10 million cutbacks and, since so much of the expenditure is on employment, then it follows, with regret, that jobs and work opportunities will be lost.  No other solution is possible on the basis of the revenue restrictions in the Broadcasting Bill, 1990 as it does not offer RTE any future opportunity of recovering the revenue lost.</P>
    <P>Therefore, any Minister who suggests that what he is proposing will not have the effect of leading to job losses, the ending of contracts of people engaged independently by the Authority does not understand his Bill, does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    <P>Reverting to 2FM and the impact of the loss of revenue and of commercial viability, the Minister's notion of including sponsorship and self-promotion within the definition of advertising he intends introducing will mean the ending of all those outside operations and community services.  Effectively it will also mean the end of all the contracts of disc jockeys and presenters currently employed, which include all of those wellknown, household names I need not mention.I am glad to note that Deputy Cowen knows something of what goes on on 2FM and, in time, will come to their aid.  What the Minister is doing will mean the end of the presenter who is the originator of &ldquo;Zig and Zag&rdquo;.  If the Deputy does not understand the implications of that for the thousands of people who daily enjoy the entertainment provided by that programme, like the Minister he knows nothing about broadcasting or of the daily services provided by RTE.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Zig and Zag&rdquo; is probably one of the most educational programmes provided by any broadcasting station, not only in this country but in these isles.  Because that programme is the property of an independent contractor employed by RTE and because RTE have no capacity to make up the revenue being lost other than to cut back on jobs, the people in the first line of fire are the independent DJs, contractors and presenters employed by RTE at present. Those are the implications and whether or not the Deputy can live with that remains to be seen during the course of this debate.  He should not interject with facetious heckles in the hope that there will be some serious impact on this discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the impact on revenue in terms of advertising we are seeking in our amendment to address this issue.  The revenue position in RTE is not understood by the Minister or by Fianna Fáil.  It was understood by the Progressive Democrats but they were not here for the earlier debates on this matter and they are absent from the Chamber today.  The income for RTE in 1991 is projected at a maximum of £93.6 million, on the basis that their licence fee revenue is to be realised at £46.81 million.  Under the Bill they will be allowed the equivalent of that by way of advertisements and if they earn any more than that they will be penalised in the coming year.  Of that £93.6 million, £51.4 million will go towards salaries, unless of course jobs are shed.  The cost of operating the station in terms of programmes shown and of bringing in outside contractors is estimated at £44.373 million and other expenses such as VAT, interest charges and so on are estimated at £6.65 million. Therefore their expenditure is estimated at £102 million for the coming year. Immediately they are running at a loss and will have to cut back by £10 million for the coming year.  There is no other way out.  Of the £44.373 million to which <Col N="502" /> I have referred, 50 per cent or more will go in salaries or in payment of contracts to people employed in outside work.  Of the £90 million per annum received by RTE, over £70 million &mdash; seven-ninths of the entire revenue &mdash; is paid directly towards salaries or contract prices.  That helps in some way to show the very narrow base of operation on which RTE have to work.</P>
      <P>In 1985 Stokes Kennedy Crowley reported on the cost effectiveness of RTE as a commercial operation and the RTE Authority duly responded.  During the period 1985 to 1989, the number of jobs in RTE was cut back drastically to facilitate the demands made on them as a result of the findings in the report.  In particular, as I have indicated &mdash; I would just draw the attention of the House to this &mdash; there was an overall drop in employment of 7 per cent, from 2,247 to 2,107.  There was a decrease in permanent staff of 17 per cent, while on the other hand there was a consequent rise in the number of outside contractors.  The move was in the direction of bringing in people on a short-term contract service basis, people such as presenters and DJs who work in 2 FM and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The RTE Authority are working well within their budget &mdash; and should be allowed do so &mdash; and are delivering an excellent service.  However, what is being proposed here by the Minister is so draconian that he must be curtailed in regard to his intentions to include promotional material broadcast by the Authority within their own service and, indeed, other sponsorship activities outside the station such as those provided by 2FM, as I have illustrated.  A central point made by RTE management is that it is all very well to tell them they must curtail their advertising revenue but they should at least be allowed the opportunity to fight back and in some way make up the loss.  If the Minister is going to introduce heavy handed and draconian restrictions &mdash; they are unworkable and I am completely opposed to them &mdash; he should at least give RTE the capacity to try to redress the loss in another area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the Minister propose in that <Col N="503" /> regard?  He told RTE that if they earn over the limit or if they make progress commercially in another field, they will be penalised in the following year by a reduction in the licence fee.  From the point of view of the commerciality of RTE, that is disastrous.  It means there is no incentive whatever for RTE to develop on what they have been doing successfully since 1985 when Stokes Kennedy Crowley reported, that is running as a commercial operation.  What will happen is that An Post will collect the licence fees and RTE will then simply multiply the total figure by two, open up their advertising opportunities, level their charges to that rate and take in the equivalent of the licence fee.  At that point they will not earn another penny because if they do, they will be penalised in the coming year.  Therefore the Progressive Democrats concept of the commerciality of RTE as a semi-State body is gone entirely.  The Minister must recognise that would be disastrous.  He is making the operations of RTE much more draconian and divisive by refusing to exclude from advertising and other such operations the self-promotional activities of RTE in terms of their cross-service promotions and their outside operations, such as those I have decribed with regard to 2FM.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he intends to include cross-service promotions &mdash; that is not some fanciful idea on my part &mdash; and he gave the example of RTE promoting their radio and television services.  Likewise he talked about the promotion of commercial activities such as the <i>RTE Guide</i> and the video set compilations and is going to insist that they be counted as advertising.  The Minister also talked about a number of current practices in this area that do not count as advertising for time limited purposes and intends to include them.  He then went on to talk about the whole area of prizes on programmes and said he would ensure that they would be included, for the reason that they are exploitive of the public.  I am thinking particularly of the programme &ldquo;Both Sides Now&rdquo; on RTE radio, where <Col N="504" /> an attempt is made to address the huge community of people who are living, out of necessity, in Britain and who are given the opportunity, through answering three questions, of winning a ticket home or a ticket to Britain.  A very good service is being provided to the displaced community of Irish people living in Britain. Equally, there is a spin-off opportunity for RTE to promote the Irish B &amp; I shipping and passenger company.  The Minister said there is something inherently wrong in all of this and that they are exploitive of the public.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to illustrate those programmes, on whatever radio station or television programme he is talking about, that are so overbearing that they blur the distinction between a programme proper and advertising. Where are they?  There has been a long tradition in advertising of the involvement of the public and the private sector with programmes in RTE.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us about them so that we know exactly what he is talking about.</P>

      <P>I do not have much <Col N="505" /> longer to go.  I want to deal with this point because it is important.  The transmission of the &ldquo;Eurovision Song Contest&rdquo; simply could not take place in the future &mdash; whenever Ireland wins that competition &mdash; without commercial sponsorship involvement.  The funds necessary to promote such a function would dry up hours of RTE advertising time if the Minister's concept of advertising is allowed to proceed in the context of what he proposed in his speech and what he intends to do under the powers available to him under section 5.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should get clear answer to these questions &mdash; general questions in terms of RTE's viability and particular questions in regard to some of the more glowing of programmes, of which the &ldquo;Eurovision Song Contest&rdquo; is one of many.  It is crucial that we are allowed, by means of this debate, to insert in the legislation a specific provision that advertising, for the purposes of the Minister's intention cannot and should not include those promotional advertisements broadcast by the authority within its own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting its own commercial services.  I am sorry if it appears to the Chair that I am moving in a broad way through the services which RTE provide, but I am working in the dark.  We invited the Minister to respond to the amendment.  He got up and in less than two minutes made three points.  He gave us no illustration whatever of the import of what he was talking about.  He did not seek to discuss in any way his concepts of advertising, he simply dismissed the issue.  We are seeking to raise with the Minister and to draw out of him some idea of his intentions, from his point of view, in regard to the code of practice regarding advertising.  This would give us a clearer indication of the urgency with which we should pursue this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the Minister's response, which was quick, brief and dismissive I am even more concerned now about the urgency <Col N="506" /> of what we are trying to achieve in this amendment.  The Minister's overall proposals represent a huge step backwards in regard to the commercial progress of RTE.  That is gone.  Because the Minister, by his devices, sought to introduce an artificial financial straitjacket on that organisation that means that at the end of the day RTE will simply revert back to the old days when it simply existed in an unreal world exercising none of the vitality we have come to know in more recent days, which will spell disaster for RTE as a public broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>For that reason we are anxious to know what exactly are the Minister's intentions in regard to his concept of advertising.  In regard to his initial response, we in The Workers' Party do not accept that what we are proposing is contrary to common sense.  The Minister sought to introduce a formula regarding advertising in the original Bill as circulated.  We have said to the Minister &mdash; and we would make the point again &mdash; that it is not open to him to suggest that anyone is being restrictive in regard to the functions of the RTE authority when the Minister has been the most restrictive Minister in the history of broadcasting.  We argue that the acceptance of our amendment would go towards his philosophical concept of the level playing pitch because it would allow RTE and their services to do exactly what other areas of the media &mdash; particularly the print media &mdash; do at present regarding their own promotional activities and their own services.  They would be doing no more than any of the independent and commercial stations would do once we establish how deeply the fingers of these people are stuck into the pies of the various outlets of broadcasting in this State.  There is no doubt that when the designs of the Independent Newspapers and Mr. O'Reilly come to fruition or when the operations of the Smurfit interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  When all of that comes home to roost we will have independent commercial networks of control far greater, far more intricate and much more manipulative of media broadcasting in this country than RTE has ever had or would ever hope to have. I do not see anything in the Minister's proposed legislation that would give him power or authority to level that playing pitch at that stage regarding the concept of advertising, cross commercial reference or promotion of its otherwise commercial activities.</P>
      <P>In summary The Workers' Party reject the arguments advanced by the Minister that our amendment is not worthy of consideration by him.  We urge him, for all the reasons advanced and in the earnest hope that some regard will be paid to the future viability, commerciality and creativity of the broadcasting authority, to reconsider his position and accept what we believe is an eminently, reasonable and acceptable amendment to his disastrous and draconian legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with a great deal of interest to the points made by Deputy De Rossa most of which deserve consideration.  However I have to say, and this is central to this debate, that I do not agree with his comments on the newspapers.  Those of us in public life depend on the newspapers and have the choice of either being craven, seeking the indulgence of the newspapers, or being honestly critical.  Indeed, Deputy McCartan was perhaps fairly or unfairly, somewhat critical of the newspapers.  Let me mention in passing that I proposed an amendment to rename the Bill the Broadcasting and Newspapers Bill but this was ruled out of order.  The reason I proposed that amendment is that the only merit the Bill may have is that the Minister may genuinely believe, although it is hard to know what exactly the Minister genuinely believes from one day to the next, that the Bill will divert revenue to the newspapers.  He would be wrong to do so.  There is considerable evidence that what the Minister is proposing would have the effect of completely hampering <Col N="508" /> RTE, which is what the Minister promised he would do during the last general election campaign with the excess revenue being diverted out of the State, which would not be to anybody's benefit.</P>
      <P>This is not to say that our newspapers are not confronted with a problem.  There is a problem to be addressed and I have said this consistently but before going on to deal with it in detail I wish to point out that we have to acknowledge that the question of advertising cannot be divorced from the question of the licence fee and other earnings.  These questions along with the question of competition have to be considered together.  RTE are not just competing with Century Radio or the local radio stations but also with mammoth organisations such as ITV, the BBC, Sky Television, Eurosport and many others who have greater resources than RTE.  Therefore RTE face both internal and external competition.  Likewise, our newspapers who also have to depend on advertising revenue apart from the cover charge, have to compete with newspapers from abroad.  That is where the playing pitch needs to be levelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish newspapers have to charge VAT at a rate of 23 per cent on advertising, while newspapers in the United Kingdom charge a rate of 15 per cent.  Irish newspapers also have to pay VAT at a rate of 10 per cent on their cover charge, while newspapers in the United Kingdom do not have to pay any.  It is clear therefore that our newspapers are at an enormous disadvantage compared with newspapers based outside the State.  We are all aware that many newspapers based in Britain have a significant circulation in this State. We are also aware that they are being sold at prices much lower than those being charged for our newspapers.  I submit that my amendment which has been ruled out of order is central to the Bill because the only remaining purpose in introducing this part of the Bill, if it is the purpose, is to divert funds to the newspapers.  The newspapers in their editorials on 30 March, the day after the Minister made his levelling-the-playing-pitch speech in Cork, widely welcomed <Col N="509" /> his proposals even though they were not clearly spelled out that day.</P>
    <P>I met representatives of the national newspapers of Ireland the following week and told them that they were mistaken, that they were confronted with a problem but that this could not possibly be the way to deal with it.  Let us reflect for a moment on what may be the Minister's thinking behind this proposal.  We have to bear in mind that the Minister has introduced two broadcasting Bills, the first is the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill &mdash; the Bill I drafted &mdash; which was enacted without change, while the second is the Sound Broadcasting Bill which became known as the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  The day that Bill was published the Minister had to change his mind because of the furore and uproar which ensued about his proposal to grant the licences himself to the commercial radio sector.  Before the ink was dry he had to capitulate and promised to bring in amendments on Committee Stage to change the substance of the Bill.  We are now witnessing exactly the same performance.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not prepared to stand over the Bill as published because he never gave it due consideration to begin with.  It also seems that he has paid the revised proposals the same scant attention paid to the first set of proposals.  This Bill is called the Broadcasting Bill but what is it?  Does it contain anything which would be of help to broadcasting, be it the independent sector or RTE or both? Does the Bill merit the title the Broadcasting Bill?  The &ldquo;Anti-Broadcasting Bill&rdquo; would be a more appropriate title.</P>
    <P>Despite repeated requests, the Minister refused to meet the Association of Advertisers in Ireland, the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and some of the other people in the field who wished to meet him before he drafted the Bill.  If he had met them he would not have come up with the first set of draft proposals or the second set of draft proposals because he would have become aware, from what they would have had to tell him, of the implications of his <Col N="510" /> proposals, particularly those relating to advertising.  I ask the Minister to indicate why he refused to meet the practitioners in the field of advertising to discuss with them the issues concerned.  Why the mad rush?  The original intention in introducing the Bill was to save Century Radio, the Minister's own creation, but that has disappeared.  There is nothing in the latest set of proposals which could be used to throw a lifebuoy to Century Radio.</P>
    <P>This debate started on 12 February in Cork when I disclosed that the Minister had sent his senior officials to RTE, not once but several times, to discuss the proposal to divert funds from RTE to the independent sector.  In a one line statement from his Department that day he denied that there was any foundation to what I had said.  I ask the Minister to repeat that prior to 12 February none of his officials, acting under his instruction, discussed with RTE proposals to divert money.  Does he still stand over his announcement on 12 February that no such proposals were made?  Would he let his officials appear before the Committee of Public Acounts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Advertising is one source of funding for the media.  In the case of broadcasting there is also a licence fee and other earnings and in the case of the print media there is a cover change. The two areas cannot be split because they both depend on the advertising revenue pool.  That pool is not something around which a wall can be built because it links into the pool in Northern Ireland and Britain.  The whole question of funding is extremely complex.  It is like a rubic cube &mdash; move one little square and you disturb all the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the proposals before the House were not clearly thought out.  They are a rushed reaction to pressure.  Who does the Minister think will benefit as a result of diverting advertising revenue from RTE?  On what did the Minister base his reasoning?  Did he base it on discussions with the Association of Advertisers in Ireland or the Institute of Advertising Practitioners?  He did not, because, like his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, leader of the Progressive Democrats and champion of private enterprise, he refused to meet them.  Not once or twice but three times the Government made rushed decisions without the benefit of professional advice.  If what I am saying is inaccurate I ask the Minister to say with whom in <Col N="513" /> the advertising world, the university faculty of communications, or such organisations did he discuss these plans and on what advice did he base his proposals?</P>
    <P>It is very clear that this Bill like the original Bill in 1987, was a rushed Bill and now as then, as a result of capitulation, we are discussing virtually a new Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan commented on newspapers.  I do not agree with him that there has been a deterioration in the standard of newspapers.  In the few years some excellent newspapers have been published, for example, <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> compare favourably with newspapers elsewhere.  The <i>Irish Independent, The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> are all of a very high standard and cover many issues.  Although newspapers coverage in general has increased, coverage of this House has diminished though that may not be the fault of the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I have a bar chart, which is an estimate from 1981 to the current year showing the amount of licence fee compared to advertising revenue.  We can see at a glance that the relationship between the licence fee and advertising revenue has remained fairly constant.  There has not been any dramatic change in the ratio.  It is very much as it was ten years ago, with slight aberrations here and there.  RTE have to use that income to compete with the BBC and ITV.  This is very real competition which will not diminish with the passage of time but will increase because of the increasing penetration of cable, the extension of MMDS and the increasing availability of direct broadcasting satellities.RTE, in order to cope with this increased competition are to have their total income reduced dramatically in a few months in one fell swoop.</P>
    <P>Even if the decision to reduce it by that amount was justified, no major business enterprise here or abroad would approach its business in that way.  It is reminiscent of the way the Government of this State dealt with CIE every year. We told CIE in the last few days of December every year that their subvention for the following year was to be <Col N="514" /> cut by £20 million.  It was totally unrealistic, as CIE and the Department knew. Of course, CIE's deficit went up year after year and the Government did not learn the lesson until 1983.  From 1969 to 1982 the CIE deficit went from £2.5 million to £109.5 million, an increase which was seven times the rate of inflation, because of the absurd approach by Government.</P>
    <P>In 1983, when I was Minister for Transport and Communications, we persuaded the Government to change the approach to the State Sector.  There were to be new five-year corporate plans and budgets to be submitted in advance, subhead by subhead, so that we would know what we were approving and the genuine cost.  We could compare every four weeks performance against the budget.  We also stopped interfering in the day-to-day affairs of State companies and stopped making political appointments, making political cumainn out of State boards. As a result, by 1987 almost every State company was making a profit, including RTE, while all of them were loss-making in 1982.  Here we are back to the bad old days.  The RTE Authority, the Independent Radio and Television Authority and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission are loaded with Fianna Fáil nominees.</P>

We are back to political appointments and interference and back to making unrealistic financial demands and setting impossible financial targets for a State company.  This will not work for RTE, for the independent broadcasting sector or the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my preparation for debate on this Bill I had discussions with the newspapers, advertising practitioners, the Advertising Standards Association and the Association of Advertisers, among many others.  One possible area where the newspapers might pick up a bit of money diverted from RTE is the area of <Col N="515" /> colour advertising.  I am reliably told, however, that in many of the newspapers colour advertising space up to next Christmas is already booked out.  The newspapers will know whether that is accurate.  Where is the money to be diverted to?  We have no TV3 to pick it up.  The Minister said two years ago he hoped TV3 would be up and running by the end of 1988.  Then he said it would be summer 1989, then Christmas of that year.  Then he said it would be summer 1990 and in a recent speech he said he expects TV3 to be operating by the end of 1990.  I should like the Minister's latest estimate of when TV3 will be up and running.  If they were operating there would at least be some electronic medium based in this State who might pick up some of the funds diverted from RTE.  I guess it will not be operating this time next year.  If it is up and running by Christmas 1991 I will be agreeably surprised.Yet we are to divert all this advertising revenue from RTE and make it impossible for RTE to continue.  The revenue cannot go towards colour advertising in the newspapers since the space is booked out and TV3 is not in operation. What is the Minister at?  Is his only motivation that which he threatened on the night of the election count, that he would sort RTE personal out?  Maybe the Minister would care to deny that he made such a threat off the air to RTE personnel on election night.</P>
    <P>Apart from the note from his Department on 12 February last in reply to my speech in Cork in which he denied that there was any such plan, the Minister replied in this House on 27 February to a question tabled by me.  It is reported at column 544 in the Official Report of 27 February 1990 as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Mitchell asked the Minister for Communications the steps, if any, he has taken to explore possible methods of financial assistance or a financial injection under any guide to any independent radio station.</P>
    <P>Mr. Burke: ...Neither I nor my Department have made any proposals, <Col N="516" /> formal or informal, to RTE to divert income to any independent radio station.</P>
    <P>On 29 March last at 9.30 a.m. the Minister addressed the Institute of Advertising Practitioners' media conference in Jury's Hotel and said:</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Institute for giving me the honour of making the opening address at your conference.</P>
    <P>This is the institute which he subsequently refused to meet before the publication of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be here not least because the loosening of your purse strings in favour of the new independent broadcasting sector would be a significant factor in its future development and I would hope this morning to be able to encourage you to do just that.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to explain to me how he proposes to help under this Bill, as he proposes to amend it, the independent broadcasting sector.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is indeed heartening that much of the agenda for your conference is devoted to recent broadcasting developments and I would expect that, arising out of your deliberations on the subject, you all will be persuaded to look more closely at what the sector has to offer.  Collectively advertising agencies have a very substantial spend at their disposal each year.  I believe that for the year just ended advertising revenue was of the order of £180 million.  Of course, the vast bulk of that amount would pass through advertising agencies, so it is certainly not an understatement to say that you are a pretty powerful group indeed.</P>

      <P>Here is a speech by the Minister in Cork about advertising and it is very pertinent.  A month afterwards he denied in this House that he had any such intention.  I know for a fact he already had proposals made to RTE in January and early February.  I have already challenged him to allow his officials to appear before the Committee <Col N="518" /> of public Accounts and be cross-examined and give them full freedom to answer questions.  If those officials have full freedom to answer questions I feel the Minister will be in a very embarrassing situation indeed.</P>
      <P>On 26 March, one month after he denied in this House that there were such plans, six weeks after he originally denied my revelation, he comes now and barefacedly admits after six weeks denying it, inside and outside the House, that he has plans.  The Minister has not the courage to come into the House and make a personal statement.  He has no clear plans.  He is oscillating from one idea to another with no firm foundation for those plans and no firm advice from the people who know about these things. Therefore, I have no hesitation whatever in reading into the record what the Minister said in Cork on 29 March having twice denied in the previous six weeks the very content of that speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A Minister who treats the House in that way deserves to be in the trouble he is in with this legislation. He told these people they were a pretty powerful group &mdash; so powerful he would not even see them afterwards to discuss his proposals.  He has refused repeated requests to see them, as has the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He went on to say that broadcasting already accounts for 40 per cent of total advertising expenditure in this country.  Up to now, of course, broadcasting meant RTE.  He said it was hoped that the availability of new independent services and the proposed new TV services would result in a real expansion of the advertising take. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly proud to have played the central role in having the necessary broadcasting legislation enacted in the Oireachtas.  You will all be aware of the troubled history of that legislation as it rose and fell over the <Col N="519" /> ten years from 1978 when it was first mooted until it was passed into law in July 1988.</P>
    <P>It was troubled since 1988.  Well, it is still troubled and I guess if it passes this House and the other House and if the Minister makes the order provided for under section 4, it will continue to be troubled for a long time to come.  The next line is particularly juicy:</P>
    <P>Indeed, most of you will also be acutely aware of the uncertainty that existed.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty was caused in the advertising world by the turbulence in the radio scene.  What has the Minister done with his proposals of the last few weeks?  He went on to say on 29 March:</P>
    <P>Thankfully, those days are well behind us now and we can, I believe, look forward to a period of sustained growth in the independent sector.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the legislation the regime provided under the Radio and Television Act, 1988 for the establishment of legal independent broadcasting came fully into effect. Progress has continued apace and within a very short period of time 17 local stations and the new independent national station have come on air.  I am hopeful that the independent national service will commence broadcasting before 1990 is out.</P>
    <P>We have six months to go.  He continued:</P>
    <P>By any standards these are significant developments and there is tremendous potential there from the point of view of advertisers.  For the first time in this country there is a real alternative to RTE.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister not accept that he has reintroduced this uncertainty which, on 29 March, he said he got rid of?  He talks about a real alternative to RTE.  Will he not accept that there is serious doubt about TV3, at least this year?  We all know the serious doubt about Century Radio.  By Christmas 1990, to which he <Col N="520" /> referred, how many of the existing independent stations will have closed and how many of them will be helped by what is proposed in the advertising section of this Bill?</P>

      <P>I met the Association of Advertisers in Ireland Ltd. twice recently.  I was amazed when they told me the Minister had not met them and further amazed to learn at my second meeting with them that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not met them.  I would have thought the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister responsible for competition, prices and inflation, would have had a very acute interest in meeting trade associations who have grave concerns and could be gravely affected by what the Minister proposes in relation to the capping of <Col N="521" /> advertisements.  They wrote to me and in a letter dated 6 June stated:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Broadcasting Bill, 1990</P>
      <P>We enclose a copy of our Press Release relating to the above Bill and hope you will find this of interest to you.</P>
      <P>In addition to the points raised in the Release, we are especially concerned at the proposals embodied in Section 4 regarding RTE advertising revenue.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) is particularly dangerous in that any reduction in RTE advertising minutage will have the following effects:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a letter which refers to section 4; I am not directly referring to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the letter appears to refer to what is provided for in section 4 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am leading up to is that the definition of advertising which we are now talking about could be crucial to mitigating the disastrous impact of what the Minister proposed in section 4.  As you will see from this letter, Sir, they believe subsection (1) of section 4 is particularly dangerous in that any reduction in RTE advertising minutage will have the following effects, and I quote:</P>
      <P>(a)  a steep inflationary increase in TV advertising rates;</P>
      <P>&mdash;one would have thought the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have an interest in this if the Minister for Communications did not&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  loss of advertising revenue to outside TV channels i.e. UTV, Channel 4, SKY etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> They continue:</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) would be damaging in creating a first year inflationary effect. Capping thereafter would be counterproductive in stifling initiative in RTE to produce programming to attract quality audiences for advertisers.</P>
    <P>Even more worrying and of greater concern to me was the telephone call I received in my office today from the Association of Voluntary Charities who are extremely concerned on two fronts. Depending on the definition of advertising it may well be &mdash; they certainly believe it will be because of the restriction on advertising to four and a half minutes &mdash; that all slot advertising will be eliminated by RTE and these quick shot advertisements which charities, in particular, use will become unavailable.  This would mean that charities who do such excellent work will be eliminated from the airwaves and will not be able to advertise.The question is: does the definition of advertising, as defined by the Minister, include or exclude such slot advertising from the four and a half minutes limit?  I should like to give you notice, Sir, that if we ever get to Report Stage I intend putting down an amendment which will propose that the definition of advertising in section 4 will not include certain factors &mdash; it will certainly not include slot advertising for charities or the items referred to in The Workers' Party amendment.</P>
    <P>What else constitutes advertising?  Is it as simplistic as our reflective, thoughtful, kind and gentle Minister says it is?  Does it include covering a sports event such as a football match with advertising around the field or does that leave a new opening for a creative form of advertising whereby RTE can do a deal with sports associations for extra advertising in a sports field where RTE is covering a match?  For instance, &ldquo;Sunday Night at the Gaiety&rdquo; may become a very profitable venture with advertising around all those lovely walls so that it can be covered by television and instead of RTE having to pay the Gaiety for hiring the hall they will be delighted to pay RTE for covering <Col N="523" /> the event.  Is this included within the definition of advertising?</P>
    <P>Will the Smurfit, Goffs and Budweiser advertisements at race meetings at the Curragh or Leopardstown constitute advertising?  Will the All Ireland finals constitute advertising events?  Will RTE be forced to be extremely adroit in earning revenue from other sources which in reality are not advertising sources?  I think you can see, Sir, that the definition of advertising is not a simple one.</P>
    <P>The Association of Advertisers in Ireland are not the only professional organisation who are concerned about the cap on advertising and what constitutes advertising.  They quantify the inflationary impact, as they see it, of the Minister's proposals.  They believe they will push up advertising costs by 30 per cent, ten times the annual national average, cripple the marketing efforts of smaller companies, many of them Irish owned, lead to substantial job losses in RTE, film production companies, facility houses and advertising agencies, reduce work and opportunities for services and supplies and lead to job losses in manufacturing and distribution as smaller companies will lose home market share because of hampered marketing opportunities.In addition they believe their chances of taking advantage of opportunities arising from the Single Market will be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>On whose advice is the Minister acting?  On the basis of what research are his proposals put forward, or is he merely proposing something out of vindictive malice, as many people suspect?  If he is not, I ask him to tell us the basis of his proposals.  Why should he include in the definition of advertising in-house announcements, cross-station announcements, which, as Deputy McCartan said, are normal among newspaper groups who advertise what is coming up in their Sunday, Monday or evening edition quite naturally?  Before we leave the definition of advertising we need to hear a much more extensive reply from the Minister. When did he start thinking about this issue?  When did he call in the officials of <Col N="524" /> his Department and have a discussion about diverting income from RTE?  Was it the day before 29 March, or was it before 12 February when he denied it? How many months consideration has been given to this question?  What research was carried out on this?  What advice did the Minister seek?  What competence exists in his Department to analyse the whole question of funding and advertising?  Did the Minister seek advice from outside the Department?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to tell the House when he circulated the memorandum to other Government Departments.  What did the memorandum contain?  What additions or subtractions have been made to it since? What preliminary consideration was given by the Cabinet to the Minister's proposals or are we to believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce who told us that certain shortcuts had been taken?  What shortcuts was the Minister for Industry and Commerce talking about?  If shortcuts were taken I should like to know how the new proposals, issued within three days, could not have been subjected to more shortcuts.  What discussions took place with other Departments and for how long did they last?</P>

      <P>The Labour Party will be supporting the amendment for a number of reasons.  The amendment addresses a very central issue in relation to advertising.  The Minister rather dismissively dealt with it in his few brief words of reply and said that the meaning of the word is &ldquo;well known&rdquo;.  Let us be very clear about why it is important to know that advertising, as we are encountering it in the amendment, is not advertising as is &ldquo;well known&rdquo;.  It is advertising that will be defined in terms of its limit by a Minister.  We are referring to advertising within a company that has established itself in public service broadcasting as a competitive and profitable company with trade and services.  That company will be uniquely set apart by having its advertising controlled.  We are talking about advertising in another sense, advertising which the Minister will put a limit on.</P>
      <P>The Minister is uniquely taking RTE and making them unable to compete thereby putting into jeopardy a whole series of different commercial activities which RTE were asked to get involved in by concerns such as Stokes, Kennedy and Crowley.  There are questions to be answered as to the motivation of politicians who refuse to let innovation and technology by part of RTE's remit.  It is important to bear in mind that seven of UTV's top clients are among the top ten advertisers in RTE.  The Minister is saying that he will take the statutory power to take advertising from the visual media and he will not bother to ask whether it can be shifted to the aural medium or the print medium.  He is saying that he will keep it in reserve just in case TV3 might work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said it was his hope that TV3 will be up <Col N="528" /> and running at an early stage and that this service, combined with other Irish media, will absorb the diverted revenues. In the interim he is endangering the jobs of those who are in the drama department, of those involved in the preparation of advertisements and of those involved in selling commercial services to RTE.  He is endangering all the different commercial services which were established under the instructions of the IDA and were, supposedly, favourably viewed by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It did not occur to him that the IDA were telling RTE to get involved in setting up a commercial technical division so that they could sell their services.  The Minister referred to this extraordinary so-called level playing field, the marketplace that says that a company that made itself competitive must be levelled.  What kind of market economics is that?  The Minister screeched in and said that he was taking statutory responsibility to limit the station's income so that other people who may come along will have an artificial economic environment.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned last night I was making the point that the lottery funds will continue to be disbursed in the manner most politically advantageous to Fianna Fáil.  That is not new and there is no reason to believe that any of the minor changes in the scheme which have been brought in will change that one iota.  There have <Col N="530" /> been some trimmings round the edges of the scheme but the bottom line remains, that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, has retained unto himself the sole authority and power to disburse the lottery grant money to all applicants. It is ridiculous when one thinks about it &mdash; 4,000 applications to be dealt with by the Minister's office and to be disbursed by him alone, when local authorities who are involved in the counties and towns have knowledge of their areas which they could usefully apply to making an assessment which would be fair, just and equitable.I do not say that that would be a perfect system but it would at least appear to be just and equitable.</P>
      <P>On what basis will the Minister distribute the funds to the 4,000 applicants? Has he laid down any criteria?  Will any conditions or tests be applied?  All the arguments which roundly condemned the system of leaving the power in the hands of the Minister for the Environment and which were so forcefully made on the Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Harney still apply.  Nothing has changed in that regard.  It is incredibly cynical of the Minister, Deputy Molloy, to come into the House and say that what happened in the meantime has made all the difference to the position which the Progressive Democrats Party will take on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Molloy, said last night that at least the new measures would bring some transparency to the situation.The only transparent thing I can see is the about-turn which the Progressive Democrats have made for no other reason except that they hold Cabinet positions as part of the Coalition Government.Their attitude is a pathetic apologia for what is going on; it is an immortal situation, the kind that brings politics and politicians into disrepute.  It must be accepted that the regard and esteem in which politicians are held is at a very low level and the conduct on the question of disbursement of lottery funds is the kind of thing that brings this House and politicians into disrepute.  It is time that we introduced morality to the issue and we should realise that local involvement is <Col N="531" /> essential for the effective disbursement of funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the motion, I should like to make one observation regarding the conduct of the national lottery: I have serious reservations regarding the introduction of a Wednesday lotto as well as the existing Saturday draw.  My reservations are based on the fact that quite a lot of people choose the same numbers week in, week out.  Many of them are on very low incomes as they are unemployed or senior citizens.  There is now very strong pressure on them to participate twice in the one week because of the fear that their numbers could come up on the Wednesday, with the result that they would lose their golden chance.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a very substantial sum of money.  The surplus from the national lottery in 1987 was £42 million; in 1988 it was £37 million and in 1989 it was £44 million.  As Deputy Taylor said, none of us knows what criteria are involved in disbursing the money, but I strongly feel that the local authorities are in the best position to assess the needs and projects which deserve funding, as they are close to the people.  The Minister is laughing but, nevertheless, I am speaking the truth.  Local councillors are accountable to the people and they receive representations from them.  As the Minister said last night, some of these representations are passed on by public representatives.  I accuse the Minister of indulging in a very cynical exercise last year &mdash; and early this year &mdash; of sending forward the lists of projects for approval because the false impression was created that the local authorities had some say in how this money might be disbursed.  In fact, the various applications were forwarded to the local authorities who sent them on to the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people were under the mistaken impression that the local authorities could prioritise the applications but that was not the case.  The list was sent from each local authority and 4,000 applications are involved.  With the best will <Col N="532" /> in the world how can the staff in the Minister's Department process those applications objectively in terms of local need?  It just cannot be done.  Obviously what will happen is that political decisions favourable to the Government will be taken with regard to the allocation of national lottery moneys.  Indeed, one wonders why we have not seen lottery moneys for quite some time.  It is a long time since allocations were made.  I must stress that while money is being allocated on criteria of which even we, the Members of this House, are not aware, at the very best that constitutes strong grounds for suspicion.  At worst &mdash; which is the real position &mdash; political decisions will be taken by the parties in power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor spoke of the profound change in attitude emanating from the Progressive Democrats now that they have seats at the Cabinet table; accountability, democracy and equity of distribution no longer appear to be the prevailing criteria.  Now the attitude is, we are in Coalition we will go along with such decisions and, if there is political advantage to be gained from the manner in which national lottery moneys are allocated, so be it.</P>
    <P>There is a recommendation in the interim report relating to sports grants, a proposal that the VECs should disburse such grants.  There is a lot of sense in that proposal because the VECs have been doing so over many years; they have been disbursing youth and sport grants.  The VECs now have youth committees with representatives of the various youth organisations within their areas.  These VECs have garnered a great deal of experience over the years and have undertaken, at first hand, a comprehensive assessment of what are their local needs.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to all of this exercise are the words &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;, both of which should be made abundantly clear and visible to everybody.This Government are not prepared to ensure that that is the case.  Therefore, the motion before the House calling on them to do so is deserving of all our support.  Nonetheless, when it comes to <Col N="533" /> voting, the Government party Members will troop through the lobbies, supporting the <i>status quo.</i>  I am sure they perceive the opportunity as a welcome electoral addition in the forthcoming Presidential election and in the local elections if they take place next year, as scheduled.</P>
    <P>One final point I might make is relevant to other discussions which took place in the House today, that is with regard to the Taoiseach's commitment to establish Telefís na Gaeltachta.  One of the recommendations of the all-party committee in this respect was that national lottery allocations for once-off projects in the Irish language area should continue to be administered by Roinn na Gaeltachta. The fact that that Department are at present promoting Telefís na Gaeltachta, seeking subventions from RTE and the national lottery, means that the interest of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party in the Irish language has been shown for what it is.  Moneys from the national lottery going to that service will not become a reality because &mdash; bearing in mind the measures now being implemented against RTE &mdash; they will not have the wherewithal to set up this important station which, in many ways, will represent the last chance for the Irish language.  There is no doubt that the Irish language is in decline in the Gaeltachtaí. It is all the more important that young children there have available to them Irish language programmes properly and professionally produced rather than be exposed continuously to English language programmes.  We are talking about a two-hour daily service.  I shall conclude and allow my colleague, Deputy Ryan, to contribute.</P>

      <P>Once again the Government have failed to listen to the people's voices.  In the run-up to and following the last allocation of national lottery funds people were appalled, and rightly so, that the Government of the day had used national lottery funds in a political manner.  In fact, they have not been the only Government to have done so.  The clear impression was given that, if a local organisation submitted an application through their local politician, whether he be a Minister, TD, or councillor, it would be successful.  That was a scandalous position, leading to highly organised pressure groups and so on.  We have seen golf clubs throughout the country receive national lottery funding while many local groups in deprived areas, particularly in those with high unemployment, were left without any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister maintains that he has improved the position.  That may be his view but is not the case.  I would not be in favour of giving priority to any application if, at the end of the day, it was left to the Minister to make the final decision.  Pending the next allocation I regret that members of Fianna Fáil nationwide have been asked to identify suitable groupings in their areas.  That is morally wrong, should not be allowed to <Col N="535" /> continue.  The only way in which to deal with it, to remove the suspicion of political patronage from any allocation, is to establish an independent committee to adjudicate and recommend such allocations in a fair, impartial way.</P>

      <P>Since its launch in 1987, the national lottery has gone from strength to strength.  Public enthusiasm for participation in national lottery games, encouraged by good marketing and product development, has ensured its continued success.  Last year the company recorded sales in excess of £140 million.  This represented an increase of 27 per cent, on the previous year.  Over the past three years hundreds of thousands of adults from every part of Ireland have won prizes totalling £160 million.</P>
      <P>The success of the national lottery is measured not on sales alone, but on the benefits to the Irish community which arise from people's participation in the national lottery.  In order to sustain that success, the business must be carried out in a way which reassures players that the integrity, accountability and professionalism of the operation is beyond question.  The national lottery's success in achieving these objectives is reflected in the fact that the people are now comfortable with the games and service provided by the national lottery.  It is particularly noteworthy that the performance of the lottery has received recognition from state lotteries throughout the world.  Over the past three years representatives from state lotteries as far away as New Zealand and as near as France, have all visited the national lottery to examine and, in some cases, copy the systems and procedures in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the national lottery is to generate funding to support <Col N="536" /> programmes which have been designated in accordance with the procedures set out in the National Lottery Act, 1986.  In this the lottery has succeeded on a scale well beyond our most optimistic expectations. As I indicated in a reply to parliamentary questions in the Dáil yesterday, £101 million was paid out over the three-year period 1987-89 to approved projects.  This year the Government have announced further lottery allocations totalling £72 million.</P>
    <P>This adds up to a total commitment to-date of £173 million over the period 1987-90 for the following programmes: youth, sport and recreation &mdash; including amenities &mdash; £78 million; arts and culture and the national heritage, £48 million; the Irish language, £14 million; health and welfare, £32 million and Dublin Millennium, £1 million.</P>
    <P>To my mind this is the real success story of the lottery.  It should be a source of satisfaction to us all that, during a period of severe restraint on public spending, the operations of the lottery enabled us to allocate funds to support many worthwhile community-based projects throughout Ireland.  Details of each individual project assisted were published in a beneficiaries compendium which was published in February 1989. Deputies will be glad to learn that the updating of this compendium is now nearing completion and that a revised and expanded compendium will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>Let me select at random from the listing of approved projects to illustrate the very diversity of the lottery's interventions.In the realm of health and welfare, funds have been allocated to hundreds of projects dealing with the old and the mentally handicapped.  Does any member in this House suggest that that money should not have been allocated? Anyway it is not open to question.</P>

Ken Doherty, the world amateur snooker champion, Eoin Casey, the young tennis player, and Niall O'Toole, the rower, also received grants.  Practically every sporting organisation in Ireland has received an allocation from the national lottery.

It was following that debate that an all-party Dáil working committee was set up to advise the Government on the effective and accountability disbursal of the lottery surplus.  This committee recommended the following main changes in the procedures for allocating lottery <Col N="538" /> funds.

As regards recreational facilities, block grants should be made by the Department of Education to VECs, which would then decide on individual applications on the advice of their sports advisory groups.  As regards health, it was recommended that lottery funds should be administered by health boards who would receive block allocations from the Department of Health and would then deal with applications for voluntary and local bodies.  On welfare, the lottery-funded scheme of grants to voluntary bodies at present operated by the Department of Social Welfare should be administered by health boards who would receive block allocations determined by the Department of Health.  Grants for arts organisations should be allocated by the Arts Council. In other areas, the committee expressed themselves as being satisfied with existing arrangements.

      <P>Having reflected at length on these recommendations, the Government took the following decisions: (i) that the amenity grants scheme administered by the Department of the Environment and the recreational facilities grant scheme administered by the Department of Education should be amalgamated into a single scheme; that grants under this scheme would be allocated by the Minister for the Environment to projects recommended by local authorities, who would be responsible for processing applications; (ii) that the Minister for Health would allocate block grants to health boards, to be assigned by them to local voluntary bodies; national programmes funded from the lottery allocation for health purposes, such as the AIDS prevention programmes will continue to be operated by the Department of Health; (iii) that grants to voluntary bodies in the welfare area would continue to be administered by the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; I do not hear any complaints about that; (iv) the grants for the arts would be administered by the Arts Council with the exception of allocations to the arts falling within the areas of responsibility of: the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Commissioners of Public Works; and (v) as recommended by the working group, there was to be no change in existing arrangements for administering lottery funds allocated for youth, Irish language projects, and for current sports expenditure, while the <Col N="540" /> Minister for Education will retain responsibility for the national, regional and local sports centres.</P>
      <P>These decisions were announced by me in the Dáil on 24 October 1989.  Opposition speakers last evening focused on the arrangements for processing grants under the revised amenity grants-recreational facilities scheme.  It was singularly depressing to have to listen to a regurgitation of the same tired old arguments which were trotted out by them in November 1988.  They had nothing new to say, but this is hardly surprising as no grants have yet been announced under the new arrangements and they are not even prepared to wait to see how they operate in practice.</P>

The first one, and the one that seems to be causing all the political furore, is the question of the grants to be administered by his Department.  Did anybody in that committee give serious consideration to how the block grant was going to be devised? Had we not the experience of grants being allocated to local authorities in the previous Government, the Government who introduced the lottery, and what happened?  Were 11 local authorities not penalised?  They got nothing.  Did somebody seriously suggest to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There seems to be a determined effort here to ensure that the facts are not put on the record of the House.  I know the truth always hurts. While I am on this point, and I want to come to a conclusion as quickly as I can despite so much of my time being wasted. I would like to draw the attention of the Dáil to the arrangements I introduced this year to improve accountability for this system.  Since the inception of the national lottery in 1987, provision had been made for the spending of the national lottery surplus by means of a subhead in the Finance Vote, from which issues were made as required to suspense accounts operated by the spending departments.  This system was appropriate for a start but I have now introduced a change which makes it relevant, totally transparent and available for debate in the House.  I totally reject Deputy Taylor's assertion that this is a minor change. Now there will be greater transparency; the Book of Estimates show how lottery funds are being used; the Dáil votes on <Col N="544" /> the allocation of funds for the various purposes; there is greater accountability and Ministers and accounting officers responsible for spending programmes are clearly and fully responsible for the use of lottery funds, rather than having them accounted for by the Department of Finance.This change is reflected in the revised Estimates for the public service of 1990 and onwards.  That is transparency, that is accountability and that, indeed should suffice for any Member of the House who is interested in hearing the truth about the lottery.  We saw the experience of the previous Government. This Government would never try to attempt to play that game so I will share my time with Deputy Roche.</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Shatter now.  Last night Deputy Shatter had the brass neck to raise the issue of gombeenism.  I actually asked my local newspaper office to fax me on some material just to deal with the issue of gombeenism and Deputy Shatter and his antics.  It is not so long ago, November 1986 and I have a good memory that we had the spectacle in the constituency of Wicklow of a Minister dealing in the kind of politics that Deputy Shatter sought to impugn us for last night. The argument was made by Deputy Shatter and others &mdash; not only in this debate but in the previous debate in November 1988 &mdash; that Ministers on this side of the House had personalised the distribution of lottery funds.  Deputy Shatter in his contribution last night, much of which was drivel, dealt with the issue by referring to the whole distribution of lottery funds as gombeenism.  The same allegations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The charge has not been improved by being recycled.  That argument about gombeenism was untruthful but was deliberately put forward in November 1988, I said so here then and I say so again now.  It remains a deliberate untruthful distortion at this time.  The only difference is that anybody with a good memory would recognise that there is a certain irony in the allegation being made now by Fine Gael.  As it happens I have a good memory.  It is not so long ago in my own constituency that we had a disgraceful example of gombeenism.A Minister came into the constituency to deliver cheques to community groups.  This was not just a Minister being careful with public funds. This was not a Minister who was concerned about the post nor was it a Minister wanting to make sure that the community groups got their cheques on time.  This Minister instructed her departmental officials &mdash; public servants &mdash; that they should telephone the community groups in question and that they should arrange a series of &ldquo;cheque presentation ceremonies&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are issues relating to the lottery that should be dealt with in debate in this House.  I am concerned and, indeed, I compliment another speaker from the Labour Party in raising the question of the mid-week draw.  I am concerned, for example, about the fact that 77 million lottery scratch cards were imported here, that not one job was created here in that respect.  I am concerned about the social impact of the lottery.  Those are issues which should properly be dealt with in this House if we had sufficient time.  The facts are that the party opposite and Deputy Shatter in particular, are not in the least interested in the working of the lottery.  Lest I be portrayed as being a person who is opposed to the lottery or view it as being less than successful, I put <Col N="548" /> it on the record that I pay public tribute to those involved and will do so again next week when we publish our report on the lottery.  However, there are issues about the lottery which deserve serious debate.  A serious debate is something we would not have here because of the antics of Deputy Shatter and his cohort.  The fact is that over 90 per cent of the proceeds of the national lottery has been allocated without a political eyebrow being raised or concern being expressed. The Minister outlined the figures in some detail earlier tonight and I ask Deputy Shatter to indicate if he is concerned that 47 per cent, or £78 million, of the proceeds of the national lottery has been allocated under the heading of youth, sport and recreation.  I have no such concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy concerned that funds have been allocated under the heading of arts and culture and that £32 million has been allocated under the heading of health and welfare?  Again, I have no such concern.  A lot of nonsense and tripe was spoken about the national lottery.  I am a member of a local authority and I do not believe that any of the local authorities covered themselves in glory in the recent past.  They could have indicated that at least one scheme out of the 4,000 applications was not worthy of consideration.  I all probability there is at least one such scheme but all of them were endorsed with some of the bundles being sent back to the Department without coming under scrutiny.</P>

If the all-party committee felt very strongly about these issues, why then is the report strangely silent on them?  There is no indication as to how the block grant would be allocated among the local authorities.

      <P>The motion before us proposes that the national lottery moneys for amenity and community facilities should be allocated and distributed by the local authorities, as recommended by the all-party group in their report issued almost 18 months ago.  This was the approach favoured by the Progressive Democrats while in Opposition when they introduced a Private Members' Bill on this issue.  However, if we are to judge on the basis of the Minister for Energy's speech last night, this will be the Progressive Democrats' approach again some time in the future but not tonight when a vote is to be taken on the issue.</P>
      <P>This approach has been rejected by the Government.  Last night the Minister for the Environment offered an interesting explanation for not trusting local authorities with the disbursement of lottery funds.  The same explanation was given tonight by the Minister for Finance.  We were told that the disbursement of these moneys could not be left to local authorities because to do so would be to transfer controversial decision making from the Government to local councils.  We were told tonight that there is no guarantee that the local authorities would give due recognition to the interests of the many small voluntary groups in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the Government's stated intention to reorganise local government, the Minister's statement of last night requires some parsing.  The Minister should explain what he meant by it.  Is he, like some benign patriarch, trying to protect councillors from controversial local decision making?  This is hardly the case since he showed no such tenderness for councillors when, following a series of expenditure cuts, he exposed them to the making of water charges and the cutting <Col N="551" /> of local services.  Is he saying that councillors are not responsible enough to disburse lottery funds, that they may make the wrong decisions, favour council sponsored projects rather than community sponsored projects and be partisan in their decision making?  That would be a remarkable revelation of the low esteem in which the Minister for the Environment holds democratically elected local councillors, the majority of whom are members of his own party.  This does not suggest to me, whatever emerges from the Government committee on local government, of which the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Energy are members, that it will increase the powers and role of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche said tonight that he is a member of a local authority.  I, too, am a member of a local authority and I must say I am not familiar with the approach to which he made reference tonight.  The local authority of which I am a member pruned the applications before them and eliminated some of them.  They also approved amounts smaller than the ones being sought by the applicants concerned.It seems the Minister has given a lame excuse tarted up with some familiar flamboyant rhetoric.  The fact is that the disbursement of national lottery funding is too attractive a form of political patronage to be delegated to the uncertain but democratic decision making of local councils.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that there are almost 4,000 applications, seeking £160 million on his desk and that he has £6.5 million to disburse.  He also indicated that he is going to give careful consideration to each of these and to the volumes of representations accompanying them.  What a load of nonsense.  It would not be physically possible for the Minister, given his many commitments, to plough through 4,000 applications. Does anybody seriously believe that the Minister is going to embed himself in the Custom House with 4,000 lottery files to weigh up the respective merits of a GAA pavilion in County Donegal, a park in <Col N="552" /> County Kerry, a running track in Dún Laoghaire and a local environment scheme somewhere else?  The answer is that he will not.  Does anyone seriously believe that the small number of staff available to the Minister is in any position to form a judgement about the respective merits of 4,000 projects from community groups they have never met in locations they have never seen and about which they have only paper knowledge.</P>
    <P>How will the Minister make his decision?  He will decide on some crude carve up of the money between the various constituencies, perhaps with some loading for political marginality or the likelihood of a by-election.  He will then have his cards marked for him by the Fianna Fáil Deputies for the constituencies concerned.  There will be no conflict between council or community sponsored projects.  The only question will be whether it is Fianna Fáil sponsored project.  That is the way in which I and the public think national lottery money will be disbursed.  The Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Finance have said nothing which would dispel that view.</P>
    <P>We have been given no inkling of the criteria which will be used.  How will the Minister decide between local authority schemes and community schemes?  On what geographical, population or social basis will decisions be made?  How will the Minister decide between major projects and small projects?  No answers have been given to these questions and I am becoming more and more convinced, given the way in which the debate has degenerated into a slagging match across the floor of the Chamber, that the national lottery money is to be dispensed like political soothers.</P>
    <P>The logical and fairest way of disbursing the money is to let the local authorities do it from block grants.  They have the local knowledge, know the projects and the project sponsors.  They are in the best position to assess the relative merits of projects and the extent to which the funding would contribute and integrate with other community and amenity initiatives.It would still not be an easy task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> In my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire 54 projects have been submitted for funding totalling approximately £2 million.  I know the groups and the projects but even with my local knowledge it would be a difficult task to judge between them.  I do not see how the Minister can make a judgment without having local knowledge of the projects.</P>
    <P>It is now four months since the closing date for the receipt of submissions.  What we are talking about is the distribution of 1989 lottery funds.  Many of the groups who made submissions are being disadvantaged by the delay in allocating funds.  Groups who are anxious to develop or improve their areas made submissions in good faith.  Not only is the method of distribution unfair but the length of the delay is seriously hindering the work of local community groups. Why is the Minister waiting?  Is he trying not only to reap the benefit of political favour for the disbursement of the money but to do so at the best possible time to give him the best possible political advantage, even though that may cause enormous problems for the groups concerned?</P>
    <P>There were 4,000 applications and this shows the considerable enthusiasm there is among local community groups.  The fact that communities have applied for 25 times the amount of money available raises questions about the amount of money that is available.  The £6.5 million which is available for this scheme is the petty cash of the national lottery.  This year £72 million is being distributed and the Minister for Finance is wrong when he says that there was no criticism made about the other 90 per cent of the funding.The criticism is this: most of the remainder of the funds which are not distributed through this scheme are being used to plug gaps in Government expenditure and to do things which in the normal way would be funded through departmental Estimates.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to cast reflection on any of the fine projects which are being funded by the national lottery.  In the list we received on 21 November, £1.1 million was supplied to the Office of <Col N="554" /> Public Works for the restoration of stone work on the Custom House, a fine project in its own right.  If the Minister for the Environment wants to give a facelift to his own office block surely it should be possible for him to find the resources to do so in his Department's Estimate rather than plundering the national lottery and leaving short the amount of money that could go to community groups.</P>

      <P>In 1988 there was very serious public disquiet about what was happening with lottery funds.  People said that the way national lottery funds were handed out was nothing short of scandalous.The momentum for change had built up to such a degree that we had a debate here.  The Government defused the situation by agreeing to set up an all-party committee.  The committee was chaired by Deputy Desmond.  The former Fine Gael TD, Donal Creed, Deputy Harney, myself and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who made a very good contribution over a period of time, were members of the committee.  There were seven meetings of the committee and they undertook an investigation of the system of the allocation of national lottery funds.  We know from the Act that the national lottery surplus funds are brought to the Exchequer as non-tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment said that the proposals of the all-party committee in relation to amenity grants were extremely vague as regards the method of determination of block grants.  Recently, local authorities were asked for their recommendations and they devoted a lot of time and energy to making assessments and so on.  I have in my possession an assessment for the area I represent. There are two electoral divisions and under the heading &ldquo;Details of Proposed Work&rdquo; there is the total estimated cost of the work, the total expenditure to date, the amount raised locally and the grant now sought.  If the Minister thinks that is not detailed enough he would want to think again.  As a result of his statement this evening he has cast a vote of no confidence in local authorities.  He has as much as said to members of local <Col N="555" /> authorities that he does not see them as being capable of administering grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the likely undue favouritism that would be shown to the most densely populated areas in the distribution of block grants.  The all-party committee looked into the history of the allocation of funds over the years and noted that certain areas did not receive any national lottery funding.  That would not be the case if the responsibility for distribution of the funds lay with local authorities.  Each area has its own local authority and the members are in touch with the local community.</P>
    <P>The committee wished to record as their view that lottery funds should not be used as a substitute for funding previously provided for from normal Exchequer sources or to finance programmes which are the responsibility of the various Departments.  The amenity grant scheme funded from the national lottery should in future be operated by local authorities from the total amount allocated by the Government for this purpose.  Block grants should be made by the Department of the Environment to local authorities at the time the authorities' estimates for the year were being set.  In determining the level of lottery funds for each authority, consideration should be given to the population of the area, the programme of amenity work submitted by the authority and the amount already allocated to the area.  Each authority would then be responsible for processing applications from local organisations, making allocations to voluntary and community groups and for projects undertaken by the authority itself.  They would also have to account for and issue payments.This would avoid duplication and remove any degree of perceived patronage which could have an adverse effect on the lottery.  Local authorities are best placed to ensure that funds are provided where they are most needed.</P>
    <P>The group noted that under the present amenity grant scheme local authorities are required to approve and recommend projects.  They would tend to be as objective about approving them as if the grants <Col N="556" /> were paid out of their own budgets.  It was recommended that the grants should continue to be made by the national governing bodies of sports, Cospóir and vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>An issue which needs to be addressed is that the capital expenditure on regional and national sports centres should continue to be the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  In view of the very substantial capital commitments involved, the group considered that the Government should review the question of the provision and maintenance of centres to ensure the optimum use of existing and planned facilities.  The group were also of the view that priority should be given to the development of a national sports centre.  High-cost projects are being undertaken and the question then arises as to how the running of these facilities is to be funded.  The sports recreational capital expenditure grant scheme should be administered by the vocational education committees, on the recommendation of their sports advisory groups.  These groups have local expertise and would be able to ensure that facilities were provided where most needed and that the projects chosen for assistance were viable.  The Department of Education should determine the block allocation to the VECs.  There should be co-ordination of the recreational facilities scheme and the amenity grants scheme to avoid duplication.  There is also reference to the arts and to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Local communities want their local authorities or VECs to be in charge of allocating grants.  They do not want handouts from the dispensers of patronage, the Fianna Fáil/PD Government.  The people do not want patronage from the messenger boys of Fianna Fáil.  They want what is theirs and they want their local authorities to be in charge of it.</P>

      <P>While all areas have their own claims and entitlements to funding for amenity and recreational schemes, as a Deputy and a councillor representing some of the most deprived urban areas <Col N="557" /> in Dublin, including the inner city, I see on a daily basis the incredible input and the uphill struggle by voluntary community activists, youth leaders and ordinary men and women who are the unsung heroes with the thankless task of trying against all the odds to organise for the amenity and recreational needs of their communities.  We in Dublin City Council have the best of staff available in our area community officers and field staff and workers in our community development departments who are trained to impartially grant-aid suitable projects.  They are the men and women of Dublin Corporation who know the projects most deserving of support, which would be forthcoming if they had the block grant allocation from the national lottery, as was intended by the all-party committee.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation have submitted a total of 182 projects requiring only £4.6 million.  We scrupulously stuck by the Minister for the Environment's directive on how to process applications.  We had to reject dozens of the most genuine applications from the most deserving quarters desperately in need of financial assistance because of the disgracefully unfair and discriminatory clause inserted by the Minister who demanded that those most deserving must have at least 30 per cent of the cost of the project already collected.  I invite the Minister for the Environment to accompany me any day on a walk in my city so that I can show him what I am talking about.  It is a moral disgrace that the Minister should retain to himself the power to decide politically whom he will assist financially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined applications from Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council amount to 342 for projects costing about £9 million.  The Minister claims that he must distribute the available sums on an equitable basis to all areas of the country.  Earlier tonight he implied discriminatory remarks against Dublin by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds.  Let us consider the Minister's record in regard to the building of local authority houses.  He built more houses in his own county, Mayo, than in the <Col N="558" /> whole of Dublin city and county last year. I have no doubt that the capital city, with nearly one-third of the total population, will yet again be neglected by this Minister.How can Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council Scrupulously apply the scheme outlined by the Minister in his directive on how to process applications and produce a list of projects needing funding of £9 million, while County Mayo managed to make 246 applications for projects costing £9.791 million? County Mayo is making a greater demand for funds than the whole of Dublin city.  If local authority house building programmes are anything to go by, I am desperately worried that the capital city will once again be neglected.</P>

      <P>Even by the flexible standards of politics applied in this country the turnabout by the Progressive Democrats on the abuse of the national lottery is breathtaking.  I represent a constituency which badly needs the funding available from the national lottery and I thought we were fortunate to have three Deputies who were opposed to the disgraceful abuse: none more loudly than Deputy Harney who, on 18 November 1988, appropriately haloed and oozing self-righteousness, proposed a Private Members' Bill with the stated purpose of ending &ldquo;the appalling abuse by Fianna Fáil of the national lottery by putting in place a new independent process for the disbursement of lottery funds&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil, the Teflon lady of Irish politics told the House, have engaged in the most despicable exercise in gombeen politics ever seen in this country.  I have no stomach for that kind of political invective but my constituency colleague, Deputy Harney, went on to state as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The behaviour of this Government is seriously jeopardising the future of the lottery itself and leading many people to the view that Fianna Fáil see the lottery as merely a re-election slush fund.  I know many people who tell me that when they buy a lottery ticket they feel they are directly contributing to Fianna Fáil party funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney went on to describe what she called a national scandal and to give specific instances of abuse, stroke politics and examples of needy and worthy organisations who could not receive funding and examples of organisations who did not make application receiving funding. She called for the setting up of an independent board chaired by a High Court judge who would make a report that would be accountable to the Dáil through the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrat leader on the following day declared:</P>
    <P>It is gombeenism gone mad.  It evokes the unsavoury world of nods, winks and political backhanders.</P>
    <P>In Deputy O'Malley's view it is improper that Irish citizens should have to &ldquo;act like 19th century peasants approaching a gombeen-man with their cap in their hand, virtually on their knees begging and pleading as a favour to them from an omnipotent and omniscient TD that they should be entitled to some kind of financial assistance for some project that they and others are pursuing in their own locality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree with the then Deputies Harney and O'Malley.  I know, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, as a member of Dublin County Council, that nothing has changed and that the disbursement of lottery funds is still disgracefully open to abuse and political jobbery.  Why would the mould breakers of Irish politics have changed their minds?  Why now suddenly should stroke politics, gombeenism, nods and winks, ministerial abuse, pipe band parades and national scandals be acceptable to those who are whiter than white, but, alas, are <Col N="560" /> not in our midst tonight?  Could it possibly be because the PDs in Government now also have their fists in the honeypot and would betray their principles for a mess of national lottery?  I find it hard to believe this would be the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley gave several examples from the <i>Limerick Leader.</i>  He said in County Limerick in particular where there were two security Ministers at the time their criss-crossing of back roads in County Limerick with a retinue of security people in tow reminded one of a NATO manoeuvre rather than simple messenger boy politicians going about to bring the good news to the peasants.  I cannot believe the party who were born to bring integrity into Irish political life, who stand for all that is good while the rest of us do not have a great many virtues going for us, would tonight go against the very principles of their own Private Members' Bill and come into this House and vote down this motion.  I must believe the Progressive Democrats will stand firm by the principles on which they were founded.  I look forward to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand I have only three minutes.  I would like to stitch into the record that the statement issued in this House last night by Deputy Shatter left me feeling very sick indeed.  I have been in this House 25 years and I have not yet seen the like of the hypocrisy and cant of his performance.  A former Minister of State in my constituency, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, who is still a Member of this House, sent out letters on 9 March, two days before the general election of 11 March 1987, directed to promoters of various projects telling them grants totalling £275,000 were being given to 11 different projects in my constituency.Letters from his Department issued not only to promoters but every single house in the 11 areas received them.  If that was not political corruption in its worst form I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a question on Thursday, 2 April 1987, as recorded in the Official Report, column 1360, volume 371 asking the Minister for the Environment the number of approvals for community <Col N="561" /> grants made by his predecessor in the constituency of Dublin South-Central; to whom these grants were made payable and the amount paid; the dates of approval in each case; the number of these grants that had been paid and the proposals he had for those organisations who had borrowed money on the basis of these approvals and had commenced work.  Many of these organisations borrowed money on the strength of these letters.  The reply I got was:</P>
    <P>The allocation of grants under my Department's amenity grant scheme for 11 projects in the Dublin South-Central constituency was notified to the local authorities concerned on 9 March 1987.  All allocations under the scheme were withdrawn on 23 March...</P>

      <P>I fully support this motion that Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to implement the recommendation of the all-party working group on national lottery funding that the allocation of moneys for specific amenity and recreational projects shall in future be allocated by local authorities and not by the Minister for the Environment.  This was the most important recommendation of the all-party group who included two members of the present Coalition Government, yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Harney.  The group recommended that from the total amount allocated by the Government for this purpose block grants should be made by the Department of the Environment to the local authorities at the time the authorities' estimates for the year are being set.  This would avoid duplication and remove any degree of perceived patronage which could have an adverse effect on the lottery.  The group concluded that local authorities are the best <Col N="563" /> placed to ensure facilities are provided where most needed.</P>
      <P>At this time this Government are trying to stimulate a national debate on the future operation, relevance and reform of our local authorities.  By accepting this motion, I tell the Minister, he would demonstrate his goodwill and commitment to local government reform. However, by rejecting this motion he is showing, together with the Cabinet, a total lack of confidence in county councillors and county councils and, indeed, county managers.</P>
      <P>The figure of £6.5 million which has been made available under this scheme is derisory when you consider that the total grants applied for amount to £163.073 million.  It would take 25 years to clear the present applications with this type of grant.  Kerry alone submitted 138 applications amounting to £5.854 million. It would take almost the entire allocation this year to satisfy the demands of Kerry alone.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the Minister his task of deciding which applications will be grant-aided.I hope he will judge them fairly and impartially and will not be guided by political considerations and advantage, which would be nothing new to his party, especially his colleagues in Cabinet.  His partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, did a very good exposé on his abuse of the national lottery in the National Lottery (Amendment) Bill, 1988.  Deputy Shatter, and tonight Deputy Rabbitte, referred to the various contributions from the Progressive Democrats on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing I have little time, I would like to refer to youth and sport which the Minister for Finance mentioned here tonight.  As a spokesperson for youth and sport I am very disappointed with the progress in sport areas from lottery funding.The principal motivation behind the establishment of the national lottery was the construction of a national outdoor sports stadium.  However, this concept seems to have been totally shelved by the Government.  An unacceptable and unreasonable approach was made by the <Col N="564" /> Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the GAA to have Croke Park designated as out national stadium.  For very good reasons his approaches were rejected. However, Liam Mulvihill, Director General of the GAA, reopened the debate in April when he proposed that the new national stadium be built by the main sporting organisations.  I believe his proposal merits in-depth consideration.  We should plan now for a new outdoor stadium.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government of 1983-87 set up a committee to report on the provision of a national indoor stadium and regional sports centres.  They produced their interim report in 1986 and a full report in 1987.  The Fianna Fáil Government of 1987-89 accepted the report and agreed to implement its recommendations but despite several announcements and three years of a financial bonanza from the lottery very few of their recommendations have been put in place to date.</P>
    <P>The national indoor stadium is very much in a limbo at the moment and the site has not been fully acquired.  In reply to a parliamentary question on 30 May 1990 the Minister stated that 68 per cent of the 12 acre site had been acquired and that the acquisition of the remainder of it was the subject of a compulsory order. The outcome of the public hearing on the CPO which was held in February 1990 is expected shortly.  From reports in the media, the owner of the site, irrespective of the outcome of the CPO, is going to take a constitutional action against the Government.  This process could take years.  The estimated cost of the new stadium is £35 million but from information I have received the cost could be in the region of £100 million.  It is time to have a re-think on this project; we should be thinking more in terms of an outdoor rather than an indoor stadium.</P>
    <P>While the proceeds from the lottery have continued to grow the allocation to the youth services has decreased from £10 million in 1988 to £8.7 million in 1990. In other words, the youth services' slice of the lottery cake has decreased while the size of the cake has grown.  National <Col N="565" /> youth organisations still do not know their allocations for 1990, and this is nearly July.  What other sector would put up with this treatment?  Is this what our youth services deserve?  The Minister has no difficulty in flying to Italy to sort out accommodation problems.  Yet he cannot sort out a problem which has been on his desk of the past four months.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude and commitment must be questioned.  As Deputy Sherlock has said the conduct of the Fianna Fáil Party in the disbursement of national lottery funds has been nothing short of a national scandal.  The current European philosophy is towards the devolution of power to local authorities and by rejecting this motion the Minister will be expressing a vote of no confidence in our county councils.</P>

      <P>I should like at the outset to recommend this motion to the House. We are not debating the success of the national lottery in this Private Members' motion, as evidenced by the figures quoted <i>ad nauseam</i> both last night and tonight, but what is at issue is the future success of the lottery.  There is ample reason to suggest that the public are seriously concerned about the alleged abuses in the distribution of funds under the recreational and amenity grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody on this side of the House is saying that those who have benefited already should not have done so; what we are clearly saying is that the system which is being currently used lends itself to political abuse and a more favourable system is available to the Minister.  Next Friday I will attend a meeting of the Bandon electoral area of Cork County Council.  Given the scarce resources available to Cork County Council we will be distributing at that meeting amenity grants which have been provided for by our county manager in our annual estimates.These seven councillors will assess the merits and demerits of individual projects.We have manageable administrative procedures, unlike those which prevail in the Custom House where, by the Minister's own admission, there are <Col N="566" /> 4,000 applications valued in excess of £163 million and not enough staff to process them.</P>

      <P>We agree that no system will give universal satisfaction but a system which removes the decision-making from the realms of party political patronage and gives local authorities a real input will ensure the continuing success of the national lottery.</P>
      <P>The Private Members' motion put down by the Progressive Democrats in 1988 also dealt with this issue and their attitude to this motion, as evidenced by the contribution of the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, last night is beyond comprehension.  The Progressive Democrats now use the argument that the reform of local authorities is necessary before our proposal can be implemented.  It appears that the futility of consistency affects everybody who sits on the benches opposite.  If the Minister for Energy, Deputy Bobby Molloy, is really serious about local authority reform then he, as a Cabinet Minister, should resign his seat on his local authority before he lectures this House on the necessity to reform local authorities so that they can be trusted to distribute the surplus funds from the national lottery. It appears from the attitude adopted by the Progressive Democrats to this motion that the more things change the more they stay the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank all the Members on this side of the House for the support they have given to this motion.  I intend to ignore the rather lame and pathetic excuse the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, gave last night for not supporting this motion.  There is no doubt that if the Progressive Democrats were on this side of the House they would have been most articulate <Col N="567" /> and vehement in their support for such a motion.</P>
      <P>The contribution of the Minister for Finance this evening in which he tried to put a gloss on what the Minister for the Environment said last night, was not worthy of that Minister.  One would expect a more substantial explanation from him on why the recommendation of the all-party working group that amenity and recreational grants be allocated by local authorities has not been implemented.  I want to refer briefly to the reasons he gave for this.</P>
      <P>He said that the proposals in the working group were extremely vague as regards the method of determination of block grants by the Department of the Environment.  They were equally vague in determining how the Department of Health should make block grants available to the health boards.  Yet the Department of Health and the Minister for Health, in all praise of the Minister for Health, had absolutely no difficulty in working out how to make a block grant to the health boards who would then designate funds for local projects within a health board area.  The Minister gave an utterly spurious reason for not implementing that proposal.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the amenity grant programme was too small from year to year to merit this degree of bureaucracy and that undue favouritism would be shown to the more densely populated areas.  How could one have a greater degree of democracy than every local authority examining 4,000 applications and passing them to the Department of the Environment who, according to the Minister for the Environment, will apparently re-examine them all over again? That is bureaucracy run mad and it makes absolutely no sense at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the Minister told us that undue favouritism may be shown to the more densely populated <Col N="568" /> areas in the determination of block grants by local authorities.  Why would the local authorities show any more undue favouritism to densely populated areas than would the Minister for the Environment? None of that makes any sense.</P>
      <P>The Minister said also that there was no guarantee that the local authorities would give due recognition to the interests of the many small voluntary groups in their area.  What in the name of heavens does that mean?  Is there any guarantee that the Department of the Environment in examining 4,000 applications, the capital value of which is £163 million, will give due consideration to the recognition of the interests of small voluntary groups?</P>

      <P>Will he explain to them why he will not provide allocations to most of the groups and people for whom they want allocations?  The allocations are going to depend largely on who whispers in his ear in this House on days when the Dáil sits to satisfy their perceived constituency needs.  The Minister really knows what is going on here because it was already well highlighted in the reply he gave on 26 April.  Is it not curious that <Col N="570" /> in the context of Dublin city and county the Minister has received applications for grants, the capital cost of which if they were all granted, would come to about £8 million, while for County Mayo the Minister has received applications for grants, the total capital cost of which is slightly below £10 million?</P>
      <P>Is it that the Fianna Fáil councillors in Mayo know something we do not know? This side of the House will be watching how much political patronage is distributed and the Minister knows that. The self-satisfied look of the Minister about that is part of what is wrong with our political system.  It is that sort of approach that does damage to politics here as does the approach of Deputy Roche.  He engaged in the most disgraceful diatribe of a personal nature against a person who is not a member of the House and against a backbench Member of our party who was leaving the House.  He conducted a personal attack on him and he did not have the decency to withdraw it.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following definition:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before the break for Private Member's Business I had been indicating the reasons the Labour Party should be supporting this amendment in the names of Deputies De Rossa and McCartan.  In his very brief reply so far to this Committee Stage debate, the Minister simply said that the meaning of advertising is &ldquo;well known&rdquo;.  By more or less saying it is something for which it would be very difficult to legislate, something to which it would be very difficult to give precision, he was not being entirely consistent with his speech on Second Stage.  I had been making a number of points and, in order to be of assistance to you and to the House, I will not be repetitive.  Neither shall I encroach on the debate which I anticipate may take place at some time in the future on section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Minister's remarks that the meaning of advertising is well known, I want to make a few points. If the meaning of advertising is &ldquo;well known&rdquo;, advertising is of the nature of the marketplace.Many of us have philosophical, political and ideological reservations on the utility of advertising, whether it makes a contribution to consumers' welfare or whatever, but be that as it may, confining ourselves to the wording here, advertising is of its nature something that is addressed to the marketplace.  What is curious in the Minister's Second Stage speech, which has direct relevance to amendment No. 1, is that an elected <Col N="577" /> representative of the people, who is nominated by the Taoiseach and receives his seal of office as Minister, is taking upon himself to say how advertising should be disposed.  When one reflects on that extraordinary proposition, one can see immediately how the market idealogues want to talk about the marketplace one week but when the marketplace is not generating revenue from the private and commercial interests they favour, or they feel well disposed towards, they then decide that the market can be distorted.</P>
    <P>There is a curious rambling reference in the Second Stage speech to how deregulation must be managed by regulation, a piece of mumbo-jumbo that the old Adam Smith school of economics used throw out every now and again.  The Minister for Communications is going to establish the disposal of advertising.  The second proposition which flows logically from that is that the Minister is going to curtail the advertising capacity of a company who have a mixed source of income &mdash; a licence fee and advertising revenue.  The Members of this House are entitled to know why a company such as RTE should be chosen for this treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not coming into the House to say, for example: &ldquo;I and my party, who were for a long time committed to public service broadcasting, have decided that RTE's work is so important it should not have to rely on advertising at all.  I am going to give them direct aid as well as the licence fee and I will free them from advertising&rdquo;.  The Minister is saying he is in favour of a recipe for death for RTE.  He is saying: &ldquo;I am going to cap your advertising and the mechanism by which I will do so will be the licence fee&rdquo;.  Of course, increasing the licence fee is hardly what one might call a move that one would initiate in the week before declaring an election.  The Minister who is claiming statutory responsibility for disposing of and capping advertising is the same Minister who assented to the increase in the licence fee.  That is a truly extraordinary set of powers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> The amendment raises another interesting issue.  Stokes Kennedy Crowley, a very interesting group who are now part of a much larger group who prepared a report on the BBC, prepared a report on the future of RTE.  I have been involved in this issue for a long time.  When Ireland was allocated in 1977 an orbital position for its communications satellite at 31º west, Stokes Kennedy Crowley &mdash; part of the Peat Marwick group that had examined the BBC &mdash; were the people who suggested that RTE should not be allowed to proceed with bidding for the telecommunications possibilities of the satellite.</P>
    <P>It went to a company with no broadcasting experience that within a very short period had sold on about 80 per cent of their holding to the Hughes Corporation.It so happens that the Hughes Corporation owns 30 per cent of the company which, for example, in Japan is in charge of the Japanese telecommunications capacity.  It is interesting also to note that the frequencies applied for by Ireland were not those used for television but were those used for telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Why statutorily limit advertising within the entity that is RTE when it is very clear that the competitive environment which we are all in now may be leading to the end of public broadcasting as we know it?  Linked through all these different forms of communications, we are seeing the colonisation of the citizen by the new communications media.  The interesting lesson was that the people had the right in 1977 to be allocated by the World Administrative Radio Conference &mdash; WARC &mdash; the new frequency.  The people got it as Ireland but it was sold on as a private entity.  We are in a very unusual situation in relation to RTE. RTE having got their lecture from Stokes Kennedy Crowley and having shed a number of their staff, encouraged a number of their staff, through redundancy schemes, to set up stand alone companies to sell products and turn to RTE and so forth are not now to be <Col N="579" /> regarded as being commercialised.  The amendment states that:</P>
    <P>`advertising' shall mean advertising, other than promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting its own commercial activities;.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the advertisers and the advertising agencies have come out so strongly on this point &mdash; it is only a minor point &mdash; is that RTE was one of those advertisers who paid their bills.  The people actually got their money for work done.  There are many others who do not pay their bills and who do not have the same record.  In this instance the Minister is going much further.  This is an entirely different concept of advertising that has never been known before.  He is not only saying to the company: &ldquo;There will be a limit on your advertising&rdquo;, but is also saying to them: &ldquo;The way you do it will be limited too.  We will deal with that <i>in extenso</i> later.  They will be required to move on from 10 per cent to 75 per cent of daily programming and from seven minutes 30 seconds to four minutes 30 seconds.&rdquo;  That is another interference by the free marketeers.  All my life I have listened to this about the marketplace taking its course and so on.</P>

      <P>What we are seeing is not, of course, any antipathy to State monopoly, what we are talking about is managed monopoly, assisted monopoly. RTE are in the position that if, for example they make a programme on learning the Irish language &mdash; they have done so in the past &mdash; and they decide to <Col N="580" /> advertise the book for people learning basic Irish, according to ministerial diktat that will have to come out of their advertising allocation.  If they manage to get a distinguished guest lead performer for their symphony orchestra and announce that fact that comes out of their advertising allocation.</P>
      <P>This is not to say that I expect the alternatives to RTE to publish books on learning Irish or to establish symphony orchestras, quarters, trios or even a single performer.</P>
      <P>RTE, however, because they have this long and proud tradition of mixed source of public service broadcasting, with half of their revenues coming from advertising, must be curiously disabled.  What the amendment is asking is that when RTE, with their own peculiar mix of the licence fee and advertising, are making their own products they should be permitted to promote them.  Let us take another example.  I have been involved in the making of a documentary film.  If RTE want to advertise one of their own documentaries that will come out of their advertising quotient also.  One might say that will apply to the other station in the level playing field.  What evidence is there that the station described with such glowing confidence &mdash; it is my hope that it will soon be on the air &mdash; will ever make a documentary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next issue which arises, an important one, is that the company that will bear these crippling intrusions in this curious new concept of advertising, must do other things.  Suppose they were over their quota and were reaching the ceiling, what are the advertising executives in RTE to do?  Are they to say: &ldquo;We must keep some of our allocation for the latter half of the year, some of it for the first half of the year or are we to have a lottery to decide who can advertise?&rdquo; If they have other customers for the stations that people have never seen, that may or may not ever have viewers, for the stations the people could have listened to and did not listen to, are they expected to ring them up and say: &ldquo;We are over quota; now, they did not chose you but because we are over the quota and we have a <Col N="581" /> ministerial ceiling on what we must do we will try pushing them at you&rdquo;?  Meanwhile, there is the rather naive assumption I mentioned earlier, that visual advertising moves to either aural or print advertising, which anybody in the field for a wet day knows does not happen.</P>
    <P>I pointed out before the break that UTV's top seven customers for advertising are equally represented in RTE's top ten.  In practice, this means, that in anticipation of something that may or may not work and because of one's attitude towards RTE that revenue is being sent away.  Everyone knows what advertising means.  Who allocates the money for advertising?  Advertisers do and they do so in response to the marketplace.  It is very unusual to have this kind of awful interference.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues arise directly from this.  I repeat that the amendment states that &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; shall mean advertising, other than promotional material broadcast by the authority within their own broadcasting service for the purpose of promoting their own commercial activities.  RTE have entered into contracts with a number of people who used to work for the station.  The Industrial Development Authority have practically assisted these people.  I can state as a fact that the Industrial Development Authority were never consulted about the implications of the broadcasting legislation before us for their clients.  I can also state that those who work within the commercial services section, set up following the publication of the findings of the review of RTE, were not consulted about its implications for their section.  There are about 90 independent film makers, each employing between five and ten people, in the country.  If we cap advertising these people will be the first casualties.</P>
    <P>I must confess that the people for whom I have the greatest sympathy, whom I have known longer than the time I have been in politics, are those who work within the drama and cultural section of the station, people we all listened to as children.  Having been allowed continue on in the station, the ethos of which <Col N="582" /> has changed, which now has to have a commercial ethos, they are to be told that they were too successful and that if RTE were to advertise anything they do, for instance, cassettes productions by the RTE players or a video production of a Brian Friel play, this would have to be counted as advertising revenue.  I could cite other examples: Heinz make sauces as well as beans.  There would be outrage in the commercial sector in America if someone said they could not talk about sauce and beans at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that anything RTE do inside the company is to be counted as advertising revenue.  This begs the question as to why this company do not qualify for the commercial freedoms allowed to every other company in the commercial world.  The conclusion that one would have to come to is that their crime was, as Dostoevski might say, that they had a broadcasting ethos to which they accorded first priority.  Stokes Kennedy Crowley stated they should also have a money-making ethos while those with a money-making ethos and no broadcasting ethos should be favoured.  Therefore the company with both a commercial and a broadcasting ethos had to be crippled so that the new Topsy which has not yet arrived can grow up in chaos with no commitment to culture, language, music, the orchestra, film making and so on. This is the company the young people from Rathmines go to when they want to learn about film making and the making of videos.  I met some of these last year, one of whom won an award for a short 15 minute film.  These are the people who hope they will have a film career with TV3 which the Minister hopes will be up and running at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>Other areas will also be affected by this proscription on the internal advertising of productions.  There is a unique and hypocritical attitude towards the film industry in this country with people from the top down &mdash; I am being charitable this evening &mdash; beating their way to get into previews and first nights even though they put an end to the film board which paid seed money for films.</P>
    <P>RTE are involved in joint productions. <Col N="583" /> How will they be able to advertise these? It might be said that we are levelling the playing field and a new film industry will spring from the alternative to RTE but there are people getting lost, in terms of the way in which advertising will go. There is no doubt that advertising will be lost in the short term.  The people who never get a mention are the technicians, those who use mixing equipment and the technology of the technological substratum of the advertising industry.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, they have to work hard with some of them.  The point that needs to be made is that their jobs are in danger.  Last year in an interview the Director General of RTE indicated that 16,000 cheques had been issued by RTE, exclusive of the cheques issued to the staff of RTE.  If it is the case that in the period from 1982 to 1990 all of the advertisers had been won back why give this all away to level the field?  How can one argue that the field is level if one day they are told they are old fashioned and the next they must change, satisfy the marketplace and are too successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a regulation to establish deregulation has been raised.  I heard a similar phrase in 1963 from a very bad economics professor who is no longer with us.  What is meant by it is that one is distorting the marketplace and there is no level playing field, that a limit will be put to your success in the name of something that might emerge.  There is a deeper script involved and we will come to that later in the Bill.  I remember the time when the satellite capacity was sold off to an Irish company which was really a front for the Hughes Corporation so that it could be part of the whole future of telecommunications.  Bord Telecom is in the top three.  The Hughes Corporation own 80 per cent of the company which got the contract.  RTE were precluded from applying for that.  That was carried in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 3 March 1986.  The <Col N="584" /><i>Irish Press</i> on 15 December 1986 returned to the subject of how the Government's application for satellite frequencies specified bands in that part of the spectrum reserved for telecommunications and not the DBS frequencies.The lower frequencies can be used for TV via cable from lower part satellite transmissions instead of the more usual 200 watt DBS.  The former is more attractive to private investors who believe the more high-powered DBS plants in Britain and France favour cable delivery of programmes to consumers.</P>
    <P>Returning to this unique interference in the internal affairs of a company who were commercially successful, there is part of a script that simply states RTE must be knocked off kilter to make room for a much bigger project which involves the privatisation of Bord Telecom.  It has been fattened up for privatisation.  We must use plain language.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle loves language. Privatisation is the robbery from the public of something which they built, own and paid for with their taxes.  People who were once citizens and believed in social solidarity get greedy and decide they will sell that which they do not own.  They rob it from the public and allocate it to private interests.  It is sometimes called modernity but I call it moral turpitude.</P>
    <P>I had hoped Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would be here because I wanted to ask him some questions about the people from the IDA who visited Montrose and the people who were told they could be relied on for funding for different projects.What is the message that was given to them?  Were film makers, sound mixers, people interested in breaking into the popular Irish music scene and so on, told there would be something marvellous available soon and that they should live horse and sometime the grass would come?  It is called TV3. There would be a great future for them then.  In anthropology they used to call that the cargo cult, something would come floating in on the tide one day and everyone would be happy and eat again.  I have a <Col N="585" /> few more things to say about broadcasting policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>People involved in charities and so on are caught also.  I am in favour of the amendment proposed by my colleagues.  They are saying that commercial activities generated from within the company should be allowed to be promoted by the company's own capacity.  They are not purchasing anyone else's advertising space.  What is being said is that no matter how innovative or creative the company are in creating new products and new technology, and despite the report of Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley, uniquely in Ireland they will not be allowed to advertise their own new products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some who say that they find the concentration on the question of the definition of advertising tedious.  It should have been made clear at the beginning because it is part of the decline of a language in this House that a Minister, moving a Bill of such immense <Col N="586" /> importance, should simply say that the meaning of it is well known.  Unless some definition is inserted which will protect the ethos of the company involved the damage to the country, to employment and to the prospects of those who work in the creative area and those who built up and made possible a telecommunications industry, will be immense.  It is very interesting to think of the people against whom this is directed, the people who attended the meetings of the European Broadcasting Union and entered into arrangements on our behalf internationally, the people who proudly put up awards they won in different parts of the country and the world.  They are the people who are the innocent victims.  There are people who no longer work in the company affected because they took early retirement. There are people who are the victims of the thinning down of different departments &mdash; it was said that the fat had to be got rid of.  There are people who took risks and set up on their own and sold some of their products back to the company.They are the people who now have to stand and wait for something that might never happen.  The company with which they had a relationship, with its curious mixture of public service broadcasting, relying for half its revenue on advertising, is to be interfered with.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the reaction would have been in 1974 when I was a Member of Seanad Éireann and the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill was going through, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien being the Minister responsible.  I can imagine the reaction if he had said he was going first to attempt editorial control and tell them what music they could have on their second channel and if he did not get away with that he would hit them such a blast in relation to their advertising revenue that they would not be seen for dust. People would have been screaming from the other side of the House for years about the incredible interference, yet this is what is happening now.  The Minister is capping, allocating proportions and making the whole thing unworkable.</P>
    <P>That is why amendment No. 1 will have <Col N="587" /> the support of the Labour Party.  It is to allow the internal capacity for innovation and creativity of RTE and the marketing of the products that come from that to be the business of RTE alone rather than to be hammered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not attempt to answer all the points raised but I will clarify a few points to be of help to the House.  I share the concern expressed by Deputies about any implication this legislation might have for the role of charities.  Concern has been expressed that charitable organisations will lose access to the broadcast media as a consequence of the measures I am proposing.  I fail to see how or why this should happen.  I believe these organisations can actually gain from the new measures.  There is no reason RTE cannot and should not continue to carry the appeals of these organisations on a free-of-charge basis &mdash; indeed, as a public service.  As such these appeals would not constitute advertising and therefore would not fall to be included under the new limits.  I have listened to Deputies and I am quite prepared to be flexible in this matter.  If there is any question or the least uncertainty about it I am more than amenable to including a provision to deal with it and to clarify it in relation to charities.  At this stage I believe that such an amendment would be superfluous.  It is incumbent on RTE as part of their public service mandate to carry these advertisements on a free-of-charge basis.</P>
      <P>I have listened to other points about self-promotion by RTE.  It is suggested that RTE, 2FM and others would have to stop the Beat On The Street and other self-promotions.  The issue arises only in relation to broadcast self-promotion.  It is not being prohibited but it must henceforth count as advertising for the purpose of broadcast time limits.  This has no bearing at all on non-broadcast self-promotion in which RTE engage, for example Roadcaster, Beat On The Street and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission was in <Col N="588" /> some way a Fianna Fáil cumann.  The commission in its present form was appointed in March, 1986 by the then Minister for Communications, Deputy Jim Mitchell.  One member, John A. Murphy, resigned when he was elected to the Seanad.  That one member was replaced but there are seven members in all, six of whom have been there since 1986 when they were appointed by the then Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins and a number of other Deputies have given the impression that RTE will be stripped of their funds, that we will have an alternative television station established but that really we will be in some sort of cultural desert.  I would remind Deputies that section 18 of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, provides as follows in relation to the independent television channel:</P>
    <P>(3)  The Commission shall ensure that the television programme service provided under this Act shall in its programming&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language;</P>
    <P>(b)  uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression;</P>
    <P>(c)  have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State, including in particular those of such countries which are members of the European Community; and</P>
    <P>(d)  includes a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs programmes;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> and the television programme service contractor shall comply with any requirements of the Commission in respect of such matters.</P>
    <P>(4)  For the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the Commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is produced in the State or in another Member State of the European Communities, and</P>
    <P>(b)  is devoted to original programme material produced therein by persons other than the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisations.</P>
    <P>These are the exact terms of reference under which RTE operate, except that there are two additions.  One is the provision that a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs shall be included.  This is not in the RTE mandate. The other point is that it is specially aimed at encouraging the independent production sector about which we have heard so much today.  It is specifically written into the legislation, which is not the case in regard to RTE.  I would say that in recent times RTE have been doing an excellent job in encouraging the independent sector.</P>
    <P>As far as the independent television service to be established under the Radio and Television Act, 1988 and set up by this House in concerned, we will have all the mandate of RTE plus a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs plus written in the provision that there has to be independent production for a proportion of their programmes.  That is not the cultural desert that has been depicted for us by the Deputies opposite.</P>

Regarding the point made by Deputy McCartan in relation to the role of the print media and having advertisements cover to cover, I have far more faith in the print media than apparently Deputy McCartan has in relation to their commitment to and history of fair and reasonable journalism.  That is not to say I always agree with what is printed; many times I do not, but in the role of the print media there is an honourable tradition of journalism.  I, and I am sure the national newspapers, would refute Deputy McCartan's suggestion and innuendo that in some way this extra advertising that will become available as a result of the capping of RTE will somehow bring about advertisements from cover to cover in the print media.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it necessary to amend it.  The situation can be adequately covered by RTE by covering the charitable announcements in the form of public service announcements rather than the way they are handled at the moment in many cases where they <Col N="592" /> charge for them.  We hear a great deal about the public service ethos of RTE, and that type of work could and should be done.  Reference was made to the Daffodil Day and the Conquer Cancer campaigns.That does not come under advertising.  It is a promotion.</P>

When he spoke about charities after I raised the matter he talked about them being free of charge.  He knows very well that if RTE were to do advertising free of <Col N="593" /> charge for charities they would have nothing but charity advertisements.  Of course they have to charge.  Will he now accept that charged advertising for charities will be exempt from the provisions of this Bill?</P>

      <P>I propose to be relatively brief but, judging by the previous speeches, I could go on all day tomorrow even though it is the longest day of the year and still be relatively brief.  This amendment seeks a redefinition of advertising.  Unless this is done or unless the Minister introduces a somewhat similar amendment to redefine advertising, this section, the definition section, usually a formality hardly ever discussed, would cost 100 jobs at least in RTE.  On this occasion they can be quantified.  As the Minister knows, the use of promotional activities within RTE is their life BLOOD, the essential of all their commercial enterprises.  These are the enterprises we and everyone sought to get going and unless they do their promotions on the air for these activities in <i>ex quota</i>, outside quota advertising time then, to use a media term, we would be reaching the wind-up stage or, more accurately, the cut-off stage for all these enterprises with a loss as I have quantified of at least 100 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of this promotion time within RTE which, if we judge it correctly, seems to be under attack by the Minister, is the reason they have profit-making commercial enterprises which benefit the station and viewers.  Whatever <Col N="594" /> our basic philosophy on private enterprise, capitalism or State enterprise may be, I think all of us here would favour this commercial enterprise of RTE which is probably a unique combination of private and State enterprise.  However, this enterprise is now under attack and unless we have a redefinition of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; by the Minister we will see the end of RTE's commercial enterprises.</P>

      <P>Both amendments have been ruled out of order because they extended beyond the scope of the Bill as introduced on Second Stage. I think Deputy Taylor will, <i>inter alia</i>, appreciate that if we were to amend that which has not been provided for on Second Stage we would be opening up all the legislation to amendments which are not provided for in the intent of the Bill, which is to increase the borrowing ceiling allowed to the company, enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee these increased borrowings and empower the company to alter their articles of association in consequence of the above provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purport of my amendment was to qualify that position, which is the very purpose and intent of any amendment, by providing that if the House agreed to allow this increase in the taxpayers' exposure for this company, the Minister could not avail of his powers of sale to privatise the shares in this company.  My amendment would be a qualification of the House agreeing to extend the guarantee by the State, Minister or taxpayer by providing at the same time that the Minister could not, while that guarantee is there, sell the shares. Those two points are interconnected and one is a qualification of the other.</P>
      <P>I was amazed when I got the communication from your office, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, saying that my amendments were disallowed.  I was flabbergasted because one is a clear quallification of that position &mdash; we agree to the extension and the guarantee but put in a condition in agreeing to it, which is where my amendment comes in.  If that is not what an amendment is I do not know what it is.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor appreciates that the Minister's Second Stage speech referred to specific provisions.  It did not refer to the opening up of all the code governing the Industrial Credit Corporation.  The House must confine itself to that which is provided for in the proposed legislation as introduced by the Minister on Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I beg leave to correct you in part.  You are correct in saying that one must look at the text of the Bill as introduced but to say that the Minister's Second Stage speech has any relevance to the content of amendments which may be tabled on Committee Stage is not, I submit, tenable. The text of the Bill is tenable and that is the only thing which is appropriate for the Ceann Comhairle to look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple Bill which seeks the approval of the House to extend the exposure of the taxpayer in connection with this company by £200 million.  My amendments said that we agree to that, <Col N="596" /> albeit with reluctance, but subject to the qualification that while that is there the Minister may not exercise the power of sale, which he has.  It is a qualification of the power the Minister seeks.  That is what an amendment is for.  How can I bring in that qualification in any other way?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy, the Bill before us provides for an increase in the borrowing ceiling allowed to the company. The Deputy agrees with that.  It will also enable the Minister to guarantee these increased borrowings and empower the company to alter their articles of association in consequence of those two measures.  That is what the Bill is about.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept that, but to confine amendments to what is within the Bill is to rule out all amendments because an amendment, by definition, is an attempt to change the contents of the Bill.  To base your ruling on a definition which says the amendment is out of order because it is not within the provisions of the Bill does not stand up. Obviously an amendment can add or subtract to the contents of the Bill; it can either take from it or add to it.  What the Chair has to decide is the extent to which an amendment can add to the Bill.  I understand the normal rule is that if an amendment could be construed to fall within the Long Title it is an appropriate amendment.</P>

Only recently the House amended the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, and several amendments to that related to amending the Trade Union Act, 1975.  They were accepted and debated.  One does not need to look back further than the Broadcasting Bill which was debated today.  The Minister introduced amendments which were completely beyond the scope of the Bill originally introduced.  The Title of the Bill is an Act to amend and extend the Industrial Credit Acts of 1933 to 1983.</P>

I do not have copies of the legislation to which he referred but I am sure that on examination he will discover that all the amendments accepted, whether from Ministers or Deputies, were relevant to the provisions of the Bill before the House.  If the Deputy looks at sections 1 to 4 of the Bill he will see what is provided for.  We can only have amendments relevant to those provisions and there is no point in pursuing this.</P>

It was a seperate issue entirely and it was debated on the floor of the House, as it should be.  There are several precedents along the lines I have suggested.

      <P>Deputies will appreciate that the Chair does not give expression to what strikes him at a particular moment.  All decisions are made in accordance with long standing and established principles in the House under all Governments.  They are contained in books.  I should like to quote from those books.  Amendments to an amending Bill must be relevant to some provision in the Bill as read a Second Time and questions as to admissibility have frequently to be decided on finely drawn lines of distinction.  The House may not amend an Act referred to in the Bill not contemplated in the Bill.

We want to amend the blanket provision.  An amendment is something that accepts what is in the Bill but seeks to vary it.  The Minister is looking for an extra £200 million and we are saying we will give it to him subject to a qualification and that is where the amendment comes in.  We are giving the <Col N="600" /> Minister the money subject to a qualification.We are not seeking to amend some extraneous matter but to amend what the Minister is seeking to do in the Bill.

I am indicating to the Deputy for the last time that amendments are acceptable if they are relevant to the provisions of the Bill.  Deputy Taylor's amendment which may be attractive and necessary in the overall if there was a total revision of the legislation, cannot be accepted.  There are three provisions in the Bill, increase the borrowing, guarantee it by the Minister and make the necessary changes following that and only amendments to those provisions can be accepted.  We have given a good amount of our limited time to a discussion on this matter and I ask the Deputies to accept my ruling.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Some time ago the Minister issued a press statement in the course of which he stated he had invited proposals from a number of financial advisory bodies on the terms on which they would advise him in relation to the future development and capital requirements of the ICC.  I presume the Minister would not be reluctant to accept advice from Members of the House and that he will not confine his invitation to the financial institutions of this city.  If the Minister is contemplating more radical reform of the Industrial Credit Corporation this section, and section 2, are leading in the wrong direction.  I cannot see why the Minister should continue to seek to extend this ceiling on the ICC from £800 million to £1 billion.  Why does the Minister not allow the ICC to trade <Col N="601" /> as a commercial bank and extend their lending and borrowing as would be prudent on the back of their own assets? Why, when the ICC have been very successful and have grown as much in the last decade as they did between the time of their foundation in the thirties and 1980, is the Minister not proposing a more extensive change?  Is it not time for measures such as this to cease and allow the ICC to trade as any other bank?</P>
      <P>It follows from that, and section 2, that the Minister should not guarantee the borrowing.  Every time the Minister for Finance intervenes to guarantee borrowings on a company an extra liability is incurred by the State.  It is not necessary to proceed like this.  It is a pity that Deputy Taylor's amendment was ruled out of order because it is probably not necessary any longer for the Minister for Finance to hold 99 per cent of the shareholding in ICC.  I do not see why decisions in the thirties, made in different circumstances, to set up an agency to carry out particular functions, should suffer from bureaucratic inertia which keeps them in place with the same shareholding on them for ever.</P>
      <P>There is a case to be made for the disposal of shares in ICC and the use of those shares for the benefit of the public as the Minister, the Government and this House see fit.  That might reduce the national debt, and, consequently, its servicing and the burden of taxation on the taxpayers.  On the other hand, it might mean investing to expand the State sector in another direction.  Quite recently some borrowing was engaged in to speed up the process of reafforestation.  Instead up extending State borrowing further, would it not be better to cash in some of the shares which the Minister holds in successful companies and to use the proceeds to finance further State requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is hardly a parliament which does not extend, in one way or another, the role of the State.  I think I was the Minister who put the National Development Corporation legislation through the House although the memorandum was carried to Government by Deputy John Bruton in the first instance.  There again <Col N="602" /> the State was put in the position of authorising and underwriting borrowings.  I wonder if the Minister has taken a longer view of this legislation.  It is the kind of thing that is discussed every year when a particular ceiling is reached but, in the context of the Minister inviting proposals from a number of financial advisory bodies whom he does not name, might it not be better for him to take the initiative and to put the ICC on a different footing? Maybe it is time he told them to run their business like any other bank, to borrow and lend as they see fit and carry the risk on their own assets.  There will then be the subsequent consideration of whether the Minister should hold such a large number of shares or if he should dispose of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am grateful to Deputy Noonan for the support he gave in seeking the validation of my amendment, I do not agree with him, as a matter of principle, on the question of the privatisation of the ICC.  We have diametrically opposing viewpoints as far as that issue is concerned.  I take the view that the Industrial Credit Corporation is a very valuable State asset.  They are doing extremely well and the Minister pointed out in his opening speech that the outlook for the company was very positive.  He mentioned that the company had shown a profit in every year since their establishment in 1933 and that they had paid dividends to their shareholders in most years, including every year since 1969. That is a very happy and proud record for a semi-State corporation, a sector that, from time to time, has come in for abuse by private enterprise, indeed by many of the organisations which are not averse to taking handouts and concessions in taxes, grants and in any other way in which they can benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a proud record and the shareholder &mdash; the Minister in the name of the people of Ireland &mdash; is doing very well from it.  Dividends are being paid and the indications are that they will increase. Why sell the company?  I am afraid that the likelihood of a sell-off is very real and that is why I am concerned about the Bill <Col N="603" /> and the section.  In case anybody thinks that the question of privatisation in the context of the Industrial Credit Corporation is a vague figment of my imagination, that I am paranoid on the subject and that that is my view in the context of any semi-State company, that is not so because a clear indicator has emanated from the most senior official of the company that the question of privatisation is a very real possibility.  I should like to quote from a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 March 1990 which referred to the annual general meeting of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>After the meeting the Industrial Credit Corporation managing director, Mr. Frank Casey, said that the company would be aiming to increase its return on shareholders' funds to about 15 per cent over the next two years in preparation for possible privatisation.</P>
    <P>There it is, from no less a personage than the managing director of the company.  I doubt that he would make such a statement or posit such a position if he had not already had a discussion or perhaps putative backing from the Minister who controls the company.  The Minister should stop the rumours by telling us whether it is on the agenda.  Members of the House are entitled to know whether the Minister had any part or parcel in this quote by the managing director of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  After all, we represent the majority shareholder in the ICC, namely, the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are also entitled to know the position in that regard in the run-up to possible discussions on a further national agreement.The employees of the Industrial Credit Corporation should also know what is going on.  This nod and wink business should cease once and for all. Let the Minister tell us whether this is on the agenda.  The chairman of the company, Mr. James Barton, reported that there was an effective 60 per cent increase in pre-tax profits by the ICC last year to £5.2 million.  This is when the powers that <Col N="604" /> be start looking at ways of getting their hands on a very valuable publicly owned company which, obviously, can go from strength to strength.  The people carried the risk on the corporation through good times and bad; when subscriptions for the company were sought years ago from private enterprise they spurned it because they thought it would not make the grade. Now, when the company are a major success story, they want to get their greasy hands on it.  Now is the time for the Minister to come clean in this regard and I will be interested to hear his comment on the statement from the managing director.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Any comment about section 1 or the purpose of the Bill in increasing the borrowing limit from £800 million to £1 billion is not a matter of great moment one way or the other.  That is really the comment to be made on the Bill &mdash; that it is so limiting, restrictive and narrow within the context of the aspect of economic policy with which it proposes to deal.  The manner in which Deputy Taylor's amendment has been ruled out of order highlights the limitations of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In the context of the urgency of a total review of our approach to industrial policy we continue this <i>ad hoc</i> approach, a number of instances of which we had on the Finance Bill and now in this Bill to amend the Industrial Credit Acts, 1933 to 1983.  I regret those limitations.  It is very hard to generate any excitement about whether the limitation should be £800 million or £1 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Taylor's remarks concerning privatisation.  Certainly it would clear the air if we could have unequivocal assurances from the Minister but they appear to be very difficult to secure.  We heard similar remarks in respect of the decision &mdash; which we all welcome in the national interest &mdash; in relation to the strategic acquisition by An Bord Telecom of Cablelink.  But, when one seeks to establish whether it is for the purpose of fattening-up Telecom for disposal, one cannot get any assurance from the Government that there is no question of <Col N="605" /> disposing of Telecom Éireann.  Similarly, we cannot get the Minister to answer unequivocally questions put to him.  Personally I would not be adverse to examining whether, for example, there would be some merit in rationalisation of some of the agencies that provide a service not entirely dissimilar or that do not have some affinity with the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Again, it is not something in respect of which we have managed to get any reply from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to his having piloted the legislation in respect of NADCORP through the House.  My view is that there is an affinity between the role of NADCORP and that of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Indeed, NADCORP are being greatly and deliberately restricted in terms of their purpose and objectives in the manner in which they function.</P>
    <P>Similarly I question whether it is absolutely essential to continue to divorce the resources of the Agricultural Credit Corporation from the Industrial Credit Corporation.I heard a Fine Gael Deputy &mdash; during the discussion on the last occasion &mdash; raise the question of whether there is not a need to examine the role provided by the Industrial Development Authority <i>vis-á-vis</i> the particular facility about which we are speaking here.</P>
    <P>I should like to have had an opportunity to discuss these matters on this Bill because they are critical at our present stage in industrial policy.  It really is very difficult to expect anybody on this side of the House to generate a head of steam on the provisions of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would again raise the question of the proportion of resources devoted to talking a stakeholding in particular appropriate companies as distinct from moneys advanced by loan.  Notwithstanding what the Minister of State had to say on the last occasion, that it was seen as a very important dimension of the purpose of founding the Industrial Credit Company in 1933, it remains my view that it would, in appropriate companies considered to have potential, take stakeholdings in return for advancing capitalisation.  I would approve of that <Col N="606" /> dimension of the company being expanded.  But, from the content of this Bill, I do not interpret that to be the intention in any way.</P>
    <P>When replaying to the discussion on this section I should be obliged if the Minister would address himself to a proposal to phase out the exchange rate guarantees, or some, that exist at present.  If my memory serves me correctly &mdash; and I do not have the reference &mdash; in answer to a parliamentary question I had tabled there was a commitment to doing that in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members on this side of the House I am disappointed and surprised that this amendment has been ruled out of order.  I suppose we must accept that.</P>
      <P>I would disagree profoundly with what Deputy Noonan had to say regarding privatisation.  The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, do believe in rolling back the power of the State in many areas.  But we feel that the whole of the banking sphere needs to be examined in great depth to ascertain what can be done to make it more accountable.  Until that review of the banking system is undertaken &mdash; if it is ever undertaken &mdash; we would strongly oppose any privatisation of any of the State banks, which would include the Industrial Credit Corporation.</P>

      <P>I do not think I need respond to Deputy Garland.  If I heard him correctly, his statement appeared to me to be totally contradictory, in that, on the one hand, he wanted to roll back the heavy hand of the State and, on the other hand, is opposed to getting rid of any part of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They appear to be full.  Taking up the point made by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to the phasing out of the exchange rate guarantee schemes for <Col N="607" /> small businesses these have been in existence since the eighties.  These were introduced at a time of high interest rates, with no loss to the Industrial Credit Corporation, to be administered on behalf of the State, the State carrying the exchange rate risk.  I should say they are being phased out and will be phased out altogether by 1992.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, that there was a wide-ranging debate on Second Stage which continued for approximately five hours on various aspects on the Industrial Credit Corporation.The Industrial Credit Corporation do have equities in companies standing somewhere in the region of £22 million today.</P>
      <P>The whole question that gave rise to the introduction of this Bill is simply and solely that the level of borrowing of the Industrial Credit Corporation stands at £785 million, whereas the maximum allowable under legislation is £800 million.The House will appreciate it does not take long to move from a figure of £785 million to one of £800 million, especially when one is talking about movements in exchange rates, when, in a day, the maximum allowable could be exceeded.  That was the urgency for the introduction of the Bill.  Indeed it was called for in the annual report of the company from which I might quote:</P>
      <P>The board and management have made considerable progress in successfully repositioning ICC for the 1990s.  Continued growth is, however, significantly dependent on our ability to gain access to additional share capital and increased borrowing powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody here has said how they would perceive the Industrial Credit Corporation getting additional share capital. I take it from what Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte said that they would expect the State to put in the additional share capital.At the same time, here we are endeavouring not alone to stop borrowing but attempting to reduce it.  This Government have clearly enunciated <Col N="608" /> their policy, demonstrating that we are not in the business of putting in more share capital.  There is not even a good return on share capital.  It is a commercial banking area which has done very well.</P>

      <P>I would respectfully suggest to Deputy Taylor that it is not at 15 per cent at present.  Wherever the Deputy got the other quote from Mr. Frank Casey, the chief executive, he can divorce me from it &mdash; that was a quote some time in March last.</P>
      <P>In regard to where the future of ICC lies &mdash; which is what this is all about &mdash; in my announcement of 17 May last, when I invited proposals from a number of financial advisory bodies on the terms on which they would advise me in relation to the future development and capital requirements of ICC &mdash; I should say this exercise is designed to do no more than have the various options available in regard to the future of the company examined by outside, independent consultants and have recommendations made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management and staff generally should be aware that only when the consultants' report has been received and considered will the Minister be in any position to put proposals to his Cabinet colleagues for consideration and decision.  There is no point now in bringing in consultants to examine the various options as to how best to approach the future and where the company should be positioned for the nineties because we must bear in mind that we will be in a different climate, a different marketplace in 1992 for small banks such as this.  It is as well to address this matter in time and not be waiting until the marketplace changes and then find they have no place in it.  It is precisely to address those problems and to advise on all the options that I am taking this course.  I have no intention of giving a view as to the future <Col N="609" /> of ICC or what is the best future for them.  If I had such a view, there would be no point in employing consultants to consider all the options.  It is not a question of &ldquo;coming clean&rdquo;.  There are two issues to be addressed in regard to ICC: firstly, to increase the borrowings, which are at £785 million while the ceiling is £800 million and, secondly, to consider the future capital requirements of ICC to enable them to keep expanding their business.  I have a totally open mind as to the future of ICC.  When I am informed think I have responded to all the questions that have been raised.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I can appreciate the Minister raising the borrowing ceiling from £800 million to £1 billion because, as he has said, ICC are already very near their existing ceiling, but why does he consider it necessary for the State to guarantee the increase?  It seems the ICC have become so strong that they can carry the extra borrowing without the State incurring a further contingent liability of £200 million.  Not only should we be curtailing borrowing and reducing the borrowing requirement but we should also be reducing the level of guarantees provided by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of a very strong public sector and very strong, vital, relevant semi-State organisations, but we have to examine the activity of each State organisation in the context in which we find them.  ICC were set up in 1933 to provide share capital in industry, which we were trying to develop behind tariff walls in a very protected economy.  It was more or less an after-thought which permitted the ICC to be involved in lending and borrowing.The primary purpose of the ICC was not as a lending agency but as a State vehicle to take share capital in companies and to build up the private industrial sector in a protected economy, because <Col N="610" /> there did not seem to be adequate private resources at the time to do so.</P>
    <P>The role and function of the ICC has changed enormously since the foundation of the company in 1933, and it is time to look at it again.  I accept what the Minister is saying, that there is no point in forward-guessing the consultants.  I am not being categoric about this but I cannot see why we would continue to extend the guarantee just because the ceiling is going up.  If the health of the ICC justifies the extension of their borrowing to £1 billion &mdash; and I believe it does &mdash; I do not think it follows that the State has to guarantee the further £200 million.  That extension in borrowing is justified on the back of the assets of the ICC.  That should be the first departure and I do not think we need section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister throws red herrings into this debate when he starts talking about where the ICC will raise their capital.  Anybody would think, when listening to the Minister, that the ICC have been held back over the years, or are being held now as a result of an inability to raise capital.  If one looks at the history of the expansion of the ICC, one can see quite clearly that that is not so.  For example, in 1958 the maximum figure provided for the ICC for borrowing, of which the equivalent is now £1 billion, was £5 million.  I know things have changed very considerably since 1958 but, even allowing for inflation, it is not bad going to increase the figure from £5 million to £1 billion.  The company have not exactly had problems in capitalising themselves through borrowing sources.  Of course the guarantee given by the State has helped them along their path, and there is nothing wrong with that.  I support it as long as the company remain in public ownership, but when we consider that the people of Ireland have put so much into the company to enable them to build up their capitalisation from £5 million to £1 billion and, having backed a winner all along, the company then should be dissipated to other companies in the private sector to increase their multi-millions, that is a different story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one red herring thrown in by <Col N="611" /> the Minister but there is another.  The idea has been thrown around that if privatisation is to take place and the Minister is to sell all or some of his shares, in csome way that capitalises the company, but that is not so.  If the Minister put the money back into the company it would capitalise them, but that is not what the pro-privatisation lobby advocate.  They advocate the use of the money for some other State purpose.  The fact that somebody sells shares in a company <i>per se</i> does not increase the capital within the company by one penny, and any suggestion that it does is a complete and utter red herring.</P>
    <P>What I invited the Minister to tell the House &mdash; whatever other options for the development or expansion of the ICC may be considered or sought from consultants or anybody else &mdash; was that he would not countenance privatisation.  He seemed to be saying that the statement by the managing director, Mr. Frank Casey, quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 7 March was made without any authority from him or following any consultation with him on the subject.  If that is what the Minister is telling the House, I accept it and I am glad to hear it, but I hope the Minister can go further and assure us that he will not contemplate privatisation for this company.</P>
    <P>On section 2, has the Minister sought or obtained or does he intend to seek or obtain, either in respect of the increased guarantee sought in this Bill or of previous guarantees, security for the guarantee under section 3 (4) of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1958, and, if so, what security has been obtained?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some reservations about the Minister trying to win us to the virtue of bringing in consultants and having them review this corporation, for the following reasons.  Firstly I believe consultants tend to give you the answer they think you want.  One presumes they must have been given some parameters when required to carry out a review of a company such as this.  Secondly, I see the ICC as an instrument of industrial policy <Col N="612" /> and I would be very unhappy if consultants were asked to look at the company in isolation and to take a piecemeal approach to examining the future options for the company as if they existed quite separate from the entire range of agencies and questions that have to be considered in the context of any review of industrial policy.  You cannot separate the role of the ICC from their role in that integrated network of agencies that support industrial strategy in this country.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Industry and Commerce has embarked upon such a review, which he has done &mdash; and the Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, sought a report on industrial performance which was concluded by Mr. Frank Roche at UCD &mdash; it is regrettable that we are taking these issues in a piecemeal, fragmented way rather than asking consultants to have a look at the effectiveness of our industrial strategy and whether the ICC can be integrated into some new approach in that context, rather than saying: &ldquo;There is a State bank, the situation has changed beyond recognition since it was founded &mdash; and the purposes for which it was founded &mdash; and have a look at that State bank, as a stand-alone operation, in the context of banking in the nineties and whether there is any value for it being retained in public ownership and so on&rdquo;. It could be that one could arrive at a different answer as a result of looking at it in the context of industrial policy rather than looking at it in the context of Irish banking.  That would be my only reservation about the path charted for them by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Deputy Noonan.  I do not believe there is a need to extend the guarantee.  It is clear that ICC have a sufficiently good track record, they are well able to borrow money without necessarily having a guarantee for every pound from the State.  They already have a guarantee for £800 million, they do not need a guarantee for a further £200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the <Col N="613" /> points made by Deputy Noonan and Deputy Bruton about the guarantees and the borrowings, I would inform the House that ICC borrowings, including their deposits, are all State guaranteed at present, apart from a relatively small amount borrowed from the Exchequer.  I am sure the Deputies agree that it would be invidious not to guarantee new borrowings and deposits over £800 million where the existing borrowings and deposits had the benefit of the guarantee. ICC is a bank and as such, it is important that all its depositors and lenders are treated the same.</P>
      <P>I share the view that we should be getting away &mdash; and have been getting away as much as possible in recent times &mdash; from providing State guarantees but in this case it is clear we are dealing with a bank.  When we see what the consultants suggest in relation to future options, that is a matter that will, no doubt, be taken into account.  Deputy Taylor asked what would be the future of ICC.  As I have already said I will not guess at what the options will be.  We will look at all the options when they are on the table and take everything into account and I hope we will make the best decision for the future of ICC.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor raised also the question of default.  If the State guarantee was called upon the company would be liable for the amount to the Exchequer.  That is the position.  The share capital has been £12 million since 1986 against borrowings of almost £800 million.  I do not think there is any great element of disagreement on what we are trying to achieve.Everybody recognises that at £785 million we must increase their borrowing limit beyond £800 million to allow them to continue to do business and at the same time look at what the best future is for ICC.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputy Rabbitte and others at this stage that all we have done is to seek tenders from the various consultancy and financial service houses.  We have not set the terms of reference as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was raised earlier in relation to ACC.  The ACC will have to be looked at and will have to be legislated for, I hope between now and the end of the year.  The market in which they are <Col N="614" /> expected to operate has changed drastically from what it was when they were set up; ICC are in a somewhat similar position.  The ACC will be examined in preparation for the nineties.  That is the position as it stands.  I think I have responded to the various points raised by the Deputies.</P>

If, for argument's sake, something went seriously wrong with ICC &mdash; I do not suggest for one moment that it has or will, but some insurance companies and banks have fallen by the wayside &mdash; where there were substantial creditors the Minister would have to pay up to the company.  If a question arose as to who <Col N="615" /> would have priority for the remaining funds and if the Minister had security for his guarantee &mdash; the 1958 Act put in a provision specially to invite him to do so &mdash; the Minister, that is the taxpayer, would have a priority position in having recourse to the assets in that company.  If he did not bother to avail of the power given to him in section 3 of the 1958 Act the taxpayer could be at a serious loss. Has the Minister availed of the power given to him to secure the taxpayer?</P>

      <P>The amendment eliminates the explicit provision for interest which section 19 (1) (b) originally made in the context of compensation for the compulsory acquisition of a derelict site under the Bill.  The Derelict Sites Act, 1961, contains no provision on the lines of paragraph (b) of section 19 (1) and on that basis it is arguable that paragraph (b) is not essential.</P>

      <P>This amendment corrects a drafting error.  The intention of paragraph (a) of section 23 (3) was to fix the amount of the derelict site levy at 3 per cent for the first year in which the levy will operate. Instead, paragraph (a) referred incorrectly to the first local financial year after the passage of the Act.  Section 23 (1) already provides that the levy shall begin on such year as may be provided by the Minister.  It is essential that the initial 3 per cent rate of levy should be co-ordinated with this provision and that is what the amendment sets out to do.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7) Where urban land ceases to be derelict at any time during a local financial year, the amount of the derelict site levy referred to in subsection (3) shall as respects that urban land be reduced by an amount determined by the formula&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not sure what the procedure is at this stage because we are dealing with amendments from the Seanad.  Perhaps the Chair might be a little more relaxed in his interpretation of the rules of the House now than he was earlier.  Am I in order in asking the Minister when the Bill, if enacted, will be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to implement it as quickly as possible. Something will have to be done in so far as co-ordination of the register is concerned.It is our hope that this will be done over the summer and autumn periods.I would like to see it brought into play on 1 January 1991, but it is only possible to make it effective if the register is deemed to be completed.  The levy can then apply from the first day of the financial year subsequent to the register being completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of any regulations or any other measures that may be required between now and 1 January next year, the Minister should not hesitate to come back to the House to seek assistance.  There are far too many people who have lived with the nuisance and annoyance of derelict sites and far too many landlords, including local authorities, who have evaded their responsibilities.This is good legislation.  I am pleased that the Minister has accepted some amendments from the Seanad but somewhat dismayed that it has delayed the passage of this Bill.  If the Bill is better, so be it.  I would hate to think that <Col N="621" /> it might languish with the same degree of lethargy as has afflicted the Building Control Act.  I hope the Minister will ensure that this will be up and running.  Is it proper and correct to say that individual tenants and residents' associations can, independent of local authorities, start to indentify sites which they consider to be derelict for submission in any register that may be compiled by a local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the positive.  It is our intention to have regulations circulated within a few weeks.  We have already completed some elements of the administration of it. The only thing that might delay matters would be the levy.  Everything else will certainly be in place before the start of the next financial year.  The levy is an important matter and it can only apply when the register has been put in place. The regulations will be with the local authorities to do that.  Perhaps we might encourage the local authorities to have the register prepared speedily.  Individuals, communities or associations can make representations to have items put on the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish to delay the passage of this important legislation any longer than necessary.  The implementation of the new legislation will require a lot of work by local authorities in drawing up registers, inspecting sites and so on.  When we last debated this Bill in the House it was asked whether the local authorities have the resources to give effect to the legislation.  I wonder if the Minister has given any further consideration to the point and if, in view of the general welcome for the Bill and the co-operation he has received this evening, <Col N="622" /> he will consider providing the necessary resources to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are satisfied that local authorities have the resources to deal with this matter.  It would be fair to say that local authorities have been expecting this legislation for some time.  Benefits will accrue to them in two ways in that there will be prevention of dereliction and they will be the beneficiaries of any penalties that will accrue.  Some of them could be quite substantial.  I do not think there will be any lethargy on the part of local authorities.  Many of them have been in touch with me in the hope that the matter will be disposed of as quickly as possible.  This is good legislation and it has taken some time for the right Minister to be in charge in order to bring it to the House.</P>

      <P>It got a good passage through the House and has been strengthened by some of the amendments which came from all sides.  It will be very important legislation in the armoury of local authorities and the Government in the prevention of dereliction and improving matters in urban areas.  I welcome the support of Deputies in this matter.</P>

Presumably when we complete our business the President will sign the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to circularise the local authorities, perhaps in advance of the regulations formally being made, to advise them to undertake preliminary work in the identification of sites.  The target of 1 January should be met but we are now heading into the summer months and if they do not commence the necessary work until September there might be great difficulty in meeting the timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill has finally completed its legislative passage. I do not want to spoil the Minister's night but in fairness to colleagues on this side of the House I should remind him that <Col N="623" /> this Bill was not produced by him until we published a Private Members' Bill. We have had a very constructive debate and the Minister has been open to changes which have produced a better Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Bill will now go on to the Statute Book.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the failure of the Government to explain the lack of response to the application for the extradition of Donna Maguire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Donna Maguire extradition case is a further example of the Government's ambivalence on extradition.Requests for a clear statement on the facts of this case have been met with evasion.  Ultimately brief statements from Government sources, none of which gave the facts and which are themselves conflicting, were issued.  The refusal to give basic facts has been justified on totally spurious grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am seeking are matters of fact relative to the actions of the Minister <Col N="624" /> for Justice and not matters of prejudice affecting a person now facing criminal charges in another jurisdiction.  It is important to recall that this Government had no difficulty issuing a full statement on the Patrick Ryan case in December 1988 outlining the basic facts, but of course that statement was issued to justify a refusal to extradite.</P>
    <P>The West German authorities now say they are flabbergasted by the actions of this Government, who stand indicted not just in this country but before the international community.  It is clear that the Government have no interest in ensuring effective extradition procedures or in combating international terrorism.  Why has the Minister failed to justify his actions &mdash; or inactions &mdash; in dealing with this case?</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there were three statements.  The first emanated from the Department of the Taoiseach.  I heard it said it was on the authority of the Attorney General but the copy furnished does not bear his name.  It merely stated that in this case the appropriate procedures had been followed.  No other information was given.  Then we had a further statement or non-statement from a spokesperson from the Department of Justice.  Whether this was on the authority of the Minister for Justice has not been explained.  Here again we have a repetition of the wording, that the appropriate procedures were followed and the Minister was setting up a committee &mdash; enough to get him a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning &mdash; appearing to give the impression that he was taking some action but again not giving the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>The third Government source statement emanated from á member of the Progressive Democrats.  He came up with a view which seemed to conflict totally with the other two statements in that not alone did he not repeat the standard phrase in the other statements that the appropriate procedures were followed, he suggested that there were no such procedures and no extradition could have taken place.</P>
    <P>I am seeking the facts, not matters of prejudice, affecting this person.  The basic facts the Minister should furnish <Col N="625" /> include whether a request for the extradition of this person was made, by whom it was made, when it was made, whether the Minister, pursuant to the Act, sought further information in relation to such request and whether the Minister made an order pursuant to section 26 of the Extradition Act; if not why not?  Was a warrant issued?  These are the facts on which the Minister has been very coy indeed.  Spurious reasons have been produced for ensuring that no facts have been given by the Minister.  I emphasise I am talking about matters of fact, not prejudice.  It was very clear that in 1988 this Government were trying to justify the non-extradition of Patrick Ryan and they were able, through the Office of the Attorney General, as recorded in this House on 13 December 1988, to issue a 16 page statement outlining fully the facts at that time, despite the fact that included in that statement was a reference to serious charges still to a be faced by Patrick Ryan which were a matter for investigation by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion I can come to is that there has been an attempt by the Minister to cover up his failure to discharge his responsibility as provided for in the Extradition Act and by international obligation.  Corroboration for this conclusion comes from, firstly, the failure to make the full facts known; secondly, the three conflicting statements issued from Government sources; thirdly his apparent failure to notify the West German authorities who as recently as yesterday said they were flabbergasted by the Minister's reaction &mdash; or non-reaction &mdash; to their request and, fourthly, by his refusal to participate in Tuesday night's &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme to explain his action or inaction on this application.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the Extradition Act, 1965, sets out clearly the statutory responsibility of the Minister for Justice. Under that section he has three options. The first option provides that he shall by order signify to a justice of the District Court that a request has been made, whereupon the district justice issues a warrant.  That arises if he does not pursue the other two options.  The second option is that he may seek further information <Col N="626" /> and set a time limit for the receipt thereof.  The third option is that he may refuse the request on certain grounds.  He now says in one of these statements that he did not refuse the request, so that is that option out of the way.  That leaves two options.  The Minister has a duty and an obligation in relation to his statutory responsibility here to tell us what he did, if anything.  Did he pursue the second option?  Did he seek further information? Did he set a time limit?  If he did so, although it seems strange that the West German authorities should be flabbergasted at the moment about his inaction in the matter, let him tell us.  The only other option then open under the Act, if he did not pursue option No. 2, was to make an order and refer the matter to a district justice to issue a warrant.</P>
    <P>I come to the third Government source statement in this matter, the Progressive Democrat statement.  If that is correct, why did the Minister not say it?  Why was such a point not issued on the Minister's authority that that was the problem in relation to this application?  Further questions arise.  If that was the reason, why did he not tell the West German authorities? Why did he not tell the public here?  Most important of all, why did he not take remedial action in relation to the amendment of the regulation which was pinpointed in that statement?</P>
    <P>Why does this ambivalence continue while the murders and bombings continue both on this island and on the Continent?We are talking about the killing of people young and old, from eight month old babies to 80 year olds, some of them Irish, some of them British, some of them Australian.  Nationality does not seem to matter.  Murder most foul is being commited by people who have no mandate from anyone but themselves and are answerable to neither God nor man.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael position on extradition is very clear.  We believe extradition is essential to defeat terrorism and serious crime.  It should be a standard part of the relationship between civilised countries. There are two main approaches necessary, through international bodies such as the Council of Europe in having tighter conventions and through the EC to <Col N="627" /> increase co-operation and on the domestic front to get rid of the obvious loopholes in our domestic law.  The Government stand indicted before the Dáil, before the country, and now before the international community.  This case discloses, first, a cover-up.  It would never have come to light were it not for the fact that it was revealed by the West German authorities.  Secondly, we have ambiguous, evasive and conflicting statements from Government sources.  Out of that morass of evasion I want the truth in relation to the Minister's actions &mdash; or lack of them.  What are the facts of this case?  How did it happen?  The Minister is before the bar of this House to explain his actions and I demand a full and comprehensive response from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify the Government's position in this matter. Deputies will appreciate that as the person concerned in this is currently facing criminal charges before a court in Belgium and as there have been indications that she will be the subject of extradition proceeding between Germany and Belgium, I must of necessity avoid any comments on the facts or circumstances of the case which could conceivably prejudice those judicial proceedings.  We in this House have already had occasion to be conscious of those dangers in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government issued a statement on this matter on 18 June and a further statement was issued by a spokesperson of my Department yesterday with my approval.  What I hope has been made clear in those statements is that extradition requests are dealt with in accordance with the law of the country to which the application is made.  Ireland is not unique in this regard.  The position in all countries is that extradition requests are subject to the law of the requested state. In this case Irish law applies and Irish law in this context reflects the relevant international law, namely the European Convention on Extradition and the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  Ireland is a party to both those conventions and fully subscribes to their <Col N="628" /> provisions.  The operation of extradition arrangements is not a simple matter either here or elsewhere.  It is generally recognised that such arrangements must have regard to certain basic legal rights which every citizen is entitled to.  The relevant legal and procedural requirements must be met before a successful application for extradition can be made before the courts.  No state has an automatic, conveyour belt type extradition system.  Every state has built into its legal system some form of examination of extradition applications to ensure that they comply with the law.  Some continental countries go so far in ensuring the protection of the rights of their own nationals who are the subject of extradition requests as to refuse to extradite them in any circumstances.  All states need to examine extradition requests carefully and this invariably takes time.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate the need for particular care in the examination of extradition requests when the requesting state has a completely different legal system from that of the state receiving the request.  Any suggestion that an extradition application in the case in question was refused is without foundation. I want to outline briefly to the House what happened in this case.</P>
    <P>The application for extradition was received here and examined thoroughly by the relevant legal advisers.  I have already outlined to the House the reason such a thorough examination is required. When the legal advisers on the matter had satisfied themselves as to the action that should be taken the application was dealt with in the appropriate way.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look to the future and be as constructive as possible about the question of any future applications for extradition which we may receive from Germany.  We want to make sure that any difficulties which might arise in such cases, because of the fundamentally different legal systems which operate here and in Germany, should be minimised and, if possible, avoided altogether.  For this reason we have made proposals to the German authorities that a special working group of senior officials from the Irish and Bonn Governments should meet to see what improvements <Col N="629" /> can be made in the arrangements for extradition between our two countries.</P>

      <P>Gaelscoil de hÍde, which was established around 1985, has 146 pupils, who attend up to fourth class, and five teachers.  The school is located in the old vocational school which is the property of Cork County Vocational Education Committee.  This school is supported strongly by Cairde de hÍde, a local support group, who over the past number of years have raised somewhere between £25,000 and £30,000 for Gaelscoil de hÍde.  The teachers in the school and the inspectors from the Department all agree that the vocational school is a suitable building for this school.</P>
      <P>Everything was going fine for the school until last week when, at a meeting of Cork County Vocational Education Committee, which was held at Scoil Mhuire in Ballingeary, the CEO quoted from correspondence he had received from the Department of Education regarding the properties which are not being used by the VEC.  That correspondence contained a directive to the CEO to dispose of these properties, including the old vocational school in Fermoy and the eight acres of land in Mallow.  I will refer later to this land.</P>
      <P>When I asked the CEO about the future of Gaelscoil de hÍde he said that it was a matter for the committee of Gaelscoil de hÍde and the Department of Education.  I have been assured by the CEO that it is his intention to dispose of these properties and, as any capital works which need to be carried out by the VEC will have to be adjusted by any amounts paid by the Department, it is his intention to dispose of the school as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister to purchase this premises from the VEC.  This issue calls into question the overall promotion of the Irish language in our schools.  The existing arrangements, management and State funding cannot keep pace with the demands of the increasing number of <Col N="630" /> parents who wish to send their children to Irish speaking schools.  Parents have experienced considerable delays in obtaining sanction for new Gaelscoileanna at primary level and there are even greater difficulties in regard to sanction for second level Gaelscoileanna. Because Gaelscoileanna are obliged to raise a quarter of their funding by way of local or so-called voluntary contributions, this creates particular difficulties for the development of these schools.</P>
    <P>In a European context, there is a need for funding for recognised EC minority languages which would strengthen the position of Irish in our schools and the Community.  Gaelscoileanna can help greatly in this regard.  The enthusiasm of the parents of the children in this school has helped in no uncertain manner and they must take credit for the way in which they have supported the Gaelscoileanna.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the situation in Gaelscoil Thomás Dáibhis in Mallow. Some years ago it was proposed to build a new vocational school in Mallow. Despite the fact that the planning process had reached stage five just because somebody said the numbers were slightly down that school was not proceeded with.  It was envisaged that the Gaelscoil would be accommodated in the new vocational building when it was constructed. Because there has been a substantial increase in the number of pupils attending the Gaelscoil this has meant that temporary buildings have had to be found for them.  This school is experiencing some serious problems at present.  I cannot elaborate on them at the moment but when young children are being accommodated in overcrowded conditions which are deemed to be unsuitable, these problems need to be addressed urgently. I appeal to the Minister to address the problems being experienced by the Gaelscoil in Mallow where, as I said previously, the interest in Gaelscoileanna is growing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to this school. This Gaelscoil was established on local initiative in September 1984 when it <Col N="631" /> received provisional recognition from my Department.  At present it has a staff of a principal plus four assistant teachers with an enrolement of 150 approximately. It is expected that a fifth assistant teacher will be appointed with effect from 1 September 1990.  The school received permanent recognition in March 1988 and since the end of December 1987 it has been accommodated in part of the former vocational school in Fermoy.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the provision of a suitable permanent home for the Gaelscoil has been under consideration for some time.  The school authorities have advised my Department's Primary Buildings Branch that they wish to occupy the former VEC building on a permanent basis.  The Department's professional staff, both inspectors and architects, have surveyed and examined the building and have been giving the matter full consideration.  One of the difficulties with this building is that even if the Gaelscoil were to grow beyond its present strength, there would be quite a number of rooms surplus to their long term requirements.  This would give rise to upkeep and maintenance and heating problems and associated costs.  Some renovations and improvements would also be needed to the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of what would be the best long-term accommodation <Col N="632" /> option for the Gaelscoil in the circumstances needs to be looked at further in consultation with the Department's professional staff and the vocational financial section.  It will be necessary as well to consult with the County Cork Vocational Education Committee before a final decision can be taken.  I accept readily that the school authorities are very anxious about the present uncertainties and that their future from an accommodation point of view be properly settled without delay.  I wish to put on the record my appreciation, and that of my Department, of the schools wholehearted commitment to the fostering of primary education through the medium of Irish in Fermoy and indeed the whole Gaelscoileanna movement throughout the country.  I will arrange for the matter to be brought to a conclusion at the earliest possible date and a decision conveyed to the school authorities with the minimum of delay.  I acknowledge that there has been some delay already but the case has a number of difficulties associated with it.</P>
    <P>In view of the Deputy's interest in the matter I will let him know when there have been developments.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 June 1990.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> The procedures for the regulation of dumping at sea in the north-east Atlantic are governed by the Oslo Convention to which Ireland is a contracting party.

    <P>At present three Irish based companies have been authorised to dump industrial waste at sea.  One of the companies hopes to have phased out dumping early next year.

      <P>I should preface my reply by informing the Deputy of the fact that in the view of most member states, the &ldquo;positive measures&rdquo; package put forward by the Commission does not, as currently formulated, go far enough towards revitalising the Community fleet.  That being said, however, considerable progress has been achieved in the maritime transport sector during the Irish Presidency:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;A compromise formula put forward <Col N="415" /> by the Irish Presidency for the liberalisation of maritime cabotage has paved the way for the removal of barriers to the freedom to provide services within the Community.  The Presidency proposal meets the concerns of both the Northern member states who have been pressing for liberalisation and of those Mediterranean countries who fear the economic and social consequences of an open regime.  At yesterday's meeting Council noted that the Irish proposal provided a sound basis for detailed technical measures and instructed the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) to proceed on these lines with a view to bringing forward draft Regulations by December 1990.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Broad agreement has been reached on the need to reduce costs associated with vessel transfer between Community registers.  Council welcome the presentation of the Commission's proposals in this regard which will be examined in detail by the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER).</P>
    <P>&mdash;Agreement has also been reached during the Irish Presidency on Community negotiating aims for the Maritime Transport Sector in the context of the proposed General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) which will be concluded in December.</P>
    <P>&mdash;In addition, Council adopted a resolution on measures to prevent maritime casualties resulting in pollution and agreed a Presidency Resolution on concerted Community action to improve the safety of passenger ferries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concern regarding the Galway Bay oyster fishery referred to by the Deputy.  As previously explained to the House, an outbreak of bonamia was confirmed in a specific site in Galway Bay last year.  The outbreak was limited to that specific site and there is no evidence that it has spread.</P>
      <P>Decisive action was immediately taken to deal with that outbreak.  The experience with bonamia, both in Ireland and abroad, is that, while it is difficult to eradicate from a specific site, it can be contained to such a site through a range of containment measures including destocking, controls on movement, etc.</P>
      <P>Following the outbreak of bonamia in Galway Bay last year, the operator was instructed to destock the infected site.  I am satisfied, on the basis of surveys carried out by my Department's scientific staff and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, that this has been done.</P>
      <P>An extensive survey of the immediate area and Galway Bay in general was carried out by my Department after the outbreak.This indicated that the outbreak was confined to the site of the initial outbreak, and had not spread.  A further survey, utilising recently recruited additional staff, is about to be undertaken by the fisheries research centre.</P>
      <P>If these measures are effective, there is no reason to expect any serious damage to the general Galway Bay fishery.  As also pointed out previously, this particular disease poses no threat to human consumption, and the marketing of oysters from this general area need not be disrupted.</P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 39 and 47 together.  In response to a request from my Department, Cork County Council submitted a fishery harbour development programme for County Cork.  Keelbeg pier at Union Hall and Ballycotton harbour have been identified by the council and by my Department as priorities for development.</P>
      <P>In relation to Ballycotton, the immediate priority is to undertake essential repairs, for which I have recently approved a grant.  I cannot say when further development works might commence.</P>
      <P>My Department are seeking an EC contribution of £7.5 million for an overall fishery harbour development programme which forms part of the operational programme for rural development.</P>

      <P>As part of its strategy in creating an awareness of the importance of safety on our waters, my Department is engaging in the dissemination of information by way of press releases to the media, marine notices and booklets or pamphlets on particular aspects of safety, for example, the Fishing Vessel Safety Manual.  I am satisfied from correspondence and from contacts with relevant persons, organisations and groups, both within the Department and outside of it that the Fishing Vessel Safety Manual has been favourably received and that there has been an upsurge in demand for sea survival and safety training courses.  In this sense the objective of the publication is being achieved.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible to estimate the extent to which the manual has been circulated because of the wide distribution network.  Sales through the Government Publications Sale Office and booksellers have been moderate but an initial print of 5,000 is available to fishermen and fishing organisations free of charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Strict controls apply in relation to malachite green.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the substance is classed as pesticide by the Department of Agriculture and Food which means that stringent limits apply in relation to permissible dilutions in drinking water under the terms of the relevant EC Directive on drinking water quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, under the normal planning process for discharge licences and production structures, local authorities would normally review all proposals which involved the possible discharge of <Col N="421" /> malachite green and attach whatever conditions they felt necessary to safeguard the public.  My Department would be consulted in that process.  Ensuring that planning conditions etc. in this regard are adhered to is a matter for the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, as the licensing authority for fish culture operations, my own Department would also have to be satisfied that such operations did not threaten public health.  In this regard, the use of chemicals is monitored carefully.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry is, however, not an intensive user of drugs and chemicals, usage being low level and irregular. The use of malachite green is permitted in all salmonid producing countries.  In this regard the safe limits allowed in the UK are much higher than permitted in this country.  The research available here and elsewhere shows that, if properly used, it poses no risk to public health. There is no evidence available to suggest that its use in this country has had any adverse impact on water quality.  In this regard I would point out that no malachite green was used in the Poulaphuca reservoir in 1989.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which all the agencies involved will, of course, be keeping under close review.</P>

      <P>A feasibility study to examine Ireland's sea and air access transport requirements has been under way for a number of months.</P>
      <P>The study, which examines the means by which disadvantages associated with peripherality can best be combatted, has been jointly funded by the Government and the European Commission.  Its findings, which are expected shortly, will assist in determining future policy options in relation to shipping.  Until the consultants have reported and the Government has studied their conclusions, it would be inappropriate to speculate on future measures which may be introduced.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy however that this Government considers the maintenance of a profitable and efficient Irish merchant fleet to be a major priority.  In 1987 a package of incentives was introduced to encourage investment and expansion in the industry.  The Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987 provides for grants of up to 25 per cent of the purchase cost of new or second hand vessels up to seven years old.  In addition, corporation tax levied on shipping companies has been reduced from 50 per cent to 10 per cent.  This has enabled shipowners to channel profits into the acquisition of additional tonnage.  Shipowners may also avail of funding under the business expansion scheme.</P>
      <P>This commitment to the Irish shipping industry has resulted in an increase of more than 40,000 tons in the capacity of the Irish fleet over the past three years. This represents a percentage increase of almost 30 per cent over the period.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for the control of the five fishery harbour centres and these are being maintained to a satisfactory standard.  The maintenance and control of other fishery harbours is a matter for the relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department's fishery harbour programme provides for major investment in the development of infrastructure in the period 1990 to 1993.  This investment will be used for projects at the fishery harbour centres and at other harbours to ensure that they will be capable of supporting a modern seagoing fishing fleet and all related downstream activities located in their vicinity.</P>

As these indicated, the programme of work and activities they set out was developed and promoted by <Col N="432" /> the EUROPEN Bureau established in my Department to which a full-time director was appointed.  The responsibility for continuing activity under the programme initiated by the bureau now lies with the international division of my Department.</P>

The Government have already allocated a sum of £250,000 for immediate start up costs and it is intended that further funding will be available for 1991 in the light of the programme to be formulated.  Already, a number of publicly funded projects are being envisaged and the Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited have launched a sponsorship programme with leading commercial and industrial companies to which the response has been encouraging.</P>

      <P>Ireland's funding from the EC Structural Funds is guaranteed until 31 December 1993.  No definitive decisions have been taken by the Council of Ministers or the Commission of the European Communities as to the Structural Funds régime which will apply beyond that date.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2052/88 on the co-ordination of the Structural Funds does, however, provide that the Council shall re-examine the regulation five years after its entry into force; and the Commission shall review the list of Objective I Regions &mdash; of which Ireland is one &mdash; in good time before 31 December 1993 in order for the Council, acting on a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, to establish a new list to apply for the period after the five years have elapsed.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Structural Funds are concerned, the prime focus of my attention at this stage is to ensure that the additional Structural Funding between now and 1993 is drawn down in order to implement the development programmes and measures contained in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i>  I am, however, keeping the post-1993 funding situation under close review particularly in the context of the completion of the Internal Market and the moves towards economic and monetary union.  The Deputy can be assured that Ireland will continue to press for special attention to the problems of the poorer and more peripheral regions of the Community in the post-1993 situation.</P>

      <P>The soil research services of Teagasc estimate that an annual usage of up to two million tonnes would be desirable on Irish farms in order to achieve and maintain maximum output from the land.

      <P>Over 80 per cent of non-life insurance undertakings operating in this country are foreign owned while the figure on the life side is over 90 per cent. When the Internal Market is complete further foreign insurers will have access to the Irish market thus intensifying competition on price, cover and quality of service.</P>
      <P>Insurance undertakings, indigenous, foreign established or foreign services must set their premium rates to match their liabilities.  There is no evidence to suggest that foreign insurers would subsidise the Irish market with premium rates which could not meet their liabilities.It can be expected, however, that good risks will generally benefit from lower quotes.</P>

      <P>The greatest impact on Ireland after 1992 will result from the implementation of the Directives listed in the Commission's White Paper of June 1985 on completing the Internal Market.  None of these however come within the direct area of my responsibility.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption of the Single European Act, the Commission at the request of the Council compiled a list of obstacles to an internal energy market. Based on that inventory they outlined the priorities which should be addressed in order to remove the obstacles to the creation of such a market.  In the light of these priorities and with the aim of achieving a Single Market the Commission made a number of proposals in the energy section.</P>
      <P>These proposals were discussed during our Presidency and I am pleased to report that a satisfactory outcome was achieved.</P>
      <P>An electricity Transit Directive and a Directive on Transparency of gas and electricity prices were agreed.  Progress was made in advancing a gas Transit Directive and a satisfactory formula was reached on an investment proposal in the energy sector.</P>

      <P>I consider that it is of primary importance to ensure that completion of the Internal Market results in a real improvement in the living standards and levels of social protection afforded to citizens of the Community and that it does not widen the disparities that exist in this regard between different regions of the Community.  All member states face similar problems in the field of social protection which include high unemployment, the ageing of the population and changes in family structures.  Completion of the internal market will greatly increase the need for countries within the Community to enhance their economic competitiveness and there is the danger that in endeavouring to do so levels of social protection may be reduced in real terms.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, a strategy for the convergence of social protection objectives and policies is being developed at Community level.  The main purpose of this strategy is to promote as far as possible, convergent solutions to the common problems faced by all Member States in the area of social protection with a view to ensuring that existing levels of social protection are at least maintained in real terms and, where possible, improved having regard to economic circumstances.It will also aim to ensure that the future development of social protection systems in the member states of the community contributes to its economic and social cohesion.</P>
      <P>An officer in the planning unit of my Department has been given specific responsibility for policy in this area.  He is a member of an <i>ad hoc</i> group of senior officials from the various member states which officials of the EC Commission are consulting in the course of preparing proposals for appropriate measures. These proposals are due to be submitted to the Council of Ministers before the end of 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> The completion of the Internal Market will also most probably lead to greater mobility of workers in the Community. Freedom of movement may, however, be impeded by the inadequacy of existing arrangements at Community level for the protection of the social security entitlements of workers who move to other member states either to take up employments or, if unemployed, to seek employment.Many highly skilled workers depend to a significant degree for their pension cover on occupational pension schemes and existing EC Regulations on social security do not apply to such schemes.  The protection afforded by these regulations to migrant workers who are unemployed, in particular those unemployed for long periods, are also unduly restrictive.  Officials of my Department are directly involved at Community level in the development of policies to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>The Informal Council of Ministers for Social Security, which I hosted in Ashford Castle on 26-27 April 1990, provided Ministers with an opportunity to focus on the implications of the Single Market for social protection.  The discussions at the Council meeting were based on position papers prepared by the Irish Presidency which dealt with the issues of convergence of social protection objectives and policies and the protection of the social security rights of workers who change jobs and-or move to other member states.  It enabled Ministers to indicate what type of measures are feasible in the area of social protection and what the priorities should be in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>The Commission was asked to expedite work in these areas in consultation with senior officials of the member states, with a view to bringing forward proposals before the end of 1991, in line with the commitments given in this regard in its action programme, relating to the implementation of the Community Charter of Basic Social Rights for Workers.</P>

The chairman of the co-ordinators group has responsibility for the Irish internal co-ordination function in that area.  A programme of matters which are to be concluded so as to achieve free movement by 1993 has been drawn up and considerable progress has been made during the Irish Presidency on its implementation.</P>

Against this background it can be taken that the matter of possible extra funding for the tribunal is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda computerised command and control system for the Dublin Metropolitan Area is a completely up-to-date state-of-the-art police communications system which is of great benefit to the Force and to the public. Every aspect of it has been planned and tailor-made, in consultation with a wide range of Garda managers, to meet the very precisely defined needs of the Force. It combines radio communications and computer systems to record details of all reported incidents which require Garda attention and of the Garda response resources which are available at any particular time.  It also contains a geographic file to assist Garda control room operators to assign the task of responding to a reported incident to the Garda mobile or foot patrol which is closest to the scene.  The system is designed to ensure that the necessary response is as quick and efficient as possible and to enable Garda management to utilise their resources in the Dublin Metropolitan Area with maximum effectiveness by providing them with much greater control over Garda manpower and vehicles in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be expected that the transition from a non-computerised environment to one of advanced technology will give rise to a degree of inconvenience or unease for those affected by the change and any such problems generally disappear when greater experience and familiarity with <Col N="455" /> the operation of the system has been acquired.</P>
    <P>The command and control system is designed to provide that each Garda unit is controlled from one source only.  The use of additional hand sets to provide a second means of control is considered by Garda management to be neither necessary nor desirable.</P>

The success of the Single Market programme will depend on the extent to which the opportunities are grasped and I have stressed this to the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department and also to other transport and tourism interests.  A senior officer of my Department has been appointed with specific responsibility for 1992.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>Transport investment proposals involving expenditure of up to £30 million, mainly in respect of rail projects, have been included in the draft operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure which is being discussed with the European Commission in the context of the EC Structural Funds. These proposals have been prepared on the basis of expected ERDF funding of £15 million for rail and bus projects.</P>
      <P>The main projects included in the draft operational programme are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) provision of new commuter rail services from Clondalkin to the city centre, with eight new stations and feeder bus services to Tallaght, at a cost of £27.3 million.</P>
      <P>(b)  upgrading of the existing commuter rail service from Maynooth to the city, involving the provision of four new stations, at a cost of £0.73 million.</P>
      <P>(c)  construction of a new rail link to certain shipside container facilities at Dublin Port, at a cost of £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Maynooth rail project, I understand that Iarnród Éireann expect to bring the improved services into operation next month.  Further developments in relation to the proposed Clondalkin rail projects or other options and the rail link at Dublin Port must await the outcome of the request for EC aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the level of EC Structural Funds available for public transport projects and the criteria which are being <Col N="466" /> considered for such projects in the draft operational programme, it has not been possible to include all of the investment proposals which were submitted by Iarnrod Éireann for consideration.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to my reply of 12 June to questions on the proposed upgrading of the Dublin/Belfast rail link.</P>
