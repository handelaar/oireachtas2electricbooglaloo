      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 12.  It is also proposed subject to the agreement of the House, that the sitting be suspended today from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Private Members' Business shall be No. 26.</P>

      <P>May I ask if the proposal that the sitting be suspended today from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. is agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, given the reported progress made yesterday in talks in London and the very delicate nature of those talks and proposed talks and accepting the fact that a public debate may not be helpful at this stage, if he would consider giving a <Col N="2" /> briefing to the leaders of the parties in Opposition in relation to these delicate matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I raise with the Taoiseach a matter of major concern in the south west?  Would the Government be prepared today, as a matter of extreme urgency, to have a statement made to the House on the outrageous attacks on our fishermen off the south-west coast and on the steps that can be taken to establish the rule of law on the high seas there? <Col N="3" /> The Taoiseach may or may not be aware that there have been very serious attacks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought yesterday by way of a Private Notice Question and indeed, a request for an Adjournment debate to raise the situation in the occupied territories of the West Bank.  May I ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs if time can be made available today for statements in the House on the situation in the occupied territories and the policies of the Israeli security forces?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this continual disorderly behaviour.  You and I and every Deputy in the House is aware of the fact that the rules of order do not permit you to allow the question or me to answer it.  Deputies such as Deputy De Rossa continually convey the impression that I am mute of malice when that is not the case.  I am not entitled under the rules of order to deal with matters on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise again with the Taoiseach the question of the amending legislation dealing with the clinical trials legislation.  The Taoiseach has promised this legislation repeatedly in the Dáil.  In view of the fact that 28 patients are denied the latest medical treatment because of the delay in this legislation, can he give a commitment that the Bill will be published this week?</P>

This is something the House should debate.  It is time we put our House in order, quite literally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Ryan and I attempted to raise on the Adjournment last night the question of Santry woods and the totally unauthorised felling of trees.  I understand the request for the debate was turned down <Col N="6" /> on the grounds that this is a matter for the local authority.  In view of the urgency of this, would the Taoiseach or the Minister for the Environment when he is next in the House make a short statement on the situation there?  Everyone is very concerned about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the Environment for laying before the House today his regulations under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, setting conditions for the marketing, sale and distribution of fuels in Dublin City.  In the light of the fact that the regulations comprise a total of ten pages and of the very serious implications for the coal industry, workers in the industry and consumers, would the Taoiseach agree to make some time available to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hesitate to muddy the troubled waters of the Taoiseach's temperament this morning but am I in order to inquire of him and his Government when they propose to bring in for Committee Stage the Water Pollution Bill that is necessary for this summer?

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputy Taylor. Amendments Nos. 20 and 24 are alternatives and I am suggesting, therefore, that we discuss together amendments Nos. 1, 20 and 24, by agreement.  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;(1) The Minister may make regulations under this section to provide for an additional special allowance for income tax purposes of an annual sum to be determined by the Revenue Commissioners not exceeding £15,000 in any one tax year in the case of a <Col N="13" /> person who has sustained serious and permanent disablement.</P>
    <P>(2) Regulations made under this section may provide for such consequential, supplementary and ancillary provisions, including provisions modifying any provision of the Income Tax Acts, as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>(3) Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under this section a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has seen fit to accept the thrust of the amendments proposed on this issue by Deputy Rabbitte and me.  The Minister's amendment No. 20 would appear to meet the type of case we have in mind.  It is not confined to the Dunne case, although that case was a primary factor.  In expressing my gratitude to the Minister I am sure I speak for very many people who deeply appreciate this humanitarian gesture by him.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister's amendment apply to cases where compensation would have been made years ago to people who have been left permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally?  I am aware of cases over the years where awards have been made resulting from very serious and permanent injuries.  Are those cases also to be considered?  Subject to the Minister's reply, I will be very happy to accept his amendment and withdraw mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish to acknowledge with gratitude the generous and compassionate response of the Minister for Finance to this very cruel anomaly in the tax code as it has applied.  As a result of his speedy and generous response the Minister will have the heartfelt gratitude not only of the Dunne family but of a significant number of parents &mdash; it may be no more than a couple of hundred &mdash;<Col N="14" /> who are covered by the provisions of his amendment.</P>
      <P>To avoid rising later, I would refer to amendment No. 16 raised by me last Wednesday which allowed this matter to be discussed.  The latter part of the amendment refers to an amendment of the Finance Act, 1969.  I sought in the amendment to raise the threshold for a housekeeper for an incapacitated person from £2,500 to £5,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In an amendment distributed last night the Minister seems to have taken that on board.  I would ask whether there is any change in the wording of the amendment I put forward and the amendment he has tabled for Report Stage.  It seems to meet the situation.  It should be said that since so little is taken on board from the Opposition benches it is gratifying to find on a matter which has such human effect that the Minister is responding in a humane fashion.  It is all very well for us to talk in terms of exemption from tax of compensation settlements in the tragic kinds of cases we instanced but no money can compensate the parents of a severely handicapped child for the tragedy that has befallen them.  They have to look after every need of the child concerned every day of the week.  The Minister has earned the heartfelt gratitude of a great many parents.</P>
      <P>In my amendment I sought to confine the exemption to wards of court.  I do not know if the Minister wishes to comment on the construction of his amendment which seeks to go wider than that.  I welcome the Minister's amendment as it seems to cover any settlement made in the circumstances described where the minor or person is not necesssarily a ward of court.  It is wider than my amendment No. 24.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in this area and draw his attention to the situation of many others <Col N="15" /> who do not have the benefit of awards from the courts &mdash; I refer to covenants of income made to persons who are disabled. Under the present arrangements when a covenant of income is made to a severely disabled child he loses his entitlement to disabled person's maintenance allowance and his entitlement to the special children's allowance for severely handicapped children under the tax provisions.  In the past the Minister went out of his way to make special provisions for disabled children but the benefits of making covenants are brought to nought because of the two losses to which I refer, namely the loss of DPMA and the loss of the child tax allowance.  I know it is too late to include such a provision in this Finance Bill but it is a serious anomaly related to the one with which he is dealing today.  It would be well worth the Minister's while turning his attention to it to see if there could be some resolution to this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward amendment No. 20.  However, there is possibly some unfinished business in this area.  If I read Deputy Taylor's amendment correctly, he is talking about an extra income tax allowance for those people who have sustained serious and permanent disablement. That is a very good proposal because many people who are permanently disabled cannot make any claim whatsoever.  For example, a person who was driving home late at night, who fell asleep at the wheel and drove his car into a ditch may be permanently disabled for life but unfortunately he cannot make a claim for compensation unless he happens to have a personal accident insurance policy, which many drivers may not have.  The income such a person receives from any source other than work will not receive any special treatment in the tax code.  I suppose it is too late to include a provision for such people in this year's Finance Bill but perhaps the <Col N="16" /> Minister will make a note of it and consider the matter between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill next year.</P>

      <P>I will take note of the points raised by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Garland and will look into them between now and next year.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 is a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment and seeks an income tax allowance of up to £15,000 for persons who suffer from a serious or permanent disablement.  The amendment would appear to be motivated by the recent publicity given to the Dunne baby case.  A similar amendment put forward by Deputy Rabbitte on Committee Stage was similarly motivated.  I undertook to have the matter looked at sympathetically before Report Stage and I have put down amendment No. 20 to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 19 results from an undertaking I gave in the course of the Committee Stage debate to consider sympathetically the proposals to increase the allowance in respect of a person employed to look after an incapacitated taxpayer or his incapacitated spouse.  As I informed the House on Committee Stage, this allowance was last increased in 1985.  Having considered the matter, I now propose to increase the allowance from its present level of £2,500 to £5,000, as suggested in an amendment put forward by Deputy Rabbitte on Committee Stage.  The cost of increasing the level from £2,500 to £5,000 will be £120,000 in 1990 and £200,000 in a full year and will affect about 200 taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 20 arises from the discussion on Committee Stage last week of the tax treatment of income of incapacitated taxpayers from the investment of lump sums received in court awards or out-of-court settlements in personal injury claims.  The argument was made that such investment income should not be the subject of income tax. I indicated at the time that I was sympathetic to the case being made and amendment No. 20 is the result of my consideration of the matter.  The amendment exempts from income tax the income arising to permanently and totally incapacitated taxpayers from the investment of their court awards or out-of-court settlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> The section applies where the income in question forms the sole or main income of the taxpayer.  Lump sum awards in such cases are, of course, already tax free.  The amendment meets the many arguments made that the investment income arising from them should not be the subject of tax.  I understand that Deputies on all sides of the House were anxious to see an improvement in the tax treatment of the investment income of such taxpayers and that the introduction of such an amendment would be welcome to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;As respects the year 1990-91 and subsequent years of assessment, section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989 shall not apply to loans where the annual interest rate exceeds 10 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I raised the issue of the heavy imposition of mortgage interest on many householders and I put down an amendment which proposed that full mortgage interest relief should be restored by the non-application of section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987, and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>I am not dealing with the same issue but with a different type of amendment. since the original Committee Stage amendment was rejected I am now proposing, in circumstances where interest rates would go above 10 per cent, that full relief would be restored.</P>
      <P>When the present Minister reduced mortgage interest relief in the Finance Act, 1989, he argued that he was justified in doing so because interest rates had fallen and they had but, as we all know, they have gone up four times in the last 12 months.  The future is uncertain.  That increase of 4 per cent over 12 months has meant that those on the average mortgage of £35,000 are paying in excess of £100 per month more.  That figure must be found after tax.  If one looks at the overall effect on the budget of a household one will see that the Minister is wiping out a tranche of salary of between £2,000 and £3,000, depending on the tax rate of those involved.  The person on the top rate of tax will have to find £1,200 net per annum and, obviously, the amount of salary dedicated to mortgage repayments will be higher than that.  It will be an extremely heavy imposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> The Minister sought to justify the reduction by arguing that interest rates had gone down and it follows that now that they have gone back up, the interest relief should be restored.  I have in mind the introduction of some type of trigger mechanism so that when interest rates reach a certain level mortgage relief will be brought back for home loans.  Mortgage interest relief is given a year in retrospect although it can be given by the Revenue on an estimate.  In my view it is possible to decide at the year end what the average rate over the year was. Obviously, I do not want the Revenue to have to look at the mortgage interest rate applying each day, but it would not be difficult to work out a system taking the rate for six months or three months.  If the rates go below 10 per cent that should trigger in sections 6 and 7 of the respective Acts and the mortgage holder would be paying a lot less in interest.  The loss of the relief could be absorbed.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if mortgage interest relief was fully restored but in the uncertain circumstances of interest rates something needs to be done.  On Committee Stage the Minister pointed out that until recently interest rates were used as a means of controlling inflation in terms of fiscal management.  He made the point strongly that interest rates are increased now to stop money flowing from one economy to another.  If that is so we are in a great uncertainty about interest rates with events in other countries by and large declining our interest rates.  In that event we will not have great control over the absolute levels of interst rates although we might have control over the differentials that will exist between our rates and those of other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address this issue, particularly in relation to the discussions we have had about tax reform.  The conventional wisdom is that all that matters is the rate at which one pays the tax.  I met many people who thought they would get tax reductions following the last budget but were surprised when their April cheques came through in the first week in May.  As far as they are concerned they are paying more tax than last year.  The <Col N="22" /> Minister has brought down the standard and higher rates of tax but he did not index the allowances.  By not indexing the allowances he has left a type of fiscal drag under which he is pulling more out of people's pockets.</P>
    <P>Mortgage interest relief is down to 80 per cent of what it was in 1987 and in section 4 of the Bill as published he is halving the relief on insurance.  The income tax sections of the budget were presented very well and it looked as if something serious was being done about income tax.  However, the table at the back page of the <i>Principle Features of the Budget</i> containing the Estimates from the Department of Finance showed that, to use Deputy Rabbitte's phrase, in the heel of the reel Irish income taxpayers in 1990 would be paying £100 million more than they paid in 1989.  What magic did the Minister use to cut the rates and at the same time collect £100 million more from income taxpayers?</P>
    <P>The Minister will collect that amount because there is buoyancy in the system. Secondly, interest rates have gone up dramatically and because of that the take from DIRT has gone up dramatically. That take comes under the income tax figures.  However, by not indexing the allowances for inflation, reducing the life assurance allowance and maintaining the reduction in mortgage interest relief the Minister has brought about a situation where those who thought they would gain a lot gained very little.  There is great disappointment among income taxpayers. The best way to judge the income tax effects of a budget is to meet workers leaving a factory in the second week in April.  As they looked at their pay packets this year they remarked, &ldquo;he told us we would be paying a lot less this year but we are paying more&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister, like all Ministers for Finance, faces another problem in connection with the budget.  The PRSI contributions are taken over ten months rather than 12 months and in February the PRSI holiday comes in.  In April people pay the full whack of PRSI and even if the Minister on budget day gave a serious tax reduction the cheque people <Col N="23" /> received that month would give the impression that what the Minister said on budget day was untrue.  That impression is created because the take in April is bigger than the take in February and March, even if one includes the concessions in the budget.  I accept that there are technical problems involved but if PRSI was stopped on a 12-month basis it would benefit everybody.  It would do other things about absenteeism in the early months of the year also.  The Minister should look at this and not just for reasons of presentation.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about tax reform and we are reaching the stage where there is not a high credibility among taxpayers that either the Minister or the House is serious about reforming the tax system.  People greeted the first reduction in rates, particularly in the standard rate, with a certain degree of excitement.  The commitment to continue to reduce the standard rate to 25 per cent was seen as a serious commitment by the Government but there is a realisation now that it does not mean that much in take home pay.  If the allowances are not increased in line with inflation, and mortgage interest relief, life assurance relief and, maybe, VHI relief are to be watered down, the ordinary taxpayer who may be paying at a lower rate or at the higher rate will be paying the same amount of tax and, sometimes, more tax.</P>
    <P>The steam is going out of tax reform and the public are quite sceptical about it.  I should like to have a serious debate on the place of allowances &mdash; life assurance, mortgage interest and VHI payments &mdash; in the tax code.  It is all about choices and if you go for lower standard rates &mdash; which is now the fashion in relation to tax reform &mdash; and if you pay for that rate by not indexing allowances and by reducing the special allowance you collect the same amount of tax but there is a difference in who pays it.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy Noonan but it is quite <Col N="24" /> clear that he is ranging wide of his amendment and going into the whole area of tax reform, which is hardly appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept your advice, A Cheann Comhairle. People with mortgages have been particularly affected by rises in interest rates and are really feeling the pinch.  They are paying significantly more than they expected &mdash; or were paying &mdash; 12 months ago.  The Minister will tell me that the average person with a home loan is not bearing a heavy imposition but, of course, averages always disguise more than they reveal because when you talk about averages you are talking about people in the last year of a mortgage which they took out 24 years ago and who owe £500 or £600.</P>
      <P>The people who are really hit are first time mortgage holders and, quite frequently, they are also high taxpayers with the result that it takes both spouses to service the mortgage.  I recommend this amendment to the Minister, he will say there are technical problems but they can be overcome either by changing the amendment or by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I will be parting company with Deputy Noonan later as we deal with the corporate tax area, I support this amendment.  I also had an amendment down on this important matter on Committee Stage.  Indeed, during the course of moving that amendment I read a letter to the House from what I suggested was a typical, hard pressed mortgagee who recommended that a stepped interest relief scheme was probably the best that he and people like him could hope for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan has now put forward something along those lines by saying that when interest rates rise above 10 per cent, mortgagees should qualify for full relief.  The reason I support it is that basically my approach to this question has been characterised by two objectives. One was to lift people in the poverty trap out of the tax net and the second was to try to shift some of the burden of the PAYE sector to other sections of society <Col N="25" /> who can afford to pay a greater share.  In talking about mortgages in the sense that Deputy Noonan outlined here is to talk predominantly about the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Of course there are some people in that category who can well afford to survive the difference between 80 per cent relief on the interest and 100 per cent. As the House will recall, I tried on Committee Stage to provide for that by suggesting that relief would obtain at the standard rate and that, accordingly, some benefit would be given to those most in need compared to people who could well afford to pay.  The Minister did not find that acceptable and we are now discussing this very important matter with a different amendment which seeks to give relief for the period that interest rates are higher than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is real hardship among mortgagees. On the last occasion we dealt with the accelerating phenomenon of repossessing homes and the question of interest relief on mortgages.  While there may not be a connection between the two things, a great many people fear the inevitability of their home being repossessed because of the apparent inevitable spiral of interest rates.  The difference for them between being able to hold on to their house in the situation of the limited mortgage relief at present and the 100 per cent could very well be the making of a very hard choice between holding on to their home in which they have made a major investment decision and denying their children and themselves some of the essentials of life.</P>
    <P>In the letter I read to the House on the last occasion the mortgagee had a mortgage of less than £30,000 &mdash; the typical mortgage is about £33,500 &mdash; and he said that it would cost him £130 per month more than when this Government came to power.  There have been four increases in interest rates since last June.  A sum of £130 in the bracket of average industrial earnings is a very significant amount, relatively speaking, and it can make the difference between people being able to provide their children with the essentials and keeping a roof over their heads.  For that reason, it is an important element of <Col N="26" /> the tax debate this year because I do not think the same situation applied last year. At that time we had experienced a continued decline in interest rates but a rise four times since then is a very heavy burden.  The Minister should have taken the thrust of what was said on board and given relief to people who are caught in the terrible dilemma of the prospect of losing their homes.  More and more people are fearful and apprehensive in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Deputy Noonan's amendment.  The Labour Party also had an amendment down on Committee Stage dealing with the question of mortgage interest relief.  As has been said, some families are in danger of losing their homes &mdash; and indeed will lose them &mdash; as a result of the increases in mortgage interest rates which have taken place over the past year, coupled with the reduction in the interest relief to 80 per cent.</P>
      <P>A far wider category exists, those whose living standards have been eaten away by the escalation of interest rates over the last year.  That is an undeniable fact and a very widespread phenomenon. People's living standards, their basic needs by way of food, clothing, education and so on, have been eaten away by having to meet substantially increased payments to building societies, local authorities, banks, financial institutions and so on.  It would have been better had there been a general reform of the taxation system; I do not mean piecemeal reductions here that suit some better than others but a reform across the whole tax spectrum.  One might then not look at mortgage interest in isolation.  But when we do deal with these items piecemeal, as unfortunately we do here, then we must ascertain how it affects the average working family living in average or working-class-type houses.  The fact is that they are put at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first priority of any family has to be the preservation of their home, and other things suffer.  I have spoken to many people, people who are in low paid or even not so low paid employment, who have felt the chill of these increasing <Col N="27" /> building society and other repayments over the past year.  It has hit them.  Their living standards have been reduced over the past year.  The tax concessions granted in this budget have not affected their position in that respect to any appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>It would have been better had the objective which Deputies Noonan, Rabbitte and I sought on Committee Stage been limited to those who need it, so that very expensive houses and people in receipt of very high incomes could have been excluded from any benefit.  That does not apply in the case of the amendment before the House.  In that respect the amendment is lacking somewhat in that it applies equally to a person in receipt of a very high income as another in receipt of a very low income; it benefits both equally.  That is not equitable but it is the best proposition at present before us.  In the interests of equity, of endeavouring to preserve the living standards of people who have been adversely affected, we will be supporting Deputy Noonan's amendment, it being the best available at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputies who have spoken already I had an amendment tabled on Committee Stage similar to theirs.  I will be supporting Deputy Noonan's amendment although I would have grave reservations about it.  As the Minister has not reconsidered his position we have no choice but to settle for some kind of second-class solution.  Like Deputy Taylor I am conscious of the fact that perhaps some people who could well afford such payments will also benefit from this proposal.  Had the Minister taken my suggestion on board that this relief, like all allowances, should be granted at the standard rate only, that would have catered for the circumstances. On balance I contend this amendment is worthy of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may add my voice to those of others in asking the Minister to reconsider the whole matter <Col N="28" /> of mortgage interest relief.  Since the prevailing mortgage interest rate is around the 11.95 per cent to 12.95 per cent mark on houses, it is obvious that the property market in the Dublin area is slowing down considerably.  There is no doubt that people find it extremely difficult to meet these increased interest rates.</P>
      <P>In this country we are lacking a proper overall housing policy.  Most people must either place their name on a local authority housing list, when the State must fund the total cost of construction of a house when they are eventually allocated one or, alternatively, resort to the private sector in order to purchase their own home.  It is not commonplace here for people to rent private accommodation with a proper lease, but it is an acceptable part of the lifestyle in other European countries.  In my view it is much better to encourage people to buy their homes, thereby relieving the State of the obligation of funding the overall cost of building houses for them.  But, if we want them to do so, we must provide them with some incentive.</P>
      <P>I have listened to certain economists maintain that the whole concept of providing mortgage interest relief is not a good one; were we to use the money saved by its abolition in reducing tax rates, it would be more beneficial to the ordinary individual.  An economist might think that way but I, as a politician, do not think that way.  That amounts to saying to somebody with family responsibilities &mdash; who is endeavouring to do the best for their family by way of providing good accommodation for them: we will take tax relief from you; we will do so by reducing tax rates spread among people who do not provide for themselves, people who do not accept the same level of responsibility in terms of providing a home for their family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may be the best solution in the minds of economists but we must take into account the advice we receive from professionals, listen to the people we represent and ensure that a balance is struck. I am in favour of supporting the individual who provides a home for his family and would encourage them even more <Col N="29" /> so.  If we persist in making it unattractive for people to take on this responsibility then the State will find that people will be living in bad housing conditions with knock-on effects &mdash; such as children endeavouring to study in the evening without any proper accommodation and so on.  I would invite any Member to examine some of our flat accommodation and ask themselves: if I were studying for my leaving certificate, endeavouring to acquire 26 points, would I go home to some of these places and endeavour to find a corner in which to study?  Then, it will be clearly seen that there is a downstream effect by way of damage to young people and their futures.  Ultimately it places a greater responsibility on the State to provide more local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is wise and is certainly not in the interests of the people we represent.  The Minister should think long and hard before taking the advice being given, not in any malicious manner, by our economist friends who tell us it would be much better to utilise this money in reducing tax rates.  That may be the case for some people but, by and large, not for those we represent. The more liability one places on the shoulders of those who must provide a home for their families the more it will reflect, in the longer term, in the level of wage demands when it comes to the next phase of the national wage agreement which I fully support.  Obviously the more I lose from my wage packet weekly or monthly the more I will need in terms of wage increases to compensate me.  Were I a member of a trade union and found that my monthly income had been reduced by, say, £100 or £150 as a result of increased mortgage interest rates, then I would be endeavouring to have my union demand a higher wage increase to compensate me for that loss in order just to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  It is important that the State examine the overall position in regard to the provision of tax incentives to people to take out mortgages. We must remember it is not a question merely of benefit to the individual. We must also take into account its <Col N="30" /> social effects in terms of proper housing, the type of family circumstances it will create and so on.</P>
    <P>At our clinics we have to listen to people looking for local authority housing describe the horrible housing conditions in which they live and can see in the faces of those unfortunate people the strain being put on their marriages.  There is no doubt in my mind that bad housing conditions ultimately lead to broken marriages and instability in the family set-up which in turn has consequences for the economy and the type of society in which we live.  As I said, they also lead to demands for higher wage increases which, if granted, will affect the rate of inflation which, in turn, will affect the economy.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting the reasonable amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, on this issue.  I sincerely hope he will listen carefully to what is being said on all sides of the House on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this amendment. Obviously I will be supporting it and wish to give my reasons for doing so.  I imagine the conditions prevailing in rural Ireland are very different from those in towns. One of the great traditions in rural Ireland is that people supply their own houses.  It is my experience that many young people build small dwellings because a grant is available for such a dwelling, and this helps to reduce the cost and the overall financial considerations.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, because of an over-supply of labour, wage levels have been suppressed.  It took some time for this to have an effect but it is remarkable that in recent years the market has responded.  Having regard to the fact that wage levels are suppressed and interest rates are very high at present many families are under extreme pressure repaying their mortgages.  That is my experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest demand for local authority housing is from single parents.  I have come across many cases where families have broken up and it would seem from the investigations I have carried out that the problems arose out of an inability <Col N="31" /> to control finances and repay mortgages. It is clear from my discussions with the local authorities in my area that the greatest demand for housing is from single parent families and their problems seem to arise from the difficulties they encounter in trying to repay their mortgages.</P>
    <P>If the level of mortgage interest relief is not increased we will be handing over this problem, which could easily be dealt with in this Bill, to the local authorities. It is clear that the amount expended on the provision and maintenance of housing in future years will be far greater than it would be if the Minister decides to amend the Bill now.  The Government seem very anxious that the local authorities should become less involved in the provision of housing.  If that is the case the Minister would be wise to look at this amendment. I give my full support to this amendment and hope the Minister will listen to the case being made and will respond to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendment.  We are very conscious of the fact that the level of mortgage interest relief has been kept at 80 per cent but this will have disastrous consequences for those buying their own houses.  The House may recall that in his Budget Statement last year the Minister indicated he was reducing the level of mortgage interest relief because of the low rates of interest prevailing.  However I can quote several instances where mortgage repayments have increased by £100 per month since last year's budget.  The Minister can remedy this matter and restore mortgage interest relief to the pre-1987 level for those people who provide their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county of Westmeath, there are 240 families on the local authority housing list but this year the county council are only going to build ten houses.  If the public sector are not going to provide houses, then the onus will rest on the individual to supply his own house.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment and to restore mortgage interest relief to the level needed to encourage people to <Col N="32" /> buy their own houses.  As the Government are not in a position to supply houses, I ask the Minister to look at this amendment which presents him with an opportunity to restore mortgage interest relief for the full amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to set aside the restrictions on mortgage interest relief imposed by section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987, and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989 &mdash; the relief currently stands at 80 per cent of the amount which would otherwise be allowable &mdash; where the rate of interest is greater than 10 per cent per annum.  I have already outlined why I do not propose to restore the relief to its pre-1987 level, given the major progress made in reducing income tax in recent years.  I have listened attentively to the debate and it is well worth putting some figures on the record at this stage so that Deputies will appreciate what exactly is happening.</P>
      <P>There have been calls for full indexation. This does not necessarily mean that this is the way I should be going in tax reform rather than reducing the rates. One of the problems is the width of the bands in that one reaches the higher rates of tax too soon.  Personal allowances have been left untouched.  Full indexation in 1990 would cost £40.6 million.  My budget scheme will cost £120.4 million.  The cost of indexation in a full year would be £67.7 million.  The cost of the 1990 budget scheme in a full year is £200.7 million. The Deputies have quite rightly said that it does not matter in which way interest relief is given as long as we give more.  It is clear that if I had stuck with indexation I could have gone a long way towards reducing the budget deficit but I did not. We have gone far beyond it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister did not stick to it because he did not do it.  One cannot use one side of the argument only.  I know it is a good political argument at the moment because interest rates are high.  I recognise the problems.  I recognise that people, maybe, miscalculated the position and <Col N="33" /> felt that low interest rates would be there for all time when they took out a loan to buy a house.  That is not the reality of life and will not be in the future.  The more we go into monetary integration in Europe the more volatile the situation may become.  We may or may not get stability with Britain joining the EMS.  It is not a solid argument to say that, because people bought houses and took out mortgages at a low interest rate and maybe misjudged their own capacity to service that sort of loan, the Government should step in and do something about it. We know there has been a patch of high interest rates.  We also know there has been a significant improvement in the reserves in recent months.  Indeed when we look at the continent we see that certain interest rates there have begun to come down.</P>
      <P>We see signs of interest rates coming down in the United States and undoubtedly there is stability at the moment, and if that stability continues, then the downward pressure on interest rates will, hopefully, continue.  That, however, is a matter for the Central Bank and undoubtedly they recognise the requirements of the economy too and they will make their prudent decision in good time.</P>
      <P>To come back to the specific suggestion by Deputy Noonan, to allow relief at different levels depending on the rate of interest payable would lead to enormous administrative difficulties both for the Revenue Commissioners and taxpayers. Every time the allowance went up to 100 per cent or back down to 80 per cent 325,000 cases would have to be revised to correct the interest allowance.  Taxpayers would query the Revenue's calculation leading to further administrative difficulties and the amendment would also cause problems for self-assessment where taxpayers would be unsure as to their exact entitlements to any relief in a particular year where the amendment might or might not take effect.  It is quite clear what it would do to the self-assessment that we introduced and which everybody accepts is the way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to what the budget has done, we have gone over this ground <Col N="34" /> before and there is no doubt that this debate will continue.  Everybody wants to put mortgage interest relief back up at a cost of £55 million.  Nobody says what other priorities I might throw out the window if we brought back 100 per cent relief as of now.  I do not think it is realistic and the figures I have given clearly demonstrate that the amount of money given out as against indexation, across bands and so on, is far superior to the amounts of money that would be given out if it were on indexation only.</P>
    <P>Second, as to the views on tax reform and the direction that should go, I know that Deputy Noonan and his party are committed to a 25 per cent tax rate and a 40 per cent or 45 per cent higher tax band.  If there is total commitment to bands, personal allowances and so on, then that is a different set of sums.  On the question of personal allowances, I know from reading various debates on this that Deputy Noonan's view one time, in 1988, was that we should leave personal allowances alone and go the other road.  He may have decided, for his own good reasons, to change his policy in relation to it.  It would appear from listening to the debate now that he is pointing the finger more at personal allowances than at the reduction of rates of tax.</P>
    <P>Let us face the fact that there is a level of money required to do everything together and that sort of money is not available and will not be available no matter who the Minister for Finance is. One must take into account that one has to provide for the approximation of taxes at whatever level they will be.  We only know part of the story yet and the other part of it is what will be the long-term future of the DIRT tax which is a big revenue earner to which Deputy Noonan referred in the course of the debate.  It is on the table, but no more than that, for an approximation between member states.  As we know it was introduced by the Community and it was thrown out by the Governments generally and consequently it lies dormant.  If I were asked for a personal view, I do not see it coming back, certainly in the form in which it was there.  There seems to be a reluctance <Col N="35" /> on the part of many member states to involve themselves in a harmonised tax on savings.  If that is to be the reality there is another tax bill to be met.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is wise to give the impression that there is a big bundle of money to be given out and that we can take into consideration every aspect of tax that we would like, bearing in mind the approximation bills that have to be met and the insecure future of the DIRT tax.  As far as the Government are concerned, we committed ourselves to a 25 per cent rate.  We started to bring down the rates last year and we repeated that in this year's budget.  We are committed to a 25 per cent rate by 1993 and the achievement of one single higher tax rate. We continued along that road by reducing the standard rate to 30 per cent, the first time that was reduced in 20 years, and the top rate to 53 per cent.  At the same time we have kept 67 per cent or thereabouts of taxpayers on the standard rate.  That is a fair achievement.  Mortgage interest relief was a very small contribution to that.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the contribution that was taken in providing some revenue towards the cost of that very expensive package in the budget this year, one finds no more than an adjustment on life assurance tax.  Everything else is given except when we come to the corporate side where we do not get the benefit until further down the line.  The taxpayer has done as well as he could possibly have done.  Certainly there is a problem with high interest rates and high mortgage rates.  Let us hope that the pressures that were there towards the end of 1989 and early 1990 will continue to ease and we can look forward to the day when interest rates come down again.  That is the real answer to this problem.</P>
    <P>Maybe an unintended side effect of consideration of such an amendment as we have here could well be that the lending institutions would not be under any moral pressure to bring down interest rates either and we could find that they might be happy to continue with high interest rates.</P>

      <P>It is the Central Bank that controls interest rates.  Our views in relation to Government policy are well known and the requirements of this economy are well known but there is a decision to make and they make it.  I want to reiterate here the concern of the Government for those who are paying mortgages and to emphasise that the increased interest rates that have occurred in 1989 occurred mainly because of international factors over which we have little control.</P>
      <P>The role of the Government is to provide, by its domestic, budgetary and other policies, the economic background conductive to maintaining interest rates which are as low as possible, and this is what we have been doing.  I should add that domestic market conditions have shown considerable improvement in recent months and interbank interest rates have also eased considerably from their peak levels attained in mid-March. Against this background, the Central Bank is more optimistic about the general trend of domestic interest rates than it was in its February monetary policy statement.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for his reply and the other Deputies representing their parties who have said they will support the amendment. I will press the amendment but I would like to comment briefly on the Minister's reply.  The Minister said the cost of indexing allowances for 1990 would be approximately £40 million and about £60 million in a full year and that he had conceded far more than that in the budget.  Of course he had, but if one does not index allowances one is simply taking more tax from people by stealth, and to arrive at first base one needs to index allowances.  The point I was making was not that the Minister had not spent money in the budget but that he got £40 million of the money he used to reduce <Col N="37" /> rates in 1990 by not indexing allowances and that the appearance of the budget was far more generous than its reality. The Minister also took another tranche of money by reducing the interest relief on insurance premiums.  We will be coming to that section of the Bill shortly. At that point the Minister may tell us what he expects to gain from that in 1990. There is a cross over effect from that section to this section because endowment mortgages will be caught twice: not alone has the interest rate gone up and the Minister is maintaining the reduction in the mortgage interest relief but on the insurance element of the endowment mortgage, half of the relief will be lost as well.  The person with the endowment mortgage gets kicked three times, first with rising interest rates; second, the reduction of mortgage interest relief and third, the reduction in insurance relief.  It is a real issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor made the case very well when he said that the essential issue is that people's living standards are going down.  I know young couples, who are both working, who have bought a house and now the issue of going for a drink on a Saturday night or buying a couple of pairs of tights is an issue of household budgeting.  Things are that tight.  Young people who have just started off have gone to the very last pound, and perhaps the pound beyond it, when raising the mortgage and they do not have an extra £100 disposable income each month to pay the increase in the mortgage.  If the household budget is at the point where every pound is allocated to a particular need, where do you get the extra £100?  What happens is that people have to cut back to cut back on their living standards, which go down considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy also made a very good point on Committee Stage when he talked about his experiences when canvessing. He said that very often the people who were most hostile and most aggressive to the political process in general are the people who have just bought their houses in the new estates.  The <Col N="38" /> reason is that their backs are up against the wall, and the repayments are a constant struggle.  In those circumstances anything which tips the balance against their household budget &mdash; the balance has been tipped dramatically in the past 12 months by rising interest rates &mdash; puts them in serious difficulties.  That is the present situation and I think the Minister should address it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he does not control interest rates.  However, he controls the policies that give rise to high domestic interest rates.  The Minister and his colleagues showed no reluctance in claiming credit when interest rates were going down.  According to the Taoiseach it was a great achievement that interest rates had dropped four points when Fianna Fáil were only in Government two years.  He said: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil can do it, with or without the help of the people who thought they could not do it.&rdquo;  But when it goes in the opposite direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;they say they have no control over interest rates and that it is a matter for the Central Bank.  I congratulate them on their tremendous news management.  The public relations machine is working very well indeed when you gain on the swings and you do not lose on the roundabouts. However, if they want to take credit for reducing interest rates I am afraid they will have to accept the blame when interest rates rise.  I do not believe that the Central Bank operate without consulting with the Department of Finance. I do not know the state of the debate at present, but it seemed peculiar to me that at a time when some progress had been made in correcting the nation's finances, the Governor of the Central Bank felt obliged to make a public statement in the early months of the year admonishing the Minister about fiscal policies, his budgetary targets and his medium term targets. That seems to me to be a breakdown, be it marital or otherwise between the <Col N="39" /> Central Bank and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what is happening to interest rates at present?  I do not believe the assurance we are getting from German politicians on the implications of German unification.  I do not know what will happen to interest rates but I am quite convinced that decisions are being taken in Germany for political reasons.  The decision on the exchange rate between the Ost Mark and the Deutsche Mark was taken against the advice of the Bundesbank. In my opinion German politicians will give any commitment at present because they have the one policy objective of unifying the country.  In our own situation if the unification of the country were a possibility, I believe that many politicians in this House would give any kind of commitment also, but I would not put too much faith on commitments in East Germany that unification can be achieved without inflationary pressures <Col N="40" /> or rises in interest rates.  You have to take these commitments in the light of, &ldquo;they would, wouldn't they&rdquo; and, &ldquo;what else could they say?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is right and that interest rates steady down.  There are certain signs at present that interest rates are coming down internationally and I hope that trend continues.  I hope that we can bring down our interest rates.  There is also inflationary pressure on mortgage interest rates.  When the Minister goes to re-negotiate the national wage agreement he will find that the union negotiators have been reminded by their members of the cost of servicing home loans.  This will be a problem and it could be a source of inflation.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are technical problems with the amendment but they are not as extensive as the Minister suggests. The technical problems can certainly be overcome.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 22, to delete &ldquo;£6,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£8,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not put down an amendment on this matter on Committee Stage.  I made it clear in relation to my other amendments that I was approaching the matter from a different angle which was the increasing of the personal allowances and the introduction of earned income relief.  As these proposals were not accepted, I feel that the exemption limit increases granted by the Minister are inadequate.  We had an adequate debate on this matter on Committee Stage on Deputy Rabbitte's amendment which sought to increase the <Col N="43" /> exemption limit for married couples to £10,000.  Deputy Taylor put down a similar amendment seeking a smaller amount.  At that stage I said that I thought the figure of £8,000 for a married couple or £4,000 for single persons would be a reasonable amount to deal with this problem, bearing in mind that we must not incur a huge loss of revenue this year in view of our substantial budget deficit. The balance of equity lies with the figures of £4,000 and £8,000.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to amendments Nos. 54 and 6 which deal with allowances for those people over the ages of 65 and 75 respectively.  While the Minister has granted increases in the exemption limits I feel they are inadequate. People over the ages of 65 and 75 have to pay increased medical expenses.</P>
    <P>The House is well aware of the failure by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to reimburse legitimate hospital expenses and also claims for routine medical expenses under the home carer's scheme. I had occasion to discuss this issue with one of my constituents recently.  I discovered and there is a very serious lack of reimbursement by the VHI in respect of anaesthetists' fees which, apparently, have not been increased since 1977.  This is outrageous.  When this factor is taken into consideration I consider that these amended figures are reasonable in the context of the present budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 3 which is the substantive amendment. It seeks to deal with the level at which people are exempted from income tax.  As the House is aware I put down a significant amendment on Committee Stage on this matter which is the area where the taxation system can be used as an instrument to tackle poverty.  It has become fashionable for various commentators to debunk the statistics on poverty and so on, but the fact remains that we have a very serious problem of poverty endemic in our society.  Whether it is true that one third of our people are living at or below the poverty line, the dimensions of the problem are very <Col N="44" /> serious.  It is important to put on the record again that the problem of poverty is not confined to social welfare recipients. There are people on low pay who, for a range of reasons partially related to entitlements that they might otherwise have as social welfare recipients and are now denied as a result of the fact that they are PAYE earners, are similarly caught in the poverty trap.  Essentially, the purpose of Deputy Garland's amendment is to lift these people out of the poverty trap by using the taxation system.</P>
      <P>In my submission last week on this issue I instanced a number of areas of research that bears out the argument.  I will not go over it again except merely to refer to the ESRI study which was commissioned &mdash; I think &mdash; by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  In any event a paper abstracted from that research was presented to the Conference of Major Religious Superiors on this issue.  It showed that somewhere between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of people in the poverty trap were liable for both PAYE and PRSI.  It is absurd that people in that circumstance ought to be required to pay tax and PRSI.</P>
      <P>In my amendment I suggested that £100 per week was a reasonable threshold below which one ought not be expected to pay tax.  Put that into the perspective of your own life and it is difficult to understand how anybody can eke out an existence on less than that and be liable for income tax.  Deputy Garland's amendment proposes to reduce that to about £80 per week, which seems to be the absolute minimum.  The level fixed by the Commission on Social Welfare, for example, would be about £66.  When you reconcile that with the entitlements of social welfare recipients and the liability for PRSI and PAYE, the figure of about £80 is very reasonable indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister ought to take on board the thrust of our arguments.  We are trying to target the tax relief on the poor in this area.  That is important.  We have all agreed that resources are finite, choices must be made and where there is some scope it ought to be targeted on the least well off in our society.  As we go <Col N="45" /> through the rest of the Bill we will come to areas dealing with the corporate sector, capital acquisition tax, various tax avoidance measures to enable industry to minimise or avoid paying tax and so on; all these measures seem possible, but they are not possible when it comes to helping the people most in need.  It is a great pity the Minister has not made at least some gesture in this area.</P>
    <P>I refer, in passing, to the argument we had on Committee Stage about the relative merits of a tax credit system compared to tax allowances.  We must focus our minds on this area in future.  It is clear that tax allowances disproportionately help the better off &mdash; that goes without saying &mdash; whereas tax credits would be a boost to the people at the bottom of the ladder.  I cannot remember the phrase the Minister used in refutation but it was to the effect that if we were to convert the existing tax allowances into tax credits the improvement would be minimal.  The system is more complex than that.  Nobody was suggesting the exact conversion the Minister hung his refutation on.  I stand over the position that a system of tax credits would assist in particular the people caught at the bottom of the ladder.</P>
    <P>There is literature which proves beyond doubt that a substantial number of people living in poverty are liable for, and are paying, PAYE and PRSI. That is wrong.  To take a figure of £80, as is now being postulated, against the average industrial earnings, which are now about £220 per week, seems reasonable. The social partners, to whom the Minister referred during this debate, have agreed on a figure of £140 per week as the cut-off point and anything below that must be considered low pay.  To take a cut-off point of £80 a week or thereabouts is eminently reasonable.  I ask the Minister to consider the arguments being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated the thrust of the principles involved here at considerable length on Committee Stage and I do not intend to go over that ground again.  I support the series of amendments tabled by Deputy Garland.  He has taken <Col N="46" /> a figure between those submitted by Deputy Rabbitte and myself on Committee Stage, but the general thrust of what he seeks to achieve is fair, equitable and just.  It proposes that people on very low incomes should be taken out of the tax net altogether.</P>
      <P>Nobody should speak in support of any amendment that involves a cost to the Exchequer without indicating where the shortfall should be made up, and I have no hesitation in doing so on this occasion. The Minister has a very wide range to make up the cost, whatever it would be, of meeting Deputy Garland's amendment. For example, he could leave corporation tax where it was; he could leave capital gains tax where it was; he could leave the higher rate of income tax where it was; and he could introduce a wealth tax of even a nominal amount that would more than cover the thrust of the amendments. It is not that the money is not there, that it cannot be got.  Adjustments along the lines I have mentioned, even on the fringes of them, would more than cover the money that would be needed to meet the costs of this amendment.  It is a question of the will to do it and what the political objectives of the Government are.</P>
      <P>The political objectives of the Government are to look after the well-to-do and the whole thrust of the budget is to that end.  If one analyses it one will see that the wealthier one is, the higher one's income, the better and bigger one's resources, the better one does under the budget.  The corporate sector, people making capital gains, people sitting on large quantities of wealth, are not charged wealth tax, because we do not have one.  Those people got the lion's share of what was given away in the budget.  Money was given away in the budget but the question is, where did it go?  It went to the wealthy sectors and the wealthier you were the more you got. There can be no equity in the taxation system unless the issue of capital taxation in one form or another is adequately dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has conceded in our debates over the last few days that the <Col N="47" /> proportion drawn from capital taxation sources is minuscule in comparison to that taken from income sources and the PAYE sector in particular, but he has done nothing to reverse that trend or to tackle it in a meaningful way in his budget or the Finance Bill.  Of course, we know the Fianna Fáil Party do not believe in dealing with capital taxation or having reasonable, fair, adequate or just capital taxation.  That is entirely contrary to their political philosophy and to those who back them up and down the country. That is not new, it always has been their position.  One can recall the wealth tax introduced by a previous Coalition Government.  It was a modest tax and produced only modest amounts of capital taxation, but it was never really given a chance to operate properly, to get off the ground.  It was only beginning to have the effect for which it was designed by the Coalition Government, and when Fianna Fáil came back to Government in 1977 one of the first things they did was to abolish that most equitable of taxes which the Coalition Government had begun to introduce on the road to equity in taxation. I was not a Member of the House at that time but I recall the report that there was a roar of cheering from the Fianna Fáil benches when the then Fianna Fáil Minister announced that he was abolishing the wealth tax.  That sums up their philosophy on this issue.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister's shedding crocodile tears, saying he has no choice and the money is not there. The money is there.  There are many extremely wealthy companies and corporations making very large amounts of money here and paying little or no tax. Meat processing, for example, would be fair game for a bit of reasonable taxation but there is no way that can be achieved. The meat barons who are making millions from one of the main raw materials of this country pay little or no tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes along with that, but when it comes to people who are living in poverty, the people we were trying to <Col N="48" /> help in our Committee Stage amendments in order to bring them above subsistence level through the tax code, no money can be found.  There is no way the Minister will provide a wealth tax or adequate company taxation to provide for that.  He allows the whole system, riddled with allowances, the 10 per cent, the company allowances, the pension funds etc., to continue merrily on their way costing the Exchequer hundreds of millions of pounds.  A mere drop in the ocean out of those funds would more than cover what we are seeking to achieve.</P>
    <P>That is where the political divide is. The people have to recognise that fact and deal with it when elections are held. They have their chance time and time again and they get the Government and the policies they vote for.  It is a tragedy; it is unfair and unjust.  The Minister has a chance even at the eleventh hour to make some gesture towards those on the lowest end of the scale.  I join with other Deputies in appealing to him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to increase the general income tax exemption limits and the exemption limits for aged persons proposed in the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 propose to increase the general exemption limit, as set out in the Bill, by £1,500 for married couples and by £750 for single and widowed persons.  Acceptance of these amendments would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of £39.8 million in 1990 and £66.4 million in a full year and would exempt some 69,500 persons for tax liability.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 7 propose to increase the age exemption limits set out in the Bill by £500 for married couples and by £250 for single and widowed persons, aged 65 years or over but under 75 years.  Acceptance of these amendments would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of approximately £2.9 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 8 propose to increase the age exemption limits set out in the Bill by £500 for married couples and by £250 for single and widowed persons aged 75 years or over.  Acceptance <Col N="49" /> of these amendments would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of £0.7 million in a full year.  The total cost to the Exchequer of amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 combined would be £41.7 million in 1990 and £70 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill already provides for very generous increases in the exemption limits: £500 in the case of a married couple under 65 years of age or £250 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category; £700 in the case of a married couple where either spouse is aged 65 years or over but under 75 years or £350 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category; and £700 in the case of a married couple where either spouse is 75 years or over or £350 for a single or widowed person in this age bracket.</P>
    <P>In addition, in recognition of the difficulties faced by low income families, the special addition of £200 per dependent child which was introduced last year is being increased by £100 to £300 per child. This child element is intended to target relief at a group which has been identified as particularly in need of State support and, together with the increase in the basic exemption limits, will go a long way towards alleviating the tax burden on low income families.  The increases provided by section 1 and the associated marginal relief will cost the Exchequer about £23.7 million in a full year and will exempt 30,900 persons with 58,100 children from liability to income tax.  A further 65,000 taxpayers with 123,100 children will have reduced liability because of the operation of marginal relief as a consequence of the increases.</P>
    <P>The increases in the exemption limits provided for in section 1 of the Bill are the most generous that can be afforded at this time, especially as other significant reliefs &mdash; i.e. the reduction in both the standard and top rate of tax, the increases in the rate bands and the renewal of the PRSI allowance &mdash; are provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to exemption limits, Deputy Rabbitte made the point that £140 was the cut-off point and it was felt <Col N="50" /> that anyone earning below that should not be liable for tax.  I do not know whether he is talking about single people or married couples.  A married couple with three children are free from tax at £143 a week.  If they have four children the exemption is higher.  The figure in respect of a married couple aged 65 and under 75 is £144 per week and the figure over the age of 75 is £167 a week.  All those carry an extension of £6 per child per week.  This is the first move to focus on low paid people.  No matter what distance one goes there will always be people who think one should go further. There are choices to be made and when I make those choices I must deliver.  It is easier to make choices when one does not have to deliver.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland raised a question about unreimbursed health expenses. Income tax relief is available under section 12 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. Unreimbursed health expenses may be claimed under that section.</P>
    <P>We embarked last year on tackling the problem of the low paid.  We have gone a long distance and we intend to go further as circumstances permit in future budgets.  An increase of 35 per cent over two budgets for a married couple with three children cannot be regarded as miserly.  For a couple with four children the increase is 40 per cent.  These are substantial increases in an area which needs more care and attention.  At least a good start has been made.</P>
    <P>The overall point being made that the less well off are not being looked after in this budget must be rejected out of hand. This budget produced a package costing £235 million for welfare recipients, the disadvantaged and the elderly.  It is the largest ever package for this sector.  I reject any criticism that the budget was unbalanced in that it did not look after the least well off.  We have targeted the low paid and those less able to look after themselves.  When one examines the full facts, one sees they have clearly got the best package possible.</P>
    <P>The best response to poverty in many areas is more economic activity and the creation of more enterprises which will <Col N="51" /> provide more jobs.  I believe a lack of jobs is the biggest single factor contributing to poverty.  As I have said, progress in this area has been slow to date but it is beginning to accelerate and we want it to accelerate further from here on in.</P>
    <P>No matter what choices we make it is the ritual every year to expect more and more amendments.  That is what debate and politics are all about.  I respect the views of the people opposite &mdash; they are entitled to their views as I am entitled to mine &mdash; but we have to make the choices at the end of the day and stand over them. I do not think the people outside who responded very favourably to the budget see it in the same light as that put forward by the Deputies here today.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The argument about exemption limits arises first from the desire for people below the poverty line, however we define it, not to be actually caught in the tax net.  It does not make much sense to take tax off people and than attempt, through the family income supplement or other devices, to restore that money.  It is pretty daft to take money out of one pocket and put it back into the other.</P>
      <P>The other argument is that low paid people who are taxed are caught in a poverty trap and are probably better off staying on social welfare than going back to work.  I want to refer to the figure for exemption limits given by the Minister and which he claimed as the pinnacle of his success.  He said that a married couple with three children on £143 per week where the husband is working will be exempt from income tax.  However, a married couple with three children on social welfare will get about £110 per week.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A man earning £143 per week will have to pay £11 per week in PRSI.  PRSI is a very heavy imposition on the low paid because it is paid on every pound and there is no <Col N="52" /> exemption limit.  PRSI is a bigger drag into the poverty trap for the low paid than is income tax.  This will bring the income of a working man down to £132 per week while a man on social welfare will receive £110.  The working man will also have to get to work which may cost him £1 per day on bus fares, thus pulling another £7 from his wages and reducing his income to £125 as against £110 for a person on social welfare.  If the working man lives in a local authority house, and on the level of income we are talking of that is likely, there will be a change in his differential rent and he will pay an extra £4 or £5 per week in that respect.  This means there will be an income differential of only £10 between the working man and the man on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Are we seriously suggesting that somebody on social welfare will work a 40 hour week, five days a week for £10 extra?  I have not calculated the full expenses but he will also have to pay union dues and will lose his medical card because he will be just above the exemption limit.  He will either have to go on VHI or take a risk.  If any of his children get sick he will have to pay £10 per day for ten days in a public ward.  Even though he will be an insured worker under PRSI and entitled to free health services he will still have to pay £10 per day in hospital charges.  This is the essence of the poverty trap argument.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> He would be eligible for the family income supplement in such circumstances but why organise a system where one arm of the State is taking money off this man while another is giving him back money to compensate him for the money which was taken from him in the first instance? The point I am making is that PRSI must be taken into the arithmetic.  Otherwise tax exemptions alone will not solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte gave an example which leads to the same conclusion.  He suggested that £100 per week should be <Col N="53" /> the exemption limit for a single person. That would mean that somebody on an annual wage of £5,200 would be exempt from tax.  At present a person on an annual wage of £5,200 pays about £600 in income tax and £400 in PRSI.  Even if this person is exempted from income tax he will still have to pay £400 a year, or £8 per week, in PRSI.  The Minister may say I am out shillings and pennies but I am not far out in the actual figures.  I believe an approach to low paid workers which does not take tax exemption limits plus PRSI in tandem will not succeed. During the last election we put forward a simple proposition, which I also put forward in this House, that is, the first £3,000 of salary should be exempted from PRSI.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We can cut the slice wherever we like but I believe the first £3,000 of salary should be exempted from PRSI.  This will cost a significant amount of money but it could be recovered by removing the ceiling at the other side.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question, the Minister told me that the gain to the Exchequer by removing the ceiling would be exactly the same in the case of the million pounds as the exclusion of the first £3,000 of income from PRSI.  These types of measures where we target people on low pay and put them in the situation where they at least do not lose money by returning to work are the ones we should follow. People in low paid jobs stay in them even though they would be better off on social welfare because it is their lifestyle to work and they could not bear to have to fool around all day with nothing to do.  It is not so much that people give up their jobs to go on social welfare but if people lose their jobs and are out of work it is almost impossible for them to go back into low paid jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is magnified in proportion to the number of children in a family.  A person with four children will have to receive an average industrial wage before <Col N="54" /> he can afford to go back to work. Obviously my arguments do not apply to the same extent in the case of a single person on unemployment assistance of £40 per week taking up a job which pays £140 or £150 per week because the differential in that case is big enough to encourage the single person to go back to work.  The trap really closes when a person has three, four or five children. This is a very serious problem which must be looked at because it has two effects. First, it keeps people on the live register whom I do not believe would be on it otherwise.  I do not believe in the theory that there is a set quantum of work, that regardless of what people are paid there are only so many jobs in the economy and if a fellow leaves social welfare and takes up a job all that happens is that somebody is knocked out of a job and has to go on social welfare.  I believe the number of jobs in a country expands and contracts relative to wage levels.  There is plenty of work available at £100 per week but people cannot afford to take it up.  If we could target many of our energies towards the elimination of poverty traps it would make a big difference.</P>
    <P>We are going to go through the nineties with the demographics much the same as they have been and we will be looking at fairly high levels of unemployment, even with the most optimistic view of the economy.  According to the ESRI it is very difficult to see how there will be fewer than 170,000 on the live register by the year 1997-98.  Perhaps they are being pessimistic but normally they are optimistic. There is a demographic problem. It may not be the same people who are on the live register because there would be movement in and out.  However, if we cannot provide jobs for all our people we should at least attempt to have all our people employable.  A person out of work for a significant period of time is not employable.  That person cannot stand the discipline of a job and may not have the skills of the labour force anymore.</P>
    <P>In the large local authority housing estates in our principal cities and towns the level of male unemployment is more <Col N="55" /> than 80 per cent.  I accept that the national figure is 17 per cent but that disguises the global figure.  In the middle class housing estates unemployment can be from 2 per cent to 4 per cent but in the working class housing estates it can be very high.  In small villages where there are 50 council houses it is quite common to have 35 of the men living in those houses unemployed.  One gets a clear picture when one goes around the country. One can see husbands collecting children from school or will meet the husbands when handing out literature.  This is serious and if it continues not only will that generation of men be unemployable but their children will repeat the process. We do not pay half enough attention to the problem of poverty traps.  In so far as Deputy Garland's amendment addresses the poverty trap, I support it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, when he is looking at this next year, to address the problem in relation to PRSI.  I do not think anything serious can be done without looking at PRSI.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider giving the benefits on net pay rather than on gross pay.  Social welfare is always net but pay is always gross.  One receives a medical card on the basis of the net social welfare payment but if one has the same amount of money thrown up by a gross wage one could lose the medical card, pay a higher differential rent or lose benefits such as free school transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider eliminating the low paid from the exemption limits, eliminate PRSI on the first tranche of income and pay for it on the other side.  The Minister should look at the anomalies in the family income supplement scheme.  He should award the benefits on a net income basis rather than on gross income, and graduate them. One experiences problems when one approaches a health board with a hardship case and is told that the person concerned is £10 above the limit.  At different levels of income it should be possible to graduate benefits, and that is important. If we produced such a package we might be making a serious attack on the poverty <Col N="56" /> traps.  They are keeping the live register artifically high, are making people unemployable and building up a welfare culture in certain communities. Unemployment is so high in specific communities that children growing up see unemployment as the normal pattern of life in their community.  They do not think along alternative lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Deputies Rabbitte, Taylor and Noonan supported my amendment.  I agree with Deputy Taylor that it would be highly irresponsible of me, or any Deputy, in view of our budget deficit to be calling for a reduction in the tax take, but, as Deputy Taylor said, there is ample scope when dealing with the corporate sector and capital taxes.  Amendments in my name have been turned down because I sought to increase the tax take from those sectors to compensate for the extra allowances I was proposing for the lower paid. That is a bad way to operate.  I should like to give one simple example.  A £4,000 exemption limit applies to married couples before they are liable for capital gains tax.  For many upper middle class people, particularly those inclined to dabble on the Stock Exchange for the purpose of making capital profits, that gives them effectively an extra allowance of £4,000 each year.  Has the Minister costed that?  I would be interested to know how much extra revenue we would gain by the elimination or reduction of that limit.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan's views on PRSI.  There should be a cut-off point. It is absurd that people on low wages must pay PRSI.  I agree with him about the poverty traps but they would not be eliminated if the House adopted my amendment.  The only way to eliminate those traps is to introduce a basic income scheme for everybody.  That policy is well known to Fine Gael and The Workers' Party, and it disappoints me that in a debate like this I am the only Member to refer to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1984, (inserted by this section) shall apply to persons with dependents who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed the Minister did not return on Report Stage with a proposal in this area.  On Committee Stage he had indicated he was sympathetic to the arguments advanced.  I should like to remind the House that the amendment about which I am speaking essentially seeks equality of treatment under the tax code for widows, widowers and single parents.  All sides of the House, including Deputy Ahern and I think somebody else from the Government benches, expressed their support for the content of the amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Under the present tax code there is one of the most cruel anomalies.  Nobody in the House, including the Minister, has tried to advance any argument to justify why there ought to be this discrimination against widows, widowers or single parents.  Whatever about the inequities in the tax code as a whole, there is no doubt that this group of people are the most discriminated against within the entire tax system.  How it is proposed that somebody ought to lose the benefit, whether in terms of the tax bands or tax allowances because the misfortune of being widowed is visited on them, is beyond me.  Essentially we are talking about circumstances in which somebody, prior to such a tragedy befalling their family, benefits from the double rate bands, the commensurate allowances or whatever.  Suddenly that family loses a parent.  In the case of an average-sized Irish family, whichever spouse it is who dies, it means that, on top of that personal tragedy &mdash; as the law stands &mdash; they lose the entitlement that was theirs prior to that tragedy befalling them.  Normally what happens is that if the person is in employment &mdash; which is obviously what is envisaged here &mdash; they will have to employ somebody to look after the children, a child minder, housekeeper or whoever.  Yet apparently we do not find it acceptable to extend the double rate bands to such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There really is no defence for discriminating against the group of people referred to in this amendment, and the Minister has not advanced any.  In fact he has said he is very sympathetic to the argument being advanced.  His own backbenchers as well as the other Opposition parties in this House supported the <Col N="61" /> amendment on Committee Stage.  I am not saying that the Minister gave a hard commitment but, looking at the record, he did say he was sympathetic, that if he could he would do something.  He said the matter was complex but that he would ascertain what he could do for Report Stage.  I do not accept that the argument is as complex as the Minister or his advisers would have us believe.  I know some questions do arise about the effect of such a decision on other sections of the workforce if the provisions of this amendment were to be implemented, but those implications are exaggerated. Where there is a will to tackle a grievance like this it can be tackled.  In this case it is not a matter of cost.  If my calculations are correct &mdash; and I do not think the Minister challenged this on the last occasion &mdash; we are talking about an extension of the double rate bands to the categories mentioned here costing approximately £3 million in a full year.  I cannot accept that that type of cost is prohibitive.</P>

      <P>Apart from what may have happened in the past for which I think the Taoiseach will agree I do not have any responsibility, is he aware of the increasing concern about the relevance of this House in terms of major announcements, and that this concern is likely to be increased by the possibility of televising the proceedings of the House? Would he remember that there have been at least two important occasions recently when the relevance of the House would have been increased by an announcement in the House on matters of concern to us and to the community at large, for example, the announcement on the setting up of the commission on the redrawing of boundaries, the announcement a few days ago in relation to the banning of coal and a number of others?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Taoiseach's concern for the Temple Bar area and wish the committee well.  However let me suggest that one of the key agencies not represented on the committee are CIE who own the site.  Does the Taoiseach not agree it is important that CIÉ are represented on the committee given that their land is at stake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has mentioned that.  I did actually consider that but we decided that it was probably best to have that interest represented through the Department of Tourism and Transport who have responsibility for CIÉ and they are represented on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Some members of the staff of CIÉ feel they would be best able to represent their interests.  Having regard to the fact that it is the policy of Dublin Corporation to seek easier access for the public through improved public transportation, including the provision by Córas Iompair Éireann of interchange arrangements for buses and underground rail links with the DART and the western towns, would the Taoiseach outline to the House the ramifications of a change in policy by CIÉ for public transportation and the provision of a central bus station in the city?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind telling the Deputy that I announced some years ago that it was Fianna Fáil policy that Temple Bar should not be given over as a transport centre, that it was too special an area of Dublin to be devastated in that <Col N="66" /> way.  That is the reason for the establishment of this committee.  This committee grew out of the wish of a number of people to do something special with Temple Bar because it is one of those areas of the city which is evolving its own special characteristics; indeed, it is sometimes referred to as the Left Bank of Dublin.  It is in that context that we decided some time ago that the transport centre proposal of CIÉ should not be proceeded with and that we should preserve Temple Bar for an entirely different type of ambience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the special characteristics he speaks about are created in part by CIÉ by virtue of their low value leasing arrangements with their various tenants?  If the Taoiseach hopes to one day get all the buses off the road and into a central station, will he agree that it is now time that the Department of Tourism and Transport provided alternative proposals for CIÉ so that from now on we can plan the city <i>vis-à-vis</i> transportation policy in a proper manner?</P>

As the Deputy is aware, a number of member states have suggested that it is a dimension that should be included at least for discussion but so far nothing has been settled.  I indicated here in the Dáil yesterday in answer to a question from Deputy Spring that I would hope to devote some time in the House here to a discussion on European affairs generally before the Dublin Summit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is an ongoing discussion in the Community on a number of aspects, the completion of the Single Market, economic and monetary union, political union, developments in Central and Eastern Europe and the Community's relations with the new countries in Central and Eastern Europe. All these things are taking place simultaneously and so far the only concrete decisions in regard to them were taken at the Dublin Summit on 28 April which I fully reported to this House and subsequently to the European Parliament. It was the decision of the Dublin Summit on 28 April to ask the Foreign Ministers to prepare some proposals in connection with political union, and that work is now under way.  The proposals by the Foreign Ministers will, in due course, come before the next Dublin Summit.  In the meantime I would hope to give the House an opportunity of debating all these aspects sometime, perhaps at the beginning of June.</P>

There is considerable worry in this country as to the role of Commissioner <Col N="69" /> Frans Andriessen in regard to these matters because of his lacking perhaps the full concern that we have in this country about the necessity of preserving the family farm in view of the predominance of industrial farming in the country which he happens to come from?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is uppermost in the minds of the Government at the present time.  There are a number of different Ministers and others concerned. The Minister for Agriculture is following events very closely and so are his colleagues in the European Council of Ministers for Agriculture.  It is a constant item on the agenda there.  At the same time the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in his capacity as trade Minister is very much involved at present in the Community negotiating position and of course it just so happens by good fortune, or by brilliance and judgment on my part, whichever way the Deputy likes to look at it, we have Deputy MacSharry as Commissioner for Agriculture in charge of these negotiations on behalf of the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy should put a question down to the Taoiseach on the matter.  Does the Taoiseach intend to have the question of sanctions on South Africa raised and reaffirmed at the Summit in view of the <Col N="70" /> growing concern that a number of member states are weakening in their resolve in that regard pending real and tangible progress in South Africa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the question of sanctions is constantly on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Council, and the Deputy is aware of both our national position in that regard and our position in the Presidency. The subject is fairly constantly under discussion in that council.  It may be on the agenda for the Dublin Summit or it may not.  It depends on the outcome of the Foreign Ministers' deliberations on it.  I would also remind the Deputy that we hope to hear personally from Nelson Mandela on 2 July in this House on the issue.</P>

      <P>My Department estimate that the number of days lost for the periods in question are as follows: January-April 1990, 69,698; September-December 1989, 11,998; January-April 1989, 12,020; and January-April 1988, 78,067.</P>
      <P>As a commentary on these figures it is clear that they are worse than for the same period in 1989 but better than the same period in 1988.  I believe there were exceptional circumstances in the period in that almost 90 per cent of the days lost were accounted for by four disputes &mdash; Waterford, Barlo, Anglo Irish Beef Processors and Liebert.  In general terms and bearing in mind these four disputes the figures are a distinct improvement on 1987 and 1986 in which 129,000 and 137,000 days were lost in the first three months.  Even these years, however, were an improvement on the strike-prone sixties and seventies.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with anything the Deputy has said.  Last night I spoke at the national conference of the Federation of Irish Employers.  I have already spoken at more than 30 annual conferences in the past six weeks and my message at these conferences has been <Col N="75" /> fairly well publicised.  There is an indiction that many workers and indeed management believe that all the national problems that created so many crises some years ago have gone.  I have been at pains to point out that we still have a massive national debt and that it takes a massive amount of money to service that debt; that there are 220,000 people unemployed with huge numbers leaving school each year and I have asked workers not to lose sight of these realities when they vote on a dispute.  Two of the four companies listed &mdash; Waterford and Barlo &mdash; where the workers are represented by the ATGWU, account for 75 per cent of the days lost this year. Disputes at the four companies represent 90 per cent of all days lost.  In the main they were not disputes over pay issues but had more to do with restructuring.  In fact one strike arose out of a row at a Christmas party and had nothing to do with the workplace but it still continued for several thousand days.  People should think before they get themselves involved in such strikes.</P>

A lot of the Teamwork schemes which cater for people under 25 years of age are in the health care area and they continually come up for renewal.  FÁS have been endeavouring to give an opportunity to some new schemes and this has given rise to difficulty in that those involved in schemes that have been renewed for the last three, four or five years have been told they will have to seek other means of funding.  I am not sure which schemes are concerned but the queries that have arisen recently relate to that fact.  If the Deputy has any particular schemes in mind I will undertake to have them checked by FÁS.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that provision for the long-term unemployed has been, and continues to be, a Government priority.  At EC level I hope to have a resolution on action to assist the long-term unemployed adopted at the Social Affairs Council next week.  The initiative <Col N="77" /> for the resolution was taken by myself in my capacity as President of the Social Affairs Council.  The particular unemployment problems of urban areas will be covered in the resolution.  Following the adoption of the resolution, I will be pressing the question of EC assistance for such areas.</P>
    <P>The employment creation package announced by me on 27 September 1989 took account of the Government's desire to initiate special measures in urban disadvantaged areas generally as outlined in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the main measures in the package is as follows: expansion of the social employment scheme through the recruitment of an extra 1,000 people from urban disadvantaged areas over the 12 month period from end September 1989.  Over 400 people have joined the scheme from disadvantaged areas since September. The extension of the scheme to cater for 15,000 people by the end of 1990 should further benefit disadvantaged areas; £500,000 has been provided from national lottery funds in 1990 towards the cost of materials for Community Youth Training Programme projects in urban disadvantaged areas; and the employment incentive scheme has been revamped and redirected towards the long-term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged persons and the overall grant payable to employers to recruit additional workers has been increased.</P>
    <P>In addition Deputies will be aware that I have provided a bonus of £10 per week for trainees with dependants to help meet the cost of undergoing training.  I have also provided a child dependant payment of £10 per week per child for participants on the social employment scheme.  Given the high number of long-term unemployed in Dublin city, I would hope that we could start a number of SES projects in the area as soon as possible and talks are ongoing on that matter.  The provision of more detailed information on training and employment programmes for individual counties is a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the Minister has at all times expressed concern for the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, there is a growing problem in regard to the expansion of the social employment scheme in as much as there is growing resistance among trade unionists on the shop floor because they see that the social employment scheme is doing work which they consider to be more proper for permanent employees, especially work in the local authorities.  It is possible that in some areas of the country there will not be sufficient people to take up the social employment scheme.  Would the Minister comment on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that there are some difficulties in this regard.  Because there are more job opportunities now &mdash; full-time, part-time and casual &mdash; a campaign is being mounted by people in some local authority areas who are reluctant to take part in the scheme.  I have endeavoured, in conjunction with the various action groups dealing with unemployed people throughout the country, to respond by increasing the differential between the amount people get on the social employment scheme and what they would get on State benefit &mdash; for example by providing the child benefit of £10 to which I referred.  Last year we tried to keep the amount in line with social welfare increases, and that matter is under review again pending the social welfare increases in July.  I will continue to monitor this matter and try to create the right climate. Talks took place yesterday between the Department and FÁS and the SIPTU trade union about difficulties in Dublin and Cork and we are endeavouring to resolve that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 17 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>This dispute began on 5 April and is now in its seventh week.  The company employ 2,300 people.  The company are one of the best known in the country and enjoy a good reputation both nationally and internationally.  I have no need to emphasise that any threat to this employment could have disastrous consequences in the Waterford area.  It is important to remember that it is not just the jobs in Waterford Glass that could be lost as a result of closure.  I am aware of the great importance of seeking a resolution to this dispute in Waterford Glass both from a local and national point of view.  It was for these reasons that I invited the parties for discussions on Wednesday last in separate meetings.  Each meeting lasted several hours.  In these discussions with the parties and in further contacts over the past few days I came face to face with the strong and resolute views of both sides. I listened carefully to the views of both sides and what I have heard is a classic situation of industrial relations conflict where both sides believe equally strongly that they are right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the management point of view the company is bleeding to death.  Over the last three years the crystal division lost over £60 million &mdash; in 1989 the crystal division lost over £21 million.  These losses are continuing into 1990.  In a company where labour costs constitute 70 per cent of overall costs these facts prompted certain action from the company which they felt had to be taken to ensure their survival.  In particular, the so-called bonanza payments were removed.  From the workers' point of view it is alleged that the removal of the bonanza payments <Col N="81" /> amounted to the breaking of an agreement and, apart from that, the company have presented the union side with a large agenda which envisages further labour savings in respect of labour costs.</P>
    <P>Having met both sides, I presented them last week with a formula which would allow for the commencement of negotiations.  The formula which I put to both sides recognised the respective positions of the parties.  In my view they achieved a balance and I pleaded with both sides to accept my proposals in a gesture of co-operation and conciliation. I wish to emphasise that my proposals are only a means to get the parties to the negotiation table and are not final settlement terms.  They amount to a formula which allows the parties to meet and draw up settlement terms.  I would also emphasise that all items of concern to the parties are on the negotiation table for discussion, including the issue of bonanza payments.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to emphasise that it will take several weeks at least after negotiations begin before there can be a return to work in this dispute.  In view of this I believe it is essential that the parties get down to negotiation immediately.  As I have said publicly in recent days I am available to offer any assistance to the parties should they consider that such assistance would be worth while.  Apart from that of course the industrial relations institutions of the State are available to help the parties at all times.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the formula which I put to the parties has been rejected.  I feel however that it is only on the basis of proposals like this that it will be possible to start negotiations and break the impasse, and I would ask both sides to give consideration to that fact.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think all sides should be clear on the realities of the current dispute. There is a real possibility that the company will cease to operate as presently structured and that other drastic options will have to be considered.  I have refused from both a national and local point of view to highlight that possibility but I feel I would be shirking my responsibilities if I did not do so now.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that what he has read out to the House is nothing less than a litany of lunacy and that the dispute at Waterford is the most serious one in the country since the Ferenka disaster in Limerick over ten years ago?  Would the Minister accept also that talks, when they get started, will take some time to conclude and that what we should be aiming at is that these talks would commence within hours rather than days?  Is he prepared to amend or expand his proposals to meet the points of both sides to facilitate the beginning of talks and would he seek a response to such amendments or expansion today?</P>

      <P>I agree with the first part of what Deputy Mitchell has said, that this is a most serious dispute.  I have had the opportunity to talking with management every day for the last five days and talking to union representatives at various levels.  I agree with the Deputy that the response which I asked for on Sunday night, through the media, should be given today by both sides.  In reply directly to the Deputy's question, in the last few days I have declined to say that but in view of what was said earlier in the House by Deputy Bruton, perhaps it is in this House that we should say things. I note that there is a number of Waterford Deputies here.  They have been very helpful in the discussions we have had in the past three or four weeks.  I appeal to both sides in this dispute.  A board meeting of the international company will take place in the morning.  I urge that the bonanza payment, which the company agreed last week could only be paid at the end of the dispute, be paid to some third party before negotiations commence.  It could be paid into a trust of the Labour Court or some other independent trust.  I also think the management could give some assurance &mdash; they may be willing to do this &mdash; to the lower paid workers in Waterford Glass that they would not be overly affected in whatever may emerge because the negotiations will have a cost factor.  In addition, I think it would be <Col N="83" /> helpful if the management could accept the withdrawing of my clause No. 4 which dealt with the servicing and maintenance of machinery during the negotiations.  It should be emphasised that it will probably take, if my information is correct, anything from four to six weeks from the ending of negotiations to get the plant operating.  Therefore, if we still have Waterford Glass, very little work will be done there this side of late July or August.  For those reasons I agree with what Deputy Mitchell has said and I ask both sides to please respond today. Neither side has responded so far to the appeal I made to them on Sunday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Deputies also have questions down but are not permitted by the rules of order to ask supplementary questions today.  Can the Minister quantify the number of jobs at stake?  We know there are about 2,300 employed directly by Waterford Glass but is there an equal number of indirect jobs as is normal in such cases?  Therefore, apart from the calamity that closure of the plant would involve for Waterford, there would be a very serious development for the country as a whole as a result of the loss of such a high number of jobs.</P>

      <P>Briefly, the number employed at Waterford is 2,300.  There are about 450 employees involved in the United States.  They would also lose their jobs as would the several hundred in the UK plant.  My advisers in the redundancy section of the Department say that if 2,300 jobs are lost you would multiply by three to get the real figure as for every job lost directly, two are lost indirectly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Industrial Relations Bill, 1989 is at present at Committee Stage in this House.  The term &ldquo;official strike&rdquo; is usually used to describe a strike sanctioned by a trade union.  Section 14 of the Bill requires that the rules of every trade union contain a provision to the effect that the union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike without a secret ballot in favour of such action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to clarify &mdash; because it certainly is not clear to me from the Bill before the House &mdash; what is the position of a union who would make official retrospectively a dispute that commenced as unofficial? Is it possible for them to have a secret ballot while the unofficial strike is taking place and, if so, would the ability to make retrospective unofficial strikes not undermine this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>All our advice is that that is not so.  Section 14 (2) requires that the rules of every trade union contain a provision that the union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike or other industrial action without a secret ballot.  It goes on to say that there is provision for seven days notice.  To write in what might happen otherwise is something that is not done.  The spirit of the legislation is that a union have provision in their rule book for a secret ballot and that they give seven days' notice and anything outside of that would be taken dim light of in the courts if they subsequently were injuncted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that a group need a majority of their members to decide whether there should be a secret ballot.  In my experience of clubs, associations, groups etc, if one person, no matter how big or small the group, requests a secret ballot then there is a secret ballot.  We know that many hundreds of the workers in Waterford Glass are seeking a secret ballot.  Can the Minister endeavour to see that such a secret ballot is allowed because I am convinced that an overall majority of the workers at Waterford Glass want negotiations to take place?  I would ask the Minister to use some advice to ensure that that majority have their say, that talks do take place and that this dreadful strike is brought to a successful conclusion.</P>

The withdrawal of labour constitutes a strike.  In the case we are talking of the tradition of the union in question, the ATGWU or the British-based T and <Col N="87" /> GWU, is a show of hands.  There is no point in inflaming the climate further. That union have always, in Britain and in Ireland, where they are organised, done their business by a show of hands.

      <P>The working party to whom the Deputy refers were an interdepartmental group set up in 1985 by the then Minister for Labour to monitor progress in the application of Government policy on equal opportunity in State-sponsored bodies.  The working <Col N="89" /> party reported in 1987.  It was not envisaged that this report would be published or presented to Government.  The report was however circulated to State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>The working party's recommendations related in the main to the designation of equal opportunity officers; the introduction of working arrangements such as flexible working hours, job sharing and career breaks; programmes of positive action to identify and remove discriminatory requirements and the establishment of joint union-management consultative arrangements.  The working party also recommended the introduction of a system of collecting and collating relevant data on equality.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa is correct.  At the initial stages very little was happening, but now each year the semi-State bodies have been together a number of times with the Employment Equality Agency.  There has been continual monitoring.  There are now people in all the semi-State bodies designated to deal with equality issues.  One of the big problems was that nobody was responsible for promoting positive action or for equality.  There has been a great deal of advancement in working hours, job <Col N="90" /> sharing and career breaks in both the public and private sectors, not yet, I think, to full satisfaction.  People still have to be convinced in some areas, but in conjunction with the Employment Equality Agency the section in the Department now call in the semi-State bodies rather than having collective meetings, and recommend the progressive actions and the good example in the better semi-State bodies to others in an endeavour to reach a standard.  Also in their annual reports they have to include a full section on equality and what action they are undertaking.  From that source we are collating the present report.  That has been done for the last few years.</P>

      <P>Most of these complaints come through anonymous letters, letters from friends, inspectors or trade union officials about companies who are under suspicion or types of industries which are permanently under suspicion. I will not name them but we debated them recently on the part-time work issue.  The inspectors do not say why they are at the firm.  They seek the records and registers and very thoroughly go through them.  A substantial amount of money is received every year from various employers that is owed to their individual workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The question of low pay has already been the subject of much research and debate and a wide range of measures covering the education, training, welfare, taxation and industrial relations areas are already being taken to tackle the problem. I have no plans to carry out further investigation in this area as there is general agreement as to the factors which give rise to low pay and an acceptance that measures to deal with it must cover the range of areas I have referred to.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy McCartan's question, I am aware of the comments referred to by the Deputy.  As I have already indicated in replies to previous similar questions I am not convinced that the introduction of a minimum wage is the solution to the problem of low pay.  I feel that progress in the industrial relations area on low pay can best be achieved through collective bargaining operating in conjunction with the Joint Labour Committee system.  The JLC system can take account of the particular economic and industrial relations circumstances of specific sectors and is a flexible and effective means of tackling the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Bill which is at present at Committee Stage in this House contains proposals to improve the functioning of existing committees and <Col N="94" /> speed up the establishment of new committees. In addition the proposed new Labour Relations Commission, will have responsibility for monitoring and reviewing the operation of JLCs and will also have the power to examine whether new committees should be established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not occur to the Minister that we are one of three countries in the European Community who do not have minimum pay legislation? Is it not time for some movement on his part in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have undertaken a number of reviews in the Department over the years in regard to this type of legislation.  There are completely different standards.  My contention is that the major issues in regard to low pay are education, training, welfare and taxation. They are the issues which will help people in the low pay category.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have said that in a future programme they will want to look more directly at this issue.  I have said that this might be a good way to see how progress could be achieved.  I am not convinced that a statutory minimum wage will create more jobs and solve the problems of the low paid.  It could cause unemployment and great difficulties.  The JLC system is a better system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the threat to jobs could be put forward as one of the reasons for not introducing minimum pay legislation, it is mostly women who are discriminated against in low paid jobs.  One problem in the implementation of such measures could be that higher paid workers would want to maintain differentials.  There could thus be a source of opposition in an area one would not expect.  It is also likely that there would be an increase in food costs in supermarkets.  Nevertheless we should have this legislation.  Other countries have introduced it without any adverse effects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is not a cheap labour <Col N="95" /> solution to our unemployment problem? Would he also agree that there is scope for some form of minimum income policy without jeopardising the creation of jobs? Would he consider going towards a minimum wage policy in conjunction with some addition to or extension of the family income supplement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  There are now about 7,000 families in receipt of family income supplement.  The issue will be addressed in discussions later this year.  There would have to be agreement among the social partners.  A statutory minimum wage seems like a simple solution but the salary must be pitched at a certain level.  If there is not agreement employers on one side will bring down recruitment salary levels to that level.  We have had examples of that in the past few years which created great industrial relations difficulties.  Other employers may be unable due to market forces to bring salaries up to that level.  It is a complex issue.  Some countries brought in very strong minimum pay legislation, but while we in this country implement the laws on the Statute Book the laws are ignored and the legislation on the Statute Book is not used to any effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister continues to rely on the alternative, which is the joint labour committee method.  Even the answer to the earlier question dealing with the conviction of the hairdressing salon shows that the efficacy of the joint labour committee system must be under serious scrutiny.  Is the Minister concerned that the more moderate wing of the trade union leadership have said that the failure of the Minister to bring forward any proposals concerning minimum pay legislation is likely to prove a sticking point in negotiations for a new programme between the trade unions and the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already addressed that.  This will be one of the items on the agenda for the talks and we <Col N="96" /> will have to see what progress can be made.  It does not move away from the question of how we can help to tackle the issue through taxation, welfare benefits, training and education generally.</P>

At present there is a major review of the apprenticeship scheme.  I am willing to look at any schemes people believe are of no great value.  I have shown my attitude to this by abolishing a number of schemes over the past few years and by setting up new and useful schemes such as Youthreach.</P>

      <P>With regard to Question No. 18 and training schemes, would the Minister not agree that youth employment schemes, as we knew them of old, or the Teamwork schemes, to use more modern terminology, have virtually ground to a halt, that they do not operate on anything like the scale they did heretofore and, that therefore, there is a need to look seriously at the possibility of bringing down the age threshold for the social employment schemes to enable people in the 18-25 year age group to participate in work at community level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with many of these schemes is that we have to be guided by the resources available and the age threshold set by the European Social <Col N="99" /> Fund.  I think 41 per cent of the participants in the schemes are in the 25 plus age group whereas previously there was a very low level of participation by this group because there was no funding. Without the ESF these schemes would be a huge cost on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out earlier to Deputy Mitchell, what is happening in a number of schemes is that voluntary organisations &mdash; I have great respect for them &mdash; use the schemes to run their organisations on a full-time basis and come back each year looking for additional funding.  After a few years the workers on the schemes run the voluntary organisations almost on a full-time basis.  This was never meant to be the case and is not in the spirit of the ESF.  The difficulty is that if we take away the scheme we will be closing down the organisations, which I am reluctant to do because they do very good work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that one of the more irksome aspects of the social employment scheme is that a person who completes 12 months on a scheme has to wait 12 months before he can apply for another social employment scheme?  It is very difficult for a person who is willing and anxious to work not to be able to apply for a social employment scheme until 12 months after he or she completed the first course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an exception to that rule.  This rule was introduced because the trade union movement did not want, and rightly so, the social employment scheme to become a full-time job but the monitoring committee can make exceptions to the rule in certain cases.  For example, on the islands the scheme can be extended for a further year because there are not enough people to take up the places.  If the sponsor of the scheme in urban or rural areas &mdash; often the parish, the community or some <Col N="100" /> local organisation such as a football club &mdash; cannot find suitable people, a person who has been unemployed for three months can come back into the scheme. I brought in that amendment in the autumn.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that these attacks and acts of intimidation are very serious &mdash; they involved four Castletownbere vessels in the past few days &mdash; and that action is necessary immediately at a number of levels, including possibly changes in the law, protests to the Government of Spain <Col N="102" /> in particular and possibly France and action at European Community level?</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy that these matters are very serious for our fishermen and international relations.  As I indicated in my reply, I am committed to action to see that this stops.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to changes in the law.  This is very pertinent also in this case.  There is a set of regulations covering incidents within the 12 mile limit but there seems to me, as a lay person in legal matters &mdash; I know the Deputy is a solicitor &mdash; to be a gap with regard to incidents such as these on the high seas. The international law of the sea seems to be deficient in this regard.  However, that does not help us with the immediate case referred to by the Deputy.  The Navy are busy in that area at the moment, and successfully so I gather, but are confined to dealing with the fishery laws arising out of the Common Fisheries Policy.  They cannot take any action in the case of a fishing boat being rammed.</P>

Will he also ensure, through his colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that at EC level the proper regulatory regime will not be just in place but will be enforced?</P>
      <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister the information given to me.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 15:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> In page 13, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1984, (inserted by this section) shall apply to persons with dependents who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Rabbitte).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was dealing with the inequities in the tax code as they apply to widows, widowers and single parents.  I expressed my disappointment that the Minister chose not to make progress on those inequities.  My amendment seems to have the support not only of Opposition parties but of a majority of the Minister's backbenchers who supported the case I made on Committee Stage against this cruel anomaly.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Noonan asked if it was likely that a constitutional question arises from the application of the double tax bands to single parents but, with political will, we can overcome those problems.  The Minister cannot advance any argument, and he did not try to support the move in the event of a death of a spouse in a family, by the Revenue Commissioners to gang up on the family and demolish the tax allowances they previously enjoyed.  In such circumstances the remaining spouse will, in all probability, find it necessary to employ a housekeeper or a child minder but will find the tax allowance they previously enjoyed has been reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can one defend the present position when in the case of marital breakdown if one spouse leaves the family home the remaining spouse who struggles to rear the family is entitled to the existing tax concession?  There is no diminution involved in that case.  How is it that in the event of an appalling tragedy and death of one spouse the remaining spouse who must rear the family is considered to be better off than when both <Col N="149" /> were alive?  This is an anomaly and the Minister acknowledges that.</P>
    <P>There appears to be cross-party support for the amendment which, if adopted, would cost a mere £3 million in a full year.  The extention of the double band rate for a full year would cost £3 million but it would be bring a lot of relief to many people.  I cannot understand why the Minister continues to resist my request. I have heard it argued that the problem we are talking about derives from the interpretation by the Revenue Commissioners of the Murphy case but I do not know if that is the position.  Will the Minister comment on that suggestion? The Minister appeared to sympathise with the argument I advanced on this issue on Committee Stage and I cannot understand why of all the groups we have dealt with, with the obvious exception of those we disposed of this morning, this group of taxpayers are most sinned against by our tax laws.  The Minister should have a rethink on this.</P>

I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment and I note that the Minister in the course of his reply on Committee Stage, seemed to adopt a conciliatory approach.  However, at the end of the day he has not conceded the point.  At this late stage I should like to ask him to reconsider Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised the House on Committee Stage that I would give a further report on the tax treatment of widowed and single parents on Report Stage.  I have already made the point that <Col N="150" /> the income tax structure does provide some help for widowed and single parents.  Widowed persons have a widowed personal allowance which stands at £2,550 compared with the single person's allowance of £2,050.  Both widowed and single parents benefit from lone parent allowances which, combined with their basic personal allowance, give such parents effectively the same personal allowance as a married couple, that is, £4,100.</P>
      <P>As regards conceding the double rate bands to single and widowed parents, I would make the point that this would, in fact, benefit only about 20 per cent of such parents, that is, those who are paying tax at the higher rates, in other words, the higher paid.  Such a move would, as I have already informed the House, involve a cost ot some £3 million in a full year.  That is if we could confine it to that and the advice to me is that it is most unlikely.  Further costs would arise if double allowances for other reliefs, for example, life assurance and mortgage interest, were to be conceded. The question would also arise of having to exclude married couples opting for single treatment.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, that is part of the problem.  Deputy Noonan touched on it when he asked if there would be a constitutional problem involved.  There is also the complexity that the double bands would in effect be conceded because single and widowed parents had children. As the House is aware, there has been no general tax allowance for children since 1986, when the general allowance was abolished in favour of increased child benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan suggested that consideration should be given to increasing the £500 differential which widowed persons have over the single person's basic personal allowance of £2,050.  I have been looking at this possibility but it could also give rise to difficulties.  For example, increasing the differential by, say, £500 &mdash; which will be worth £150 a year to a widowed person paying tax at the standard rate &mdash; would cost some £8.5 million <Col N="151" /> a year.  It would also mean that the combined allowances of a widowed parent &mdash; the widowed personal plus the widowed parent allowances &mdash; would, at £4,600 be £500 more than the £4,100 married personal allowance.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will gather from what I said, changing the tax treatment of widowed parents is a complex matter.  I am, however, conscious of the difficulties faced by such parents and I am also conscious of the sympathy for their position among Deputies on all sides of the House, which I share.  We are all aware of cases where a spouse was left with a family, who had to educate them to second and third level, and the problems which can arise.  The Murphy case is part of the problem and the complexities of which we spoke.</P>
    <P>However, the root of the problem is &mdash; I have to repeat &mdash; the burdensome nature of our income tax structure.  Our tax rates are too high and our tax bands are too narrow, which means that the higher rates are reached very quickly, even by those on relatively modest incomes.  We have made very substantial progress on income tax in recent years by reducing the top rate of tax from 58 per cent to 53 per cent and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 30 per cent.  We have extended the standard band by £1,800 for a single person and £3,600 for a married couple.  That is a lot of progress in a few years.  Widowed taxpayers will have benefited from the improvements of recent years and will again benefit from the further improvements to which the Government are committed.</P>
    <P>I will continue the search for a solution to this problem although it is very difficult to see where it lies.  We can avail of legal advice in relation to what we can do and the constitutional aspects.  Conceding the double rate bands to single and widowed persons would, as I already informed the House, involve a cost of £3 million, even if it stopped at that.  Of course it would not stop at that because the question would also arise of having to exclude married couples opting for single treatment. Double bands would, in effect, be <Col N="152" /> conceded because single and widowed parents have children.  As the House is aware, there has been no general tax allowance since 1986.  Married couples would also make the point that in their case there are two adults to support.  Conceding the double rate bands to single and widowed parents would benefit only the 20 per cent to whom I referred.</P>
    <P>We must continue to try to find solutions to the various aspects of the problems. I assure the House that I will continue that search but, unfortunately, at this stage it is not open to me to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment.  Clearly, the Minister is sympathetic towards it but, in real life, sympathy does not put food on the table or provide clothing or education.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary, with all the expertise and back-up available to the Minister &mdash; his staff in the Department, the Attorney General and so on &mdash; that a way cannot be devised to respond sympathetically to the needs of a family when one of the spouses has died tragically.  I do not accept the argument about the Constitution put forward by the Minister. It is trotted out far too often.  Our Constitution may have its defects in some areas but, by and large, its intent is fairness and equality and its whole thrust is towards a humane position.  I cannot see that any court will interpret a decision in regard to fairness and equality in tax laws as contrary to the Constitution.  The reverse is the case.  Indeed when laws have been struck down by the Supreme Court as being contrary to the Constitution the more usual position has been because there had been inequality or unfairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of a family hit by death is traumatic and the State at such a time should be strongly supportive of that family in every possible way.  There are enough family difficulties when one of the spouses has died without heaping on an additional financial burden.  The loss of the spouse in itself causes a serious <Col N="153" /> trauma to the surviving spouse and children and to add to that concern by bringing in financial worries which did not exist when the spouse was alive is inhumane and much too tough.  Generally speaking, we are not that badly off and we do not need to punish families in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a married couple could make the case that after a death there was only one adult to support.  That is true but the other side of the coin is that there is only one adult left in the family and whereas before there might have been two earners, as a result of the death they might be down to one &mdash; or no &mdash; earner.  It could well be that the surviving spouse, by reason of commitments to family and children, would not be in a position to go out to work and would be reliant on a relatively modest income which would be very severly eaten into by inequitable and inappropriate tax charges.  If the Minister, the Government and the Department wanted to do something about this they could.</P>
    <P>Financial hardship is caused very often, particularly to widows with young children, as a result of tax impositions when the spouse has died.  I know of many cases where this applies.  It is a family even though one spouse has died.  The remaining spouse and children constitute a family within the definition of the Constitution and our laws.  They need additional support when they have been bereaved but we are giving them less support by increasing the level of taxation on the same income which was there before the person died.  One would have thought that they needed greater financial support instead of less.</P>
    <P>At the very least &mdash; although I would not regard it as acceptable &mdash; I would have thought that it should have been possible for a period of at least five years after the death to grant a concession to the bereaved family to enable them to sort out their affairs, to get on their feet, <Col N="154" /> to establish a new pattern and to accustom themselves to a new situation.  I do not think that a period of five years would be adequate &mdash; I would not accept it as a permanent solution &mdash; but it would be a start.  I would beseech the Minister to have a further think about this as quickly as possible and perhaps introduce amending legislation to cover the point.  I am quite sure he would have the support of all sides of the House on any concession he would make on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Although there were some very important issues dealt with I have avoided pressing votes in so far as that was possible throughout the passage of this Bill.  I must say I regard this as the kind of anomaly on which it was reasonable to expect a response from the Minister. I fully accept his bona fides and the fact that he is sympathetic to it but it is an area that merits a response and on which I will have to press for a vote.</P>

      <P>I am.  I just wanted to say, finally, that we have seen, in other sections of the Bill, the extraordinary rate of success that professional lobbyists have had since budget day in causing the Minister to make concessions.  It would appear that groups like widows do not have any such professional expertise or lobbyists available to them.  For example, it was possible to make significant concessions to businesses, the banks and others since budget day but not in this case.  Because this group of vulnerable people do not have any professional lobbyists I have no choice but to press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;As respects 1990-91 and subsequent years of assessment, relief in respect of children shall be allowed at £300 per child.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would have the effect of restoring to our tax code the children's allowance which was discarded some years ago.  The sum I am suggesting is £300 per dependent child.  I am aware that this would, once again, put a heavy burden on the Exchequer but, as I have already stated on an earlier amendment, I feel the amounts involved could be made up through extra taxation or the closing of tax loopholes and breaks for the corporate sector and in the area of capital taxation.  I make no apology for the potential loss in revenue in this matter.</P>
      <P>The reason for the elimination of the children's allowance was that adequate payments were being made to families through the child benefit scheme.  I am sure the Minister will also say that the lower paid families are catered for by the children's allowance where the exemption limits have been raised from £200 to £300.  That, however, does not cater for the average family which is under attack at the moment.  We have extensive debates in this House on the question of mortgage interest and I do not want to go over those points again.  I am sure the Minister would agree that the situation of a family with a mortgage is very much worse now than it was a couple of weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution is particularly protective of the family and I would be the first to support the Constitution in that. There is a very strong case to be made for having the children's allowance restored and I would suggest that the figure should be £300.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Government of which I was a member removed the child allowance from the tax code and at the same time increased child benefit.  The argument was that because of the different rates of tax the child allowance applied unequally.  If we take on board Deputy Garland's amendment the parent on the standard rate of taxation would get £90, the parent paying tax at 48 per cent would get £148 and the parent paying tax at the highest rate would get £159 in respect of each child. We believed there was a better way to give money to parents and that was through child benefit, or children's allowance as we used to call it.</P>
      <P>The child benefit is paid to the mother. In most families the child benefit, whether it comes through the post office or in the pay packet, is used for the benefit of the family.  In families where there are difficulties, however, money put in the hands of the mother is more likely to be used for the benefit of the children than money which accrues to the father's pay packet because he pays less income tax.  Those are the reasons the changes were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gives rise to a difficulty however. It accentuates the poverty trap we were <Col N="159" /> talking about before lunch.  Under the social welfare code unemployed parents are given child benefit whether they are on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or any other benefit. Children's allowance does not distinguish between children, all children under 16 years of age are eligible.  The difference in income between people on small wages and those on social welfare is so small that it is difficult for people with children to work for low wages.  There is no doubt that the abolition of the child allowance under the income tax code accentuated that problem.  If the Minister continues to reduce taxation and arrives at a situation where there are two tax rates of 25 per cent and 40 per cent, or if we go along the road Deputy Rabbitte advocates and move towards tax credits, it may be possible to direct money for the benefit of children through the tax code.  At the moment if the Minister had £100 million at his disposal I would prefer that he would use it to increase child benefit, which would apply equally to all children, than to apply it to tax relief for children which works very unevenly between different levels of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister had very few resources at his disposal for the benefit of children when he increased child benefit this year &mdash; the increase in child benefit was extremely small.  However, I accept much of what Deputy Garland said.  There certainly is a problem in directing resources to families where there are a number of children in a way that does not accentuate poverty traps.  If we could get over the problem of child tax reliefs having varying cash benefits depending on the rate of tax a person is paying, I would go along with Deputy Garland's amendment.  At present it is very interesting to debate it and I am glad that Deputy Garland put it down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has put the question of tax allowances for children in perspective.  They were removed in 1986 and an increase in child benefit was called for.  The details of existing rates for child benefit after this <Col N="160" /> budget is £15.80 per month for the first to the fourth child and for the fifth child and upwards £22.90 per month.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Garland is looking for is a tax allowance of £300 per child.  It has already been pointed out that this would mean that people on standard rate of tax would get less than the people on the higher rates, and that is not the way to distribute money, if it is there to be distributed. Taken with the rest of the package of taxation and the cost, this is the first time in a number of years that child benefit has been increased.  Except for the fifth or sixth child, in the last year or two there has not been an increase for quite some time.  When resources permit we would all like to channel money to families with children in accordance with what is in the Constitution &mdash; that we should cherish the children of the nation equally.  We all recognise how expensive an exercise it is to rear, clothe and educate children.  There is, of course, covenanting which will help taxpayers with children.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Noonan rightly says there have been extremely generous increases under the social welfare code in the whole area of child dependants as far as we could go.  The special exemptions Deputy Garland referred to were the first step along the road in attacking this problem, and going so quickly to £300 per child in the special exemption area is also a generous recognition.  We would, of course, like to go further and will undoubtedly do so as circumstances permit.</P>
      <P>The amendment put forward by Deputy Garland would cost £41 million in 1990 and £68 million in a full year.  We must ask ourselves if this is the right way to go.  Would it be the most equitable way?  Would the money be getting to the people who need it most?  If there is money available it should go to child benefit.  There again some would argue that people who do not need it will get it as well.  I know this benefit goes to the wife and is seen as her income, the sole income for stay-at-home wives.  That is the way it is viewed and that is the way it always will be viewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> There are no more resources available at the moment.  The debate, however, is worth having to see which direction people feel is more equitable &mdash; the taxation route which will give less to the people on the standard rate, who are the people who need it most, and give more to the people on the higher rates.</P>
    <P>The first time I looked at this last year when there were little or no resources available, I felt that most hardship would fall on the children of large families and that is why I focused any money I had in that direction.  This year we went for a wider spread on the basis that the benefits had not been increased for quite some time.  It is no harm to have the views of the House before sitting down to look at this for the 1991 budget on the basis that there would be additional resources at that stage, but no one can say with any certainty that that will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Garland's amendment.  I have a certain sympathy with the point that Deputy Noonan has raised, that available resources should be better targeted in the form of child benefit, but we are dealing with the tax code.  Advancing arguments, as both he and the Minister have done, to the effect that it would disproportionately benefit the higher income groups is not a very plausible argument at this stage of the day because we have long since agreed that the entire system of tax allowances and the present structure of the tax code does precisely that. All that Deputy Garland can do is to function within the existing system.  I accept, as does everybody, that it will benefit the higher earner more but what else can we do in the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as if there were not a precedent for Deputy Garland's approach.  For example let us take the very significant element of relief that has been introduced in the residential property tax.  It was found feasible to provide that residential property tax in respect of a property can be reduced by the ratio of the number of children, up to ten, residing in the home. So if you take a family that includes five <Col N="162" /> children where those five children normally live in the family home, the residential property tax otherwise payable is reduced to half.  I think section 112 of the Act applies the reduction of one tenth of the tax in respect of each qualifying child. If we are making the argument that an allowance disproportionately benefits the better off, I would have thought that by and large &mdash; although I know it is not as simple as this &mdash; the better off home owners, who would be liable to residential property tax, which says something about the type of home they have even in these days of spiralling prices, benefit from this relief.  As I said yesterday most of my constituents are not liable for residential property tax.  Why can we find it possible to bring in special reliefs for people who are liable for this tax when we cannot do it for the generality of taxpayers, as Deputy Garland seeks to address in his amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that it is good that we are arguing about this point. Having regard to the overall inequity of the system, I agree with the thrust of Deputy Garland's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It would cost £68 million to implement, as against £1.5 million for the relief on residential property tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this amendment has degenerated into a debate on some possible future developments that might take place and on which the Minister invites us to debate.  In the ideal situation one would have a provision whereby people with an income over a certain amount would not qualify for a child allowance, and the maximum available would be applied to people at the lower end of the scale and in accordance with the number of children they had. That would be a fair and equitable solution and there is no reason that such a proposal should not be considered.  There is no need to pay child allowance or to make any of the substantial allowances available to people on the upper end of the scale.  Everybody in the House pays lip service to that concept but when it <Col N="163" /> comes to the actual legislation in respect of it opinions divide and different things are said and done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland's amendment is not ideal for the reasons pointed out by Deputy Noonan.  I agree that it is not ideal and it would have the effect of disproportionately benefiting those whose incomes were higher.  People paying tax at the marginal rate of 53 per cent would benefit more <i>pro rata</i> than a person on the lowest or middle scale. Nonetheless, as has been said, we have to take the amendment in the context in which we find it and it would be of appreciable benefit to those families with a large number of children who must be supported on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Noonan raised the question, which I had overlooked but which was very much on my mind, that the reintroduction of children's allowance would effectively benefit the higher rate taxpayers.  Of course that is so.  The reason for my omission is very simple, that I am totally out of sympathy with the tax system and every time I look at an allowance I have to keep reminding myself that it should be only at the standard rate, in other words we need a system of tax credits, which would get over the problem.</P>
      <P>The present level of child benefit has already been dealt with in the Social Welfare Bill and it is no longer possible to address that problem.  I agree that the matter would be far better addressed through child benefit payments than through a child allowance.  In that connection it might be worthwhile introducing a very substantial increase in child benefit next year which would be taxable, in the same way that pensions and contributory old age pensions are taxable. In this way, whether it is done through the child allowance or through child benefit, the benefit flows to the lower paid worker away from the higher paid worker.  The Minister could consider this suggestion for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, of course, a bit more flexibility with regard to the child allowance, <Col N="164" /> in that it applied to children attending third level institutions, parents with children receving third level education need this allowance, whereas there does not seem to be any machinery to deal with their situation under the child benefit system.  Under the circumstances, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle I am not pressing the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 8, to delete &ldquo;£286&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is blatantly seeking to give some additional relief to the most oppressed section of the taxpaying population, the PAYE workforce.  It is merely seeking to address an element of it, the special allowance in respect of PRSI. Originally when this allowance was introduced &mdash; I cannot remember how many years ago &mdash; it was in the region of £312. Apparently it was reduced successively by Governments since then and it now stands at £286.  It is unusual among allowances in the sense that it is going backwards rather than forwards.  The argument on validity at the time of its inception seems to be equally valid today. The figure was £312 at the time of inception and £500 seems very reasonable now. This amendment does no more than seek to give some relief to the hard-pressed PAYE workforce.  It also, to some extent but by no means adequately, addresses the question that Deputy Noonan and others have raised here during the course of the debate on this Bill concerning how punitive PRSI can be especially on lower income groups where there is no escape, no threshold and no exemption limit and where people paying the top rate of PRSI are liable on every pound.  No concession is given for that in the tax code.  I will not labour the point.  This amendment is an attempt to lighten the burden on the back of the PAYE workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The special PRSI allowance for higher rate contributors to <Col N="165" /> social insurance was introduced in 1982 to offset the decline in disposable incomes caused in 1982-83 by the increases in the higher rates of PRSI and the imposition of the 1 per cent youth employment levy. The amount of the allowance was set at £312, as Deputy Rabbitte has said.  It was not available to public servants and others who contributed at a lower rate of PRSI.  The relief was confined to 1982-83.</P>
      <P>The allowance is not a permanent allowance and requires renewal on an annual basis.  The relief was nontheless reintroduced in 1983-84 at £286 and has continued annually since then at that rate.  The allowance is now being retained for the year 1990-91.  As Deputy Rabbitte has said, the amendment is another blatant attempt to try to get more relief for the PAYE sector.  The increase to £500 will cost an additional £23.9 million in 1990 and £39.8 million in a full year and these people will benefit in whole or in part from the increase.  The cost of the retention of the allowance at last year's level, as I have said, at £286 as proposed in the Bill is estimated at £51 million in 1990 and £80.2 million in a full year and 611,000 taxpayers, of whom 607,000 will have a reduced tax liability and 4,000 will be relieved of tax altogether, are expected to benefit.  In these circumstances and bearing in mind the cost of this year's income tax package, excluding the PRSI allowance, which will amount to £200.7 million in a full year &mdash; not counting the benefits to everybody from the reduction in VAT by 2 percentage points and a reduction of excise duties in certain areas &mdash; I must reject the amendment.</P>

      <P>(ii) that, being a husband, who, for the relevant year of assessment, is assessed to tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, his wife was, throughout that year, totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity, and</P>

The last point in my amendment No. 16 of last Wednesday referred to the case that gave rise to this amendment, the Dunne baby case.  The Dunne parents were entitled to avail of the sum of £2,500 per year or approximately £50 per week from the interest on the capital sum.  It was my understanding that if that was increased, as I proposed, to £5,000 &mdash; which the Minister now seems to be agreeing to in his amendment &mdash; a person in the circumstances that I am referring to who is not technically employed but who is looking after the incapacitated person would now be entitled to avail of £5,000 per annum from the money available.

      <P>I am genuinely trying to tease out this matter.  I think I might be at cross purposes with the Minister.  This amendment deals with the allowance for a housekeeper taking care of an incapacitated person.  That is how it is described in section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969.  In the Dunne case, as I understand it, which was my motivation in tabling this amendment, where the child is a ward of court, the parents are permitted £2,500 per year in order to look after the child.  The parents were not employed and they could avail of an allowance up to but not beyond £2,500, which was £50 per week because the father would lose his dole entitlement or whatever.  I am puzzled by the reference to the employed person.  Can a parent in this situation be an employed person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in relation to the Dunne case as reported in the newspapers, as I understand it, was that when the Dunne child was in an income tax situation the allowances available to him were the single personal allowance plus the £2,500 allowance for somebody to look after him on the basis that that person is a taxable person.  At this stage we do not know who will look after the child.  It may well be that they may have to employ somebody from outside and if that is the case that allowance is available.  That is where it originates. <Col N="169" /> It also applies where there is an incapacitated spouse in the house and somebody has to be employed &mdash; this is where it became known as a housekeeper's allowance &mdash; to look after a fully incapacitated person.  There was an allowance of £2,500 but it is now £5,000.  It could also apply where the two people in the house are incapacitated, where a person has to be employed.  That is the reason I say one spouse or spouses because there could be two people in the house who are incapacitated.  In that case the allowance of £5,000 is still available. Does that clarify the matter?</P>

The table attached to the amendment would seem to confine this particular relief to the incapacitated person or to the spouse of the incapacitated person, and as drafted it refers to a wife. What about a situation where there is an incapacitated person in a house other than the husband or the wife?  Since we are talking about the Dunne case, suppose they had lost the court case, they had an incapacitated child in the house who was not a taxpayer because he did not have any income.  In those circumstances there would be no allowance of £2,500.  That is the position of a child. Is that correct?</P>

The Minister is aware of what happens that when the income comes in all the other benefits disappear, for example, the medical card and all the other areas from which the child benefited until the court award was made. One cannot talk on the one hand in the tax code area and try to move it over and apply it in a non-tax area.</P>

      <P>I must bear that in mind but Deputy Noonan is quite right, I have to disagree with Deputy Rabbitte on this. We are discussing amendment No. 19 which is before the House, and it is fair to comment on amendment No 19, today what it does, what it does not do and to give our opinion as to what it ought to do.  That is what we are talking about and that is perfectly in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 is related.  There is a relationship with amendment No. 20 because of the suggestions that there was an interlink between the two positions. We must be clear on what amendment No. 20 does not do.  We know what it does &mdash; it covers the Dunne case and a very small number of similar cases.  As I said this morning, I am delighted about that and the Minister is to be congratulated for doing it.  This will be of immense help to the Dunne family and the others who are in that position. However, the number of cases it will cover is extremely small.  It is tied down very stringently in the conditions that are set.  I do not complain about that but, for example, it applies only to people who have a mental or physical infirmity which is permanent.  Many people will have incapacities for ten or 20 years, and that might not be regarded as permanent. People could be very severely injured in an extraordinarily bad way yet not come within those parameters.  It is for such situations that we have to look at the amendment No. 19 type of measure, namely, the provision of a tax allowance for a person to care for them.  There always was such a provision &mdash; I think it was originally in section 143 of the Principal Act, but it is extremely limited in its application, as Deputy Noonan said rightly, covering only the case where a husband or wife is totally incapacitated by old age or infirmity and a person is <Col N="175" /> employed to take care of the incapacitated individual.  All the Minister is doing here is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Updating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that very narrow parameter increasing that tax allowance from £2,500 to £5,000 which, so far as it goes, is welcome.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Noonan is trying to make a point &mdash; and if he is I support him &mdash; that there is a very large number of very needy and deserving cases to which that concession should be extended and should apply.  He referred to Down's Syndrome cases, and there could be other types of cases of severe incapacity, where a child or a father with a modest income is paying tax, but cannot, because of his or her old age, responsibilities or whatever, care for the incapacitated person. In that case there is no allowance in the system to employ a person to take care of such an incapacitated individual.  This is the appropriate category to discuss it because the issue of providing care is what is under discussion.  Unfortunately, mental illness &mdash; in particular Down's Syndrome and other illnesses &mdash; is tragically an appreciable and increasing phenomenon in Irish society.  It is high time that we applied our minds to what that means for families with a person in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that health cuts have severely cut back the number of residential places that are available for these people.  The present trend is to have these people cared for within the community and within the family.  That is a debatable point in itself, but, even assuming one accepts that as a starting point, if some incapacitated people are to be cared for within their own families and communities, surely the State has a responsibility to make financial provision to enable families, enlarged families and communities, to do just that, and that it has not done. the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance saved themselves appreciable sums of money by their health cutbacks reducing the numbers of residential places.  The very least the <Col N="176" /> State could do would be to make a tax allowance for the family with a modest income to enable a person to help take care of his or her relation who is suffering from a very serious mental or physical infirmity.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, Deputy Taylor has elaborated on a real social need and Deputy Noonan raised the question in terms of the necessity to broaden the scope of section 3 of the 1969 Finance Act.  I agree with that &mdash; and I am sure we all do &mdash; but if it is otherwise, I would like the Minister to tell me because after I asked the initial questions I thought I was clear in my mind on it.</P>
      <P>I rise on the point Deputy Noonan made that an incapacitated person who is made an award in the circumstances described can benefit from this allowance but all these other categories such as Down's Syndrome people who were not made an award cannot benefit from the allowance.  My clear understanding is that this allowance does not apply in the first category because after amendment No. 20 there will be no liability to tax. Therefore this allowance cannot apply.  It can only apply in the restricted terms of section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <P>That is correct.  It is an allowance against a taxable income. Deputy Taylor and Deputy Noonan are quite right.  This allowance was introduced about 1969 and it is being updated. Amendment No. 20 takes out a category which could apply and deals with it separately. This does not do anything for Down's Syndrome children.  It fits the purpose which we intended &mdash; no more, no less.</P>

      <P>In page 13, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>4.  &mdash;Section 138B of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from and including &ldquo;, save that it does not include&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;emoluments&rdquo; in subsection (2), down to the end of the section.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the £800 PAYE allowance to relatives of owners and directors of companies in circumstances where full tax return is made and full PRSI is paid. If a son or a daughter is employed in a parent's company as an employee, paying full income tax and full PRSI, he or she should get the allowance just like any other PAYE worker and should not be excluded simply because of relationship to the proprietor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally in support of Deputy Noonan in this matter. Governments in the past few years have been increasingly anti-small family business. This is a very serious discrimination. It is outrageous and representations have been made to me about it.  I do not know how it ever got into legislation.  If two small business people know one another, each has to send one of his children to the other's business.  That is the only way they can get the allowance.  There is an implication that a family business is a tax racket and that the employment of sons or daughters is a gigantic tax fiddle.  That is a libel on the self-employed who are the backbone of this country.  I would be totally supportive of Deputy Noonan in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the PAYE allowance to certain categories of persons, i.e. proprietary directors, their spouses and <Col N="179" /> children and the spouses and children of self-employed individuals, who are at present excluded from the allowance even though they are taxed under the PAYE system.</P>
      <P>The PAYE allowance is, and always has been, intended to be available only to ordinary employees.  When the allowance was introduced it was made clear that it was aimed at improving the tax progression for these ordinary PAYE taxpayers and was in response to the case made by the ICTU that the general scheme of allowances then in existence discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Proprietary directors were originally excluded from the allowance on the basis that they were in a position to control their own remuneration or that of their spouses.  Proprietary directors are, in fact, in most instances the self-employed in an incorporated form.</P>
      <P>Spouses of the self-employed and proprietary directors are excluded from the PAYE allowance to avoid a repetition of the abuses of the &ldquo;working wife's allowance&rdquo;. When that allowance existed, it was common-place for the self-employed to set up nominal employments for their wives, sufficient to attract the full measure of the allowance without incurring any extra tax.  It was very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to challenge a wife's entitlement to this allowance because the husband invariably produced &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to prove that she was entitled to it.</P>
      <P>Children of the self-employed and proprietary directors are excluded from the PAYE allowance because the experience of many years has shown that if a tax advantage can be gained by creating artificial income or employment for children then that device will be used.  Furthermore, the wages of many people who carry out duties in their parents' business, or indeed their spouses' business, are not subject to the proper operation of PAYE.  In such cases, there would appear to be no justification for granting the PAYE allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Finance Bill debates on <Col N="180" /> the issue in 1980, the possibility of extending the allowance to spouses and children of the self-employed was examined in response to an undertaking by the then Minister.</P>
    <P>No satisfactory means could, however, be found of identifying the cases to which the allowance should be extended.  Whatever criteria might be decided upon, they would require that the Revenue's income tax staff would be involved in elaborate investigation and policing procedures in order to work the scheme in practice. The diversion of the Revenue's scarce resources to such work would be highly undesirable.  Even if the problem of identifying the cases to which the allowance should be extended could be solved, it was found that it would still not be possible to devise a scheme that would not be open to widespread abuse and avoidance.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, there remains the important question of cost. It is estimated that the cost of extending the PAYE allowance on the basis proposed by the amendment would cost about £58 million in a full year and about £38 million in 1990.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I should declare my interest by saying that my son works in my firm and if Deputy Noonan's amendment were adopted it would be to his advantage.  I have been discussing with Deputy Rabbitte the original rationale of this exclusion of a child working in a parent's firm from the PAYE allowance.  As the Minister has indicated, it turns out to be that if the exclusion were not there it might lead to widespread fraud.  It seems somewhat strange when one analyses it that this is an adequate reason for discriminating and for taking away the rights of one person which are enjoyed by another person in exactly the same situation. There are always possibilities of fraudulent abuse in all aspects of tax laws, and no doubt there is a fair bit of it, but I think it is true to say that the overwhelming majority of people are law abiding and <Col N="181" /> pay whatever tax is properly due.  Fortunately the number who do not is relatively small.</P>
      <P>It seems somewhat anomalous that where there are so many genuine cases of a son or daughter working hard in a perfectly normal manner in firms &mdash; I know many who do this &mdash; their position should be different from the point of view of tax for no reason than that the owner of the firm happens to be their parent.  I suppose it would be hard for them to accept that the reason for them being deprived of the same PRSI allowance their friend down the road has is because other people might resort to fraud.  I understand the reasons for it but it does seem a bit hard.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am disappointed at the Minister's reply.  I do not want to catch all the categories alluded to by the Minister with my amendment, only sons and daughters.  I can see the difficulty in applying the allowance to spouses.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that we do not have the excellent staff advising us which he has advising him and that sometimes when we are drafting an amendment and thumbing through old Finance Bills we do not absolutely hit the nail on the head.  What I had in mind are sons and daughters in respect of whom proper tax returns and full PRSI payments are made.  I did not think it would be beyond the wit of the officials in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to give them the £800 allowance like anyone else.  I believe that would cut down on the opportunities for fraud.  If a proper return is made for income tax and PRSI they should not be excluded from the PAYE allowance simply because their father or mother owns the business in which they work.  Perhaps the Minister will look again at this point &mdash; I presume he will be bringing in a budget next year. I will not press my amendment.</P>

      <P>This comes back to the debate we had this morning on mortgage interest relief and the relative merit of allowances. There is a cross over effect here for mortgage interest relief.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that in many of these cases one could argue there is an element of retrospective legislation in that a commitment to take out an insurance policy and pay an annual premium is a permanent long term commitment. One could argue in cases like this &mdash; I should like the Minister to take <Col N="183" /> this point on board for the year &mdash; that the full relief should be granted in respect of those policies already taken out.  If there is to be a restriction, which I do not believe there should be, it should be limited to policies taken out after the appropriate date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole area of insurance and the purposes for which insurance premiums are used has changed dramatically during recent years.  I do not think we should lose sight of the fact that the purpose of the tax relief in respect of life assurance was to encourage taxpayers to make provision for their dependants in the event of early death or for their eventual retirement. However, with the growth of superannuation schemes, the provision of sophisticated retirement packages for the self-employed and the advent of PRSI for the self-employed the original justification for the relief has been considerably diminished.  Furthermore, the life assurance industry in Ireland has experienced substantial growth in the past few decades not only in terms of volume but also in the range of products on offer.  An increasing proportion of life assurance contracts are being used as savings and investment vehicles rather than as a means of providing security for dependants.</P>
      <P>The consequences of the interaction of these developments and the tax relief available in respect of premiums paid is that, in effect, the taxpayer is getting tax relief on the capital element of his investment.  To that extent, the availability of the relief is a cause of distortion in the financial investment.  An added consideration is that relatively little tax is paid by assurance companies on the incomes generated by them from life assurance and the investment as it finally emerges from the company is fully exempt in the hands of the investor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the contention that restriction of life assurance relief is somehow bad for the economy.  The restrictions I have introduced are aimed at getting income tax rates down, reducing <Col N="184" /> the income tax burden and helping job creation.  The income tax system is acting as a disincentive to enterprise.  The changes I have introduced in the last two year are aimed at unlocking that effort in enterprise for the benefit of the economy. I cannot accept that this essential task of improving our income tax structure will in some way damage the economy.  This is the view held by those outside and has been expressed to me many time in letters, etc.</P>
    <P>We all agree that we need a better income tax system.  The Government are doing their very best to bring this about and the restriction on life assurance must be seen in that light, it is purely as a contribution to the overall tax reduction package which was given out in the budget.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point that it is less necessary now to give the relief because of the availability of superannuation schemes, pension schemes and so on.  There are certainly plenty of pension schemes and superannuation schemes available although there are tax implications involved in those as well.  Those pension subscription items represent a very substantial cost to the Exchequer and very considerably more than would be involved in the life assurance policies we are talking about here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made the point that insurance companies pay very little tax on what comes to them from this source. If that is so &mdash; and I know it is so &mdash; it is nobody's fault but the Minister's because he is the one who can bring in taxation measures on the insurance companies to ensure that there is an appropriate take from them.  The Minister ought to do this; the Labour Party have advocated this for many years.  Like the banks and financial institutions insurance companies are not paying nearly enough.  They are always <Col N="185" /> moaning and complaining about something. Their profits go up all the time, yet they whinge and moan.  When we had juries they moaned and wanted them abolished.  They told us that if juries were abolished everything would be all right but when the Government abolished juries they continued to whinge.  It is difficult to know what they want but in the meantime their buildings get glossier and are granite and marble faced.  They continue to build luxury offices.  There are not many signs that they are in a bad way.  In my view they are doing extraordinarily well for the reason that the Minister advanced, they are paying very little tax.  The Minister should do something about that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;The amount of rent which tenants aged 55 and over of private landlords can claim against income tax under section 142A of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1982 (as amended) is hereby increased from £750 (single and widowed persons) and £1,500 (married couples) to £2,000 in all cases.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is also in Deputy Garland's name, a new grand alliance has been established on these amendments. As a nation we take pride in the fact that we have the highest home ownership of any country in Europe.  We also take pride in the fact that those who do not own their own homes are housed very adequately, generally speaking, by local authorities but one category experiences difficulty, those who do not own their own homes and are in private rented accommodation.  I do not have in mind <Col N="186" /> the young workers around the city who live in flats, bedsitters and so on but those over 55 years of age who for one reason or another do not have a home of their own and who do not qualify for a local authority house.  There is a tax allowance against rent of £750 for a single person and £1,500 for a married couple.  That was introduced in 1967 when it was quite common for people in their later years to be in accommodation where the rent was more or less fixed.  A famous court case found in favour of the landlord rather than the tenant and, following the passage of legislation here, rent tribunals were established to review rents every five years.  Rents now relate more to market value for people in their fifties and sixties who for much of their lives lived in the rented accommodation and paid very low rent.</P>
    <P>Our suggestion is that the allowance should be increased substantially, up to £2,000 for married couples and single people though there might be a constitutional problem in treating a married couple and a single person similarly for allowance purposes.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to another problem in regard to rented accommodation.  A married couple qualify for the £1,500 allowance but if one of them dies the surviving spouse must pay the same rent.  However, the allowance is reduced to £750.  That can represent a very serious imposition. The trauma of bereavement is accompanied by a serious deterioration in that person's finances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put it on the record of the House that my mother lives in rented accommodation.  The principle behind the relief has been accepted. The rates were increased in 1985, and rightly so, but they have not been reviewed for five years.  In the meantime rents have increased substantially, by about 35 per cent.  It seems only reasonable that the increases in rents should be reflected in the allowance.  It is reasonable that there should be a special provision to cater for a surviving spouse who must continue to pay the full rent.  It could be argued that now that only one <Col N="187" /> person instead of two is living in the house or flat the surviving spouse has too much space at his or her disposal and should seek smaller accommodation at a lower rent.  I hope the Minister will not use that argument against our amendment.  Most of us have elderly parents and are aware that when they reach a certain age it is difficult to get them to leave their accommodation. Generally speaking, a couple who move to rented accommodation at a certain age will not leave it.  I should like to ask the Minister to be generous in regard to this allowance.  The amount involved is very small, particularly in regard to widowers or widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment raises a very fundamental issue.  As the years roll on and one comes across provisions in the income tax code and branches of the law they become almost like axioms.  One almost comes to the conclusion that they have always existed.  One adjusts one's mind to the belief that the provisions are right and proper.  However, we should stop and think about these matters. Where is the rationale in saying that a person in the happy position of being able to buy a house with a mortgage, although he may be struggling to meet his repayments or have his mortgage interest relief cut back to 80 per cent of the amount, should have at least a proportion of his repayments credited against his income tax?  That person will own the house at some stage although that may not occur for ten or 20 years.  We take it that it is right and proper that such a person should be given an income tax allowance in respect of his repayments which are building up an equity in the house and that a tenant who, generally speaking, is at the lower end of the scale and is not building up an equity in the premises he is living in, should not receive any credit for income tax purposes against the rent payments he makes.  There is no logic to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that most people would say that the tenant should have first claim to income tax relief rather than the purchaser.  Everything is loaded in <Col N="188" /> favour of the purchaser, although I accept that the relief has been cut back but the unfortunate tenant, except those over 55 years of age, does not receive anything.  He pays out his rent and does not build up any interest in the house. The tenant will never own the house irrespective of how long he lives there and his rent will be increased from time to time. He will get the wrong end of the stick on all occasions.  Where is the rationale in that?  Where is the rationale for saying that a person who rents a business premises is entitled to write off the full amount of his rent against his tax liabilities whereas the residential tenant, who provides a home for himself by paying rent, is not entitled to anything?  That is a fundamental question.  We have often talked about tax reform and we have said that it does not mean tax reductions or adjustments. This is the sort of thing we mean when we talk about tax reform.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that a fundamental issue of that nature can be tackled by this amendment or indeed in the Finance Bill. Obviously it cannot but I ask the Minister to think about it and begin the process as soon as possible of bringing the position of the tenant into line <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of the house purchaser and to equalise their tax positions.  The amendment is extremely limited but it should be supported for the small benefit it would bring to a very limited category of tenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support, without reservation, what my colleague said on this amendment.  There can be no justification for not acceding to the request. All parties have been provided with a note to remind us of the grim reality by the organisation Threshold, for example, and the pertinent points have been put on the record of the House.  It should be noted they make the point that most of the affected tenants are now very elderly, in declining health and &mdash; as a result of a survey conducted in 1989 &mdash; that the number of former rent controlled tenants has fallen by one third since 1982 and that 25 per cent of the remaining decontrolled tenants were aged 75 or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot conceive any case which the <Col N="189" /> Minister could advance against implementing this amendment.  It also provides for a situation where one of the spouses dies which, in the circumstances we are describing, is particularly tragic because to lose a lifelong partner in the twilight of your life is traumatic.  As Deputy Garland said, I presume nobody will suggest that they should move out of their accommodation, which might have been their home for many years, to live the remainder of their life in a smaller abode.  That is simply not practical.  The rent remains the same but the allowance is halved. That is unjust and I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to increase the allowance to individuals aged 55 years and over in respect of rent paid for private accommodation from £750 to £2,000 in the case of a single and widowed person and from £1,500 to £2,000 in the case of a married couple.  The cost of the amendment is estimated at a reasonably small sum of £900,000 in 1990 and £1.5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>As drafted, I am advised that the amendment would clearly be in conflict with the Supreme Court judgment in the Murphy case.  To accord with that judgment the allowance for a married couple would have to be set at double the figure for single persons, which is £4,000. In that event, the cost would be £1.35 million in 1990 and £2.25 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Deputies should also bear in mind that as you increase the tax allowance on anything like this, the landlord raises the rent.  As I said, I cannot accept the amendment but I undertake to have it examined sympathetically for next year's budget.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the constitutional implications but there is a counter legal view of the interpretation of the Murphy decision from that of the Revenue, which might be worth looking at.  I am glad the Minister made a commitment in the House and I presume that, if he continues to insist <Col N="190" /> that there is a constitutional bar to doing it this way, he will pick a figure &mdash; as Deputy Garland suggested &mdash; somewhere in between, especially in relation to widowed people.  If there is an increase next year and a new category in between for the widow or widower I will withdraw my amendment, if Deputy Garland agrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;(1) The Minister may make regulations under this section providing for the assimilation of the treatment under the Income Tax Acts afforded to parties to a non-marital relationship to that which would be afforded to a husband and wife.</P>
      <P>(2) Regulations made under this section may provide for such consequential, supplementary and ancillary provisons, including provisions modifying any provision of the Income Tax Acts, as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.</P>
      <P>(3) For the purposes of this section two persons shall be regarded as being parties to a non-marital relationship if they prove, in accordance with the regulations, that they have entered into a voluntary union which is intended to endure for their joint lives to the exclusion of all other persons.</P>
      <P>(4) Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under this section a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would authorise the <Col N="191" /> Minister to make regulations to liken the treatment under the Income Tax Acts of parties to a non-marital relationship with that accorded to a husband and wife.</P>
    <P>Last night, on Committee Stage, we discussed an amendment in the context of the capital acquisitions tax legislation and this is a similar amendment to deal with the income tax position arising in non-marital relationships.  As I said on the debate on the other matter last night, the State, particularly since the passing of the Judicial Separation Act, recognises marital breakdown.  We must recognise that there is a high incidence of marital breakdown, that an appreciable number of judicial separation decrees has been pronounced by the courts and separation agreements entered into.</P>
    <P>We must also accept that many of the people who are involved in marital breakdown have set up permanent and lasting relationships with other partners and that many children are involved.  The law has already recognised and quite properly given them equal rights and status with marital children.  I do not want to go over last night's debate but a very large proportion of the people living in non-marital relationships do so involuntarily in the sense that they would like nothing better than to get married and regularise their position if the law would allow them to do so.  However, because one of the spouses is married to someone else and because we do not have absolute divorce, they have no choice but to live the way they do.  Many of the relationships have lasted for anything from ten to 30 years or more and they constitute a family in everything except the technical aspect of the term.  It is just, right, equitable and proper that the same income tax laws should apply to them as is the case with spouses but it does not apply.</P>
    <P>They fall into two categories, the wealthy and ordinary working people.  The wealthy do not have much of a problem because they can get advice on their tax affairs from solicitors, accountants and so on.  However, working people, those <Col N="192" /> on very low incomes or who are unemployed, are in an appalling position.  The tax allowance that a husband, for example, gets for his wife does not apply here.  The husband will receive a single person's allowance only.  In many cases the female partner in the non-marital alliance would have no income at all.  The only tax allowance they would receive would be the man's single person's allowance. No doubt the Minister will tell us when replying &mdash; and he will be quite right to say so &mdash; that they can put that position in order by entering into an annuity deed.  That is not true; I know all that.  The Minister should not waste breath telling me that; I know that; I know they can do so.  First of all, they must know about that &mdash; and many of them do not; and they have to be able to afford solicitor's or accountancy fees to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They are expensive and they just do not have the money to pay solicitors and accountants to see to that. They may have to pay stamp duty on the annuity document.  They may have quite a prolonged, frustrating correspondence and negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners to have it accepted and registered. The Revenue Commissioners raise all sorts of questions &mdash; I would not say difficulties but they raise questions &mdash; as to proof that the money has been paid; they ask for affidavits to verify that it has been paid and so on.  All of that costs money and trouble.  We must remember we are talking here of people on very low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a principle involved in all of this.  Let us accept the principle.  If the Minister is saying they can rectify the position by the back door, by entering into annuity deeds, why not rectify the position up-front, recognise that such circumstances exist, say: we do not want to put these people through the mill of a whole legal gobbledegook, a fictional arrangement to provide for something we know is right, that should be provided for <Col N="193" /> by law in the normal way.  When they establish that a permanent liaison exists, the same income tax regime should apply to them as would apply if they were married. For all practical purposes in their relationships such people live together for very many years, are devoted to each other, the relationship is permanent and they have children.  It is exactly the same as a family arrangement or unit and should be regarded as such.  There is nothing unconstitutional about it any more than there is in recognising the rights of non-marital children.  That is one aspect of it.</P>
    <P>When the male partner of a non-marital liaison dies the female partner remaining is in a particularly indivious position. Had she been his wife she would have been entitled to a widowed person's allowance of £2,550.  She has no such entitlement because, technically speaking, she is not the widow.  Then we are faced with the strange position that the widow's allowance would go to the original &ldquo;wife&rdquo;&mdash; in parenthesis &mdash; whom the man might not have seen for 20 or even 30 years and who is then very likely living with somebody else in a different non-marital liaison.  Where is the logic of saying that the former wife should have the benefit of the widowed person's allowance rather than the woman that man has been living with for, say, 25 years, who may have brought up a family of three, four or five children?</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of illogicalities we are allowing prevail within our tax system when we fail to recognise circumstances staring us in the face, that we know are widespread in this country.  Rather we go through this pretence, this cod, of convincing ourselves, saying: Ah, no, this woman he has not laid eyes on for 20 years is his wife; she is the person who is entitled to receive the widowed person's allowance; we pretend that she is the person with such entitlement, as though they were married in the normal way and everything was normal as in an ideal relationship.  Why do we deal with it by messing about with annuity deeds, fixing up the position and not recognising the <Col N="194" /> reality but rather dealing with it all by way of pretence?</P>
    <P>There are other adverse effects, not just in respect of the widow's allowance or the income tax allowance that a spouse would normally receive.  It applies also to mortgage interest relief.  For example, a widow would be entitled to mortgage interest relief of £2,320 whereas the partner in a non-marital liaison left widowed for all practical purposes would receive no mortgage interest relief whatsoever. Likewise in the case of age allowance, a married couple would receive £400 which would not apply in the case of non-marital relationships.</P>
    <P>Those are the anomalies prevailing. We must recognise that we are now in the nineties in Ireland.  We accept that marital breakdown occurs; we accept that judicial separation decrees are given; we accept that separation agreements are entered into.  These tax consequences flow from a recognition of these circumstances. It is no good pretending that they do not exist.  It is sad, unfortunate, one would wish it did not happen, but it is all too widespread.  The numbers of cases are increasing in which judicial separation orders are made.  The effect of such orders is a complete break between husband and wife when they become completely separate people.  As I said yesterday it is exactly the same as a divorce for every single purpose except as to their right to remarry.  It has tax implications. Let us recognise them and deal with the position as it obtains.</P>
    <P>There are details to be worked out in any endeavour to abolish this discrimination. I am not specifically legislating by way of this amendment.  I am simply suggesting an enabling provision to allow the Minister make regulations to sort out the details.  It would constitute a tremendous saving and give relief to so many thousands of couples up and down the country in this position.  I had one such person in my office a few weeks ago, a bus conductor with Bus Áth Cliath. He has a fair salary from that position, nothing to write home about.  He was married before, has been separated from his former wife for many a long year. <Col N="195" /> He is living with this woman, they have children, and find themselves in a hopeless financial position.  His taxation is crippling them.  In order to alleviate their position I have to set about the whole rigmarole with regard to annuity deeds which I am endeavouring to undertake for him, and which is complex.  The Revenue Commissioners are not as accommodating as they might be on this issue and they are slow enough.</P>
    <P>We must remember that, even when an annuity deed has been negotiated and signed and they endeavour to obtain the refund to which they are then entitled, they must wait a whole year before the processing of the application for the refund is completed.  In other words, for the whole of the relevant year they have to suffer and get by.  I would remind the Minister that they do suffer hardship in not having sufficient food on the table, sufficient clothing, sufficient school books for their children.  I am talking about one salary earner, the wages of a bus conductor with Bus Áth Cliath &mdash; that is all the income coming into that household.  He is taxed as a single man although his family unit consists of himself, the woman concerned and three young children.  They are suffering financially.  All right, come the middle of the year, I suppose he will receive his refund but he must wait a long time for it.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners want proof that the annuity money was paid week on week or month on month, whatever. They do not even accept a statement to that effect.  That is the case even though these people living as a family unit.  For example, the couple were given a local authority house.  In additon, affidavits were required of both the woman and the man, and that is expensive.  Then one must correspond with and get clearance from the Revenue Commissioners. I can tell the Minister that, as a result of his staff cutbacks, a reply from the Revenue Commissoners will not be forthcoming within the week or the month either.  It is a long, slow haul.  By the time one finds the right Department, one's <Col N="196" /> correspondence having passed from this to that section, from this to that PAYE unit, from one premises to the other, it becomes a cumbersome, lengthy process. I have experience of it.</P>
    <P>I have processed one or two of these applications and, believe me, it is quite a headache.  If one were to charge, as do most solicitors and accountants, the full scale fees, it would be quite a pricey, expensive operation, not the kind that a bus conductor employed by Bus Áth Cliath could readily afford.  He is discriminated against and suffers in a way the wealthy person does not.  What I am asking for here is fair, reasonable and equitable.  It is also unanswerable.  The Minister in his heart knows that it is unanswerable and that logic requires what is being sought in the amendment. I look forward with interest to hearing how he is going to approach the answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not bore Deputy Taylor by referring to the arguments put forward on a similar amendment which was discussed on Committee Stage in relation to capital acquisition tax.  In the course of the debate I indicated that there were serious objections to the principle that tax law should lead general law in the manner Deputy Taylor describes.  I do not at this stage feel there is any need to go over the same arguments again.  Deputy Taylor knows quite well, being a legal man, that the issue he has debated at length are matters of general law which have to be tackled in general law and that tax law will follow, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I could not accept the amendment on Committee Stage, neither can I accept it on Report Stage.  I pointed out on Committee Stage the ways and means available under the present law to deal with the problems that exist.  I recognise that such problems exist but we do not live in a perfect world.  We are dealing here with tax law, not general law.  Nevertheless, under tax law, as the Deputy admitted, one finds a way to deal with it.  The bus conductor was lucky in going to Deputy Taylor as apparently he dealt with it in a reasonable way having regard to what the <Col N="197" /> bus conductor could afford.  As I say, that is the position and until general law is changed there is no point in arguing the matter any further.  When general law recognises the type of union Deputy Taylor speaks about I have no doubt that tax law will follow, as appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We went over these arguments last night and Deputy Taylor has again very lucidly advanced the case in favour of his amendment.  I see little point in dwelling on it now.  The Minister has said we cannot have a situation where tax law leads general law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but this seems to be a case of live horse and you will get grass. As far as I can see, there is no prospect of the Government bringing forward the amendments required to general law. The practice has now left the law so far behind that it is completely anachronistic in the Ireland of the nineties.  Everyone knows that the circumstances predicted in this amendment exist to a very wide extent throughout the entire country and are no longer confined to urban areas. It would be all very well to talk about awaiting amendments to general law if there was a prospect of this occurring but to the best of my knowledge and belief there is no such prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw attention once again, as I did last night, to the onerous conditions which would be imposed by the enabling provisions set out in the amendment especially in subsection (3).  I cannot contemplate any circumstances outside of the regular marital arrangement whereby one could have more rigorous requirements imposed on a liaison than what are envisaged in subsection (3).  It would be required for the purposes of that section that the two persons be regarded as being parties to a non-marital relationship if they prove, in accordance with the regulations, that they have entered into a voluntary union which is intended to endure for their joint lives to the exclusion of all other persons.  They <Col N="198" /> would be as demanding as marriage vows, the only difference being the taking of marriage vows is not an option open to those we are referring to here through no fault of their own.  The provision which would allow them to regularise the liaison does not exist under Irish law.</P>
    <P>It is cold comfort indeed to the people who find themselves disadvantaged for the Minister to say that it would be improper for tax law to precede general law in this area.  This is a matter of grave concern to a growing number of people in society and I do not accept that it is not possible for us, given the excellent tradition of an Irish solution for an Irish problem, to take on the tax implications of what is now a fact of life in Ireland and to devise an Irish solution for this peculiar Irish problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to the Minister's reply to this reasonable amendment.  The Minister spoke about creating a precedent if changes in general law were to be preceded by changes in tax law.  However a precedent has already been created by the Department of Social Welfare because the Minister for Social Welfare penalises a couple on learning that they are co-habiting.  As this is the case, why can the benefits which would accrue to the couple under tax law not be applied?  One solution is as good as another, irrespective of whether it is an Irish solution.  The Department of Social Welfare have no problem in penalising couples who co-habit.  It would follow therefore that the privileges that might accrue under tax law should also be applied on the grounds of common justice.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Ferris for their support for the amendment.  As I said yesterday, I cannot accept the argument that one has to await an amendment to the general law as this is an income tax matter and nothing but and entirely appropriate to a Finance Bill.  It is not appropriate to deal <Col N="199" /> with the wrong which I am trying to have remedied, by way of a change in the general law.  One cannot deem the category we are speaking about to be man and wife.  What we are trying to do is resolve the adverse income tax position of a couple living in a non-marital liaison on a permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has said on their position is harsh.  We are supposed to cherish all the children of the nation equally but the position of the children of such a non-marital liaison is not equal. They suffer financially because of this harsh income tax provision which the Minister refuses to deal with.  What it amounts to is a punishment on the family unit.  The whole concept is that because they have not been able, through no fault of theirs, to adapt to the usual norm, live their married life, they find themselves forced into this position.  This State takes <Col N="200" /> it upon itself to punish them financially, just as courts impose fines on people as a punishment.  They are fined by having an appreciable amount of their hard earned money taken out of their modest wage.  Why should they be punished in that way?  I thought it was criminals who were punished, who were fined and who are adversely affected by the financial implications.  These are innocent people trying to do their best for themselves and their children in difficult circumstances and it ill behoves us in this House to pass laws that are a harsh punishment week in and week out on them and their children. The financial implications are very serious indeed, and these people suffer very badly from them.  It will be most disappointing if we do not face up to that situation and recognise it.  I am pressing the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Agricultural Policy: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Connaughton on Tuesday, 22 May 1990:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P>(a) recognise the present crisis in Irish agriculture with particular reference to the present GATT round negotiations;</P>
    <P>(b)  acknowledge the serious income crisis now affecting thousands of Irish farmers;</P>
    <P>(c)  Implement measures that will help to alleviate some of the problems associated with the present crisis in the areas of milk, beef and store cattle, cereals and sheep; and</P>
    <P>(d)  make low interest loans available to finance beef production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> The Government is therefore called upon to arrange for the funds to be borrowed on the German market, cover the exchange risk, arrange for the funds to be on-lent by the Associated Banks with a modest handling charge, the lending rate to be kept at or below 11 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;acknowledging that a major restructuring of Irish agriculture and food production is necessary to</P>
    <P>&mdash;end poverty-line farm incomes</P>
    <P>&mdash;make the transition to a more liberalised agricultural market which removes artificial upward price-fixing mechanisms</P>
    <P>&mdash;reverse the concentration of agricultural land into the hands of fewer, wealthy farmers and corporations</P>
    <P>&mdash;create a more ecologically-sensitive, sustainable food producing sector;</P>
    <P>and further aware that the present investment policies of financial institutions are unsuitable to the nature of agriculture investment and capital return, at the terms which reflect the long pay back period of farm investment calls on the Government to ensure that long term credit facilities corresponding with the investment requirements of Irish agriculture are made available to farmers, and in particular to</P>
    <P>(a)  statutorily require financial institutions (banks, insurance and hire-purchase companies, investment houses, pension funds), to invest 10 per cent of their new annual investment portfolios in Agricultural Development Bonds;</P>
    <P>(b)  ensure the moneys arising from the purchase of these bonds to be advanced as loans to farmers at fixed long term (e.g. 15 and 20 <Col N="204" /> years), low interest rate terms (e.g. 5 per cent p.a.) for commercial development of their enterprises;</P>
    <P>(c)  ensure the interest accruing to the financial institutions from the bonds to be tax-free.</P>
    <P>That such loans to be made available:</P>
    <P>(1)  to progressive farmers who are</P>
    <P>&mdash;engaging in land development and infrastructural projects which will lead to higher value-added production</P>
    <P>&mdash;switching to import-substitution production in horticultural and tillage sectors</P>
    <P>&mdash;enlarging farm-holdings and dairy quotas to economic levels</P>
    <P>&mdash;converting to organic horticultural or livestock farming or introducing more ecologically-sensitive farm practices</P>
    <P>&mdash;developing alternative enterprises (e.g. agri-tourism alternative livestock and horticulture, farm-house processing, etc.).</P>
    <P>(2)  for the installation of young farmers.</P>
    <P>(3)  to farmers with high debt repayments to be eligible for loans to lower their repayment levels.</P>
    <P>(4)  or to any activity that contributes to the productivity of Irish agriculture;</P>
    <P>that these Agricultural Development Bonds and loans to be supervised by Teagasc and the Agriculture Credit Corporation as part of a long term agricultural develomental plan designed to create jobs in the food production and processing sectors of the economy and to increase the number and incomes of family farmers participating in agriculture on a full-time basis (atógáil).&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last night at the <Col N="205" /> end of the debate, it should be clearly stated that the banks and the financial institutions have a responsibility not only to their shareholders and depositors but also to the community at large and they must be forced, if necessary, to show that social concern.  Agriculture, being our primary Irish wealth producer, must have a favourable long term development capital available to it.  As I said, at present the banks are the only practical source of loan capital for farmers but over the decades they have been reducing their commitment to the agricultural sector &mdash; from 1983 to 1989 they dropped that commitment by one-third.  It has been argued that the banks have been shifting their investment to manufacturing and productive areas but the figures do not bear this out and certainly the Quarterly Bulletin of the Central Bank does not bear it out.  The figures show that in 1983 over 20 per cent of borrowers came from the manufacturing sector but in 1989 this was reduced to 15 per cent, a drop of over 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The biggest growth in bank borrowing comes from the financial sector.  For other lending agencies, such as pension funds and insurance companies, between 1983 and 1989 bank borrowing in this incestuous area increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent, a 100 per cent increase.  This type of investment does not create jobs or wealth in society.  It funds take-overs, speculation and other parasitic activities in the economy.  That demonstrates a lack of social responsibility of the banks and financial institutions. I must conclude that agriculture cannot avail of investment or loan capital from the non-banking financial institutions and banks are withdrawing from the farm sector, except of course for the very rich farmers who can afford the high interest rates and who, I claim, are the subject of the motion before the House. Therefore, all financial institutions should be required to share the cost of reinvesting and modernising the farm sector for the benefit of farmers, consumers, food workers and the rural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party propose that 10 per <Col N="206" /> cent of the new annual investment portfolios of the financial institutions be provided for low interest, long-term capitalisation of agriculture.  The following figures, again from the Quarterly Bulletin of the Central Bank, relate to all licensed banks in Ireland &mdash; I am not referring to governmental or non-residential borrowing; I am talking about non-Governmental residential credit. The amount on lending in August 1988 was £9.847 billion and in August 1989 it was £11.624 billion, an expansion of total credit in that one year of £1,776 million, and 10 per cent of that figure would amount to £177.6 million.  The above figures only include banks; they do not include other financial institutions, for example, pension funds and others.</P>
    <P>This source of funding for the agricultural sector is available on a recurring annual basis and not on a once-off basis. Given the level of credit being made available by the financial institutions &mdash; I have figures only for the licensed banks &mdash; there is certainly no need to go to Germany to borrow money for Irish agriculture. There is plenty of capital at home, as is demonstrated by the reports of the Central Bank.  Under present legislation the Central Bank have power to persuade the commercial and financial sectors to make that portion of their new credit portfolios available for the funding of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, therefore, propose that financial institutions &mdash; banks and so on &mdash; be statutorily required to invest 10 per cent of their new annual investment portfolios in agricultural development bonds which would be supervised by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and Teagasc.  The moneys arising from the purchase of these bonds would be advanced to farmers at fixed long-term, low interest rates for the commercial development of their enterprise.  Farmers with high debt repayments would be eligible for loans from this source to lower their repayment levels.  These proposals will oblige the financial institutions to invest in agricultural development through the purchase of development <Col N="207" /> bonds and provide cheap capital for progressive farmers on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>I believe our approach is a reasoned and practical one to the capitalisation of Irish agriculture, for the creation of a modern, efficient agricultural sector.  Our objective is to maximise the number of family farmers on the land through an effective land use policy; to ensure they have decent incomes and a decent standard of living; to maximise production while protecting the environment and the produce; to create added value in food processing and to create many additional jobs in spin-off industry and agri-tourism, which we know are possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend our amendment to the House.  It is a serious attempt to tackle the many problems facing Irish agriculture and to lay a financial foundation for its recovery and development for the common good.  I regret that.  We must deal only with the specifics in the motion before us and not with the speech made by the Fine Gael spokesperson which seemed to back-off from the terms of the actual motion.  It was a non-specific collection of clichés and Fine Gael attempted to throw in everything, including the kitchen sink, and to blind us to their real proposal which is to give cheap money, guaranteed by the Irish taxpayer, to ranchers and beef barons who do not need it.  I believe their purpose is to alleviate the short term cash flow problems of very rich people.  That is not our problem and I do not believe we have to solve it. They can do that themselves.  The Labour <Col N="208" /> Party will not be supporting the Fine Gael motion which is flawed and badly constructed. It is making unnecessary proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to put any discussion on agricultural conditions at home or in Europe in the context of the international situation as it is.  It is important that we inform ourselves fully of what those realities are and that we do not confine ourselves to reacting to those developments.  We have to play a major and constant role.  By way of general introduction there is no point in proposing the quick fix as if the quick fix were the answer to any particular problem. When I analyse for the House and for the Fine Gael Party in particular they may realise that the motion they have proposed may seem to have a certain attractiveness from the party political point of view but in reality it does not demonstrate either a sense of awareness or responsibility in connection with the present situation. One of the international realities we face is the GATT negotiations.  In those GATT negotiations some participants have sought to focus attention on the agricultural aspects exclusively and in particular on the Community's support arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community for its part has participated fully in the negotiations to date. As provided for under the Treaty of Rome, the Commission acts as the Community's negotiator on the basis of mandates that have been agreed to by the appropriate Council of Ministers.  In so far as agriculture is concerned, the Community's approach is governed by the objectives which were set for the Round and reaffirmed at the mid-term review in April 1989.  On that basis, the Community has indicated, as I outlined on 17 May, that it is willing to participate in negotiations to progressively reduce support to the extent necessary to re-establish balanced markets and a more marked-oriented agricultural trading system.  It is prepared to seek out better ways to manage international markets <Col N="209" /> and to re-define GATT rules and procedures. The Community is also seeking a rebalancing of support and protection for a number of sectors including cereals substitutes and oilseeds in order to remove distortions in trade between products such as cereals which enjoy high levels of protection and support and certain competing products where insufficient protection exists.  Credit is also being sought for reform measures undertaken since 1986.</P>
    <P>The Community is not prepared to accept the approach being advocated by the US and others whereby virtually all support and protection for agriculture would be phased out over a ten year period.  Such an approach would be likely to extend to internal markets the instability in supply and price which is common on world agricultural markets to the detriment of both producers and consumers.  The United States proposal is also unsuited to an agricultural and rural infrastructure such as exists in the EC with its smaller farm size and upward of ten million farmers.  Even there with entirely different structures of farming from the south of Greece to the north of Scotland, all the available evidence shows that the adoption of total elimination of support and protection would involve disproportionately heavy losses for the Irish economy.  All the available evidence shows that the American producers would not be prepared &mdash; whatever their administration might suggest &mdash; to accept a position where there would be total elimination of support within that time scale.  The real negotiating phase in the GATT is now about to commence.</P>
    <P>As President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers I arranged to have the matter placed on the Council's agenda for the April meeting.  In fact, this was the first formal discussion which has ever been undertaken at this level.  In the discussions, Ministers unanimously supported the global approach to the negotiations being pursued by the Commission and in particular the Commission's defence of the basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy including such essential elements as the <Col N="210" /> two-tier price system, Community preference and the role of market policy. The Council also agreed that Agriculture Ministers should regularly consider developments in the GATT negotiations which had not happened until the time I put it on the agenda as President of the Council of Ministers.  I propose to have a further detailed debate on this issue at the June Council and further discussions will be held thereafter as appropriate.  I believe it is essential that the Agriculture Council should play a full role in the Community's input to the GATT negotiations and in promoting the Community's agriculture interests.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy which has underpinned our agriculture sector over the past 17 years is essential to ensure the continued wellbeing of Irish and Community agriculture.  This has been made very clear in the mandate given by the Council to the Commission which was reaffirmed unanimously by the Agriculture Ministers as recently as 25-27 April.  This was the first time that all the Twelve, at any level, of the Council spoke unanimously in support of the negotiating position of the European Community.  I think I can claim some degree of satisfaction for that result.  As I have asserted on numerous occasions, Ireland's principal aims in the negotiations are to ensure that the Community can continue to support farming and rural areas and that farmers incomes are maintained at reasonable levels.  I will continue to take a very active interest in this, given the importance of the agricultural sector to the Irish economy.  In that regard, it is no harm to point out that agricultural accounts for 9 per cent of our GDP and 25 per cent of exports.  In fact, when the low level of import content and profit repatriation in the agriculture-based industries is taken into account, together with transfer payments from the FEOGA Guarantee Fund, it is estimated that exports of agricutural and food products amount to over 40 per cent of net export receipts.  That is huge by comparison with any other country in Europe and demonstrates the significance of the Irish agri-food sector to the economy <Col N="211" /> generally and not just for farmers. Employment in the agriculture, food and drinks industries is almost 19 per cent of total employment and is way above anything that exists elsewhere with the possible exception of New Zealand.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of the present state of the beef market must take account of the operation of the European Community regime related to beef.  There have been significant changes in this in recent years. We have just completed a year in which we saw the most radical changes in the Community's market support measures. There have been major changes in the intervention system and in the various producer premiums.  There were certain aspects of the revised regime which were not acceptable and that is why I voted against the package at the Council of Ministers in January 1989.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that there were aspects of the revised regime which were not acceptable to us it is important to remember that we did succeed in getting a number of concessions in the course of the negotiations: the over-all limit for intervention was increased to 220,000 tonnes compared to 200,000 tonnes originally proposed by the Commission; a safety-net clause was introduced to provide for unlimited intervention if prices fell below certain levels; and the Council gave special recognition to the special position of the beef industry to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The special recognition of the relative importance of our beef industry has been of particular benefit to us in our dealings with the EC Commission since the adoption of the revised beef regime.  In March of 1989 we got special intervention measures adopted to deal with problems that arose at the time.  In the autumn of 1989 we got agreement to an aids to private storage scheme which was of crucial importance to our industry during the peak production period.  Under the new regime of intervention on the basis of tenders we have vigorously pursued the case of Irish producers and it is significant to note that during the first year of the tendering system intervention in Ireland <Col N="212" /> accounted for 47 per cent of the Community total compared to an average of about 20 per cent in earlier years.  That demonstrates in a very practical way the effective outcome of our negotiations on a range of issues.</P>

      <P>I am always anxious to ensure that our prices are at the maximum level possible.  However, I am equally anxious to avoid a situation that the pessimism of certain parties does not in itself have the effect of depressing prices.  I would like to point out that 1990 prices are, with the exception of the very high prices in 1988 and spring 1989, higher than in any year since 1984.  In this respect there can be no doubt that the acceptance by the Commission of the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy which formed part of the Council agreement in January 1989 allowed us to place significant quantities into intervention during the last 12 months at prices which enabled us to support the market both during the critical autumn months and in the early months of 1990.</P>
      <P>Let me mention in passing that I have just returned from Brussels via Belfast where I attended the Balmoral Show.  It is very significant for anyone who wants to listen objectively to what is being said, that the Northern farmers are saying at last they are happy that they are being given the same facility &mdash; or close to it &mdash; in intervention as has been uniquely achieved for the Southern farmers.  That is a matter of fact, and when we have got that through in this year's price negotiations, they regard that as a major breakthrough and achievement.  So much for those who try to dismiss what we have done as of no consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the most recent meeting of the Council of Ministers agreement was reached on a suggestion from me as President that the delay in payment for beef taken into intervention should be reduced from 120 to 45 days.  This decision should be of significant benefit <Col N="213" /> to our producers.  It is yet another example of a practical step taken at the instigation of the Irish negotiators which will have a positive impact for our producers. Another welcome decision of the recent Council Agreement was the extension of the suckler cow scheme to small dairy producers.</P>
    <P>I realise that our industry could improve its performance.  One only has to look back as far as 1988 to find a time when we were doing better, but that was a year when some Third Country markets were very buoyant and our industry was to reap the benefits.  Some of these markets have now encountered their own difficulties which means that our exporters have not been able to gain the same access or have had to accept lower prices.  We hope some of these markets will open up for us again.  In this context I should mention that other markets, mainly in the Far East, are beginning to open up and at the Council of Ministers recently I got agreement to a suggestion of mine that the EC Commission should explore the marketing possibilities in these countries.  I am well aware of the problems facing our industry such as seasonality of production and the need to expand further the value-added sector of our industry, but I do not see the solutions as being purely in the short term.  I have, therefore, set up a group to identify the industry's problems and to suggest appropriate solutions.  This group, which comprise representatives from my Department together with all the farming organisations, meat factories, IDA, CBF and UCD will examine the problems and come up with agreed recommendations, covering both national and EC policies. I am hopeful that their report will be available sometime later this summer and I can assure the House that I will give very careful consideration to their proposals.</P>
    <P>In relation to cereals, I note that many committed growers continue to have confidence in the future.  One way in which this is shown is in the 40 per cent increase in plantings of winter wheat last autumn. More recently there has been general acknowledgement by all member states <Col N="214" /> that the 1990-91 Presidency prices package represents a good deal for cereal growers and a very considerable improvement on the original Commission proposals, whether everyone wishes to acknowledge that or not.  This is particularly so when a comparison is made with last year's package which embodied a series of price cuts.  Following the recent price negotiations, the effective support prices for next year will be higher than this year's support price.  In fact, the real intervention buying-in price of May 1991 will be some 2 per cent higher than May 1990 given the reduction in the payments delay.  Facing into the new harvest, therefore, we have a good floor price for cereals.</P>
    <P>Grower's income in 1989 was higher than expected due to the very good price paid by merchants and co-operatives and the dropping of the additional co-responsibility levy amount due.  Also, the new arrangements for payment of the additional co-responsibility levy will help on-farm cash flow since just 1.5 per cent additional levy, rather than 3 per cent as formerly, will be deducted from the grain cheque.  The total levy deduction will therefore be 4.5 per cent or £6.63 per tonne rather than the 6 per cent originally proposed.  In consequence, both farmers and the trade know now the full scope of deductions, facilitating a realistic determination of market price.  There will, of course, be no refund mechanism and any greater or lesser amount of additional levy due following the 1990 harvest will be taken account of in the next marketing year.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that Irish cereal prices this past few years have been towards the top of the table in the league of European Community prices.  Indeed, Irish grain has been in recent times trading largely above intervention and, in effect, the situation is largely a market-led one which I welcome.  Irish malting barley has built up a reputation with the highly selective European maltsters arising from its uniqueness as a spring grown quality product which confers certain brewing advantages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> Of late, the concept of supply management has been advanced by our main farming organisation, envisaging that Community grain production would be controlled through the allocation of a specific acreage per grower related to a reference period.  The grower would have to compulsorily set aside the balance of arable land on the farm.</P>
    <P>In principle this can be supported as ideally, it should result in moving towards market balance between supply and consumption. I have always supported supply management as the most effective way of dealing with the problems of the cereals market.  However, I should tell the House that it is, of course, the Commission who have the initiative and responsibility to introduce proposals in this area, and as yet there is no point in my creating the impression that the Commission is prepared to do that. Before the Council can adopt a procedure, it must be proposed by the Commission. Obviously the matter is one on which we will continue to exert pressure and to negotiate.  The prices decision recognises to some extent the need for more action in this regard.  As well as undertaking to promote non-food use, effective and balance set-aside and incorporation in animal feed, the Council has asked the Commission to evaluate the implementation of the European Council's stabiliser decision of February 1988 and to make appropriate proposals in time for implementation in the 1992-93 marketing year.  This is as much as can be achieved on this front at this stage.</P>
    <P>That last statement was included in my speech before I left for the Council meeting this week, and I am glad to say that at that Council meeting we have made very significant progress towards introducing the other elements of the European Council procedure such as the demonstration project for non-food use of cereals and the extension of non-food use to the set-aside proposal.  All this should help to relieve the surplus pressure which brought about the European Council decision in May 1988.  I may be impatient of it, the Opposition may be <Col N="216" /> impatient of it, farmers may be impatient with it, but there is no point in any of us pretending the European Council did not take that decision and that it is not now part of European law.  We hope we will be able to get it reviewed in time.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless it is evident that as a consequence of the stabilisers, a number of growers are experiencing income difficulty at present.  The situation of more vulnerable arable farmers was addressed in the rural world measures which formed part of the prices proposals.  For the next two marketing years, Irish small cereals producers will, subject to certain criteria, continue to receive a full refund of both basic and additional co-responsibility levies.</P>
    <P>The consolidation and expansion of quality malting barley exports to Europe, together with Third Country malt exports, will be the major challenge for the early nineties.  It will be necessary to foster linkages throughout the industry to enable the capitalisation on Ireland's clean green image both with regard to mainline cereals production and niche markets for organic cereals.  In this fashion Ireland's reputation as a producer of quality food, whether as raw material or finished product, will be enhanced and progressed profitably.  Also, the producer group concept, with its connotation of quality product for the market will continue to be actively promoted, a matter in which the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, has been diligently involved.  We will seek major progress in that concept over the years.</P>
    <P>In an increasingly quality conscious Europe, our green image with comparatively restricted use of insecticides and little or no nitrate groundwater problem will stand us in good stead.  However, other member states are rapidly taking action to counteract environmental damage, so Ireland will need to move quickly to capitalise on its image.  How best this can be done will form part of the framework of my Department's actions for 1990 and onwards, and will receive attention in the regular liaison meetings held with farming organisations and the trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> Recently I announced that the Government's review of the disadvantaged areas scheme has resulted in a decision to lodge a detailed application with the EC Commission seeking agreement to: extend the present disadvantaged areas by adding new areas to the list of less severely handicapped areas and by designating certain coastal areas as areas suffering from specific handicaps, an extension of about two million acres; reclassify as less severely handicapped those areas now designated mountain sheep grazing areas; reclassify as more severely handicapped certain areas, 1.3 million acres, now designated as less severely handicapped; and restructure the scheme to provide for an increase in headage rates and for greater modulation of payments to reflect differing degrees of handicap.</P>
    <P>In the hopeful expectation that the Commission and the Council of Ministers will accept this, I can tell the House that about 72.5 per cent of the total acreage of the country will be designated as disadvantaged and, in addition, at least that percentage of the total disadvantaged areas will be designated as severely disadvantaged. I leave it to the public at large and make a judgment as to whether that is a significant breakthrough.  I do not expect a kind judgment from Deputy Connaughton.  He is so predictable.</P>

      <P>The first item requires a Commission proposal to the Council of Ministers and agreement by a qualified majority in the Council.  The other proposals require approval from the Commission itself.  Expenditure on the new proposals, together with the existing expenditure under the disadvantaged areas scheme, will attract 65 per cent Community recoupment.  That, too, is a major breakthrough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timing of the implementation of these proposals will depend on the completion of the EC procedures for approval of the proposals and the availability of FEOGA funds which will be increasing <Col N="218" /> gradually in line with the EC commitment to double the structural resources over the period to 1993.  It is expected, however, that the implementation will commence in 1991.  When fully implemented the new proposals, together with the abolition this year of the off-farm income restriction, will increase headage payments from £60 million to £100 million a year.  In addition, the newly designated areas will benefit from increased investment aids, exemption from the milk co-responsibility levy and the special supplement to the ewe premium.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Review was by far the most comprehensive and extensive of all boundary reviews to date and was undertaken in response to almost 1,000 submissions made to the Department by public representatives, county councils, farming organisations, local interest groups and individuals and Deputies of all parties.  The field work for the survey which commenced as recently as 29 January 1989, covered an area of 6.68 million acres and a total of 1,636 district electoral divisions and over 20,700 townlands in 22 counties.  Almost 49,000 holdings, or 57 per cent of the total submitted, were visited by the Department's agricultural officers and surveyed in detail.</P>

      <P>The proposals to extend-reclassify over 3.55 million acres and increase the overall size of the disadvantaged areas by 19.2 per cent, the largest such increase to date, would benefit some 29,000 farmers and represented a very satisfactory outcome to the Fourth Review.  The decision to endorse these proposals and also to increase and modulate headage payments was in keeping with the Government's aim as set out in the Programme for Government in September 1989 &ldquo;to increase and reorientate headage grants and to negotiate with the EC on a maximum extension of the disadvantaged areas&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am very satisfied at the successful outcome of the 1990-91 farm prices negotiations and to have achieved such a good result for farmers at a time when difficulties existed in a number of sectors Community-wide.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached by Ministers following lengthy discussions both at bilateral and plenary levels over two days and nights and on the basis of an improved compromise paper which I tabled.  The revised compromise address in particular the demands of Ministers in the cereals, rural world, milk and agrimonetary areas and it had the overwhelming support of Ministers with no member state voting against.  The revised package represented a significant improvement in support for farmers' incomes throughout the Community and I am pleased that the value of the prices agreement for Irish farmers would approach £90 million in a full year.  This figure represents an increase of over £50 million compared to the original Commission proposal.  Deputy Connaughton will not want to acknowledge that either. If his time ever comes, he can try to do better in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> The principal benefits for Ireland in the new prices package will result from the green currency adjustment and the substantial reductions in the intervention payment delays in the milk, beef and cereals sectors.  Changes in Ireland's green currency will lead to a price increase of 25 per cent in all sectors, with the exception of beef where this increase has already been obtained.  The intervention payment period will be reduced in some areas by as much as 80 days and this should have a very considerable impact on maintaining prices at reasonable levels.</P>
    <P>I would stress the benefit of the rural world measures for a country such as Ireland with its preponderance of smaller family farms.  Measures such as the milk quota buy-up, the extension of the suckler premium to small dairy farms and the special ewe premium would be especially beneficial and I am happy to note the intention of Commissioner MacSharry to come forward with a range of proposals in the months ahead aimed at the further development of the rural world.</P>
    <P>Increase in monthly increments for cereals and sugar will be a further help to Irish farmers.  I have certain assurances from the Commission in relation to the operation of the sheepmeat stabiliser and I expect this to result in the payment of a higher ewe premium this year than might otherwise have been the case.</P>

      <P>The early conclusion of the prices negotiations this year will contribute to greater farmer confidence at this time.  I am encouraged by the level of support given to the prices packaged by my fellow Ministers and representatives of the farming organisations here and the level of consensus achieved augured well for the Community in its approach to the final phase of the GATT negotiations which is now beginning.  The only dissenting voice was, predictably, that of Deputy Connaughton, but it was not heard too loudly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council had devoted significant <Col N="221" /> attention to the GATT negotiations. Ministers had expressed satisfaction that the basic principles of the CAP were being strongly defended by the Commission in the GATT negotiations and they clearly indicated that these principles were not negotiable.  It is my intention to provide for further regular debate on GATT in the Agriculture Council during the remainder of this Presidency.</P>
    <P>The success of agriculture is best assured by fostering a stable economic environment in which enterprises can grow and maintain competitiveness rather than by piecemeal intervention which at best can merely prop up a particular sector in the short term.  The Government have directed much of their policy to achieve this aim and the result has been very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Interest rates also increased in the past year, by 4 percentage points between April 1989 and year end.  Again, the increase in rates was related both to external and domestic factors.  There has been a general rise in European interest rates in order to counter inflationary pressures.  The gap between Irish and UK rates, which opened up in 1988, remained at 4-5 per cent during 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The current satisfactory performance of the economy can only be maintained if improvement in the public finances are sustained and built upon.  The current budget deficit in 1989 is estimated at £263 million, while the Exchequer borrowing requirement &mdash; EBR &mdash; is estimated at £479 million, or 1.8 per cent of GNP, in percentage terms, the lowest EBR for many years.  Proposals such as are being suggested, which would increase Government borrowing, could not be undertaken without upsetting the Government's borrowing targets &mdash; Deputy Stagg is quite right in that there is no point in making &ldquo;top of the head&rdquo; suggestions and then calling for economic control &mdash; this would be considered in grave circumstances only and where clear-cut benefits were guaranteed. Previous experience with an <Col N="222" /> exchange rate guarantee scheme suggests that benefits are far from guaranteed and cannot easily be targeted on those most in need of financial assistance.  That has been the experience.  There is the further difficulty that such a scheme might be regarded as a State aid to the beef industry and as such would be in contravention of EC legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not in favour of a subsidised foreign currency borrowing programme, for a number of reasons.  The exchange rate guarantee scheme which was introduced in the early 1980s proved very costly to the Exchequer and the taxpayer.  A subsequent analysis of this scheme has shown that a sum equivalent to almost a quarter of the original drawdown amount was incurred as costs.  Furthermore, these very high costs do not seem to have been justified by benefits from the scheme. The same analysis indicates that the level of investment cannot be manipulated by improving the interest rate alone; only a very limited number of projects could be made viable by such interest subsidies and State subsidised credit was merely being substituted for normal private credit.</P>

There is also a generous scheme of grants available under the farm improvement programme to assist in the construction and improvement of farm buildings and facilities.</P>

      <P>The crisis in Irish agriculture to which the Fine Gael motion refers is not new.  Irish agriculture has been in a crisis of one sort or another for many decades.  The policies of successive Governments have been incompetent and inept and Irish agriculture has never been allowed to realise its full potential and create wealth for those living on the land and jobs for those in downstream industries.</P>
      <P>In 1971 there were 262,000 people on the land but by 1986 this figure had more than halved to 120,000.  Between 1981 and 1986 about 60,000 jobs were lost from farms of all sizes.  Farming lost more jobs than any other industry between 1981-86 about 60,000, or 12,000 per year. Manufacturing industry lost 6,000 jobs a year over the same period but there are twice as many people in the manufacturing industry workforce as there are in farming.  For every job lost in manufacturing industry four were lost in farming.</P>
      <P>I have referred on many occasions to the stark contrast between agriculture in Ireland and Holland.  Holland is little more than half the size of Ireland yet only 120,000 people are employed on the land in Ireland compared to 309,000 in Holland. This has been achieved by the Dutch with an average farm size of just 25 acres.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that the motion before us has to be considered. No one doubts that many farmers are facing difficulties but I am not convinced that the solution proposed in the Fine Gael motion is the correct one.  Having listened continually for more than ten years, to Fine Gael talking about our national debt and the extent of our foreign borrowing and justifying cutbacks in essential services such as health, education and social welfare in order to reduce the level of borrowing, it is ironic to now hear them advocating a new area of foreign borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion seems to ignore the need for a long-term development plan or strategy for Irish agriculture.  The motion correctly notes that many farmers are currently facing serious difficulties <Col N="225" /> but it fails to acknowledge that many farmers had one of their best years ever last year.  Agriculture will always be subject to some extent to cycles and income has to be averaged out over a number of years to give a meaningful picture.</P>
    <P>The motion also fails to acknowledge that not all farmers have the same problems and that aid for agriculture has to be targeted towards those farmers who most need it and who will benefit most from it.  The Fine Gael motion and particularly the section relating to the low interest rate loans for beef production would be of most benefit to the largest and most profitable producers.</P>
    <P>While we would not necessarily endorse some parts of the Labour Party amendment the general thrust of it does acknowledge the need for longer-term structural changes in Irish agriculture. Therefore, we will be supporting the amendment.</P>
    <P>One recent development of particular interest was the establishment of the new farming organisation, the United Farmers Association.  The establishment of the new body clearly reflects the level of dissatisfaction among the farming community with the existing farm bodies. We welcome the establishment of the new body and wish it well.  I am sure that there will be policy areas on which we will disagree but I hope that the new body will have as a priority the establishment of good relations and co-operation between farmers and non-farmers.  I hope they will recognise that every citizen has an interest in seeing more effective and efficient use made of our land.</P>
    <P>One of the demands of the new organisation is for the introduction of a two-tier pricing system for agricultural produce. This is a reasonable demand, especially as so much taxpayers money both at national and EC level, is being spent on price support.  It has been estimated that as much as 80 per cent of all price support spent on farming goes to the top 20 per cent income bracket.  This is clearly not justifiable and the introduction of a two-tier pricing system would ensure that public money would go to those who need it most.  A long time ago somebody in my <Col N="226" /> county said that it is the producer and not the product that should be subsidised.  If that had been done we might have a different situation in agriculture today.</P>
    <P>The dairy sector has been crucial to Irish agriculture and will continue to be of major importance.  The value of our dairy exports amounted to almost one quarter of our total food exports in 1988, the last full year for which figures are available.  The total value of food exports in that year amounted to roughly one quarter of the value of total exports &mdash; £2,899 million out of a total of £12,300 million.</P>
    <P>Ireland's share of total EC milk output is only 5.4 per cent of total output and our economy is more dependent on milk than any other EC member country. Ireland is naturally suited to dairying. We have a mild climate and soil that is capable of growing good grass over a long season and the sun does not burn it up in the summer months.  More than 80 per cent of usable agricultural land is under meadow and pasture.  More than 70 per cent of all dairy products manufactured here are exported.</P>
    <P>Ireland's special reliance on milk means that we should receive treatment from the EC and take that fact of life into consideration.  Special consideration should be given to two areas.  We should be allowed a higher milk quota and get financial assistance to help us with the problem of winter feeding.  Winter feed would even out the erratic nature of milk and beef supplies to factories and make possible the winning of markets for a much wider variety of food products.</P>
    <P>The compensation is unlikely to be paid by processors because in the one area where at present a steady 12 months supply is guaranteed, in the domestic liquid-milk market, the price per gallon paid to farmers is being cut, or atempts are being made to cut it.  The milk quota system has been eased a little by Brussels allowing an additional 32 million gallons to be added to the Irish quota.  Out of the extra 32 million gallons, 11 million gallons has been allocated to small farmers and producers with a quota of less than 12,800.  Farmers have already <Col N="227" /> applied for the extra quota.  It is believed that individual applicants will get between 400-500 gallons and that this can be backdated to April 1989.  The penalty for overproduction is severe, £1.10 per gallon.  The penalty for 1990, this market year, will be increased to £1.27 per gallon.</P>
    <P>The IFA claim that their policy in relation to milk quotas is to allow small farmers first bid for any milk quotas that come on the market, but it requires money to avail of this offer.  This may be difficult to raise, especially as interest rates are again on the up and up.  Only one-third of the additional milk quotas recently allocated by Brussels went to small farmers.  It is because of the importance of the inclusion of disadvantaged areas to the people who depend on the extra grants that will come from the EC that I appeal to the Minister to proceed with all haste to have approval granted.</P>
    <P>In the public mind, farming means the EC, the Common Agricultural Policy and milk quotas.  Farming, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade &mdash; GATT &mdash; is a new development to many people.  When the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade come into being in 1948, it was intended to provide a set of rules to bring some order into the marketplace.  All the member countries of the EC and others &mdash; in all 96 governments &mdash; are parties to this agreement. This accounts for 90 per cent of world trade.  GATT's professed aim is to liberalise world trade.  The depression of the thirties, a time when home markets were protected by high tariff barriers, still haunts many countries and many economists. Ireland followed the thirties' economic policies into the sixties.</P>
    <P>GATT rounds of talks were at first, from 1948, directed towards liberalising industrial trade but in 1986 it was decided to include agriculture.  This was agreed at a conference of trade Ministers who met in Uruguay in September 1986.  They laid down an agreed plan, an agreed target, to reach agreement on agriculture by the end of 1990.  The total period of this negotiation is known as the Uruguay round.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Ministers taking part in the Uruguay round see CAP as the obstacle to liberalising agricultural trade and as a matter of unfair competition.  Many countries, other than those in the EC, have special measures by which their agriculture is aided.  All these matters are now on the table and there is general agreement that they must be resolved by the end of 1990.  Irish farmers would lose heavily if agricultural trade was fully liberalised.</P>
    <P>The fact is that GATT controls 90 per cent of world trade and 96 countries are known as its contracting parties.  With a further 28 countries applying its rules the talks must be taken extremely seriously. The basis of GATT &mdash; a principle now to be applied to agriculture &mdash; is best expressed in these words, &ldquo;no country participating in GATT is to give special trading advantages to another or to discriminate against it; all are on an equal basis and all share the benefits of any moves towards lower trade barriers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>GATT's ultimate objective is expressed in the above statement but, for the present, they do allow some exceptions, regional trading arrangements, and developing countries.  Even where exceptions are admitted the special measures allowed are of a strictly limited character.</P>
    <P>Where protection is allowed to domestic industry it must be in the form of a customs tariff and not through other measures, for example, import quotas. This measure must be agreed and is then binding on members of GATT.  Countries can also seek a derogation from particular GATT obligations and emergency action if, for example, imports are putting domestic industry out of action on an alarming scale.</P>
    <P>GATT allows us to enter into agreements that are closer than the general rules which govern relations between the GATT contracting parties.</P>
    <P>GATT has had, so far, much less impact on agriculture than in other areas. Agricultural protection, although customs barriers have been reduced, has actually increased in other forms during the 40 years of GATT's existence.  GATT <Col N="229" /> was in being before the EC was established but the EC was allowed to protect its market against low-priced imports of such products as cereals, beef and dairy produce.  The protection took the form of a variable levy system.  The EC in exchange for being allowed to protect its market in relation to cereals, beef and dairy produce agreed to bind itself to low or zero import duties on products like vegetable oils, proteins and cereal substitutes.</P>
    <P>When this agreement was made, the imports of the products just named was of fairly limited volume, but the volume has greatly increased in recent years as oil industry spin-off products, such as gluten, come in as cereal substitutes or for cheap feed, replaces cereals.  This problem needs to be discussed in the present GATT negotiations because of the serious problems faced by cereal producers. Cheap feed leads to cheap livestock production and has led to a beef mountain.</P>
    <P>Few, if any, farmers can see any virtue in a return to the pre-quota system of unrestricted production of milk and the accumulation of its manufactured products in storage.  Storage costs money.  The main difference between the EC and other GATT countries is in relation to subsidies.  The USA, and a group of food exporting countries outside the EC, called the Cairns group, and the EC countries are in disagreement on supports for agriculture.  The USA proposes that all, or almost all, subsidies and supports for agriculture be phased out or drastically reduced in the next ten years.  All levies and quotas, the existing supports, should be translated into a tariff equivalent and, they say, this could then be negotiated downwards or eliminated over a period.  Export subsidies, they propose, should be phased out over the next five years.</P>
    <P>A number of decisions were taken in 1989.  The Brussels Summit in 1988 laid down the financial guidelines within which the market and the price side of CAP affecting the rural and agricultural world would, in future, operate.  This applied to the FEOGA guarantee fund <Col N="230" /> up to the year 1992.  It laid down production limits for major farm products.</P>
    <P>The number of dairy cows always greatly exceeded the number of beef cows and the numbers in the dairy herd, until recent years, have remained fairly steady.  The beef cow herd numbers have experienced much more movement.  In the years just before entry to the EC &mdash; when entry was clearly on the cards &mdash; the beef cow herd grew by 16.3 per cent in 1971, 8.9 per cent in 1972, 32.9 per cent in 1973 and 12.4 per cent in 1974. Between 1974 and 1984 the number of cows in the beef herd declined steadily.  In 1974 beef cow numbers totalled 732,000. The number fell to 421,000 in 1983, the lowest total since 1970, at 387,000 head. Since 1983 numbers have fluctuated but mostly in an upward direction.  In 1989 the total had increased to 562,000 head.</P>
    <P>The beef industry export about 80 per cent of what they produce and our income from beef exports in 1988 was £716,874,000 million.  The importance of the beef industry to farming is shown in one survey which said that 48 per cent of all farms are engaged in some way in dry stock production.</P>
    <P>The picture of the beef industry last year is rather mixed.  Net disposals of cattle and calves were estimated to be about 1.5 million head in 1989 a decrease of 10.5 per cent on 1988 and exports of live cattle fell by 20 per cent in 1989.  At 170,000 head this was just over half the average level of live exports in 1985-1986. It is the lowest level of live exports since we joined the EC.</P>
    <P>The slaughtering of cattle at meat export premises &mdash; for the second consecutive year &mdash; was 8 per cent lower than the previous year.  The 1989 export slaughterings were estimated at 1.2 million head, 103,000 head fewer than in 1988.  Slaughtering for the domestic market was 4 per cent lower than in 1988.</P>
    <P>In 1989, 8,000 fat and breeding cattle were imported.  The output of cattle and calves is estimated at 1,784 million head. This amounts to a 2 per cent increase on the 1988 figure of 1,749 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Since the foundation of the State, agricultural policy has been preoccupied with maximising the incomes received by farmers.  This is understandable but it also reflects a tendency to see agriculture as an industry in its own right, rather than simply the first stage of an integrated sequence combined with processing and marketing.</P>
    <P>Seen in this way, the primary objective of Government policy should be to establish the productive practices among farmers, which are most conducive to effective processing and marketing.  For example, the Irish dairy industry currently is characterised by a massive glut of milk during the summer months.  It requires a high level of processing capacity to handle this glut, with the result that much of the plant lies idle for the rest of the year.  This imposes heavy costs on the processing sector.  Lack of continuity of supply during the year also means that the processing sector cannot diversify into other consumer products with short shelf life, such as soft cheeses. Similarly, Irish farmers seem unable to grasp the importance of properly graded and presented produce, which is essential if reliable and dependable long term market outlets are to be secured.</P>
    <P>What is required is an integrated and comprehensive development plan for agricultural production, processing and marketing whose central objective would be to maximise the overall contribution of the sector to the economy in terms of income generated and employment created.</P>
    <P>The immediate aim should be a policy designed to maximise usable output from our national land resource, in order to provide the materials for an expanded processing sector.  In the case of small farms, this requires a programme of consolidation of holdings, in order to create new farm units capable of providing a family with a reasonable standard of living by working these units alone.  It should be noted that research has shown that medium sized units of this kind tend to be the most efficient farms in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> What we believe is needed is the establishment of a farm and food development authority to formulate and implement a comprehensive and integrated development plan covering agricultural production, marketing and processing.  The authority would achieve this by including all relevant organisations, agencies and groups within their planning ambit.  They should be a statutory agency on the lines of the IDA, located outside the Central Civil Service structure.</P>
    <P>To summarise, The Workers' Party believe that: (1) the primary function of the agricultural sector should be to provide food of adequate quality in sufficient and regular supply to consumers, and at reasonable costs; (2) agricultural producers should receive a reasonable income from their produce; (3) agriculture should make the maximum possible contribution to the national economy in the form of optimum productivity at farm level applied to well developed linkages with the rest of the economy, involving both support industries and services and downstream processing and marketing.  The present situation in agriculture leaves much to be desired in these areas; (4) agricultural production and processing should be conducted in such a way as to minimise damage to the natural environment; (5) in the interest of maximum efficiency, agricultural producers should be adequately trained, and should have at their disposal adequate resources &mdash; including land resources &mdash; to allow them to generate an adequate income from farming alone; (6) an effective land use policy &mdash; allied to effective employment and welfare policies outside agriculture &mdash; is required in order to encourage those with insufficient land resources to make their land available &mdash; through sale or leasing &mdash; to others who can make better use of it; and (7) it is desirable that farmers should control to the maximum extent possible the downstream processing marketing of their produce, both in their own interest and in order to secure Irish control of this sector of vital national importance.  State policy in <Col N="233" /> relation to agriculture should vigorously promote this objective.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party favour a fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which &mdash; as it has worked in the past &mdash; has fostered the production of wasteful food surpluses while artificially raising food prices to unnecessarily high levels, has distorted world food prices with negative consequences for producers in developing countries and has been inequitable in its distributional effects by giving the greatest rewards to the biggest producers.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party favour a major transfer of funding from the CAP to the EC Structural Funds as offering a more equitable and beneficial &mdash; in terms of its long term development potential &mdash; method of securing funding for Ireland from the EC.  As the proportion of CAP funding going to Mediterranean products is likely to rise in future years, and as Ireland obtains a higher proportion of structural rather than CAP funding, such a transfer is likely to work to Ireland's overall advantage.  As major cutbacks in CAP funding are inevitable in any case, The Workers' Party favour seeking an early and orderly agreement on how this transfer should be effected.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are confident that, given Ireland's natural advantages in key agricultural areas, an efficient Irish farming sector can prosper in the less interventionist market environment which is likely to prevail in the EC in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party favour the establishment of an agricultural development authority, an ADA, akin to the IDA, to oversee the formulation and implementation of a vigorous and comprehensive agricultural policy in Ireland.  This authority would offer grants and other incentives in return for achievement of agreed performance targets and would be free from day to day political interference. Their major functions would be to formulate a national land use plan &mdash; including utilisation of peatlands, afforestation and amenity areas &mdash; with appropriate production targets at national and local level; to formulate and implement an <Col N="234" /> effective land policy; to integrate research and practice and to promote effective integration of production, processing and marketing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion this evening.  As usual, I am confident that the Minister will protect our interests in the course of the GATT negotiations which will comprise the most important event in agriculture in 1990.</P>
      <P>The phasing out of all support and-or protection for agriculture would be highly undesirable for our farmers.  We, being a peripheral part of the Community, need this protection.  Our production is derived from natural grass and, because of our location, transport militates against us in competition in the marketplace.  The US proposal is not at all suited to a rural based agriculture, comprised of small farms, such as ours.  Indeed the removal of subsidies, along with the support and protection we have enjoyed, would involve our farmers in heavy losses.  The Common Agricultural Policy has stabilised the whole of the agricultural base. Therefore, we want the Minister to ensure a continuation of that policy, which I am sure he will achieve.</P>
      <P>Failure to act with regard to cereal substitutes over many years has led to many problems.  Before the conclusion of the GATT negotiations in December next we will be afforded an opportunity to tackle this issue.  Cereal substitutes have been dumped continuously on the EC, subsidised to the extent of over £50 a tonne by the United States Government, because they want to get rid of their surplus on to the EC.  For that reason it is important that the protection within our farming structure is maintained.  I might add that the importation of cheap cereal substitutes to the EC is eroding our livestock competitive advantage, firmly based here on an abundant supply of grass, and as a result, our beef and store cattle production suffer considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious problem confronting <Col N="235" /> our agriculture at present is the outbreak of BSE in Britain and, to a much lesser extent, here.  We must tackle the marketing of our beef head on.  At present most, if not all, our beef exported to Britain and Scotland is rebranded and sold as Scottish or English beef.  If, at a time when we are endeavouring to overcome the BSE threat, we had our own identity or emblem, I would recommend a label such as &ldquo;Irish beef derived from green grass&rdquo;.  Soon we will be able to boast of beef produced from an agricultural base and a totally free from disease herd.  For many years we have exported our best beef to Britain which has been rebranded there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for allowing me five minutes of his time to make some pertinent points on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attitude and performance in the House this evening could be compared with variations in the weather. Throughout his contribution he sought to claim credit for anything that happened as a result of the good weather &mdash; probably due to a high pressure belt over Tipperary which has fogged his brain over a period of time in regard to many aspects of agriculture.  In addition perhaps the bad weather coincided with low <Col N="236" /> pressure emanating from the Eurocrats of Brussels.  I can only conclude that he is a fair weather Minister.</P>
    <P>In reality there is an income crisis looming for our farmers in 1990.  Various contributory factors were evident in the latter part of 1989.  The Minister chose to ignore the danger signals for beef and cereal by bluffing his way through the problems then becoming evident.</P>
    <P>If one takes a cursory glance at the management data in respect of farm planning issued by Teagasc &mdash; the agricultural and food development authority under the aegis of the Minister's Department &mdash; one will see various examples of how relevant is this motion.  For example, a farmer operating a two year calf-to-beef system would need to be able to sell cattle over 600 kilo weight after two years in order to make a small profit of, say, £18 per head.  This performance, in terms of an excellent farmer, is demanded of such farmers at present operating that system, who I might add have not the blessing of the use of hormones they had heretofore. Let us take another example, that of a farmer totally dependent on cereal production. That farmer would need to produce at least two tonnes of spring barley per acre to break even.  In fact, a committed cereal farmer would need 200 acres of production at present to merely meet his basic family obligations and/or responsibilities.  That is a far cry from the rosy picture with which the Minister tried to hood-wink this House this evening. These data constitute some of the stark realities of Irish agriculture today, outlined by Teagasc under the control of the Minister.  Those statistics are a clear indictment of how unrealistic is the Minister in asserting that there is no farm income crisis in agriculture today.  That argument could be extended further to all the major enterprises in agriculture. Since the fanfare of publicity on the tremendous outcome of the Minister's agricultural prices negotiations in 1990 milk prices to producers have been reduced by up to 14p per gallon.  In addition, lamb prices are so ridiculously low farmers would contemplate giving them away in order to get rid of them <Col N="237" /> because they are eating so much.  More and more farmers are forced to put their pride in their pockets and seek the assistance of the Department of Social Welfare in order to weather this latest income storm.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, in tabling this motion, are advancing realistic proposals, based on precedent, which worked to farmers' advantage in the past in terms of low-interest loans for beef and cereal farmers in particular.  They do not constitute junk bonds, as Deputy Stagg maintained, or something akin to the land bonds of heretofore. Rather they are realistic proposals of how beef and cereal farmers &mdash; which in fact store farmers would like to see implemented also in order to give them a boost in their cattle prices obtained at marts today &mdash; might improve their position.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the recent contributions here of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition have little or no sympathy for or understanding of the problems facing farmers today.  To find out the actual rather than the perceived position in farming all the Minister need do is ask the farmers within his own constituency.</P>

      <P>I thank all those Deputies who have contributed to this debate both tonight and last night.  While I was very disappointed by some of the reaction, this is an opportune time to discuss such a notion on the Floor of Dáil Éireann.  It is raised at a time when the crisis in agriculture is beginning to bite. It is very important that the Minister, the Minister of State and Back Bench Deputies on the Government side give us their views on what the future is likely to hold for farmers.  The first thing we need to do is acknowledge that there is a crisis. The Government will win the vote but it is incumbent on the main Opposition party to raise this matter on the Floor of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Everything which has been said on the Government side of the House either last night or tonight clearly indicates that they genuinely believe there is no crisis in farming.  If that is the case, God help us in the GATT negotiations.  I ask the Government once again to allow rural Deputies of all parties, as Deputy O'Toole has suggested, discuss this matter in Government time in the not to distant future.  Why should we agree to a system under which the agreement reached in negotiations with the Americans and others is only allowed to be discused in this House when nothing can be done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The most sensible thing to do would be to allow each Deputy during the next few weeks say what he or she thinks.  I hope this will happen.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, have tried to explain this matter away by saying things could be worse.  Last week the Minister for Agriculture and Food said that the cattle trade is not that good but at least it is better than it was in 1987, for instance. So what?  What has happened since 1987? All we need do is look at the cost of fertiliser, machinery and borrowed money to see that we are not comparing <Col N="239" /> like with like.  If the Minister genuinely holds that view there is a terrible time ahead for agriculture.</P>
      <P>Three weeks ago the Minister returned from the EC price negotiations and with a fanfare of trumpets announced what has been achieved.  The Minister and the Minister of State have pointed out that the farming organisations are of the view that the Minister did well but given the telephone conversations I had today I wonder if they still think that.  Three or four county executives have requested copies of both speches.  I wonder what they want them for.  Perhaps it is a different story now.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister say that things have got better as a result of the increases, valued at £90 million, gained by the Minister at the price talks when farmers are selling every animal at prices up to £100 to £120 below the price obtaining this time last year?  Lambs are being sold up to £20 below the price they were fetching this time last year and God only knows what the price will be in a months time.  Cereal prices have been cut by 3 per cent and if overall EC production goes over 160 million tonnes a co-responsibility levy will be payable.  All the indications are that the European harvest is going to be that good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Toole rightly pointed out, cheap substitutes are a major source of embarrassment for cereal growers. What about wool prices?  Admittedly this a minor matter but I have never seen wool being sold at 28p a pound during the past ten years.  The milk sector is in a state of shock.  During the past three to four months creameries have dropped the price by between 10p and 15p per gallon.  Contacts within the industry inform me that the price will drop much more during the next two or three months.  Taking this along with the four hikes in interest rates during the past 12 months, I fail to understand how anyone could say that the income of a farmer will either remain static or increase this year as compared with last year.  It appears the Government do not acknowledge this fact but I can assure the Members of the <Col N="240" /> House that the farming community are only to well aware of it.</P>
    <P>There are two very important matters I wish to bring to the notice of the House. First, it is clear that there is a certain amount of hostility from certain quarters of this House towards the agricultural community.  The first hint of this was when the Minister for Finance, in the debate on the Finance Bill a few days ago, queried the need for equity given the fact that some 60 acre dairy farmers can earn between £40,000 and £50,000 per annum.  Any Minister who believes this is possible is certainly heading for trouble and if he is able to exert influence, as any Minister for Finance should be able to do, we are in serious trouble.  He argued because incomes were so high that there was no need for equity.  I have to say that Deputy Stagg was far more hostile to the agricultural community than any other Labour Party or Opposition Member I have come across in my life.</P>

      <P>This is an ideal opportunity for every Opposition Deputy who has an interest in rural Ireland to send a clear signal to the Government that we do not like what they are doing. We can disagree on minor points.  The major point is that the Government have ignored what has been happening in Ireland and in the EC.  Despite the fact that we have the Presidency of the EC it is significant that we never had it so bad as we have had it in the last three or four months since our beloved Taoiseach became President of that outfit and Minister O'Kennedy became President of the Council of Ministers.  When the bells ring here for the division tonight it will be an ideal opportunity for all the Opposition parties to vote against the Government to show every farmer in Ireland, big and small, that we have their interests at heart.  Afterwards we can talk about the small print.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;An individual who makes, in the manner prescribed by the Income Tax Act, 1967 a claim in that behalf and makes a return in the prescribed form of his total income shall, for the purposes of ascertaining the amount of his assessable income for the purposes of income tax, be allowed a deduction from the amount of his earned income as estimated in accordance with this Act of a sum equal to one-fourth of that income, but not exceeding, in the case of any individual, the sum of £1,500.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In introducting this amendment I am seeking to put back on the Statute Book earned income relief which was abolished about 15 years ago as part of the so-called tax reform.  The words &ldquo;tax reform&rdquo; are used very loosely in the House when often what is meant is tax reduction or tax changes.  The implication that there is any new thinking involved in this so-called reform is a joke.  This tax was introduced supposedly to simplify the income tax code.  To an extent, it certainly did simplify the income tax code in that it reduced a very simple and easily calculated relief which was given on earned income &mdash; that is income from salaries, wages, business profits, professional earnings and so on.  It was a very simple relief to calculate and it differentiated between earned income on the one hand and unearned income on the other.  For the life of me, I could never see the logic of this being abolished. Surely we should be differentiating in favour of earned income and discriminating against unearned income from rent, interest and so on.  The difficulty with this amendment is that it must be taken in conjunction with the rest of my amendments but that cannot be because it must stand on its own.  For example, I was proposing the abolition of the PAYE and PRSI allowances.  If these allowances were eliminated this would go a very long way towards paying the cost of the earned income relief.</P>
      <P>The great advantage of the earned income relief is that it removes the differentiation between wages and salaries on the one hand and business profits and professional earnings on the other.  We have had an adequate debate on this matter already.  In view of the current year basis of assessment there is no longer any reason for differentiation between these two types of income.  I listened to the Minister's explanation for his reasons for keeping up this differentiation but I was not impressed with the reasons he put forward.  It is obviously too late to do anything in this budget but I would ask the Minister to look again at this whole question of the PAYE allowance, the PRSI allowance and the earned income relief.  We would move on to a much better system if this amendment were adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment by Deputy Garland proposes the introduction of a deduction equal to one-quarter of earned income subject to a maximum deduction of £1,500.  Earned income relief formerly existed in the income tax code and was provided for by section 134 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Broadly, it consisted of a deduction in respect of one-quarter of <Col N="249" /> earned income subject to a maximum deduction of £500.</P>
      <P>The distinction between earned and unearned income was abolished in the Finance Act, 1974 which introduced a new, unified system of personal income taxation and abolished surtax.  Earned income relief in consequence disappeared under the new scheme.  To compensate taxpayers for the abolition of the relief, substantial increases in personal allowances were granted.  For example, the allowance for a married person went up from £474 in 1973-74, the last year of the old system, to £800 in 1974-75.  These allowances have, of course, been greatly increased in the intervening years, so that now, for example, the married personal allowance is £4,100.</P>
      <P>Given that earned income relief as a concept no longer exists and its removal was compensated for by increased personal allowances as I have just outlined, the introduction of relief based on that concept would, in our view, be totally inappropriate at this stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland asked me to look at the question of allowances in the preparation for next year.  I am quite prepared to do that but I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to reply briefly to the Minister.  I agree that the allowances need to be looked at and, of course, he is quite right in saying that at the time earned income relief was abolished there were substantial increases in personal allowances.  However, I still seek a problem there and I ask him to look at it.  I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;Sections 13 to 21 inclusive of <Col N="250" /> the Finance Act, 1987 are hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The sections sought to be repealed deal with withholding tax on professional fees and other sums paid by the Government to professional people.  This was ill-conceived legislation brought in partly as a way of doing something to reduce the substantial budget deficit the Government had to face in 1987.  This tax has always been very unfair.  It impinges particularly on doctors who are involved in the medical card scheme.  Many of these doctors practice in an area where most of their income is derived from medical card holders.  One of the great defects of the scheme is that it is based on gross earnings rather than net earnings.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies here will appreciate that, particularly in a rural practice, a doctor's expenses are very considerable.  Apart from his surgery expenses he has substantial travel expenses.  All in all, this was a very badly thought out scheme.  A number of spurious arguments were brought out at the time it was introduced.  It was said doctors were over-paid.  That may be, but if they are over-paid the answer is to deal with that in a direct fashion, not to get at them indirectly through draconian and unjust sections in a Finance Bill.  It is said also that doctors evade tax.  I am sure some doctors evade tax, but the vast majority of doctors do not.  If doctors are evading tax there are laws and collection methods to deal with that.  An unfair measure like this should not be introduced as an excuse because some doctors evade their tax.</P>
    <P>Whatever vestige of reason there was for this legislation it has now disappeared because of our adopting the current year basis of assessment.  Doctors, like everybody else, will now have to pay their tax on 1 November on their current year's earnings.  This is another differentiation. We are introducing another category of people.  We have employees and wage earners on one hand, business people on another and now we have a third category who are discriminated against more than anybody else, that is people who earn the bulk of their money from payments from <Col N="251" /> Government Departments.  I do not know what possible excuse the Minister can have for keeping this provision.  I hope, even at this late stage, he will consider accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not know what the cost of Deputy Garland's amendment would be, but I presume the Minister will inform us of that.  Withholding tax operates very unfairly in a number of respects.  If the Minister is not in a position to do it tonight, I would like him in advance of next year's Finance Bill to take a couple of items on board. At present for doctors who employ a receptionist, or a locum, or a nurse, when their expenses are being rebated to them, withholding tax is deducted from the expenses.  Therefore, where the doctor pays a receptionist he deducts PAYE and PRSI and that is advanced to the Revenue Commissioners and he is getting the cheque to rebate him for the expenses. Withholding tax is deducted.  That is extraordinarily unfair and I would like the Minister to move to amend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an amendment down to section 24 which deals with withholding tax also. I agree with Deputy Garland.  Now that all Schedule D taxpayers are going to be taxed on a current year basis, the Minister should also agree that the credit for withholding tax should be on a current year basis.  Under the scheme at present the tax is deducted at the standard rate when the fee is paid and it is set off as a credit against the individual's tax liability. Under the preceding year basis of assessment which existed until this year the credit was in the year of assessment in which the fees were assessed, that is the following year, and the credit was for the withholding tax deducted in the basis period.  In section 24 the Minister is changing the concept of the basis period to a credit period and, even though tax will be deducted on a current year basis, the offset can only take place as a year in retrospect.  That was very unfair.  If Class 2 Schedule D people are still to be taxed on a withholding tax basis this concept of the credit period being introduced in <Col N="252" /> section 24, which means they will have to wait 12 months before they can put their credit up, is blatantly unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate effect of this amendment, if passed, would be to freeze all withholding tax now in hands for all time; credit could not be given for withholding tax deducted last year nor could interim refunds be made from now on.  I am sure this is not what the Deputy had in mind when drafting this amendment.</P>
      <P>However, even if the amendment was remedied to cure this defect by allowing credit and interim refunds in respect of tax deducted up to now, it would have a very critical effect on the budget arithmetic. It would reduce the tax yield for the year 1990 by £23 million.  It is easy for anybody to write out amendments: one would cost £23 million and the one before this, would cost £475 million.  Let us not run away with ourselves in relation to where all this money is to be found. Furthermore, the anti-evasion element in the withholding tax scheme would be damaged.  It is well recognised, and in fact it has been advocated by the Commission on Taxation, that withholding tax schemes are a very effective means of curbing evasion of tax through the non-declaration of receipts.  In those circumstances I must reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the operation of the existing withholding tax scheme, interim refunds are paid when the amount of withholding tax deducted exceeds the tax liability on the income of the previous accounting period.  In calculating the amount of any interim refund an amount of withholding tax equal to this liability is retained and any excess over that amount is repaid. Thus the tax actually retained for credit later against income tax liability of the year of assessment is determined by reference to the taxable income rather than the turnover.  Taxable income would, of course, reflect all allowable deductions in respect of trading expenses, not just payments made to a secretary, locum or receptionist but also travelling expenses, heating, lighting, etc., as well as general tax reliefs, such as personal allowances, <Col N="253" /> retirement annuities, life assurance, etc. The existing procedure takes into account the items mentioned and I am not convinced of the necessity for this amendment.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to confine the amendment to medical practitioners since other professionals would in equity have to be covered.  While it is impossible to be precise, it would reduce the withholding tax yield.  From an administrative point of view I would also point out that the level of expenses incurred by individuals within a particular profession and among the professions generally varies so much that to determine some artificial standard would not result in greater equity.  The differences which exist are best resolved by applying the withholding tax to the full amount of all payments and where necessary making interim refunds by reference to actual tax liabilities and therefore to incomes net of expenses in individual cases.</P>
    <P>The movement to current year basis does not really change anything as far as the withholding tax on professional people is concerned.  It provides that the various elements of the withholding tax system will impact on the taxpayer in precisely the same way as heretofore. Tax will continue to be deducted at the standard rate and interim refunds will continue as before, with the same qualifying conditions and without any change in the timing of these refunds.  Credit for tax not refunded as an interim refund is given as heretofore against the liability for the year of assessment or in the accounting period in which the deductions were made.  Special commencement and cessation arrangements continue to apply.  The hardship safety net applies as before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that on a current year tax basis all taxpayers are paying in the current year, including those in receipt of income subject to withholding tax.  He is saying that it would cost the taxpayer £34 million. These people are not only paying tax on a current year basis but are probably paying about one year in advance.  They are paying now in respect of next year's earnings.  That is obviously the case.  If doctors and other professional people are now paying on a current year basis they will be paying approximately what they will be paying with the withholding tax. Obviously the Minister is collecting next year's withholding tax this year.  That is outrageous.</P>
      <P>Regarding tax evasion, what the Minister says is a total <i>non sequitur</i>.  A withholding tax is one way of dealing with tax evasion but if the Government Departments who pay money to doctors or other professional people make a return to the Revenue Commissioners of the amount payable to these professionals, that would be just as good from a tax evasion viewpoint.  If doctor A in Donegal is in receipt of £35,000 from the Department of Health in a particular tax year, it is quite irrelevant from the point of view of evasion whether that money is deducted at source as at present or whether the Revenue Commissioners are advised by the Department of Health that that sum of money has been paid to a particular doctor.  The real reason is that the Government were strapped for cash in 1987 and they picked a soft target to milk for money.</P>

There is discrimination against spouses and children, sons or daughters of employers in respect of tax free allowances. It is anti-family to have a provision in the taxation code which discriminates against family employment.  If the spouse or children were literally to walk across the road and work for somebody else they would be given these allowances if they paid income tax and PRSI.  It is beyond comprehension that up to now these people have been excluded from the proper rate of tax free allowance.  On a farm a husband and wife will each have a £2,000 tax free allowance but they will not have the benefit of the additional PAYE allowance.  We are suggesting that where there is genuine employment of either the spouse or children they should have the tax free allowance and the PRSI allowance.  We see no reason for excluding them.  The Minister might explain why family employment is discriminated against in this regard.  It is almost an incentive to the children of the employer to emigrate or to work for somebody else. It discriminates against the possibility of continuing a family business.  The benefit would be less than £300 per annum.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us the number of spouses or children of employers who are without this allowance at the moment, the cost of treating them the same as everybody else and why they were excluded in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> The ICMSA submission dealt specifically with this unfair aspect of the taxation system as it applies to this category. In particular, we were worried about the need to treat spouses and children equally, as the Constitution says we should treat them.  However, this category is totally discriminated against in the area of taxation.  I hope other Members will support our amendment and that the Minister will accept it.  Not alone would we be grateful for this but many family employers would also be grateful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the PAYE allowance and PRSI allowance to the spouses and children of self-employed taxpayers, who are now being placed on the current year basis, where the taxpayers employ those spouses or children.  Deputy Noonan had a similar amendment down earlier today.  I do not want to labour the arguments but I will repeat them for the benefit of Deputy Ferris.</P>
      <P>The amendment, in so far as it relates to the PAYE allowance, is similar although narrower in focus to the amendment put down by Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage.  The arguments I used in relation to that amendment are equally applicable here.  This has been the position for the past ten years.  This question has been raised on many occasions and the situation has been more or less the same.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the PAYE allowance is and always has been viewed as an allowance for ordinary employed taxpayers. The primary reason for its introduction was to improve the tax progression for these ordinary PAYE taxpayers.  Spouses of the self-employed are excluded from the PAYE allowance to avoid repetition of the abuses of the working wife's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that allowance existed, self-employed taxpayers frequently set up nominal employments for their wives, adequate to attract the full measure of the allowance without incurring any extra tax.  It was very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to question a wife's entitlement to this allowance because the <Col N="257" /> husband invariably produced evidence to prove that she was entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Children of the self-employed are excluded from the PAYE allowance because over the years the experience has been that if a tax advantage can be gained by creating artificial income or employment for children then that opportunity will be taken.  Moreover, the wages of many people who carry out duties in their parents' business or, indeed, their spouse's business are often not subject to the proper operation of PAYE.  In such cases, there would appear to be no justification for granting the PAYE allowance.</P>
    <P>The cost of extending the PAYE allowance on the basis proposed in the amendment would be about £17 million in 1990 and about £24 million in a full year. Deputy Taylor's amendment also proposes that the PRSI allowance be extended to the spouses and children of self-employed taxpayers in certain circumstances. Among these circumstances is the condition that the spouses or children be employed by the taxpayers concerned. I would point out that where the employment involved is insurable employment and the employees pay PRSI contributions at the appropriate rates for which the PRSI allowance is due under the existing legislation, they would qualify for the allowance.  In such instances, the proposal to grant the PRSI allowance is unnecessary.  Consequently, I will be opposing the amendment.  The number of spouses and children of self-employed people is 84,000.</P>

      <P>This debate is becoming a bit fragmented.  It is a pity we did not take amendments Nos. 21 and 28 together.  This would have saved a bit of bother as we are only rehashing the arguments we have already made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not put down any amendment to this section because I would prefer to go down the road of unearned income relief, to which I have already referred.  This relief would be a substitute for PAYE and PRSI allowances.  However, as we have not gone down that road, we have <Col N="258" /> to go down the correct road of extending to all self-employed people, whether farmers, professionals or business people, the benefit of the PAYE and PRSI allowance.  I hope Deputy Taylor will press his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed at the Minister's response.  The Minister had a problem about extending this tax facility to this category and he referred to ordinary taxpayers.  Our amendment was absolutely specific; we regard the spouses and children of self-employed taxpayers to be ordinary taxpayers in the tax net and naturally we want them to be treated the same as all other taxpayers.  It was for that very reason our amendment was so specific.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not exactly the same as similarly worded amendments because this amendment is confined specifically to people who are employed and paying tax and PRSI.  Our amendment does not propose extending those rights to employers who are already self-assessed or included in this year's assessment. They are not in any way included in this amendment.  Perhaps the Minister's earlier response identified this anomaly and said why it would be impractical to extend the PAYE type allowances to an employer &mdash; the Minister put forward some valid points &mdash; but this amendment specifically deals with employed people, be they the spouses or children of an employer and I do not understand why they should be treated separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people are being discriminated against and I was surprised at the inference that this type of allowance could in some way lead to falsification of tax returns or that people could use them to gain benefits.  A person is either working for somebody, gainfully employed, in the tax code and registered with a PRSI number or they are not.  Our amendment specifically states that people must be in that category, so there would be no question of any abuse of the system.  We will have to push our amendment because there will be inequity in the tax system if <Col N="259" /> some categories of taxpayers are treated differently to others, particularly those <Col N="260" /> who work and are prepared to pay PRSI and PAYE.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 21, to delete lines 1 to 35, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>`basis period for the year 1990-91' means the period on the profits or gains of which income tax for the year 1990-91 falls to be finally computed for the purposes of Case I and Case II of Schedule D;</P>
      <P>`corresponding period' means the period of 12 months immediately preceding the basis period for the year 1990-91.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subject to subsections (4) and (5), the provisions of subsection (3) shall apply, in determining for the year 1990-91 the full amount of the profits or gains of a trade or profession where the trade or profession was set up and commenced before the 6th day of April, 1989.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where this subsection applies, the assessment which, by virtue of section 58 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (as amended by section 12), falls to be made for the year 1990-91, shall be reduced by the excess of the amount of the profits or gains of the basis period for the year 1990-91 over one-half of the aggregate of the profits or gains of that basis period and of the profits or gains, if any, of the corresponding period:</P>
      <P>Provided that the assessment for the year 1990-91 shall not be reduced under the provisions of this section to an amount which is less than the amount determined by the formula&mdash;</P>
      <P>125</P>
      <P>A × &mdash;</P>
      <P>100</P>
      <P>where A is the amount of the profits or gains of the corresponding period.</P>
      <P>(4)  Where an individual is charged to income tax for the year 1990-91 on the full amount of the profits or gains from farming determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of section 20B of the Finance Act, 1974 (as amended by section 18), the provisions of subsection (3) shall have effect as if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the reference to the amount of the profits or gains of the basis period for the year 1990-91 were a reference to the full amount of the profits or gains from farming of the individual determined without regard to the other provisions of this section but in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of the said section 20B (as so amended) for the year 1990-91,</P>
      <P>(b) the reference to the amount of the profits or gains of the corresponding period were a reference to the full amount of the profits or gains determined upon a fair and just average of the profits or gains from farming of the individual in each of the three years ending on the date 12 months immediately before the end of the basis period for the year 1990-91, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> (c)  the reference in subsection (3) to section 58 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, were a reference to subsection (2) of the said section 20B (as so amended).</P>
    <P>(5)  Where, under the provisions of section 58 (5) (a) (ii) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (as amended by section 12), profits or gains of the year ending on the 5th day of April, 1991, are to be computed or the assessment for the year 1990-91 is to be amended, then those profits or gains shall be computed without reference to the provisions of this section and the said assessment shall be amended accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment substitutes a new section 14 for section 14 as introduced to extend the transitional relief available in respect of trades or professions to those persons whose profits for 1990-91 exceed the profits for 1989-90 &mdash; the period which &ldquo;drops-out&rdquo;&mdash; by 25 per cent or more, instead of 50 per cent or more as was the case in the section when introduced.</P>
    <P>The effect of the redrafted section is to allow to relief as before to the 50 per cent cases but to provide a reducing relief to those persons whose profits in 1990-91 are between 25 per cent and 50 per cent higher than their 1989-90 profits.  For example, where there is an excess of 50 per cent the reduction will be 17 per cent approximately; where there is an excess of 40 per cent the reduction will be 11 per cent approximately; where there is an excess of 30 per cent the reduction will be 4 per cent approximately and where there is an excess of 25 per cent there is no reduction.</P>
    <P>The amendment also makes some technical adjustments to section 14 as introduced to clarify the interaction between the relief under this provision and the farmers' averaging provisions in section 20B of the Finance Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>The anomaly to which this amendment is directed was mentioned on Committee Stage debate by Deputy McCreevy and was also brought to my attention by Deputy Micheal Ahern in correspondence.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 35, to delete lines 31 to 50, in page 36, to delete lines 1 to 50 and in page 37, to delete lines 1 to 18.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to delete a section which brings about a situation that the credit for withholding tax would still apply in the following year even though those liable for withholding tax will be taxed on a current year basis.  It is unfair when they move to a current year basis that the tax withheld in the current year will only be credited in the following year.</P>
      <P>I know that simply removing the section may have wider implications &mdash; I am aware of certain implications that might follow from removing the section completely &mdash; but my intention is to have withholding tax credited on a current year basis for the professions who will now be paying tax on a current year basis.  That is the nub of the amendment.  Deputy Garland already gave me an opportunity to mention the points about expenses legitimately incurred by doctors and other professions where tax is withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure, in effect, that withholding tax deducted during an accounting period will be credited against the tax liability for the year of assessment for which the accounting period is the basis period.  As the basis period for a year of assessment is now, under the current year basis proposals, an accounting period ending in the year of assessment itself, the amendment would mean that withholding tax deducted would be credited in the year of assessment itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing withholding tax legislation, an individual taxpayer's accounting period or basis period &mdash; during which withholding tax is deducted &mdash; and the following year of assessment &mdash; in which credit for the withholding tax deducted to given &mdash; are linked together. This is achieved by referring in the withholding tax legislation to the connection <Col N="265" /> that exists between the two periods for assessing purposes.  The accounting period is a basis period for the following year's assessment, the profits taxed for the year of assessment are not the profits of the basis period.  The profits of the basis period are only used as a measure of the profits for the year of assessment. The profits being taxed for the year of assessment are, in law, the actual profits of the year of assessment itself.</P>
    <P>The current year basis provides a new measure of the profits of the year of assessment &mdash; the profits of an accounting period ending in the year of assessment rather than that ending in the proceding year of assessment.  Therefore, the length between the period in which withholding tax is deducted and the tax basis for the following year of assessment, which was introduced in the 1987 Finance Act, is broken.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 24, which Deputy Noonan wishes to have deleted, is to sustain the relationship between the deduction period and the credit year in the new circumstances, that is to retain the arrangement whereby withholding tax deducted in one period is credited against the liability for the following year of assessment.</P>
    <P>The proposals in section 24 do not alter the basic operation of the withholding tax system.  The various elements of that tax system will impact on the taxpayer in precisely the same way as heretofore.  I have already read out the ways in which this has been done up to now.  I will not waste the time of the House repeating it. I should say it will cost £46 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I see the implication of that but I still think the net point is correct &mdash; that after the passage of this Bill, when professionals move, as they will, to a current year basis, when withholding tax is deducted on a current year basis, as it always was, the credit should apply to the current year as well rather than to the following year.  It is an artificial mechanism being put in place to maintain a system which, from a collection point of view, is working well. Even though it was effective it is now anomalous &mdash; when we move to a current year basis &mdash; to be using it all the time.</P>
      <P>I have heard the Minister's arguments advanced already to Deputy Garland.  I should like us to have a couple of minutes on amendment No. 33 with regard to manufacturing relief.

      <P>In page 37, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>`agency' means a charitable body providing development aid or emergency relief in developing countries and designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs by order made under this section;</P>
      <P>`tax' means income tax or corporation tax, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  This section applies to a gift of money which, on or after the 6th day of April, 1990, is made to an agency and is not deductible in computing for the purposes of tax the profits or gains <Col N="267" /> of a trade or profession or is not income to which the provisions of section 439 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, apply.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Revenue Commissioners may consult with an agency in relation to any question which may arise in connection with subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a person proves he has made a gift to which this section applies and claims relief from tax by reference thereto, the provisions of subsection (5) or, as the case may be, subsection (6) shall apply:</P>
    <P>Provided that in determining the net amount of the gift for the purposes of those subsections, the amount or value of any consideration received by the said person as a result of making the gift, whether received directly or indirectly from an agency or any other person, shall be deducted from the amount of the gift.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of income tax for the year of assessment in which a person makes a gift to which this section applies, the net amount thereof shall, subject to subsection (6), be deducted from or set off against any income of the person chargeable to income tax for that year and tax shall, where necessary, be discharged or repaid accordingly; and the total income of the person or, where the person is a wife whose husband is assessed to income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the total income of the husband shall be calculated accordingly:</P>
    <P>Provided that relief under this Act shall not be given to a person for a year of assessment if the gift (or the aggregate of the net amounts of gifts) made by him in that year, being a gift or gifts, as the case may be, to which this section applies, does not exceed £100.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> (6)  Where a gift to which this section applies is made by a company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the net amount thereof shall, for the purposes of corporation tax, be deemed to be a loss incurred by the company in a separate trade in the accounting period of the company in which the gift is made, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the references in subsection (5) to a year of assessment shall be construed as references to an accounting period of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow tax relief to any person, whether an individual, company or other person in respect of a gift of money made to an overseas development agency.  The object here is to provide some compensation for the reduction in the overseas development budget provided by the State for the charitable agencies that provide developmental aid and emergency relief in developing countries.  It is a fact, albeit a regrettable one, that the amount of aid granted by this State to developing countries has fallen.</P>
    <P>My purpose here is an endeavour to redress, that, in some measure, by providing that gifts made by a person or company to a recognised and certified agency &mdash; approved and designated as such by the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; where the gift exceeds £100 would be chargeable against tax.  That is proposed in the hope that it would redress the shortfall.  Many people feel it reasonable and appropriate that this country provide emergency relief for developing countries abroad.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor's amendment proposes tax relief on donations to charities which provide development aid or emergency relief in developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies will join me in paying tribute to the tremendous work done by such charities.  As Deputies will be aware, the income of those charities, whether from donations or otherwise, is exempt from taxation in their hands as <Col N="269" /> long as that income is applied for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>However, to go further, as Deputy Taylor suggests, and allow relief to persons who make donations to such charities would mean that the Exchequer would find itself funding, at anything up to 53 per cent, organisations which currently operate on voluntary and unrelieved contributions.  This cost, which could be substantial, depending on the extent to which use was made of the relief by both existing and new subscribers, would be additional to the State's contribution to development assistance which is over £34 million.</P>
    <P>The cost of implementing the proposal in the amendment could not be afforded within the present budgetary constraints and, if conceded, would have to be made up from elsewhere.  Everybody will agree that our current levels of tax are too high. Therefore, I am very reluctant to seek more revenue from any source to make up such deficiency.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I am sure the House will appreciate that I am not in a position to concede the tax reliefs sought by Deputy Taylor.</P>

      <P>No, I am not happy.  I do not know whether the Minister has an approximate figure of what this would cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it might be difficult to ascertain what the figure would be.  However, I would hazard a guess that it might be relatively small, that the amount of money that firms and individuals might be induced to donate, even if they were allowable for taxation purposes, would not make up the recommended percentage figure for each country &mdash; Ireland in particular &mdash; by the United Nations who control such things. We are very poor in our contributions to <Col N="270" /> Third World countries for these purposes, countries where people are literally starving, where famines occur, where much work needs to be done, in many cases it being literally a matter of life and death.  Our record in that respect is not something of which we can be overproud.  There is a lot of room for improvement there.  I am not saying that we have not done anything.  Nonetheless, having regard to the very serious circumstances prevailing in many Third World countries and their needs, we could do just a little more.</P>
      <P>If the State is not so minded, or feels it cannot provide such contribution directly from the Exchequer, then, in effect, my amendment would provide a partnership contribution, partly from people and companies and partly from the State.  It is true, as the Minister said, that in some cases it would be a question of the Exchequer funding anything up to 53 per cent but, more often than not, its contribution might amount to 10 per cent only.  Be that as it may, it would induce, pull in, funds from private sources so that, every £ sent, would cost the State, at most, 53 pence rather than a direct grant out of Exchequer funds when every £ sent would cost the State an equivalent amount.  There are firms who would be induced to give money, to make contributions, if they were allowed to charge the amount against their tax liability.  I felt the amendment was reasonable and I still think so.</P>

      <P>This is a very worthy amendment.  I do not agree with the Minister that our record, especially in recent years, in development aid is anything to be proud of.  Having regard to the dimensions of the problems involved, I contend we are slipping behind.  Indeed we are a long way short of the minimum target set by the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have thought that this amendment constituted a relatively painless way of helping to make up something of that gap.  It may not induce all that amount of funds.  As Deputy Taylor said, it is not intended to constitute an alternative method of making our nation's <Col N="271" /> contribution by way of development aid. Nonetheless it might induce some funds that would otherwise not be available.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 32a:</P>
      <P>In page 49, line 22, to delete &ldquo;computer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate on the restrictions on manufacturing relief, imposed by section 33 of the Bill as circulated, we asked a number of questions <Col N="272" /> which in my view were not adequately answered.  I do not know what the scope of the restrictions on manufacturing relief will be, despite the fact that the Bill will pass all Stages in 20 minutes' time.  I know what the Minister's intention is but it should be borne in mind that the scope of this relief has been extended beyond what those who established the policy had intended.  This was done by recourse to the courts and the appeals commissioners drawing on the precedents created by the courts.</P>
    <P>We are aware that it is the intention of the Minister that activities such as banana ripening, the grading and bagging of coal, the breaking down of bulk, the bottling of gas and a variety of other activities will no longer qualify for the 10 per cent rate of tax.  However, I do not know where we stand now.  The Minister has indicated that a statement of practice will be issued in due course, that any genuine manufacturer has nothing to fear and that the Revenue Commissioners will be reasonable in their interpretation of the sections, but this leaves us in a state of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to our initial discussion, the Minister circulated an amendment to make it clear that the remanufacture and servicing of computers would qualify for the 10 per cent rate of tax.  If we include remanufacturing and servicing, we will have to amend the Bill further.  The amendment in my name and that of Deputy Barrett would do this, with the result that any activity involving remanufacture and repair would qualify.  I am thinking here of cases which have been brought to my attention.  As the Minister is aware, tool making is a key skill in industry.  I am not thinking here in terms of those who sharpen chisels or hedge-clippers but rather about those who put together and instal assembly lines where the tooling is automated.  When an assembly line has to be taken down effectively it has to be remanufactured and repaired at the same time.  In those circumstances that activity should qualify as should all sub-assembly work.</P>
    <P>We are not stating that it should be remanufacture or repair but rather that <Col N="273" /> the process should involve both activities. If there is a remanufacturing element the amendment should be extended beyond covering just the computer industry.  I would be surprised if the IDA and the Department of Industry and Commerce are not arguing in favour of this.</P>
    <P>The next amendment in my name relates to the grain industry.  Serious concern is being expressed that the drying of grain will no longer qualify and that tax on profit from this activity will be charged at a rate of 40 per cent rather than 10 per cent.  The Minister was asked specifically to state if the drying of grain is either in or out.  We are entitled to certainty when legislating.  If the Minister tells me that it will still qualify, fair enough, but if he tells me it will no longer qualify I will have to press the amendment.  However, the Minister is not answering this straight question.  Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 are consequential.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Perhaps we could have fewer puns.  Bottling water, for example, is a recognised manufacturing activity and bottling water plants have been set up with grants from the IDA and SFADCo, and the understanding was that this activity would qualify for the 10 per cent rate of tax.  If someone extracts water from a spring and puts it in bottles and markets it, according to the defintion this would represent the breaking down of bulk and nothing else. It seems to me that they are caught, yet the Minister seems to imply that they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the fellow who buys trees in a wood, takes them to a sawmill and saws them up into planks is caught too, because that is also breaking down of bulk.  What about the person who is buying sugar in bulk and packaging it? What about the person who is buying flour in bulk and packaging it?  Where is the cut-off point?  Then there is the whole food processing industry where the words are &ldquo;maturation&rdquo; and &ldquo;preservation&rdquo;. What is the Minister's intention here?  He has not explained.  He was asked a couple of times in the House about people in the sand and gravel business.  Are those who go on to make it into readymix, concrete and concrete blocks, to be taxed at 10 per cent and those who collect gravel and sand and sell it in smaller quantities to be taxed at 40 per cent because they are simply breaking down bulk and selling <Col N="276" /> in smaller quantities?  I am not saying I disagree with what the Minister is doing. I believe the Minister is not sure of what he is doing.  Certainly if he is sure of what he is doing he is not telling the rest of us.  My amendments Nos. 6 and 36 are framed to give greater clarity to the section so that the Revenue Commissioners would have greater guidance when they adjudicate on these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an amendment in my name in relation to the deletion of the word &ldquo;computer&rdquo;.  What I am endeavouring to do here is to get all firms and subsidiaries currently involved in the repair or the refurbishment of own products recognised as qualifying for the 10 per cent rate.  It is extraordinary that we are making exceptions for computer companies which, broadly speaking, are all overseas companies yet we are denying this relief to other manufacturers of engineering products.  I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment and make it quite clear that somebody involved in the repair and refurbishment of old, manufactured equipment in a highly skilled, labour intensive activity would be eligible for the 10 per cent rate and that it would also apply to other engineering companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious that other people want to speak but I just want to say to the Minister that in relation to the film industry I cannot see why a distinction should be made between a feature film and a commercial since the process is exactly the same.  There is the same pool of technicians, the same film studios and the same equipment being used by all film producers, yet we have a situation here that if a company is involved in the making of commercials, such as the one promoting the Irish language, the Telecom Éireann commercials, the Smithwicks and Harp commercials, it will now be taxed at 40 per cent but a company making feature films will be taxed at 10 per cent.  What we will do here is drive the making of commercials out of the country because we will not be competitive. It will be quite ludicrous to see a British made commercial promoting the <Col N="277" /> Irish language.  This is the sort of situation in which we are now finding ourselves.  I would ask the Minister to clarify that point also.  I believe that commercial films and feature films should have the same tax relief applied to them.  My understanding is that under this Bill as it stands that is not the case.  My two points, therefore, are related to engineering enterprise and the film industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it highlights the absurdity of the situation we are in when, having come to a critical areas like this, we are expected to deal with it in two minutes.  It is not possible to do that and one has to fall back on Deputy Taylor's view at this stage which is that getting the view of the Minister really does not assist the situation a great deal and interpretation will be a matter for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we have only a couple of minutes left and my colleagues want to get in, let me just say that there is a real problem when we have spent the course of this Finance Bill talking about broadening the tax base and about certain areas not making a fair contribution and talking about the absurd situation created by the banana ripening case where certain companies were enabled to claim the 10 per cent advantage rate where manifestly they could not, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, be described as manufacturing. There is a dilemma in holding that position.  Yet, when presented with hard proposals to broaden the tax base and to try to get a better yield from some areas, we are beginning to backtrack when, in broad terms, up to the time when we were presented with a hard proposal we were all in favour of it.  Deputy Noonan listed a whole series of areas, I listed six areas and Deputy Barrett added two or three more.  It seems that if we did have time to tease it all out we probably would conclude that we should leave the <Col N="278" /> situation as it is.  I cannot go along with that.  I think it is a false option, anyway. I do not believe that there are companies of any significance paying the 40 per cent rate and if we had a real situation of 10 per cent on the manufacturing sector and an effective 20 per cent rate on the rest it might be more meaningful.  The first criterion is that these companies must be making a profit before the matter applies at all.  Otherwise it does not apply, so, to some extent, we are posing false alternatives. I very much regret that we have to cut if off at this point.</P>

      <P>In so far as the section in its original form cuts back on these ridiculous outs that were thrown up in the previous legislation by the courts, I support the Minister.  My complaint would be that he does not go far enough and that the whole issue of 10 per cent tax rates has gone altogether too far. It has gone completely out of hand as Deputy Rabbitte said, and I agree with him.</P>
      <P>We are talking about poverty traps and relatively small amounts of money that would make an enormous difference to families in poor circumstances and, on the other hand we are shifting around here trying to extend these super-advantageous tax rates.  It does not bear thinking about.  I would not be prepared to support Deputy Noonan's amendment on these issues.  I find it remarkable that the Minister brings in a provision to say that dividing, cutting, sub-dividing food products and so on, is not entitled to the 10 per cent manufacturing rate except for meat.  Meat is a special category.  What is so special about meat that it has to be given the super-advantageous terms in contrast to any other product that is produced in the country?  One may suspect the reason but it is just not good enough. We tried to deal with it on Committee Stage.</P>

Meat warrants a very special section of its own just to make doubly sure that it benefits from the 10 per cent rate.  The Minister said that the basic principle of taxation ought to be that if a company makes profit it pays tax and if it does not it does not pay tax.  If they make very big profits so what? Let them pay the 40 per cent, it would not be the end of the world and the money could be used to alleviate poverty and get some numbers of families with children out of the poverty trap they are in.</P>

      <P>I would like to support amendment No. 33.  The Wexford constituency that I come from is the most substantial grain growing constituency. We have evolved a new product of malt and barley which is substantially exported, and the process of grain drying adds considerable value and is therefore a genuine manufacturing process.  The retained profits are vital for the development of this sector and increasing exports.  For those reasons, because of the difficulties in relation to farm incomes, the need to get new export products such as malt and barley, I would ask the Minister to give specific recognition to amendment No. 33.</P>

      <P>I shall have to be very brief.  It is not possible, and I am sure the Deputies will appreciate this, to give specific yes or no answers to all the questions that have been raised by Members on the far side.  However, I will be as helpful and as forthcoming as I possible can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked about the provision for film commercials made here and it was alleged that these were excluded.  In fact <Col N="280" /> they are not.  I had received representations from the film industry &mdash; a labour intensive industry &mdash; and to my knowledge they are quite happy with what has been done on Committee Stage. Everybody knows in general terms what we set out to do &mdash; we set out to eliminate abuses of the tax code which were very clear to everybody.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked whether repairs were automatically excluded from this tax concession. Repairs are not automatically out if there is a change in character in the process &mdash; I want to stress that it is the process that is important, and nothing else.  The Revenue Commissioners will examine the process and I am not doing anything in this legislation to exclude anything specifically but I am trying to correct the abuses that existed.</P>
    <P>Some people used emotive language to suggest that our approach to section 33 was to create doubts.  However, as the accountancy practices and the Confederation of Irish Industry began to realise what we were doing they realised that there was not the level of uncertainty they feared.  In fact our whole approach is to minimise uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor asked about meat processing. Meat processing was specifically included in the section to allay any fears that it might be treated as a produce acquired in bulk and divided and packaged to prepare it for sale.  The term &ldquo;meat processing&rdquo; has a very wide meaning and therefore it is not that easy to answer yes or no to the questions Deputies raised.  Meat processing includes a wide range of activities and some of these may constitute manufacture, while others may not.  I think most Deputies recognise what I am trying to do &mdash; certain restaurants were availing of the 10 per cent rate by manufacturing in the back kitchen and selling the produce and that is the type of thing we are trying to target.  It is clear that activities carried out in a full industrial building approved under regulations constitutes manufacture.  In other cases, the normal tests have to be applied.  The process will have to be of a sufficient degree to qualify for the scheme.  We want to be as clear as we <Col N="281" /> can in trying to advise the House and businesses as to what will be covered by the term manufacture.  To be disqualified from the 10 per cent rate, a company must fall primarily within one of the excluded categories.  With regard to the sector we have just spoken about, the meat processing industry, the processes carried out by companies within the food processing industry do not fall primarily into one of those excluded categories and do not involve simply the breaking down of bulk produce or simply the preservation of foodstuffs, generally they involve complex processes and this does not fall into one of the excluded categories as generally the process results in a new product.  Unless they fall primarily into one of the excluded categories they will continue to qualify for the 10 per cent rate, and that applies across the board.</P>
    <P>I heard similar emotive language being used last year when we were trying to introduce the anti-avoidance measures and certain sectors of the accountancy profession use it all the time.  I am not worried about it.  The anti-avoidance profession is always there.  A genuine manufacturer who has a process that changes the character of a product had nothing to fear.  Every sector of industry has the opportunity to go to the appeals section in the Revenue Commissioners and to go through the normal appeals procedures.</P>
    <P>We have set out to stop the abuse of the concession and the erosion of the tax base.  In fact more and more companies <Col N="282" /> were lining up each month to avoid taxation.</P>

      <P>I have not yet dealt with computers and all the other sections the Deputy raised.  I do not think that anybody in this House would disagree that computers and part of the process in electronics and telecommunications is installation.  Part of their process is installation. For instance, after you manufacture a telephone exchange part of the process is installing it and part may be what may be loosely termed repair, but it is not exactly that as it is part of the process of manufacturing.  The same will apply in those other areas.  I do not see why the Deputy wishes to exclude computers because if you take out computers you could include a whole range of areas across the board that were never intended to be included and should not be included, for example, ordinary repairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Israeli Security Policies.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The intensified violence in Israel over the past few days which has left at least 18 Palestinians dead and approximately 800 injured has focused <Col N="285" /> attention once again on the plight of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories.</P>
      <P>While the particular incident which has led to this upsurge in violence &mdash; the massacre of eight Palestinian workers in Tel Aviv on Sunday &mdash; appears to have been the work of one, probably deranged, individual, the other casualties have been the victims of the Israeli Government's &ldquo;iron fist&rdquo; security policies which have left more than 650 Palestinian civilians dead and tens of thousands wounded since December 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately it is only in the aftermath of particular horrific incidents, such as those at the weekend, that the eyes of the world focus on the activities of the Israeli security forces.  For too long, western Governments have been prepared to turn a blind eye to the systematic killing of civilians, the use of live ammunition against unarmed crowds, torture, beatings, brutality and illegal detentions.  In December last, Amnesty International produced a report which highlighted many of the abuses by Israeli security forces, particularly in the occupied territories. The report which they produced in their <i>Focus</i> magazine in December 1989 pointed out that they had repeatedly expressed concern about violations of human rights committed by Israeli forces in responses to the Intifada, the organisation particularly concerned that the guidelines, regulating circumstances in which troops can open fire, may permit unjustifiable killings.  In practice, the restrictions imposed by these guidelines are reportedly often disregarded.  The authorities appear not to have taken adequate measures to promptly investigate fatal incidents and punish those found guilty of abuses.  The report goes on to point out that almost half of the over 550 unarmed civilians shot dead by Israeli forces between December 1987 and October 1989 were aged 18 or younger.  More than 110 of the victims were aged 16 or less and included children as young as three and four.  The report pointed out also that Israeli forces have shot and killed unarmed Palestinians <Col N="286" /> ostensibly while trying to arrest them.  In a number of cases the victims do not appear to have been involved in any violent activity when they were shot.  Israeli soldiers are allowed to use live ammunition to arrest people wearing masks.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International, a highly respected organisation, which is concerned about human rights have produced a report which damns the security forces in the occupied territories.  It is time the world in general took more notice of what is going on there.  The general willingness to turn a blind eye to unacceptable activities has condemned hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to a miserable existence in appalling conditions in refugee camps.  Throughout the history of the Israeli State and especially in the past few years, it has shown a contempt not just for the rights of Palestinians but also for international law and for the United Nations.  It has engaged in the forced deportation of Palestinian civilians despite the fact that this is in clear breach of the 1949 United Nations convention regarding the treatment of civilians under military rule.  It has persistently ignored United Nations resolutions and has treated representatives of the United Nations with contempt.  As we know, most of the casualties suffered by Irish troops serving with UNIFIL in Lebanon have been at the hands of Israeli backed forces.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Irish Government have spoken out in the past against the unacceptable activities of the Israeli Government and their security forces and I hope they will now protest to the Israeli Government in an even stronger manner and press the European Council of Ministers to adopt a similarly strong position.  The Israeli ambassador should be called in and told quite clearly of our anger and indignation.</P>
    <P>The Government should demand the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories they have illegally occupied since 1967 and their replacement by a United Nations force.  The Government should also consider sending an all-party Dáil delegation to the occupied teritories there and to report back on what <Col N="287" /> measures we might take to assist the plight of the Palestinians living there. This weekend a delegation from the European Parliament will be visiting Tel Aviv.  I hope to be with that delegation to investigate the situation there at first hand for the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government must use their position as President of the EC Council of Ministers to urge moves towards a lasting peace in the Middle East.  The biggest single obstacle to the peace process in the Middle East is the persistent refusal of the Israeli authorities to enter into any discussions with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, which is the legitimate representative voice of the Palestinian people.  In South Africa, the Nationalist Party Government of President De Klerk has been forced to enter into negotiations with the ANC but the Israeli Government still persists in its refusal to talk, thus blocking the road to peace and condemning many more people to needless deaths.</P>
    <P>Any lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East must include as a central feature a homeland for the Palestinian people.  There is considerable international support for the convening of a UN backed international conference on the Middle East but, again, this has been blocked by Israel.  The Government have expressed their concern for an international conference but I hope they will examine ways of pursuing this even more vigorously through the European Community and the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the humanitarian considerations for Palestinians and Israeli people we have a direct interest in securing a lasting peace in the Middle East. Peace would allow for the withdrwal of Irish and other UN troops from Lebanon and would also create a climate where the release of Brian Keenan and other hostages would become more probable. On the other hand, incidents such as those at the weekend poison the atmosphere throughout the entire Middle East <Col N="288" /> and are not conducive to the release of the hostages.</P>
    <P>I note from newspaper reports today that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to meet the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat, in Tunis, on Saturday next.  I hope the Minister will extend to Mr. Arafat the sympathy of the Irish people on the recent deaths of so many Palestinian civilians. I urge the Minister and Mr. Arafat also to take steps to advance the proposal made during their meetings last November that the Palestine Liberation Organisation should be allowed to open an office in this country and appoint an official representative.  I understand that the Palestine Liberation Organisation are anxious and ready to go ahead and, indeed, have already nominated their representative and that they are simply awaiting the sanction of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Now would be an appropriate time to take this step.</P>
    <P>It is important that the European Community and the Irish Government's position in the European Council at this time should be used to exert the greatest possible diplomatic and economic pressure on Israel to change their position with regard to the Palestinians.  There is a clear indication that the peace process in the Middle East has run aground, and it is important that the EC, the US and the Soviet Union, too, who also have an interest in the area, should use all their efforts to get the peace process back on the rails and overcome the blockages.  If it means applying economic sanctions to Israel, that should be done, at least on a progressive basis, in order to bring them to their senses and bring them to the negotiating table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy De Rossa for putting down this question, thereby giving this House the opportunity of expressing its shock and concern at the events which began <Col N="289" /> just outside Tel Aviv last Sunday.  I would also like to set out in detail the actions which the Irish Presidency has taken in response to these tragic happenings.  As Deputy De Rossa said, the Irish Government have spoken out very strongly in the past and will continue to do so in relation to the very tragic events which take place there.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs advised the Political Affairs Committee of the European Parliament that he had asked the Twelve to issue a statement. That statement was issued last evening and it reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Twelve are shocked and saddened by the violence which has left at least 18 Palestinians dead and hundreds injured in Rishon le Zion and the Occupied Territories since 20 May. They extend their condolences to the families and friends of those killed and their sympathy to the injured.</P>
      <P>The Twelve deplore the tragic massacre by an Israeli civilian of eight Palestinians in Rishon le Zion.  It is a matter of very grave concern to the Twelve that the response of the Israeli authorities to the spontaneous demonstrations which broke out in the Occuppied Territories has left a further ten Palestinians dead and hundreds injured.  They have repeatedly raised with the Israeli authorities the question of the use of excessive force to put down manifestations of the Palestinian uprising in the Occupied Territories.</P>
      <P>The Twelve earnestly appeal for calm.  They call on the Israeli authorities to exercise the utmost restraint.  They are also concerned at the risk that violence might spread &mdash; a risk illustrated in particular by events yesterday in Amman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Twelve see the latest upsurge of violence as symptomatic of the fragility of the situation in the Occupied Territories in the absence of any significant prospect of progress in the direction of a settlement.  It underlines, in their view, the imperative of resuming the <Col N="290" /> peace process in a meaningful way at a very early date.</P>
    <P>In their contacts with both sides, the Twelve will, on the basis of the principles which they have enunciated in the Declarations of Venice (1980), Madrid and Strasbourg (1989), do all they can to promote significant steps in the direction of a comprehensive settlement.  They will also be trying to prevent any further hardening of attitudes which could compromise that objective.  Moreover, the Community and its member States will actively pursue their programmes of aid to the population of the Occupied Territories.</P>
    <P>The Twelve statement is being given formally to the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. As Deputy de Rossa said, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has also arranged to meet the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Mr. Yasser Arafat, at the weekend, schedules permitting. This meeting which has been planned for some time, underlines the importance which we and the Twelve attach to the advancement of the peace process in the Middle East.  It is particularly important now, in the light of the tragic events in Israel and the occupied territories since last weekend.</P>
    <P>I have to say that these latest events add to our growing concern about what has been happening since the peace process ground to a halt in mid-March.  We have to remember that the killings in Rishon le Zion were the work of somebody who was probably mentally disturbed. The massacre was strongly condemned at the highest levels by the Israeli Government, but it is a measure of the volatility of feelings resulting from the absence of progress towards peace that, nevertheless, the killings caused widespread demonstrations.</P>
    <P>The mounting toll of Palestinian deaths and injuries is one aspect of an insensitive, indeed sometimes provocative, approach on the part of the Israeli authorities. The establishment of new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories is another &mdash; one which Arab countries and <Col N="290" /> the Palestine Liberation Organisation will consider at their Summit meeting in Baghdad next Sunday.  With his Troika colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already discussed the question of settlements at length with the Arab League Committee on the Intifada in Luxembourg on 2 April.</P>
    <P>The Twelve are acutely aware that a political settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict based, as it must be, on the exchange of land for peace becomes even more remote with every new manifestation of Israel's illegal settlement policy.</P>
    <P>The Twelve are engaged in a continuous dialogue with the Israeli authorities on the aid and human rights aspects of the Strasbourg Declaration. This approach has achieved certain limited results.  The scheme for direct exports from the occupied territories is operating more smoothly; a draft law which would have complicated the transfer of financial flows to Palestinian NGOs was withdrawn; since the end of February, many community colleges have reopened; the order closing the universities is expected to lapse on 28 May. The question of how best we can influence developments for the better is always current.</P>
    <P>In parallel, we have pressed ahead with giving effect to the commitment to double direct Community aid for the Occupied Territories by 1990.  The Palestinians understand Community action on aid and on human rights as a contribution to world peace.  Deputies will also wish to be aware that, nationally, we have allocated from our development co-operation budget the sum of £87,700 for education purposes in the occupied territories. Part of these funds are allocated to Bethlehem University on the West Bank and the remainder to vocational training centres in Gaza.</P>
    <P>If I have given instances in which something very modest was achieved, it is because we must not succumb to a sense of hopelessness.  Despite justified frustration at their meagre results, the Palestine Liberation Organisation have not <Col N="290" /> departed from the political approach.  It is in everyone's interest, including, of course, that of the Twelve, that the political approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict should be vindicated.  Israel, too, however, must be part of this approach. The conflict is, after all, an Arab-Israeli conflict.  Israel must, therefore, be party to any negotiated settlement.  As Twelve, we will be intent on using every opportunity to ensure that Israel becomes engaged in a political process leading to an overall settlement.</P>

      <P>We now come to deal with the second item for consideration on the Adjournment.  Deputy Jim Mitchell, Deputy Brendan Kenneally and other Deputies gave me notice of intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the industrial dispute at Waterford Glass.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of this debate it is proper, given the gravity of the situation in Waterford, even at this late hour tonight, that the Dáil have an opportunity to express its united concern at the situation.  I know that in the city and county of Waterford tonight there is great stress and great heat, so I am conscious that nothing said here tonight should add to that heat or further inflame the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, we cannot but express our very strong concern at the gravity of the situation.  If we reflect on the figures given in this House earlier this afternoon in reply to questions by me and other <Col N="290" /> Deputies, we will remember that the Minister told the House that concerned here were not only the 2,300 jobs at Waterford Glass which would be bad enough, but 4,600 other indirect jobs were also affected, to give a total of almost 7,000 jobs to be lost if we lose this plant.  That is not only capable of making the city and county of Waterford a desert, it would have severe repercussions for the entire country.  Another major consideration is that Waterford Crystal is one of the great quality brands known throughout the world and represents and signifies Irish quality, craft and design. Many potential investors may get the impression, wrongly, that we have a difficult and truculent trade union movement or industrial relations situation.  It would give an opportunity to our competitors for that investment to convey a wrong impression internationally.</P>
    <P>The position is extremely grave and I know there is a conviction on the part of some that there is not really any danger to this plant.  Those of us who have been keeping closely in touch with the situation and deliberately keeping quiet to allow the possibility of talks realise that we are in an extremely grave position, that there is a need for urgent talks.  I would suggest that they listen to the Minister's request to start talks.  I would go further and ask management to stretch a point and go into talks.  I would ask them to pay the equivalent of the bonanza payments into some trust fund controlled by an independent authority, perhaps the Bishop of Waterford and Lismore.  I would ask the unions to stretch a point and to start the talks.  No principle is conceded by agreeing to talks.  I would go further than the Minister.  Having started the talks, I would suggest to the unions to consider resuming work as soon as possible while those talks are going on.  It weakens their case not at all and it strengthens the hope of saving and developing the industry which means a lot to them and a lot to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Politicians from my constituency of Waterford who are here to comment are to be complimented.  Other <Col N="290" /> politicians and civic leaders who have commented from time to time also deserve credit for having the courage to speak their minds.  It is not an easy time for any of us.  It can be very ugly and very frustrating.  I do not want to make this a political issue but I have seen a number of people who walked away rather than get involved or try to help.  It is despicable. I compliment those who are here tonight and those who have commented outside.  Politicians, civic leaders, captains of industry, people in public life or outstanding in society have a duty to comment when such a terrible scenario is facing us.  We are on the brink of the biggest employment disaster this country has ever witnessed.  We could be only days away from it, certainly weeks.  I know there is a certain amount of delicacy attached to commenting on this episode but nevertheless we must comment if the problem is to be solved.</P>
      <P>There is need for urgent action to get talks underway between unions and management at Waterford Crystal.  It has struck me forcibly in recent weeks that many of the workers do not believe the factories in Waterford and Dungarvan can close.  They are basing their belief on the value of the fixed assets and the experience and skills of the workforce. Those skills and experience are considerable. There is a tremendous workforce in that industry.  Having said that, I do not share that point of view.  The industry, because of huge losses and high overheads, must be in serious jeopardy. We must all address ourselves to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the industry is to be saved we need a revised list of proposals from the Minister which hopefully will be accepted by both sides as a basis for negotiation and eventual agreement.  I appreciate, as do most people, the efforts the Minister has made.  He has applied himself to the problem and has done his best so far.  It is an extraordinarily difficult problem and it is vital that every single worker realises the gravity of the position.  I do not believe the management are bluffing when they say there is serious danger of the factories closing.  If the company's board decide to <Col N="290" /> close it will be a decision which will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.  More than likely the decision will not be made here but in boardrooms elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the management and to every worker to concentrate their minds on talks that will lead to an agreement and a lasting solution.  It is estimated that only half the workers turned up for last Sunday's crucial meeting.  That is unfortunate. What a disaster it would be if the factories did close, particularly because of apathy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for giving me some of his time to contribute to this debate.  I believe that the desire for talks in Waterford is strengthening. I have become more and more certain of this.  I lend my support to Deputy Deasy's remarks regarding the efforts of the Minister for Labour to seek talks about talks.  He has applied himself unselfishly to the task and I believe his proposals last Sunday, though they were not accepted, do not require very much change in order to become acceptable.  I am not aware of the contents of his new proposals, but I very much hope that he is successful and that the proposals are acceptable to both sides so that talks can begin on Monday, as I understand the Minister wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are stories circulating regarding possible actions to be taken by the company tomorrow.  Perhaps the Minister would assure the House that this is not the case.  I said on the first morning of the strike that my first and foremost concern was for the workers, their jobs, pay and conditions.  They have lived under a shadow in Waterford and Dungarvan for the past three years.  There has been a stop-go policy and there was the June agreement.  I will not go over events of the past.  Disputes are settled at the negotiation table.  I said it on the first morning of the strike and I reiterate it now.  Both sides need to come to the table urgently. The climate is right and the desire is there.  The Minister for Labour has made many efforts and has kept on top of the <Col N="290" /> situation.  I reiterate what Deputy Deasy said.  This dispute calls for urgent talks and I hope the Minister's new formula will be successful.</P>

      <P>I have not made any public statement on this matter for quite some time.  I did so in the early stages of the dispute, but I have felt since then that my intervention would not be appreciated by either side and might do more harm than good.  Perhaps a contribution at this stage could be more helpful.  I will be speaking on the lines followed by my constituency colleagues and by Deputy Mitchell.  I thank them for their support. As they rightly said, we have to be careful that we do not inflame the situation any further by what we say here.</P>
      <P>I too should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, for the tremendous job he is doing in this area.  I should like to assure the Minister that his efforts are appreciated by the workers in Waterford Glass who know he is working hard to try to find a solution to this dispute.</P>
      <P>I too could refer to what has given rise to his dispute, but I do not want to give a history lesson to anybody here.  The past is over and we must now look to the future.  The future looks very bleak for Waterford, its hinterland and Dungarvan. Not only are the 3,200 jobs in Waterford Crystal at stake but other jobs are at stake also.  The loss of 7,000 jobs would be catastrophic in a place the size of Dublin, which has one third of the population, but the loss of 7,000 jobs in Waterford could wipe the town off the map.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only lately the workforce have begun to realise that there is an alternative; I have believed this for quite some time.  If Czechoslovak expertise was brought into Waterford in the fifties to start the glass <Col N="290" /> industry, and there is still a glass industry in that country, then the expertise must still be there.  With the breaking down of the barriers in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia is both a commercial and viable area for the production of glass. However, I am confident that the Minister's further proposals will be accepted by both sides.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all concerned to fully consider these proposals, to give them a chance and to get around the table and start talking.  The Minister is not talking about solving the dispute at present; he is trying to get the two sides together. Nothing will be solved if they do not come together.  I appeal to everybody concerned in this dispute to come together to discuss the nitty gritty.  It will be absolutley catastrophic for Waterford if this company closes down.  Indeed, the consequences of its closure will be felt nationally as it is one of the most important indigenous industries in Ireland.  This company must not be let die.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me this opportunity to add the voice of The Workers' Party to the appeal to both sides in this dispute to come to the negotiation table without delay. During my 15 years as a trade union official I have experienced some difficult trade disputes but no industrial dispute in the history of this State could have such major and far reaching implications as the one at Waterford Crystal.  I know the workers have very strong feelings about some recent decisions which have been taken by management &mdash; indeed management stand condemned out of their own mouths &mdash; but the absolute priority at this time is to start negotiating towards a resolution of this dispute.  I hope, as Deputy O'Shea said, that management will not take any new decisions which are likely to make that process more difficult.  Talks can solve this dispute no matter how intractable they are whereas if there are no talks then most certainly there will not be a solution. No party in this House wants to see the disaster which could happen at Waterford and I am quite sure that the workforce <Col N="290" /> most of all do not want to see that situation come about.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their supportive remarks.  The new proposals contain amendments to Sunday's proposals and take into account the views which were expressed by Members of this House and by people from Waterford who have gone to a lot of trouble to speak to me and my officials during the past few days.  I cannot make these new proposals public because I have given a commitment to the unions and the management not to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea asked about the action taken by the company.  One of the reasons I put forward new proposals and worked long and hard during the past few days is that an international meeting is being held tomorrow and many things were said on the ground by the people in Waterford Crystal which could be regarded as true.  However, I am assured that nothing will happen at tomorrow's board meeting.  I am glad to be able to give that assurance to everybody interested in the dispute.</P>
      <P>I also want to thank the Bishop of Waterford, the business people of Waterford, the Mayor of Waterford, the various groups involved and, in particular, the Deputies and Labour spokesmen for the various parties who have been very supportive over the past few days.</P>
      <P>I think what Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Deasy &mdash; who put it straighter than anyone else &mdash; were saying is that there is a view that the company will not close down and that in some way this is all a bluff.  I am not one to cry wolf &mdash; and I do not think the Deputies who have spoken here tonight would either &mdash; but I am aware more than most of all the agendas, and perhaps some hidden agendas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in reply to a question from Deputy Mitchell at Question Time today it is only right that we have an obligation to be very straight and frank about this issue.  If either side involved plays with the dispute they will be playing with fire. There are international managers <Col N="290" /> involved who perhaps do not understand our industrial relations and do not want to; even if they did try perhaps they would not understand them.  That is a reality of life.  I appreciate the efforts made by Mr. Charles Douglas and Mr. John Freeman and their officials.  In case there is any misunderstanding about the management position, Mr. Paddy Byrne, the managing director of Wedgewood-Waterford Glass, flew to Dublin and explained to me how serious the dispute is.  I conveyed the confidential data he gave me to the unions so that they would know the precise position.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter and for the extra time you have given us.  However, we are quickly running out of time.  All Members are asking both sides to go back to the negotiating table.  I have no doubt that both sides could say that the new proposals do not contain all they would like, but they will have ample time during the negotiations to make those points.</P>
    <P>With regard to a question I was asked today by the people of Waterford, it will be the conciliation service of the Labour Court who will be involved and it will be the chairman of the court, in conjunction <Col N="290" /> with me, who will pick the most senior members.  However, I will be glad to accept his judgment of the best people to be involved and I believe he will pick the best people because of the difficulties involved.  All the other institutions of the State on the labour side will be glad to help out in whatever way they can.</P>
    <P>Like the other Members who have spoken, I appeal to both sides to get back to the negotiating table quickly and to argue whatever points are in dispute.  If any more time is lost in this dispute it will end up like other disputes where people write books about them afterwards.  This is probably the last chance I will have to publicly appeal to both sides to accept these proposals as quickly as possible and to get down to negotiation, which is another hard day's work.  I should like to thank everybody who contributed to this debate.</P>

      <P>The amount allocated to my Department for grant assistance towards emigrant welfare services was doubled from £250,000 in 1988 to £500,000 in 1989 and has been maintained at that level for 1990 despite the critical Exchequer situation. Grants from that allocation for voluntary organisations which provide welfare services for Irish emigrants to Britain are made on the advice of DÍON, the London <Col N="105" /> based committee which advise me on emigrant welfare matters generally.</P>
      <P>There are no funds at my disposal, other than the DÍON allocation, for the making of such grants.  Applications for grant assistance far exceed the amount available to me.</P>
      <P>As I intimated in a reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 20 February 1990, DÍON are not in favour of providing grants for projects involving a capital element.  This has been clearly stated in its guidelines for grant applications. Indeed, I understand that many voluntary emigrant welfare groups also take the view that funding of capital costs of hostel accommodation should, properly, be the responsibility of the relevant local authority, they share DÍON's view that the response of the Irish Government to the problem of homelessness among Irish emigrants should not have the effect of relieving local statutory bodies in Britain of their responsibilities towards the accommodation needs of homeless people in their area.  Accordingly the DÍON Committee have sought to encourage the proper co-ordination of activity between the statutory bodies and Irish community based organisations.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I am not in a position to make a special grant available as proposed by the Deputy.  I would also be reluctant to interfere with DÍON's function to determine their priorities and guidelines for grant purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following detailed and prolonged examination of the whole matter raised in this question, I have concluded that it would not be feasible to make regulations on the lines suggested to extend the scope of the 1984 Act to so-called informal insolvencies.  There are a number of issues involved which could give rise to difficulties.  The main reason, however, for my decision is that I have received legal advice to the effect that it would not be feasible by regulation to extend and implement any definition of employer's insolvency beyond those categories set out in section 1 (3) of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  Primary legislation would be necessary for that purpose.</P>
      <P>To illustrate further the problem involved, it has been established in the course of the examination which has taken place that any extension of the definition of an employer's insolvency could not be implemented solely for the purpose of payments due to employees under the 1984 Act.  An employer could not be deemed to be insolvent for one limited purpose only without reference to wider implications.  This brings the whole matter into the area of general legislation governing insolvency, which is obviously very complex.</P>
      <P>Another major difficulty would be in determining which particular employers falling outside the existing definition set out in section 1 (3) of the 1984 Act were genuinely insolvent.  This is the sort of decision which under present legislation relating to insolvencies is a matter for the courts.  It would not be appropriate or feasible to provide for such determination to be made by way of regulations to be implemented by the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>The reasons stated in the question for the inability of certain employees to benefit under the 1984 Act are based on misunderstanding and oversimplification of insolvency law and of the functions and powers of my Department in relation to the institution of insolvency proceedings.</P>

      <P>The Charter will be implemented through an action programme drawn up by the Commission in accordance with its right of initiative under the Rome Treaty.  I expect that the first group of proposals arising from that action programme will be transmitted to the Council late in the Irish Presidency.  These will include two draft directives &mdash; on atypical forms of employment and the adaptation of working time &mdash; on which the Commission has concluded or is concluding discussions with the social partners in a new procedure just instituted.  Assuming the Commission proposals are available before the end of the Irish Presidency, we will initiate work on them and seek to <Col N="112" /> advance them as far as possible.  It will not be feasible, however, to bring any of the proposals to a conclusion in the very limited time that will be available for their consideration before the end of our term of office.</P>
      <P>During the Irish Presidency, I have been emphasising that the action programme should be completed by the end of 1992 to coincide with the target date for the completion of the Internal Market.  To that end, I have been concerned to give an initial impetus to the work on the implementation of the Charter through the Commission's action programme and at my initiative, a timetable for the presentation and processing of priority proposals to give effect to the Charter was agreed with the Commission and the two succeeding Presidencies.  I am confident that this will help to ensure that the momentum for action is maintained.</P>
      <P>In the wider perspective of the social dimension, the Irish Presidency has been giving priority to the development of a Community programme of action in favour of the long-term unemployed and I expect that a Presidency resolution on that subject will be adopted by the Social Affairs Council on 29 May.  I look forward to the adoption at next week's Council of other Community measures concerned with vocational training, safety and health and other employment related matters &mdash; in all the outcome of a very successful Irish Social Affairs Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I think the record should be set straight.  Sixty thousand jobs were created in the last two years.  Even when job losses are taken into account, this is a very satisfactory performance when compared to net job losses of 76,000 in the period 1980-87.  From 1980-87, unemployment rose by 146,000.  In the last two years, there has been a substantial fall in <Col N="114" /> unemployment to the present level of 221,100 seasonally adjusted from a figure of 250,500 in April 1987.</P>
      <P>All the indications are that there will be even further improvements in the employment situation in 1990.  I expect the live register to fall by about 10,000 and emigration to slow down.</P>
      <P>This is a remarkable turn-around in a relatively short period of time and much of it is due to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  I would be the first to admit that much remains to be done.  Relevant studies are being undertaken by the NESC.  I have no doubt that employment levels and employment creation will form an important agenda item in the negotiation of any further programme.</P>

      <P>The employment regulation order made by the catering joint labour committee covers part-time and full-time workers in most fast-food establishments throughout the State, except the County Boroughs of Dublin and Cork and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>The ERO made under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, fixes statutory rates of pay and regulates statutory conditions of employment of workers in catering establishments who are engaged in the preparation of food or drink, or the service of food or drink, or in work incidental to the preparation and service of food in a catering establishment.  There is provision in the ERO for the payment of part-time and casual workers on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis.</P>
      <P>It is open to any trade union or organisation claiming to be representative of any class, type or group of workers to apply to the Labour Court to have the employment regulation order with respect to the catering industry extended to those areas currently excluded.</P>
      <P>There are at present no joint labour committees for the retail trade. However, a registered employment agreement exists in this area which covers wholesale or retail establishments in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire whose business is the sale of footwear, clothing, headgear, drapery or haberdashery.  This registered employment agreement sets out minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment of workers in establishments affected by the agreement. There is provision in the REA for the payment of part-time and casual workers on a <i>pro-rata basis.</i></P>

    <P>Parties to an employment agreement <Col N="117" /> who are substantially representative of the appropriate workers and employers can apply to the Labour Court to have that employment agreement registered with the court.

The total area involved is approximately 3,700 hectares and includes part or all of the following townlands: Brockagh, Seven Churches (or Camaderry), Lugduff, Conavalla, Baravore, Camenbuloge, Ballinafunshoge, Ballyboy, Derrybawn.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 47, 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The Phoenix Park Management Plan, launched in 1986, identified traffic as being the major constraint to the management of the property as a national historic park and set up measures to reduce the impact of the vehicles on the amenity values of the park.  Of these measures the following have been achieved to date: closure of some minor roadways to through traffic in order to reduce the number of junctions to the main road and to bring land masses together for the enjoyment of the public; closure of White's Gate during morning peak hours; delineation of the main road &mdash; including the narrowing of the carriageway width; reduction of speed limit from 40 mph to 30 mph; restoration of the gas lighting system on the main road; and relocation of the Phoenix Monument to centre of the main road.</P>
      <P>When permission is granted to any organisation to run an event which involves road closure the Office of Public Works insist that the organisation erect notices at the gates to inform the public of traffic restrictions.  One of these organisations omitted to erect such signs on a number of occasions recently.  The matter has been taken up with them to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
      <P>The present road improvement schemes outside the park will, when completed, offer alternative routes to commuters and the Office of Public Works' traffic management strategy for the park will take theses factors into account.  In the meantime, traffic on the main avenue will be kept under review but I would not foresee any further major changes, such as a roundabout at Mountjoy Cross, until the commissioners have had time to fully assess how the new arrangement at the Phoenix Cross works.</P>
      <P>It would be incongruous to have a higher speed limit on the main avenue of a national historic park than pertaining on the main roads at each end.  A mobile park ranger force will be established this year and one of their main tasks will be to prevent speeding in the park.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 54, 55 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending approval and a decision by the EC on the proposals to extend and reclassify our disadvantaged areas and in line with the practice followed in the case of previous reviews, I cannot disclose which areas in particular are proposed <Col N="122" /> for designation or for reclassification nor can I give any details of what appeals system might be approved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question put by Deputy Boylan, however, I can say that all lands in both Cavan and Monaghan are already classified as disadvantaged. In relation to the family income question put by Deputy Leonard, I can confirm that the average family farm income per male farm worker in an area related to a national average, that this national average was calculated from figures accepted by the EC and that the net margins used in assessing the incomes derived from different farm enterprises in the course of last year's survey corresponded to those used in compiling the national average.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, I can state that I am very pleased with the outcome of the fourth review of our disadvantaged areas.  It should lead to the designation of about two million acres as disadvantaged and to the reclassification of about 1.55 million acres and should produce the largest single extension and largest single reclassification of our disadvantaged areas to date.  Given this very satisfactory result, I shall be making every effort to obtain early EC approval of the extension/reclassification now being proposed by Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community's 20 per cent shortfall in sheepmeat is made up by imports from third countries.  These imports are subject to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and are regulated under voluntary restraint agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under GATT arrangements third country supplies of sheepmeat have free <Col N="123" /> access to the Community market subject to a 20 per cent duty.  On the setting up of the common organisation of the market on sheepmeat in 1980 the Community negotiated agreements with all the main suppliers including New Zealand, under which it was agreed to limit supplies in return for a reduction in the duty to 10 per cent.  The voluntary restraint agreement concluded on 25 September 1989 between the Community and New Zealand was a renegotiation of the original agreement and was the culmination of protracted negotiations which has an impact on other commodities and has implications under GATT arrangements.</P>
    <P>During these negotiations I was successful in ensuring maximum protection for the Irish producer while at the same time respecting our international obligations. Under the terms of the voluntary restraint agreement with New Zealand, Ireland and France have been designated sensitive zones to which quantitative restrictions apply.  Under these arrangements New Zealand could issue voluntary restaint agreement export certificates up to a maximum of 450 tonnes in 1989 and 540 tonnes in 1990.  However, in 1989 the total volume of New Zealand exports to Ireland amounted to only 30 tonnes and to date in 1990 to 86 tonnes.  As Ireland's production of sheepmeat in 1989 exceeded 58,000 tonnes, the limited quantity of imports from New Zealand was not significant.</P>
    <P>In the overall Community context, New Zealand agreed to reduce its annual quota by 40,500 tonnes to 205,000 tonnes and within that quantity, for the first time accepted a ceiling on fresh meat exports. In return, the Community agreed to reduce the import levy from the 10 per cent in the original agreement to zero.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the current difficulties being encountered by Irish lamb producers due to a fall in market prices but I am glad to note some recovery has occurred in the last week or so.  The drop in prices is due to a number of factors including the advantage to British lamb exports to the French market caused by <Col N="124" /> the drop in the value of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the French franc, the lower level of clawback on British lamb exports and increased slaughterings both here and in Britain.  The 1990 ewe premium will compensate Irish producers for income loss sustained this year.  Total ewe premium payments this year, including payments in respect of the 1989 as well as about 60 per cent of the 1990 premiums, should exceed £130 million.</P>
    <P>Córas Beostoic agus Feola will continue their vigorous efforts to promote the consumption of Irish lamb on domestic and European markets.  Efforts will continue to ensure that the considerable marketing achievements in securing a top quality profile for Irish lamb on continental markets will be maintained.</P>

      <P>Employment under the social employment scheme is insurable for occupational injuries benefit purposes only, and, accordingly, is liable for PRSI contributions at Class J rate of 2.75 per cent of earnings.  This rate consists of 2.25 per cent (representing the health contribution and the employment and training levy) from the employee, and 0.5 per cent (representing the occupational injury element) from the employer.  For holders of medical services cards, the employee liability of 2.25 per cent transfers to the employer.</P>
      <P>On the introduction of the social employment scheme, it was recognised that participants under the scheme could, in certain circumstances, be insurable at the standard class A rate of PRSI contribution. However, to encourage participation in the scheme, and to minimise the contribution liability of sponsoring employers, employment under the scheme was deemed by statute to be insurable for occupational injuries benefit only, as outlined above.</P>
      <P>Any change by way of reducing the existing contribution liability or exempting particular sponsoring employers would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Juvenile liaison officers are members of the Garda Síochána and I am informed by the Garda authorities that the facilities necessary for the proper functioning of the juvenile liaison officer scheme are being afforded to it.  Juvenile liaison officers are provided with separate office accommodation at the Garda stations to which they are attached and the stations' clerical and other back-up services are available to them.  They maintain contact with social service agencies and health boards as appropriate.  Juvenile liaison officers are paid an allowance and they are entitled to travel and subsistence allowances on the same basis as other members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The report of a working party which was set up by the Garda authorities to review the operation of the juvenile liaison officer scheme is currently being considered by the Garda authorities.

      <P>The provision of resources for the operation of the library service is the responsibility of the library authorities. In the case of expenditure incurred by such authorities on loan or leasing charges for library purposes, subsidy, at a rate of up to 50 per cent is payable by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna on foot of claims submitted by library authorities. The amount paid in specific library subsidy for the Dublin area in 1989 was £405,736.  The amount payable in 1990 will depend on the level of subsidisable costs arising.  This, of course, is in addition to the assistance afforded by the rate support grant towards the expenditure of the local authorities generally.</P>
      <P>With regard to staffing, the allocation of staffing to the various local authority programme areas and the recruitment of staff where necessary is a matter for determination by each local authority manager within overall numbers employed at the end of 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to signposting on non-national routes. Since 1987, grants have been allocated to a number of county councils under a programme of destination signposting of regional roads in areas of high tourist amenity.  In 1990, grants totalling £75,000 have been allocated to three local authorities.</P>
      <P>This destination signposting programme forms part of an ongoing integrated programme of both destination and amenity signposting in various areas, based on recommendations made by the County and City Managers' Association and Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>The question of the provision of such a grant to Tipperary (South Riding) County Council will be borne in mind when the 1991 allocations are being determined, having regard to the overall priorities under the signposting programme. It is open to the local authority to use the discretionary grants for non-national roads paid annually by my Department, to supplement expenditure from their own resources on the provision of such signposting.</P>

    <P>Expenditure figures for Northern Ireland are denominated in pounds sterling.  The expenditure figures for Northern Ireland are calculated on an April to March financial year.  Hence the Northern Ireland figures labelled &ldquo;1989&rdquo; refer to the financial year April 1989 to March 1990, and similarly the 1990 figures refer to the financial year which began on 1 April 1990.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Health Promotion facilitate co-ordination of health promotion policies on an intersectoral basis.  Numerous bilateral meetings have taken place.  The committee have met in plenary session on two occasions.  I have been able to use these meetings to discuss important health-related issues with my ministerial colleagues. These arrangements have worked very well, particularly in relation to the development of school programmes, issues relating to environmental and occupational health as well as agriculture.  For example, the bilateral contact with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food resulted in the establishment of the Food Safety Advisory Committee in 1989.  This committee have a major role in the protection of public health and have already submitted a number of important reports relating to food irradiation and lysteria.</P>
      <P>The various recommendations of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion in the areas of nutrition, tobacco, alcohol, accidents and exercise have significant implications for other Government Departments and require very good co-operation with the Department of Health.  The existence of the arrangements for ministerial meetings both in the context of the Cabinet sub-committee and bilaterally ensures that such co-operation is the closest possible.</P>

      <P>The present position with regard to capital grant applications is that in 1989 the Government decided to amalgamate the lottery funded capital grant scheme and the amenity grant scheme operated by the Department of the Environment into a single scheme. Under the new arrangements, the Minister for the Environment will allocate grants to projects recommended by local authorities who will also be responsible for processing the applications.</P>
      <P>As there are no funds available to my Department under this scheme any capital grant applications should be forwarded to the relevant local authorities for consideration under the new scheme.</P>
