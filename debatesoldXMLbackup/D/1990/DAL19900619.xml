      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the initiatives he intends taking, in his capacity as President of the European Council, following the recent publication of the United Nations Report on Global Warming; if a procedure of a beneficial nature exists which can be followed; if Ireland is in a position to initiate any such procedures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the report of 25 May 1990 of Working Group I (Scientific <Col N="2" /> Assessment of Climate Change) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</P>
      <P>This report is one of three parts of an overall report which is to be published in Advance of the Second World Climate Conference, which takes place in Geneva from 29 October to 7 November 1990. That conference will be particularly significant in that it should initiate the formal negotiations for a Global Climate Convention and associated Protocols which, hopefully, can be agreed and signed at the World Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of climate change and the role which the Community can play in helping to deal with it were discussed by Environment Ministers at their Council meetings in March and June this year <Col N="3" /> with a view to developing the strongest united Community position on this issue in preparation for the Second World Climate Conference later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the widespread concern that has been expressed in relation to this issue which seems to be based on fairly sound scientific evidence, will the Taoiseach not agree that in his capacity as President of the European Council, Europe should be seen to give a lead in this area also?  Having regard to the fact that the British Prime Minister has spent some time referring to this general issue recently, will he not agree that it would be opportune for him to become involved as a European in that area now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Well, I am involved fully and so is the Minister for the Environment.  The Community has taken this whole issue aboard and, as I said, two Environmental Council meetings have discussed it with a view to arriving at a Community position.  One of the main objectives of our Presidency policy at the moment is to have a co-ordinated Community position on all these global issues.  I hope to take that further at the forthcoming Summit in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there specific problems which have been identified in relation to which there are specific remedies which could now be highlighted and put into operation, thus eliminating some of the problems we might have to face in ten years time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are.  The problems are fairly well identified.  This panel have given a very good scientific assessment of the position and on the basis of that assessment and other similar type of scientific reports and investigations, what must be done is fairly clear.  It is just a question now of getting co-ordinated international action.  That is the purpose of the forthcoming conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not <Col N="4" /> agree that Ireland should set itself the target of stabilising emissions of CO² by the year 2005 as many other Community countries have done?  Can he assure the House that we will not be seeking derogation in some ways from this, given that so many underdeveloped countries will be asked to make an effort here? Finally, can he indicate the proportion of Ireland's land mass that would be vulnerable if there was an 80 cm rise in the sea level by the year 2030 as is predicted that would threaten our offshore islands as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no particular problem with the target mentioned by the Deputy.  I am not aware of the situation with regard to our land mass but I will ask to have that calculation made and supplied to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have made the Environment a priority item during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Communities. It is my intention to have a Declaration on the Environment agreed at next week's meeting of the European Council.  I envisage that this declaration will cover a wide range of issues and will lead to an acceleration of effort by the Community to deal with problems besetting its own environment and to promote concerted action to deal with global problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach made an effort to refer to the issue of nuclear safety in his environmental statement?As he probably knows, it is being handled by the club of Energy Ministers at the moment who effectively veto any realistic moves in this area.  Does he feel there is scope for Ireland in its role as <Col N="5" /> President to raise the level of concern about nuclear safety through this environment statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, I believe, a role for Ireland in that area and we are following that up, but I prefer to keep it separate from the Declaration on the Environment at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that as long as the issue of nuclear safety is handled by a club of Energy Ministers, more than half of whom are committed to nuclear capacity, this issue will not get the sort of attention non-nuclear countries such as Ireland believe it deserves?  Does he not also agree that this issue has to be considered at Heads of State level if we want to get real movement in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been doing that and I should like to point out to the Deputy that the disclosure of the appalling situation in regard to nuclear installations in Central and Eastern Europe has brought a new dimension to the problem which I think has concentrated people's minds a bit more than perhaps was the case up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An exhibition of geological material from the national collection was on display during 1989 at the National Museum premises in Merrion Row.  Prior to that period, the exhibition travelled to a number of exhibition centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A more extensive and representative exhibition is currently being prepared which will incorporate material which has not been seen publicly since the 1950s.  It is planned that this exhibition will open later this year and will continue during 1991 as part of the Dublin City of Culture programme.</P>
      <P>The policy of the museum is to mount such exhibitions while transferring the full collection from Daingean to accommodation at Beggars Bush which is being specially adapted and where scholars can have access to the collection in due course.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's positive response to my question. I take it that he agrees the geological collection, in particular, is of educational value to our schoolgoing population.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it may be reasonable on occasions to impose modest charges, with appropriate exceptions, for special exhibitions in the National Museum to provide additional resources to meet exceptional costs and to promote and advertise the exhibitions, so that attendances are increased.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows there are special times, for example, some free days, some free hours, and special categories of people such as pensioners and so on.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Formulation of a further programme to succeed the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is essentially a matter for the Government and the social partners.  I am sure that any recommendations by the Irish Episcopal Conference on Emigration or by other bodies will be taken into account by all concerned in formulating a new programme.</P>
      <P>While emigration is, on the basis of the latest information, falling as a result of the success of the existing programme it is still unacceptably high and its reduction must be a key objective in any new programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that over 300,000 of our young people have emigrated since 1983 and the warning by the NESC in their report that even if our economy improves it will still take some time before the factors incurred in emigration disappear, does the Taoiseach not agree that there should be a legitimate voice for this large section of our population in the formulation of the next programme for national recovery?

We have, after all, 50,000 teachers between primary, post-primary and third level and they are at the conference table; we have 121,000 full-time farmers who are very much at the conference table; we have 57,000 employers who are at the conference table.  As Deputy Deenihan rightly says, since 1983 over 300,000 people, or in the past ten years over 500,000 people, have fled this island and have a legitimate aspiration to come back and, in some cases, would bring back much expertise and finance. It might be well worth while, before the final components are put together, to look at the possibility of having them at the table by right.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is a practical proposal.  The whole purpose of the first programme and of the second programme is to bring emigration to an end, to create employment opportunities at home and to create a situation here where emigrants will be enabled to return and find employment and even, as the Deputy says, return with new skills.  That is the whole purpose of the exercise.  As I said, the first programme has succeeded to some extent in achieving both those objectives.  The purpose of the second programme is to accentuate and accelerate that process.  We must, however, have structured discussions.  The original format was a success.  I cannot see how anybody who wishes to have an input into <Col N="12" /> the discussions will not find some way of doing it.  In fact, I will look at it to see if there is any way in which the mechanisms could be improved to make sure that every individual or group who wish to have an input into the discussions can do so.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in this House on 14 February last, the Government hope that all social partners will participate in negotiations on a further programme.  Since the current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is operative until the end of this year, discussions on a new programme will not commence until later this year.</P>
      <P>The current programme has been an outstanding success in correcting the grave imbalances in the public finances while restoring growth to the economy, reducing unemployment and increasing employment, raising living standards through real increases in take home pay and in long-term social welfare benefits, improving our international competitiveness through lower inflation and a stable exchange rate, and substantially lowering personal income tax rates.</P>
      <P>I am sure, therefore, that there will be widespread support for a new programme which will enable us successfully and in partnership to continue the transformation in economic and social conditions brought about by the current programme.</P>

      <P>Stringent security measures have been introduced in recent times to safeguard National Library material.  These measures are those recommended to minimise the problem of theft which is common to all libraries. The extent of any thefts from the National Library cannot be accurately assessed at this time.  As I indicated to the House on 12 December last, it is proposed in future to close the National Library annually to the public for one month to enable stocktaking to be undertaken in accordance with normal practice in such libraries.  That exercise will commence next November.</P>
      <P>The Director of the National Library has already had some success in having removed material returned and has recommended that, in order to facilitate the further recovery of removed material, an amnesty should be introduced.Arrangements are being made for announcing this and for providing a book drop in the main hall of the National Library.  I would appeal to anybody who may have relevant material in their possession to return these valuable items of our heritage to the National Library as soon as possible.</P>

I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he will consider, yet again, a briefing for the Leaders of the Opposition parties in the House as has been done for all leaders of the parties, and others, in Northern Ireland?

I shall have to consider, as the talks proceed, his other request.

      <P>In relation to the latter point, I should like to emphasise to the Taoiseach that I feel at a certain disadvantage in relation to the dissemination of information.  It appears that all parties in Northern Ireland, and a good number of politicians in England, have been briefed on what is happening. It is not helping things when at weekends different statements are issued by politicians who are members of the same party.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach to consider briefing us on a confidential basis.  In an effort to get the support of Opposition parties for what is happening, and obviously that is very important, he should consider holding at an early date a meeting with the leaders of the Opposition parties, something that is long overdue.</P>

      <P>I can do that, of course, <Col N="22" /> but the situation is different.  Briefings, in the sense that the Deputy has referred to, are not taking place.  The Secretary of State is conducting totally separate discussions and dialogue with the different parties in Northern Ireland.  That is what the process is and there is no question of briefing anybody.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that the Secretary of State is discussing matters with some parties and briefing other parties but I do not think that is as important as the fact that the leaders of the parties in this House should be aware of what is going on.  They should be given some indication of the outline, at least, of what is being proposed in order to avoid making insensitive statements, as were made by some party people in Northern Ireland in recent times.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Taoiseach to consider strongly briefing parties in the House.  He had discussions with the Prime Ministers of the various members of the European Community on the question of sanctions on South Africa.  The indication in today's newspapers is that support for sanctions is falling away.  In view of the Taoiseach's trips to the various capitals of Europe, will he confirm that that is the position and if there is still a strong demand from the people of South Africa that sanctions should be maintained?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that support for sanctions is falling away and it is not the position as I understand or assessed it.  I naturally discussed it as I went round the capitals and I have already indicated that there are different emphases in various capitals about the matter.  I think that the general view among all the leaders of the Community is that they want to do the right thing. There is a public debate going on as to what should happen; one school of thought is that we should express encouragement, approval and support for what President de Klerk is attempting to achieve but that it is too early to consider a move on sanctions.  Other views held <Col N="23" /> are that the process is so important that President de Klerk should be given some positive indication of our support.  That is the state of play at the moment and I am sure the matter will come up for a substantial discussion at the Dublin Summit.  I do not wish at this stage to pre-empt the outcome but the Deputy knows my position &mdash; and that of the Irish Government &mdash; in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is to be a doubling of the EC Structural Funds for the less-developed regions of the Community over the period to 1993. Ireland has already been allocated over £2.8 billion and, with further allocations to come from Community initiatives, we are likely to get about £3 billion in total. Discussions on economic and monetary union are still at a very preliminary stage. The need for regional policies to assist the process of convergence is recognised and Ireland will continue to press for special attention to the problems of the <Col N="26" /> less developed and more peripheral regions of the Community in the context of economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of Community dialogue and discussion, we have continued to emphasise that despite the greater convergence of economic policies which is already taking place, problems are still likely to arise from the fact that different countries are at different stages of development.  Greater integration will benefit the Community generally but we cannot be sure that these benefits will be evenly distributed.  The Delors report itself acknowledged that if sufficient consideration were not given to regional imbalances, the economic union would be faced with grave economic and political risks.  This analysis was also endorsed in the report prepared by the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
      <P>Both the Commission and my EC colleagues are fully aware of Ireland's concerns in this area.  The Commission will be publishing a detailed study on EMU later this year.  I would hope that this study will pay particular attention to the regional distribution of the costs and benefits of EMU.</P>

The Minister referred to Structural Funds but, apart from the fact that Structural Funds to a large extent are being wasted on current expenditure, will the Minister give an estimate of how much of this gap in living standards he expects these funds to close between now and 1993?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the various <Col N="27" /> Community fora it has been made clear to our colleagues that EMU must be considered in its totality, not just in terms of the undoubted benefits which are likely to accrue, but also in terms of the possible costs.  We have argued that it is vitally important, for the stability of the union, that net benefits should be distributed in a manner which is consistent with the Community's objective of greater economic and social cohesion.  This objective is, of course, enshrined in Article 130 of the Single European Act.  We have also taken the view that our approach for now should be to firmly articulate our concerns within the framework of Community discussion and dialogue and in that way we can present our arguments in favour of measures to promote cohesion in the context of the overall development of all Community policies.</P>
      <P>We would be pleased if EMU were to be as beneficial for all regions as some would contend.  However, we will be working to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to provide support should this favourable scenario fail to manifest itself.  The Deputy should be aware that, at the informal ECOFIN meeting held at Ashford Castle in the last days of March, the Commission published a document on economic and monetary union and on the economic rationale and design of the system.  We were unhappy with that section of the paper which dealt with the costs and benefits of the EMU and expressed our unhappiness in very forceful terms.  We urged the Commission to pay greater attention to the regional distribution of the costs and benefits of EMU in the detailed study which they will carry out later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could predict at any stage what will be the full impact of the Structural Funds.  We are moving from a position of £361 million in 1988, to £462 million in 1989, to £557 million in 1990, representing an increase in nominal terms of 54 per cent.  The Commission will be carrying out a study of what impact those Structural Funds will have, which study will be available by the end of 1990, when <Col N="28" /> it will become clearer how much the gap is being narrowed by the Structural Funds which was the primary objective when introduced.</P>

Furthermore, would he not agree there is a danger that the relative positions, so far as the living standards of ourselves and our partners in the EC are concerned, will become frozen as soon as economic and monetary union is achieved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should listen.  As I said, the Structural Funds represent the first set of funds put in place in an endeavour to bring about the convergence we all wish to see happen and desire.  When we ascertain what will be their impact, then we will be looking beyond the Structural Funds, and this will take us as far as 1993.  Within the context of EMU we have already suggested that the solution may lie &mdash; depending on what the then gap will be &mdash; in expanding the Community budget and providing additional resources in that regard.  But it would be totally imprudent to go any further than that at this stage until the Commission has established to everybody's satisfaction what will be the impact of the present Structural Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 32 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The issuing of instructions to customs and excise staff is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  However, I am advised by the commissioners that instructions were issued to customs and excise staff following the European Court's ruling on Ireland's 48-hour rule. Staff have been instructed to continue to operate and enforce the 48-hour rule restrictions until further notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, travellers who have not been outside the State for 48 hours can import dutiable goods only on payment of the appropriate duty.  Travellers who have been outside the State for 48 hours or more as heretofore, will, qualify for their full allowance entitlements.  In the immediate aftermath of the European Court's decision customs staff were allowed to exercise some discretion &mdash; as is normal &mdash; where they were reasonably satisfied that travellers had genuinely acted on the assumption that the 48 hours <Col N="30" /> restriction had been removed.  This discretion no longer applies.</P>
    <P>As the 48-hour rule continues in place for the time being, the question of damage to employment in the Border counties as a result of the European Court ruling does not arise.  It is because of the serious implications for this country that the Government are actively pursuing the matter with the EC Commission with a view to obtaining a mutual agreement for modified arrangements to enable Ireland to prevent the abuses and distortions of trade which had occurred up to 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, by allowing the present position to continue, he and the State are acting unlawfully, contrary to European law, which is binding in this country; that it is holding this country up to disrepute on the European scene; that it is particularly relevant, having regard to the fact that Ireland holds the Presidency of the EC at present, that we proceed to flagrantly flout European law, as established by the European Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that, from the moment I issued my first statement and in any other statements that emanated from the Government in relation to this, they have accepted fully the court's ruling in relation to the 48-hour rule.  I have also indicated that it is not unreasonable, in fact is entirely in keeping with EC practice, for the Government to take some time to consider the court's ruling in detail.  As I said before, discussions have begun with the Commission and other member states with a view to obtaining a mutual agreement for modified arrangements which would enable us to prevent distortions of trade which occurred prior to 1987.  Our aim is to reach an understanding with the EC as quickly as possible.Even as I speak here there is a meeting taking place in Brussels today concerning this very matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also add for the benefit of the <Col N="31" /> Deputy and the House that the Commission took the view &mdash; after the introduction of this 48-hour rule &mdash; to proceed to the European Court rather than sit down to negotiate the matter, as one might reasonably expect.  That matter was adverted to by the Advocate-General in his opinion some months ago in relation to it.  Consequently, the Commission were not in a position to sit down and have discussions with us up to the time the court ruling was made public. However, subsequent to that ruling they sat down straightaway.  Negotiations are taking place, not only with the Commission but also by way of sounding out member states as to what might be acceptable.  Recognising that the Danes do have a 48-hour rule, that there is a precedent for that derogation, what we are seeking is something similar to take us to the end of 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that court rulings and orders are meant to be obeyed, not merely to be considered by the states to which they are handed down; that the judgment is now the full effective and enforceable law in this country and that, consequently, any citizen of this country stopped by a customs and excise official and interfered with in any way, could successfully bring an action against the Minister, against the customs and excise official concerned and against the State to claim damages for an unlawful act on the part of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

      <P>There has been no change in the Government's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the semi-State sector since it agreed the Programme for Government in July 1989.  I am happy to reaffirm the Government's commitment to a viable and profitable semi-State sector and to be in a position to report that in recent years, most of the bodies in this sector have shown dynamic growth, together with substantial improvements in their profitability and financial position.  It is the Government's intention that this pattern of improvement should be maintained.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the semi-State sector is not a monolithic bloc but consists of a disparate group of organisations with different financial structures, markets and prospects.

In some instances this may mean the participation by these bodies in joint ventures with other semi-State bodies or with private sector entities.This approach is strictly consistent with the terms of the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain to the House how he considers it is consistent to maintain a position of support for a profitable and viable semi-State sector while at the same time targeting <Col N="33" /> some of the leading companies for privatisation or part privatisation, such as Irish Life, the Irish Sugar Company, Irish Steel, the Great Southern Hotels and so on?  Is it not ironic that these companies are among those targeted by the junior partner in Government, by citizen McDowell, when he said the achievement of this Government would be to privatise these companies in whole or in part?  Does the Minister not accept they could be the basis for large-scale development and job creation?  Therefore, why is it intended to constrain them in the fashion that, for example, it has been decided to constrain RTE?</P>

      <P>Questions in relation to communications are a matter for the Minister for Communications.  The situation in regard to Irish Life is well known. I have discussed it many times with the unions concerned and indeed it has been discussed at Congress.  The most recent development in this context has been the establishment, following the meeting of ICTU with the Taoiseach, myself and other Ministers on 27 March, of a working group under the Central Review Committee.  That group was given the task of reviewing the role and contribution of State companies, economic development and job creation.  I am examining the possibilities that exist to improve the performance of State companies, including the possibilities for developing large-scale indigenous companies capable of exploiting the single European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the question of Irish Life is well known.  I have invited tenders from the outside world and I have published a Bill that will come before the Oireachtas.  Our position in that regard under the Programme for Government has not changed.  I will put again on the record of the House what was said in relation to commercial State enterprises. The Government are committed to the maintenance of a viable and profitable commercial semi-State body.  Any changes in the ownership structure of particular State companies will only take place if it is in the public interest, in the <Col N="34" /> best interests of the company and their employees and following consultation with the social partners.  The Government decided last year to restructure the Irish Life company, which was originally in the private section.  That process is in train and the options after restructuring will be further examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Taxation, which was set up in 1980, produced five reports in the period up to and including 1985 containing a wide and detailed range of recommendations for the reform of the tax structure and the administration of the tax system.  In general, the thrust of these recommendations was towards the achievement of a more equitable, simpler and more economically efficient tax system through a widening of the tax base and lower rates of tax.  I think it is generally accepted that major progress has been made, especially in the last three years, in reforming the tax system along lines consistent with the thrust of the commission's reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the income tax area, the number and level of rates has been reduced.  As part of this the standard rate of tax has been cut from 35 per cent to 30 per cent; the top rate of tax has been cut from 58 per cent to 53 per cent; the standard and 48 per cent rate tax bands have been extended significantly.  The changes have to an extent been funded by curtailment <Col N="36" /> of the reliefs, as was envisaged by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>Significant changes also have been implemented in the corporation tax code. Accelerated capital allowances have been reduced and will be phased out completely by 1992 and section 84 lending is being curtailed.  As a parallel move the standard rate of corporation tax which has already been reduced to 43 per cent from 50 per cent will be reduced to 40 per cent in 1991.  Most of the reduced rates of corporation tax, apart from the 10 per cent rate, have been abolished as was recommended by the commission. The principal objective of these changes is to reduce the bias in favour of capital in the tax code and to broaden the corporate tax base.  The ending of the export sales relief scheme with effect from April 1990 will be a further help in this regard by providing additional revenue from 1991-92 onwards.</P>
    <P>In the area of indirect tax reform the main impetus for change is, of course, now coming from the EC decision to complete the single market by 1992. Many of the Commission on Taxation's proposals on indirect taxes have in fact been overtaken by this development. This year's budget saw the start of the process of adapting our VAT rates and excise duties to those of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>A number of far-reaching reforms and improvements have also been made in the tax administration system in the past few years.  The measures in question either directly equate with recommendations of the commission or were designed to help achieve the commission's aim of a more effective tax administration system.  The key measures are: self-assessment procedures have been introduced for the self-employed, for companies and for capital acquisitions tax; a current year basis of income tax assessment for the self-employed has been introduced; a surcharge on the late submission of returns by companies and the self-employed has been implemented; the power to attach assets of tax defaulters has been granted to the Revenue Commissioners; tax clearance <Col N="37" /> certificate requirements have been introduced for public contract tenderers and applicants for grants; the 1988 tax amnesty yielded £500 million and greatly reduced tax arrears and thereby greatly improved the tax administration system; a new system of tax enforcement by sheriffs has been established and new steps have been taken to curb tax-avoidance.These changes have brought about a real improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration system, as well as an important broadening of the tax base.</P>
    <P>As regards future progress, I would point out that one of the key objectives of the Programme for Government is to reduce the standard rate of personal tax to 25 per cent by 1993 and to move towards a single higher rate of tax.</P>
    <P>Overall, as I have said, the tax reform measures adopted to date are very much in sympathy with the general approach and recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  They have resulted in reduced tax rates, they have broadened the tax base, they have reduced the incidence of tax default and they have introduced a greater degree of equity into the system.  More needs to be done, of course, and the process of reform is continuing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister has said, is it not a fact that since the first report was published in 1982, only minimal improvements have been made in reforming the tax code, and that specifically since the objectives was to introduce equity, even less improvement has been made?  Where do the Government now stand on the specific recommendation made in one of the reports, that a local property tax based on wealth and property ought to be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Deputy regards that long list of improvements I read out, mostly at achieving the objectives of many of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  As the report states, these proposals constitute a formidable programme of tax reform which could not <Col N="38" /> be carried through easily or in a short time.  I think the most important line that everybody in the House will remember is: &ldquo;The advantageous among our recommendations cannot be demanded while the palatable are rejected&rdquo;.  When we tried to make some adjustments as regards broadening the tax base, there were reactions from all the Deputies opposite.  Their initial reaction seemed to be that they want the palatable but not the unpalatable, but you cannot have your loaf and eat it.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, which has been made on proposals for harmonisation of tax and excise duties during the period of Ireland's Presidency of the EC and in ensuring that the special difficulties of Ireland in this regard are recognised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The framework agreement which was put in place at the end of last year under the French Presidency on indirect tax harmonisation does not envisage decisions until 1991 on the major issues.  Nevertheless, in the course of the Irish Presidency we have made useful progress in preparing the way for the decisions to be taken on a number of topics including the scope of the reduced VAT rate; and the harmonised rates of excise to apply to alcohol, tobacco and mineral oils.  Because of the sensitive budgetary and economic implications for all countries, progress on these issues is difficult.  However, the groundwork is being laid for resolution of the outstanding issues within the agreed timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to facilitate advance planning by both businesses and tax administrations, I have been pressing the Commission to bring forward its proposals for the VAT control arrangements to apply to imports and exports of goods when frontier controls are removed.  While the production of the proposals took longer than expected, they were formally unveiled by the Commission at the meeting of Finance Ministers which I chaired in <Col N="40" /> Luxembourg on 11 June.  We will be initiating a detailed examination of the proposals by experts later this week with a view to progressing them before handing over to our Italian colleagues.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that at that meeting of the Council of Ministers on 11 June the Irish Presidency achieved a major success in securing the agreement of the Council for a package of three corporation tax measures aimed at encouraging co-operation between companies in different member states.  The package had been under discussion among member states for some 21 years. This is recognised as a very substantial success for the Presidency and the Community in the run-up to 1992.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the budgetary difficulties posed for Ireland by indirect tax approximation, the study being undertaken by the EC Commission at my initiative is now well under way.  The study will examine and report on measures to facilitate our full participation in the process of completing the internal market.  It is hoped that the study will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that it is highly unlikely that the harmonisation of VAT and excise duties will take place by the end of 1992 and that it will not be in place for the target date of the end of 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy or anybody else could make that assumption.  It has been decided among all the Twelve member states that final decisions on VAT and customs and excise will be made by the end of 1991. That is what the agreement states. That does not rule out agreement on many aspects of it as we move towards the end of 1991.  At present the Commission's proposals on VAT and the repercussions of removing the fiscal frontiers are on the table and are being examined.Agreement on excise duties is still awaited from the Commission.  Apart from that we have been behind the scenes carrying out a lot of study and discussions <Col N="41" /> with the member states on the classification and into what rate they will fall in relation to VAT and excise.  A lot of groundwork is being done which is not noticeable at this stage.</P>

      <P>Unless I am misunderstanding the Minister what he is telling the House is that various proposals will be arrived at by the end of 1991.  That is not a statement to the effect that there will be harmonisation of all EC member states on tax, VAT and excise duties by the end of 1992.  Is the Minister seriously saying we will have harmonisation of both VAT and excise duties by the end of 1992?  In effect what impact will that have on the revenues of the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives of the single market are to achieve tax harmonisation and remove the fiscal frontiers by the end of 1992.  The position in relation to the effect that it will have on our budgetary position is being studied by the Commission with the agreement of all the members of the Council.  That study and its results should be available shortly.  At present the figure still stands at approximately £600 million as the cost to the Irish Exchequer, based on moving our VAT rates towards the UK rates&mdash; which stand at the standard rate of 15 per cent at present &mdash; taking a view on what excise duties might be in relation to the broad number of items, because excise duty is as important to the Irish Exchequer as VAT.</P>

      <P>I wish to make two points. First, in support of Deputy Dukes, I think the facts speak for themselves and, of course, the Taoiseach should reorder the Broadcasting Bill so that we can have a proper debate on it in this House. Second, it is worth recording that the Order of Business which was agreed for today at the Whips meeting of last week was as follows: at 3.45 p.m. the International Carriage of Goods by Road Bill, 1990, on which there was to be a 30 minute debate, to be followed by Committee Stage of the Pensions Bill, 1990, at 7 p.m. by Private Members' Business and at 8.30 p.m. by Report and Final Stages of the Derelict Sites Bill, 1989, to conclude by 10.30 p.m.  That is the Order of Business that was agreed by the Whips. Would the Taoiseach explain to the House why it has been changed within the last five to ten minutes?</P>

It made arrangements for dealing reasonably expeditiously with the Order of Business before us, sitting until 10.30 p.m. tonight and a number of other subsidiary arrangements.  Subsequently, we were informed by the Fine Gael Party that they do not propose to agree to that Order of Business and they have withdrawn facilitating the Government particularly with regard to pairs for Ministers who are abroad on official business.  In these circumstances, the Government decided, as the Fine Gael Party do not propose to agree to the Order of Business as agreed, that the appropriate thing to do is to recorder the Order of Business in such a way as to bring it entirely within the competence of the Government to order.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the proceedings but I want to go back over some sections of this Bill and remind the House that, as the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, said on Second Stage of the Bill, in giving the CMR the force of law in the State the Bill also makes a necessary supplementary provision aimed at protecting the public as well as property and the environment.  Article 22 of the CMR provides that a carrier is entitled to unload, destroy or render harmless dangerous goods.  Section 3 (5) of the Bill provides that a carrier must give notice to the public authorities of his intentions in dealing with dangerous goods and he is obliged to take all practical steps to prevent injury or the risk of injury to persons or damage or the risk of damage to property or the environment.</P>
      <P>I highlight those provisions because they have a great deal of relevance to politicians who represent Dublin city. The Minister acknowledges that there is to be an increased uptake in road haulage.With the anticipated increase in road haulage and trade using our road network and the resulting dangers posed by the carrying of dangerous and volatile materials by carriers particularly on our city road network, the Minister might look carefully at alternative methods of conveying these potential time bombs through built-up areas in Dublin city from their major source which is at Dublin port.  It is an unsatisfactory method and environmentally unfriendly that these massive and dangerous lorries and their loads must travel through our city streets leaving thousands of city pedestrians and commuters vulnerable and leaving property vulnerable also in the event of an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context we will have to consider for Dublin a rail link at Dublin port using <Col N="204" /> the piggy-back combined transport technique as established and used on mainland Europe.  If we are to be seen as real Europeans we should be seen to use desirable alternatives to bringing in these highly volatile loads on massive lorries trundling through our city streets making their way to their ultimate destination. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of pounds on roads like the eastern bypass or the &mdash; new term &mdash; port access route, a safe mode of conveying these goods can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Severe problems are created in Dublin by heavy goods vehicles going from the port through the city to the main road network on the city outskirts.  There is potential for the greater use of rail in this regard.  Why should containers which arrive in port by ship not be transported by rail to a central depot outside the city where they could then be collected by heavy goods vehicles or drive-on, driveoff piggy-back systems as in operation in Europe and make their way to their destination?  The rail network for this is already there.  All we need to do is simply upgrade the line.  This would take much of the freight traffic from the streets of Dublin reducing the weight of goods vehicles in the city and generally lessening damage and pollution to the environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my disappointment with Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is on record as attacking myself and the members of the Labour Party for our non-attendance because we were at a conference in Trinity College on 1 June. He challenged us to be here today.  We are here today, and it is very bad that the main Opposition party are not represented by their spokesman on Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is non-contentious legislation I will make only one comment in connection with section 3 of the Bill.  It is recognised that any legislation dealing with the international carriage of goods by road or rail at this time raises questions of the carriage of sealed toxic materials, dangerous products etc. Section 3 requires the carrier where it <Col N="205" /> is considered that he has a cargo of a dangerous category to notify the health authorities, the fire services and the local authorities.  Are we satisfied with the capacity of the three categories of services to deal with emergencies that may and can arise due to the carriage of goods not only through the city of Dublin as Deputy Byrne says, but right through the whole of this country?  In addition to ensuring that the three bodies, the health boards, the local authorities and the fire service, have the capacity to deal with any emergency, once the goods arrive and are being distributed throughout the State we should have a method of surveillance to ensure that at least every possible step is taken to make certain the safety of the community through whose areas these dangerous cargoes may be passing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my general agreement to the Bill.  The development of a road freight system is a vital component of a vibrant Community economy.  Central to the success of a transport service for goods is the development of an adequate standard of road carriageway radiating to all parts of the Community and to the very perimeters of the most far flung member states. However, one wonders how many light years away we in Ireland are from seeing mainstream arteries such as the autoroutes and autobahns of central Europe reaching from Blacklion in County Cavan to Malin Head in County Donegal, or Mizen Head in County Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Ireland's peripherality is undoubtedly a handicap in terms of our distance from the main centres of population, the sheer additional distance and the hopelessly inadequate national primary and national secondary road network underlines the extreme difficulties these areas have in attracting industry.  Such industries face additional crippling transport costs, occasioned not <Col N="206" /> alone by sheer distance but by substandard roads.  The Members of this House will have heard me time and time again drawing attention to this major problem in our country, particularly in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  I wonder when we will get around to levelling this playing field.  As we come closer to the realisation of the single European market we should be aware of the remarkable fact that an enormous population of 100 million people live within a 250 mile radius of Brussels while less than 8 million people live within the same radius of Cavan.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the development of the road freight policy envisaged in this Bill I have to confess that I would have much preferred to debate a similar Bill entitled the International Carriage of Goods by Rail Bill, 1990.  Our Community policy is far too road-based and the massive boom in freight traffic within the Community has foisted an unacceptable aggression on Community residents.It is obvious that the more we develop our road system the more we proliferate the harmful effects attendant on road transport, for example, noise, exhaust pollution and congestion.</P>
      <P>People living along road corridors are fully entitled to demand protection for their environment and Governments owe them this protection.  However, it is equally true that a solution to this problem has to be found urgently which will reconcile this right with the economic requirements of the countries concerned. An alternative to the ongoing extension of road transport is, therefore, very necessary.  This option is there in the development of railways.  The Community should look seriously at the need for a rail investment policy which would be most beneficial to the Community and promote railway systems at least on a par with the current motorway programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the mid-sixties the then Government made a major blunder in my constituency by closing down the rail link between Clones in County Monaghan and Mullingar in County Westmeath.This rail link was a major means <Col N="207" /> of transport from Monaghan to the midlands, and the hurried decision taken at that time by a so-called expert brought in to advise the Government to close down this rail link was a major disaster.  The consequences of that decision are that heavy traffic has been put on our roads which were not constructed for the heavy traffic they have to carry now.  This problem has accelerated to such an extent that it is well nigh impossible for people to make their time schedules from Donegal to Dublin or Galway and they have to pass through Counties Cavan and Monaghan.I do not know whether this rail link can be renewed.  Much of the land has been taken over by farmers and developers and the whole system has broken down.  Even though it was thought necessary at that time to close down this rail link the Government should have held onto the railway line so that it could be reopened sometime in the future.  If that rail link was there now I have no doubt that it would be opened in the morning, if not by CIE then by some private enterprise who would be prepared to take it over.</P>
    <P>While transport capacity should be increased both in quantity and quality terms thereby facilitating a transfer from road traffic to rail I believe that, while ambitious, the only way forward is by investing on a large scale in high performance rail infrastructure and terminals to combine transport.  A well integrated railway system can offer a coherent transport system and an alternative to road only transit traffic.  Such a system would safeguard the quality of life for people affected by traffic while at the same time ensure environmental protection.I appeal to the Minister to divest front lines which have not been overly trespassed upon or devastated to individuals and for Irish Rail to seriously look at the possibility of keeping these routes open, as the Community as a whole must. In the not too distant future we will see the folly of putting too much emphasis on road transport to the virtual exclusion of the rail option which must offer a far more efficient and long-term alternative.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport, Deputy Lyons, has asked me to convey his regret at not being in the House to reply to the concluding Stages of this Bill and has asked me to stand in for him, which I gladly do.  A number of points were raised during the previous day's debate which the Minister of State failed to address and I should like, out of a sense of courtesy, to refer to these.</P>
      <P>Deputies Gay Mitchell and Eric Byrne referred to the controls on the carriage of heavy or dangerous goods by road or rail.  This point was touched on again today by Deputy Byrne, Deputy Moynihan and Deputy Boylan.  As the House knows, there is already a wide range of controls in existence covering this area. The points raised by the Deputies have been noted for consideration by the Ministers concerned who are, in the main, the Ministers for Labour, the Environment, Justice, Energy and Tourism and Transport.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell asked about the date of operation of the Bill when enacted.  It is expected that in four months time or so the Bill will be in force in so far as carriage to or from the State other than to and from the UK, including Northern Ireland, is concerned and in about one year's time the Bill will be in force in so far as carriage to and from the UK, including Northern Ireland, is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State appreciates the co-operation of all Deputies in securing the passage of the Bill through the House. With regard to the points raised by the Deputies today, I should point out to Deputy Byrne that the emergency services will be on notice to deal with any emergencies which may arise.  I know of this in the context of the Asahi train which runs through County Westmeath. Local authorities have the main responsibility for these services and have very explicit and up to date emergency plans in place.  Indeed, they meet very frequently to monitor, evaluate the update their emergency plans.  These plans must <Col N="209" /> be kept up to date, and I know this is happening at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan and the other Deputies who spoke indicated their general agreement for the Bill.  Deputy Boylan's main point of debate was the imbalance and he asked why rail was not used more often.  He also said that he would like the Bill to have been a rail rather than a road Bill.  I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that a Bill to deal with the carriage of goods by rail is being prepared for Oireachtas consideration later this year.  It will apply an international rail convention, COTIF, as our law.  That is a brief encapsulation of the points raised by the Deputies today and on the previous day.</P>

      <P>I made it clear on Second Stage that it was my intention to seek a way of providing statutory requirements regarding member participation in the appointment of trustees which would be broadly acceptable to both employers and members of schemes.  Accordingly, in the light of the consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the FIE on this matter, I propose to provide by way of this amendment that the Minister for Social Welfare may by regulations grant members of a specified class or classes of funded schemes the right to select a specified number of persons to be trustees of schemes.</P>
      <P>I intend to ask the new Statutory Pensions Board, as a priority, to encourage employers on a voluntary basis to provide for member participation in the appointment of trustees with particular reference to the procedures to give effect to this which would be most acceptable to both employers and members.  This would be very much in line with the functions of the board as set out in section 10 of the Bill regarding the issuing of guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of trustees, codes of practice and standards and their implementation.</P>
      <P>I would attach particular importance in this context to the board's function with regard to encouraging the provision of appropriate training facilities for trustees.  It is also my intention to ask the board to report to me before the end of 1992 on the necessary statutory requirements in this regard.  On the basis of that report regulations will be introduced as provided for in this amendment early in 1993 which will come into force with effect from January 1994, that is, three years after the main provisions of the Bill come into force.  This is in line with the majority recommendation of the National Pensions Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> I am confident that this whole process will result in member participation in the appointment of trustees being achieved by way of consensus between employers and members.  There are two aspects to this issue which I will be asking the new pensions board to examine in particular. The National Pensions Board in their report stated that the right to member participation in the appointment of trustees should be confined to schemes with more than 50 members.  I believe that this is an arbitrary limit and I will be asking the new board to examine ways in which members of all funded schemes, irrespective of the size of the scheme, can be given rights to participate in the appointment of trustees.  While the pensions board suggested that this might only apply to schemes with over 50 members, I am asking the new board to examine ways in which the members of all the funded schemes can be given the same opportunity to participate in the appointment of trustees.</P>
    <P>I would also wish to emphasise that participation by members in the appointment of trustees does not necessarily mean that the trustees chosen have to be members of the scheme.  In fact, in most cases members may prefer to have professional trustees appointed on their behalf who would have the necessary expertise in this area.  Such trustees would be accountable to the members and such accountability could be exercised through pension committees composed of members of the schemes.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in their report stated that structures such as pension committees should be encouraged. It is not, therefore, just a question of saying that members should be able to appoint members; members should be able to appoint whom they like to be their representatives as trustees and that is what I am providing for.  I believe this approach may resolve many of the difficulties employers have in relation to the matter.  It would ensure that persons appointed would have the necessary expertise and would confine themselves to ensuring that the schemes are properly <Col N="212" /> administered in accordance with the scheme rules and the statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>Questions regarding levels of benefits and the general adequacy of the pension arrangements would be separate issues for resolution in an industrial relations context.  The appointment of professional trustees on behalf of the members is also likely to be the best approach in situations where there may be difficulty in various categories of workers in a company being able to reach agreement on what members of the scheme should be chosen for appointment as trustees.</P>

I am surprised that we will be dealing with the whole issue of member trustees as this stage.  If the change in the definition is accepted as this stage where do the other amendments put down by me and other Deputies stand?  If this amendment is passed will they automatically fall?</P>

      <P>Thank you for that.  I am immensely reassured.  I welcome the Minister's details of the changes and his thinking in relation to them.  I am a little concerned that it is still a question that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; make regulations.  He is giving himself a power and the issue is still cloudy.  I know it is the Minister's hope that in three years time he will make <Col N="213" /> such regulations.  However it would still be open to the kind of interventions that led to him not including it in the Bill as published largely because of the concerns of employers.  While giving these concerns serious attention I believe many of them are unfounded in view of the reality of the experience of member trustees on the ground.  Where schemes have member trustees, who do not have to be members of the scheme but represent the members of the scheme, they operate extremely well already; they are very successful and are an example of worker democracy in practice and I do not share the hesitancy that is still an element of the Minister's proposals in that it is not included as a right in this Bill.  It is wrong that it is not being included as a right and that it is left to a Minister to decide.  The Minister's thinking on this issue, following the Second Stage debate, is clear and he will be aware that it is our view that we should make a firm commitment in regard to the appointment of trustees. The Minister should bear in mind that many issues remain to be dealt with in the regulations such as electoral procedures and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister said that the employers' concerns were found to be valid in regard to schemes where there had been no tradition of communication. He accepted that in such instances it might be difficult to cope with a change overnight to a system of member trustees as a right and it might lead to this issue being fought out on what some employers have described as a battleground. Nobody wants to see that taking place and there is plenty of time for both sides to get to know what is involved in being a trustee of a pension fund.  Certainly, it is not an issue that should be the subject of an industrial relations dispute because everybody shares the same concern, the proper management and success of a pension fund.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has gone some distance in regard to this but I regret that he has not given us an indication of his intent.  It is clear that since the National Pensions Board reported the Minister was got at by those who were against the change and, as a <Col N="214" /> result, the Bill as drafted did not contain this proposal.  I accept that it has been included since but I am concerned that the commitment may be watered down. Three years later the Minister may feel that it is not appropriate to introduce the appropriate regulations and for that reason I would like to see this provision tied into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendments are a step forward because the original Bill failed to provide for the participation of members in the appointment of trustees and that cast a serious doubt on the stated purpose of the Bill.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with whom we had discussions, were at pains to point out that if the provision was not made obligatory the whole thrust of the Bill would be lost.  To exclude members from the limited form of participation in the management of their own pension funds would run counter to the overall thrust of the Bill.  I welcome the Minister's amendment and I commend Deputy Byrne who has produced a more positive amendment, No. 57.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current experience shows that where membership trustees exist they have proved positive and enhanced the confidence of the members of the scheme.  The existing pensions board, set up by the former Deputy Barry Desmond when he was Minister for Health, reached the conclusion after lengthy discussion that that type of regulation was necessary.  Their final recommendation took account of the point of view of employers and it also reflected that there would have to be some process for members to appoint either one of themselves or experts representing them as trustees.  In this legislation it is important that we achieve a balance between the employer and the employee.  We are concerned about the rights of employees because in many pension schemes up to now their rights were not always recognised.Certainly, their rights were not enshrined in legislation.  After many arguments, including positive contributions by some employers advocating <Col N="215" /> this process, there was a consensus that a provision should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is going down that road he is retaining a certain amount of ministerial discretion.  I accept that the parliamentary draftsman always prefers to use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall.&rdquo; For years I have listened to the argument that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is a strong word and that it is presumed that when a Bill states that a Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; do something it is presumed that he will do it.  Indeed, the Minister for Social Welfare has a good record for carrying out his promises. However, Deputy Byrne goes further in seeking to make it obligatory on the Minister, or any future Minister, to lay down guidelines in regard to funding and in regard to the election and participation of trustees.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should commence the Committee Stage debate in a proper manner.  The Minister has gone some of the way towards meeting the views of Members and of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  However, I am inclined to support amendment No. 57, tabled by Deputy Byrne, because it is more positive.  I do not have any objection to the Minister's technical amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put the cat among the pigeons and made a complex Bill more complicated by introducing the question of trustees which I had hoped would be dealt with on a later section.  I have obtained a copy of the first report of the National Pensions Board and other documents.  In practice we are talking about pensions schemes which, on the Minister's own admission, are huge in the context of the funds available.The massive sum of £10 billion &mdash; the current value of the pension funds &mdash; is accumulating rapidly as the annual contributions are £500 million and the investment income yields an annual income of £600 million.  It is a very valuable fund which is increasing as a result of annual contributions from the workers and the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody agrees that there are two <Col N="216" /> main factors involved in the accumulation of this massive sum of money.  The funds are made up of contributions from working men and women, in the main from their salaries, and the other contribution is by the employers.  Logically, therefore, the employers and the workers should have a say as trustees in the running of the scheme.  The employers and the workers should be in a position to oversee, direct and assist in the growth of these schemes, perhaps by directing investment policy.  On reading the Bill, it was a major setback to discover that employee representation is not covered in a statutory way by the Minister.  The National Pensions Board did a lot of work in this area and made recommendations and our amendments, in the main, follow the thrust of those recommendations. The failure to make provision in the Bill for the participation of members in the appointment of trustees casts serious doubt on its stated purpose, which is to introduce major reform in this area.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many workers had to proceed on the basis of the 1888 Act &mdash; I think that was the year &mdash; and we, sadly, saw former workers of H. Williams having to go to the High Court, with all the expense that entails, to remove trustees.  We never want to see a repeat of these circumstances.  Excluding members from this limited form of participation in the management of their pension funds is contrary to the overall thrust of the Bill.  Deputy Ferris made the point that where member trusteeship exists in some of the many schemes it is a positive and constructive experience which enhances workers' confidence and leads to a greater level of interest.  It is very important to recognise that when people are contributing to a pension scheme they should be involved in it.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board issued recommendations after lengthy consideration of all the arguments, including those put forward by the employers. Their final recommendation was a compromise which took account of the reservations and concerns expressed by them, which is reflected in the very <Col N="217" /> restrictive nature of the recommendations.The Minister gave fulsome praise to the National Pensions Board for their excellent work and Members on these benches agreed with his remarks. May I quote an extract from the recommendations of the board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote from page 87 of the first report of the board on the appointment of trustees:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this report a member trustee is a trustee nominated by the members in accordance with the procedures set out below.  Such trustee need not be a member of the scheme and may be a corporate body.  An employer trustee is a trustee nominated by the employer &mdash; and may also be a corporate body.  When appointed the duties and responsibilities of member and employer trustees would be identical... Our conclusions on this issue were not unanimous.  We all agreed that the participation of members in the appointment of trustees is a desirable objective but we differed in our views as to whether it should be made compulsorily available for certain schemes.  A majority of Board members supported the view that the commitment of members would be improved and their long term interest best served by providing them with &ldquo;statutory rights&rdquo; in relation to the appointment of trustees.</P>
      <P>Our amendments seek to give workers the statutory right to membership by way of trusteeship of the pension schemes. They went on to say that a minority of board members, however, considered that the concept of member trusteeship should be encouraged only through voluntary agreement between employers and members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Pensions Board consist of approximately 20 talented people who are expert in their own fields.  They <Col N="218" /> had the tortuous task of familiarising themselves with the existing legislation. They recognised its inadequacy because, in many cases, the trust laws were not formulated with pensions in mind. The opposition by employers to members as trustees does not stand up and their arguments are not convincing.  I have already said that where member trustees exist the experience has been a very positive one and indeed that view has been supported by some employers.  For example, the CIF ran a very successful pensions scheme and, as a carpenter, I was for many years a member of it.  They felt that worker trustees nominated by the members of the union were very important and, as employers, they gave full support to that concept.  Indeed, all the representatives from the pensions industry supported this view, based on their own experience.</P>
    <P>I seek an amendment to the Bill which will provide for the participation of members in the appointment of trustees. I will be reverting to this now that I have been taken by surprise that we have reached this amendment so quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will realise that always I wanted there to be member trustees.  The National Pensions Board proposed that there should be member trustees but not for three years.  We are meeting that recommendation in what we are now doing.  Deputy Byrne mentioned that there are 20 members on the board but, within that 20, there are three employer members only.  On the one hand there are the trade union representatives and, on the other, the employer representatives, both directly involved. They are the two groups with which I am dealing in this regard.  I have had further discussions with both sides.  No difficulty will arise in the case of a company which has had a pensions scheme in operation for a long time and that has trustee members; there will be no difficulty at all experienced in that area.  Overall they are not compulsory schemes.  They are not something in respect of which I can stipulate statutorily: one has to have <Col N="219" /> an occupational pensions scheme, that statutorily one must have member trustees, or whatever.  We are doing what the National Pensions Board recommended which was to give them &mdash; a very competent body &mdash; extra powers.  We are appointing the type of board they wish to have created and allowing them to extend, on a voluntary basis, the participation of members as trustees, or appointment by the members of people whom they consider suitable to represent them as trustees.  There is no conflict about this.  It is a question of doing it in harmony which is what has been happening between ICTU and the employers.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was circulated there was an opportunity provided for further discussion which has taken place between employers and the trade unions.  Of course, I have had discussions with both sides.  The main concern of ICTU was that, when it came to implementing the provisions, if they were not happy with the degree of implementation after the three years, it would be possible &mdash; without amending the Act &mdash; to take appropriate action.  They accept the bona fides of the present and successive Governments. They said they would like to see me take power in this Bill, by regulation to do what is necessary bearing in mind the advice forthcoming from the National Pensions Board, the competent authority in that area.  It is within that context I am introducing my amendment which has been designed to meet all those circumstances, allowing the people involved work in harmony.  The House should not forget that they do not have to work in harmony; they do not have to continue to extend these schemes and, if we begin to place strictures on them, no more schemes may come into being.  The ICTU realise that it is a question of striking a balance while, at the same time, progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Bill was to provide the types of safeguards &mdash; now incorporated in it &mdash; and discussed on Second Stage.  We are now going further, first, to provide for the establishment of <Col N="220" /> the board and, second, to ensure that the power is available to me to be used if and when necessary. The approximate time scale for implementation is that recommended by the National Pensions Board. I do not want to depart from or frustrate the harmony generated between the two if at all possible.  Therefore, we are taking the steps suggested.  I must stress that both employers and trade unions are in agreement on this.  We have advanced a step further; they are happy to proceed on this basis, which constitutes an advance on the circumstances prevailing at the time the Bill's was published.  We can trust the board to continue with the work they say they must undertake anyway.  Second we are providing power in this Bill for the making of such regulations if and when that is felt necessary. Therefore it will be evident that we are taking a clearly agreed approach.</P>
    <P>There is a number of problems <i>vis-ávis</i> Deputy Byrne's amendment No. 57. First it refers to any funded scheme having 50 members or more which was contained in the original report of the board.  We have now gone further.  We know it should apply to fewer than 50 members.  I am leaving it open because I want the board to continue with their work.  We want the provisions applicable to every funded scheme if at all possible. No doubt Deputy Byrne is now aware that that is my approach.</P>
    <P>My amendment provides a fair amount of scope in regard to the kinds of people who can be appointed to represent members of the schemes, something which has been generally welcomed. Indeed I should say my amendment was tabled after considerable thought, consideration and discussion.  It is well balanced in regard to what we are endeavouring to achieve.  I know that is what Deputies on the other side of the House are endeavouring to achieve also.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of Deputy Byrne's amendment reads:</P>
    <P>Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and shall <Col N="221" /> not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I contend that would merely have the effect of delaying any decision being taken and would not be necessary. Members will have 21 sitting days within which to raise the matter in either House whereas, if they are not unduly concerned, the regulation then comes into operation.  I know that Deputy Byrne seems to table such amendments habitually.I should say that all they tend to do is tie a Minister's hands and, in practice, render matters more inefficient; that is the reality.  We want to get away from that.  There is the safeguard that, if somebody is unhappy with a regulation being proposed, it should be remembered that they are circulated to everybody, will appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> will be placed on the table of the House, when Members will be afforded an opportunity to propose any change therein.</P>
    <P>Deputies may talk about the report.  I should say the man who wrote that report is sitting beside me and put more work than anybody else into its publication. We have obtained a lot of expert advice in drafting this amendment, which is designed to meet the requirements as discussed on Second Stage.  We can go back and have it changed if the Deputies so wish but I would not be in favour of that because I believe this amendment is well designed for its purpose.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the provision whereby the Minister shall, as against may, provide.  Deputy Ferris is right in that the draftsmen are not in favour of the word shall.  If we are going to say the Minister shall provide, we would have to give a date by which time he should do so.  How do you know what date to put down?  All we would be saying is we do not trust the National Pensions Board and that they are not going to come up with the right ideas.  If I appoint a chief executive of the National Pensions Board and ask him to do something by a certain date, he may not be able to do it until a few days later or a month later.  As Deputy Ferris has said, that is generally <Col N="222" /> why the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used.  If the Deputies wish, I will reconsider this matter because I appreciate their concerns.Deputy Byrne in particular keeps coming back to this question.  He wants to see the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because he does not believe anything will happen otherwise.Most things happen by agreement, especially nowadays where there is a <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a Central Review Committee and so on.  As a safeguard, we are taking the power here to immediately take action at any time that is considered appropriate.  I think that is a good way to approach the issue, but I will certainly consider before Report Stage the question of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as against &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his further moves on the matter.  Having had a closer look at his amendment, I appreciate that it includes substantial refinements that are welcome, particularly as regards subsection (2) (a) and the limitation of 50 members. There is very good reason for not including a date, but if you intend to do something, you set down a date by which time it should be done.  That would strengthen this provision and would certainly meet my reservations.  I suggest we should set down a period of five years.  In other sections we have specified that within ten years certain arrangements must come into play but I think five years would be an appropriate time by which arrangements must be made for appointment of member trustees and so on.  The &ldquo;shall&rdquo; provision would not even achieve that because it is open-ended.  The Minister said in his reply that he could not tell people to appoint member trustees.  We are telling them to do a lot of things and we certainly can, in this legislation, tell them to appoint member trustees.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but from my discussions with people <Col N="223" /> involved, the fear in reality is unfounded. We can make too much of this matter. For example, I met a member trustee recently who is in name a member trustee but it means nothing to him because there are no regular meetings and no information is given about the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Penalties will be imposed after this Bill has been passed.  He had better know about the meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While we have clearly set up the board and propose penalties for not having information, until we see the regulations that the board will establish in relation to the appointment of trustees, we do not know what kind of restrictions will be put on the regularity of meetings, the kind of information they must have and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the question of regulations under this Bill.  Until a lot of these areas have been fleshed out, the whole impact of the Bill will not be known.  It is quite clear that unless members become very much more informed about pension schemes, they will not be particularly well protected. Even if the trustees provide them with the reports, unless they have developed an active, aggressive and detailed knowledge of the matter and are able to use the information that is given to them, they will not be protected.  I know that many ordinary members of schemes believe that when we talk about member trustees, we are talking about one of the lads or lassies becoming a member trustee.  Those who have been involved with schemes know that may not be the best way of proceeding and that you would be better served by appointing somebody with more expert knowledge. That is specified quite clearly in the Minister's proposal and is welcome.  I think the reason the Minister has not specified a date and favours the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is that we have taken a softly, softly approach and are hesitating on the matter.</P>
      <P>If we fudge the issue of member trustees, members of schemes might fear that people are trying to hide something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> Most of these schemes are run by administrators and professionals.  The vast bulk of the schemes are of a medium to small size and are not run in-house but are farmed out to professional pension trust bodies who run them.  A lot of the fear is based neither on reality nor on practice. It is interesting that the in-house schemes are by and large those which have developed the system of member trustees.  They are the ones that have been dealing hands on with the employees for a long time.  A lot of the fear is based on a lack of thinking out of the position.  The Minister has said there is real concern about these fears.  If he could convince me that they might interfere with the setting up of schemes, I might be willing to accept his slightly more softly, softly approach, although he has gone a great distance on this.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the whole issue of trustees will continue to be vague.  I received a letter from a person who belongs to a pensions scheme which circulates a booklet to each member with information to the effect that committees of management elect managers of the scheme, the systems of appointment of trustees and so on.  All these matters will determine the success of the Bill.  We should not wait for the National Pensions Board to make their regulations; we should specify these matters in the amendments to Part I.  The issue of trustees is one that remains to be fleshed out and unless we get other areas right, member trustees will be of a limited value.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to develop the point he raised in relation to the genuine fear.  Does he believe that fear is based on reality or that it could interfere with the setting up of the schemes?  As I have said, the larger schemes which operate in-house schemes already have member trustees and they are working well.  In most other cases they are farmed out. One could imagine that the only reason for the secrecy is that somebody is playing about with them.  By and large these schemes are run by professional bodies in compliance with professional standards.If anything else is going on, they <Col N="225" /> are the very schemes for which we should have member trustees for whatever protection and necessary information they can give.  &ldquo;Trustees&rdquo; is defined as meaning the administrator of the scheme and, accordingly, references to trustees shall be construed as including references to administrators.  Can the Minister clarify that definition and develop it a little further?What number of schemes are we talking about in regard to administrators and what is the distinction?  Under what legislation do they operate?  Do they operate under the Insurance Acts etc?  It is a distinction that had not occurred to me until we began debating this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a major area of agreement between what the Minister is suggesting in his amendment and what has been suggested in the other amendment.  I am sure the author of the pensions board report will welcome the fact that we have commended that report in all its recommendations.  The only point that worried us was that one of its main recommendations, in the area of trustees, had been ignored in the original Bill.  The Minister has now taken a major step forward.  The only matter of disagreement &mdash; if it is disagreement &mdash; that remains is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. In relation to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the Minister's amendment instead of the proposed word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be more binding on the Minister, or any successive Minister, particularly as it will not bring into being a specific starting date.  As the Minister rightly said, there is no obligation on any employer or group of employers to have a pensions scheme.  It is only if a pensions scheme is to be put into operation that there should be regulations setting down the rights of people to have trustees on the board.  The first part of the Minister's amendment suggests that the employer will have the right to select employer representatives or employ himself.  Of course, all employers ensure that they are on the trustees board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the Minister's amendment uses the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  That is important because it deals specifically <Col N="226" /> with the right of members of the schemes to have participation or representation. That is essential because we are talking about funds in excess of £6 billion which is a conservative estimate of the value of pension funds.  These funds are for the benefit of workers in their jobs and in their future.  They are offered initially to people as part of the remuneration of their job.  A pensions scheme, whether contributory or non-contributory, is at the discretion of the employer.  If he offers a pensions scheme this legislation will ensure that it is run in accordance with regulations laid down by the pensions board.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister &mdash; and he has suggested he would do it &mdash; to bring in regulations setting down a procedure under which these people could be represented on the trustee board.  It is reasonable to expect that when the interests of the employees are at stake they should have the same right as the employer.  We want to ensure that nobody would have any worry about this. As we have said &mdash; and Deputy Byrne has repeatedly said &mdash; where member trusteeships already exist that enhances the confidence of the members in their own schemes and leads to a greater level of interest and participation.  That is what we want.  Surely that is what any good employer would want by way of offering good terms of employment, an interest by the members in their own scheme and trusteeship?</P>
    <P>I have read the wording suggested by the Minister as opposed to the wording suggested by Deputy Byrne and on balance, I think the Minister's amendment is a better one provided he will, as promised, change &mdash; between now and Report Stage &mdash; the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Everything else contained in that amendment is satisfactory for me.  It does not oblige the Minister by way of a date &mdash; which will be dealt with in other parts of the Bill &mdash; to bring in the regulations at a particular time.  I agree with the Minister that having to bring regulations before the House would delay them even if the regulations were satisfactory.  Of course, they will be submitted to us and <Col N="227" /> if we feel they do not meet the interests we represent then we can put down an amendment.  I am not unduly worried about the rights of the House; I am concerned that the legislation would reflect the need for the Minister to lay down regulations.  Certainly the Congress of Trade Unions felt very strongly about this issue and the pensions board recommended, after long and tedious deliberations, the amendment we were suggesting.  We were suggesting that that requirement would be met by way of regulation.  I think the Minister's amendment would meet that requirement also. I am glad of the Ministers assurance that he will examine the draftsman's favourite word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and have it changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; before Report Stage.  Then, I would be happy with the Minister's amendment as suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the suggested amendment by the Minister. The more I read it and the more I get a chance to refresh my memory of the opinions of the National Pensions Board the more determined I am in favour of our own amendment.  The Minister has tried to project the position that &ldquo;we are all in the one boat, we have all had talks with Congress, the employers etc. and we have thrashed out this agreement&rdquo;.  It is not my understanding that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would be happy with the Minister's amendment. The Minister mentioned that the National Pensions Board said that because of the importance of the issue we consider it desirable, taking into account the reservations expressed by some members of the board on this matter, that progress towards the fulfilment of this objective should be gradual rather than immediate.  For this reason we recommend that the necessary statutory provision shall not come into operation until a period of three years has elapsed following the date of the enactment of the proposed pensions Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to remember that was said in 1987, three years ago.  That was the thinking of the National Pensions Board <Col N="228" /> then.  We are now three years longer in the tooth.  The Minister has produced this proposed legislation and is now seeking another three years before we would put into the legislation the rights of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but in all fairness to those employers and others who have been in touch with the Minister since the National Pensions Board issued this report it is a fair assumption that the elements the Minister is now trying to appease are basically kicking to touch for another three years.  He would not in the final analysis be representing the intended outcome as suggested by the recommendations in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If that happens the Minister will have power to take action at any time in between.  That is the big difference.That is why the pensions board recommended this provision because it puts that power into the legislation at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can say that with conviction if he wishes.  On the other hand he was critical of the fact, as mentioned in the report, that it shall apply to any funded scheme having 50 members or more.  The Minister said that is out of date because the new thinking is that it could be fewer than 50.  I welcome the Minister's proposals that the scheme should permit for worker trustees from schemes that comprise fewer than 50 members.  We are not fighting with each other on that issue.  In fact, I would support a scheme with fewer than 50 members being the criterion.  The Minister has alleged that the new section 61 (2) proposed in my amendment is old and out-of-date but I argue it was never the intention to extend the three year period referred to in the report by a further three years, in other words, it will be another six years before workers sit on the boards of trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to tease out the Minister's thinking behind amendment <Col N="229" /> No. 56.  The Minister will tell me very quickly if I am misreading it but he seems to be implying that the workers' at some stage, will have the option, if a majority of them decide to do so, to select or, at the option of such a majority, approve of the selection by the employer concerned. I would be very unhappy if that wording were accepted.  Employers for all sorts of reasons might exert undue influence to get employees to opt out of nominating their own person in favour of the person nominated by the employer.  The more I think about this the more I believe it will have a dangerous effect on the floor of the workshop.  I would hate to see conflict arising in industry but this would be a possibility where an employer puts the word out among the workforce that he knows of some person who would make a good trustee and would protect the best interests of the workforce.  Some workers would accept his word and others would not.  This is a recipe for internal industrial conflict which would not be in the best interests of the employer or the employee.  Therefore, I have many reservations about the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by Deputy Flaherty, the Minister has given no indication of when this scheme will be introduced. Our amendment is far more straightforward.It states that the number of trustees to be elected shall not be fewer than the number of trustees representing the company.  The Minister is trying to water down this key element of the amendment in his own amendment.  I am very suspicious of the Minister's amendment and am now more supportive than ever of our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify one point which occurred to me while Deputy Byrne was speaking. The Minister has stated that the specified number will be fewer than 50, but having regard to the fact that the amendment states &ldquo;the Minister may provide by regulations, in respect of schemes having not less than a specified number of members&rdquo; is he going to leave it up to the board to decide?  It is possible that the number <Col N="230" /> may be higher than 50.  Obviously, it would be open to them to decide voluntarily on a smaller number but what we are doing is laying down a minimum number.  Why not opt for the number recommended by the Pensions Board rather than leave the matter open to interpretation?  There is a possibility that the number will be smaller and, if so, we should specify how much smaller and that it will still be open to schemes to opt for a figure below that level if they wish.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Byrne, it is my understanding that congress have admitted that because this is a specialised area, a very limited number of people with expertise are available within their own circle to deal with this matter and the best course for many groups of employees, if they wish to protect their interests, is not necessarily to agree to the appointment of the person nominated by the employer but rather to appoint someone with knowledge to protect their interests.  This is a point I did not grasp until my last set of meetings with them.  It is possible that an employer will do what Deputy Byrne has said and this may result in tension in the workplace.  I do not know if the Minister has discussed this amendment with the two groups concerned but he indicated that he felt it would get their agreement. We will be able to clarify this point when we come to deal with section 61.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty stated that we should insert the words &ldquo;five years&rdquo;, but one of the problems with doing this is that people would sit back and wait five years before doing anything. I do not want to quote examples as plenty abound, but I believe the board will make this happen if this is what they want to do.  I can assure Deputy Byrne that the board will make progress in that area.  As I said, I will have a look at this matter before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fear was expressed in relation to the setting up of schemes.  However, this fear can be overcome.  It is easy to refer to schemes which are running well where everyone is happy and to ask why everyone else is not happy but this is not the <Col N="231" /> case.  A genuine fear has been expressed, and we are dealing with it reasonably at present by providing the means to ensure that it can happen harmoniously and as quickly as possible.  We are giving power to the Minister to step in at any stage to point out that they had been given sufficient time and that he is going to make it mandatory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty referred to the administrator.This is a technical matter but the term &ldquo;trustees&rdquo; is designed to include in the case of schemes not set up under trust &mdash; that is unfunded arrangements &mdash; the administrator of the scheme.  It is a requirement of the Revenue Commissioners that for tax approval purposes schemes must appoint an administrator. It includes any person or body responsible for managing the scheme.  The administrator will often be the trustee of the scheme or someone who is nominated, but it may also be a pension scheme manager or the employer himself.The responsibility for ensuring that a schemes complies with the various requirements rests with the trustees or, if there are no trustees, the administrator. This is to ensure that it is always covered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty raised the question of including the figure 50, not another figure.  We want it to apply to all if possible.We could provide for not more than 50 but equally we could specify not more than 25.  Any Minister in my position would be happy to follow it up with the board, who will pursue the line I indicated.There is no need to put in a number.  However, I will consider the matter before Report Stage.  The intention is very clear.  It may be better not to mention a number.  In setting up the board I will indicate very clearly what we want in this respect.</P>
    <P>I can never please Deputy Byrne and I will not try further.  He does not trust me or anybody.  I have had discussions with the ICTU and I know this is what they wanted in the Bill.  They know it has been developed harmoniously and that it is a question of balance.  They know the very real difficulties and that the matter has been discussed at the central review <Col N="232" /> committee.  This is consistent with my meetings with them.  Whenever Deputy Byrne sees the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; he gets upset.</P>

Deputy Byrne maintains his reservations and perhaps he can consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>(a)  on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both,</P>
      <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides for increased levels of fines for offences under the Bill. Following the publication of the Bill representations were made to me by the ICTU that the levels of fines provided for in the Bill were too low and did not constitute a real deterrent.  This point was raised on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>In view of the serious consequences that could arise for members due to the failure of trustees to discharge their responsibilities under the Bill, the level of fines should be substantial enough to penalise defaulting trustees.  I propose, therefore, to provide in addition that the guilty party may on conviction on indictment by the court be liable to a fine of £10,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.  The current maximum limit set by the Attorney General's office for fines for summary offences is £1,000.  Accordingly, I propose no change in relation to such fines.  A number of the amendments propose an increase of the £1,000 fine to £5,000 or £10,000.  In practice that cannot be done in relation to summary offences, where the maximum is £1,000.  I am bringing in a more serious offence with the higher levels as the maxima.  I trust this amendment will meet the requirements as set out by the Deputies in their various amendments.  A number of others like amendments Nos. 69 and 70 really provide for the same fines set into different parts of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendments Nos. 69 and <Col N="234" /> 70, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a minor printing error in their wording.  The error in question is the use of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;on&rdquo;. I wish to correct that error on page 13 of the list of amendments.  Amendment No. 69 (b) should read &ldquo;on conviction on indictment,&rdquo; and amendment No. 70 (ii) should read &ldquo;on conviction on indictment,&rdquo;.My note said &ldquo;or&rdquo; but from my experience in Justice I said automatically &ldquo;on conviction on indictment&rdquo;.  It is just the terminology.  I hope this will meet the requirements Deputies are seeking for stronger penalties.  These are very major penalties.  A very serious penalty is introduced now and this is the way it has to be done.  It cannot be done by just increasing the summary offence penalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>This merits a welcome. The Minister has moved substantially. Again, I defer to the legal expertise in relation to the distinction between &ldquo;summary&rdquo; and &ldquo;on indictment&rdquo;.  I suppose the decision about where a case enters the courts and whether it is dealt with appropriately is a matter for the legal authorities, but we have made a provision that it can be dealt with seriously.  A strong view was expressed to all of us from Congress and others and from ordinary members of schemes that, given the very serious consequences for scheme members of failure of trustees to carry out their duties and the phenomenal size and value of pension funds and schemes, it was necessary and desirable that paragraph (b) be amended to provide for a more substantial fine.  I have suggested one or two amendments which would in turn give extra protection to trustees and we will be dealing with that shortly.  On both sides there can be serious offences and very serious consequences can ensue for the members if trustees fail in their function.  The changes proposed by the Minister meet quite substantially the points raised by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

      <P>Section 3 of the Bill provided initially for a fine not exceeding £1,000 for contravention by a trustee of the provisions of the Bill or regulations <Col N="235" /> under the Bill.  Section 18 provided for fines not exceeding £1,000 and £5,000 or a two year term of imprisonment where an employer or a trustee obstructed investigation of a scheme by the board. In the light of the value of the scheme and the value of pensions trusts at present, currently in excess of £6 billion, it was everybody's opinion, certainly that of Members on this side and to a lesser extent of Deputy Flaherty because she halved the suggested penalty which is now being doubled by the Minister in line with what Deputy Byrne and I have been suggesting, that where workers' interests were at stake and such a large sum of money was invested on their behalf, for offences under this Bill the level of fines was too low.  There could be very serious consequences for members of the schemes if a trustee failed to carry out his duty and it was obvious an amendment was necessary.  Deputy Byrne and I agreed in different locations on different days and with different advice, that the correct fines were in the region suggested by us in our amendment.  However, the Minister has available to him legal advice that was not available to us and we bow to that advice.  I understand that you must have a summary conviction and all sorts of legalistic terms are consequentially used before you can enforce fines at this level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing is that now employers and the trustees of these funds will know we are serious in the Oireachtas about complying fully with regulations or suggestions laid down by the Minister.  If a company chooses to ignore them, as has been done in the past, these types of fines will apply.  We want to be no more penal than anybody else but we must have fines pitched at a level that is a real deterrent against people doing anything but what is intended by way of legislation with investments made by, for and on behalf of employees in companies who benefit under these schemes in the long term, and we intend their long-term benefits will be protected by legislation.  Fines in this region are the appropriate deterrent. I accept the Minister's legal advice <Col N="236" /> regarding the wording he has used.  He meets the reservations we and Congress had about the levels of these fines as laid down in the Bill initially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone in the right direction this time.  When we are dealing with the question of fines or imprisonment we must take into consideration that we are trying to protect against, for example, fraud.  The Bill lists instructions that must be complied with and the offences, for example, the production of false reports or false certificates or other documents.  We must view the penalties in the light of the huge sums of money involved in the pensions area.  I do not wish to bore the Minister, but let me mention again the enormous amount of £10 billion increasing at a rate of £500 million from contributions annually and from investments of £600 million per annum.  We are talking about huge sums of money in the knowledge of unfortunate events recorded where very large question marks have been put over the functioning and operations of certain people about where the pension money ultimately ended up.  In certain cases it did not end up in the pockets of those the funds were supposed to be for, that is the employees of certain companies.  Therefore, we have as a backdrop the fact that there is great possible temptation for certain individuals to mess about in a simplistic way with members' funds or for companies to act in a more co-ordinated, complex way by fraudulently administering or investing the funds.  Because of the huge sums of money involved, we must have penalties sufficient to deter anybody from doing anything illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost as important if not more so, we are also dealing with the oxygen of life for hundreds of thousands of people. At the moment there are in excess of 500,000 paying members, but hundreds of thousands of people either are at present drawing pensions or are on the way out of their gainful employment and about to take up pension rights.  Their interests must be protected.  There are also widows, widowers and families of <Col N="237" /> decreased members whose pension rights have to be protected in law.</P>
    <P>We propose in our amendment a substantial increase in the fine provided in section 3 (3).  We have to make people aware of the mortal sin dimensions, so to speak, of an offence committed under this Bill.  I think the State contribution to these schemes in 1989 by way of tax relief on contributions was some £203 million and on investment income £162 million in 1989.  This is a substantial contribution by the State by way of tax breaks and tax reliefs.  The State, companies and employees have an investment in these pension schemes and we must collectively be safeguarded by way of the penalties proposed in this legislation.  The penalties proposed in the Bill must be brought to bear on trustees, corporate bodies or other companies listed in the various sections who commit serious offences.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister the position in regard to indexing the fines proposed for offences under the Bill.  A fine of £10,000 may not represent a great deal of money to a corporate group but it is a fair sum by today's standards.  Is there any way of providing in the legislation that the fines set will be as much of a deterrent in ten or 20 years' time as they are today and will not be diluted by time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to indexing, this is normally done by way of updating or in a consolidation Bill.  It is not normal practice to index fines.  The fine proposed in the Bill is very substantial and I think Deputies will find in practice that a fine of £10,000 or two years in jail will act as a deterrent.  I presume the two years in jail will not have to be indexed but the fine of £10,000 is quite substantial and leaves us a lot of scope.</P>

I should like to point out <Col N="238" /> to the House that the figure of £1,000 in paragraph (ii) of amendment No. 70 should read £10,000.  This is a typing error.  I am reflecting the views of the Members opposite in what I am doing here.  Deputy Flaherty said the fine should be £5,000 while another Deputy felt it should be £10,000.  One way or the other Deputies felt that the fines should be more substantial and I am making provision for that by proposing a very substantial fine of £10,000 as a maximum and a prison sentence.  I thank the Deputies for their support for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to indicate his thinking in relation to the report on the tax treatment of pension schemes and whether he intends to do something in this regard.  On Second Stage the Minister referred liberally to the tax regimes the Government operate to encourage pension schemes and how important they are.  I put down an amendment to this section which was ruled out of order because it did not come within the scope of this Bill and proposed the extension of further reliefs to pension schemes for the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the Revenue Commissioners monitor this whole area and those involved in the pension industry believe they have operated in very difficult circumstances a benign and helpful regime for various schemes.  They have an immense body of knowledge and <Col N="239" /> information built up which would be of value to the pensions board &mdash; I understand that is the thinking behind this section &mdash; and I should like the Minister to clarify how he envisages this co-operation working.  Will it be confined to an exchange of information?  Would there be any value in relocating personnel from the Revenue Commissioners to the board when they eventually begin to recruit staff?  Is the Minister aware of the very difficult staffing problem the Revenue Commissioners have in this area?  Is the Minister prepared to make a special case for pensions schemes which have operated in very difficult circumstances?  I should like the Minister to tell me how he envisages this exchange of information working, his understanding of the role of the Revenue Commissioners in this area to date and how they will be interlinked with the pensions board in monitoring pensions schemes in the future to ensure there is no unnecessary duplication.</P>

      <P>The section provides for the transfer of information on occupational pension schemes between the board and the Revenue Commissioners. The retirement benefit district of the Revenue Commissioners is responsible for the tax approval of pension schemes under the Finance Act, 1972.  Their supervision is mainly limited to ensuring that the tax reliefs are restricted to bona fide pension schemes and that the benefits paid and the contributions set aside to fund the pension promises do not exceed maximum limits, that is, that the pension scheme is not being used for tax avoidance purposes.</P>
      <P>Section 59 of the Bill requires a scheme to register with the board and it may be considered desirable, following the establishment of the new board, to set up a joint register of pension schemes between the two organisations.  A recommendation along these lines was made by the National Pensions Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> In relation to the general question of the tax treatment of pensions which is of importance to the whole pension system, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance, but needless to say it is one that the pensions board would be aware of and would be anxious to highlight its importance as a crucial incentive in the development of pension schemes generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated a slight problem in that area in that he has responsibility for the pensions area but the tax treatment of pensions is a matter for the Government and the Department of Finance.  He has to hand a major report on tax treatment of pension schemes which made very specific recommendations in some areas and left others to the Revenue Commissioners.  Would the Minister indicate whether he will be making any recommendations to Government or taking any initiatives in this area because the tax treatment of pensions is vital in terms of creating an environment where they would expand?  I ask in particular in relation to the self-employed who are excluded from comparative benefits currently available to employees in occupational pension schemes.  Is there any hope that something could be done in that area, given that my amendment was ruled out of order as it related to a financial measure not in the context of a further pensions Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax treatment is pretty good at present.  The main concern would be that there would be any adverse development in the tax treatment of the occupational pensions schemes.  The report is with the Minister for Finance at present and it is his responsibility.  I have noted what the Deputy said and will certainly keep it in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly would not interpret the section as being a facility for people to avoid the payment of tax.  We would be anxious to ensure that whatever incentives are there now should be maintained and improved upon because they have a vital bearing on the success of occupational pensions schemes.  The tax <Col N="241" /> incentive is a vital instrument for getting the scheme up and running, otherwise employers will not set up schemes.  The Minister has read the situation correctly and it is appropriate that anything we do should not prejudice the existing benefits and that they should be improved if at all possible so that pensions schemes can be more successful in the future, particularly as we are now legislating to have some order put on them.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would say that areas like this tend to be interfered with in budgets by the Minister for Finance in particular which makes them less attractive.  The same applies to mortgage relief which is another debate, but it is important to note that there have been disimprovements in the tax relief for essential items like this.  They are a way to encourage people to save in the future and we should legislate to give them every incentive to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>6.&mdash;Every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and shall not come into effect until such time as a motion approving of the draft has been approved by each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Minister has put in a catch all section for his regulations, I am putting in a catch all amendment because of the need to have those regulations passed positively in the House.  There are so many areas here that will be decided <Col N="242" /> by regulation.  Practically every major section of the Bill will take its shape largely in regulations.  It includes elements of the disclosure which are extremely serious.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's ideas in relation to the regulations relating to that.  In relation to funding there will be groups excluded, etc.  That is why I express this concern again, given that some of my colleagues have put down amendments individually to some of these sections, I will not press it overactively at this point. Depending on the kind of reassurances the Minister gives us, we can decide what to do on the other sections of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are times when I share the views of Deputy Flaherty.  It is important that the House would have the opportunity to discuss some types of regulations before they become effective. I have reservations, however, about applying that principle to all regulations relating to this Bill because it could delay regulations which would be in the interests of the beneficiaries.  The Minister should bear in mind that the suggestions we put forward are ideal for inclusion as regulations.  He should consider submitting to us in advance of publishing the regulations a draft of his proposals.  If he submits such a draft we will have an opportunity of commenting on it and the Minister could take our views into consideration before publishing the regulations.</P>
      <P>If the Minister takes our views into consideration we will not be tempted to stop them coming into operation by resolution in the House.  I do not think it is right that we should have to wait for so many sitting days of the House to pass before regulations, social welfare regulations in particular, are put into effect. Poor people may be depending on the implementation of those regulations. There is no doubt that regulations under the Bill will be important.  While we are not in a position to cover everything in the Bill the Minister will be in a position to do so in the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the views <Col N="243" /> expressed by Deputy Ferris.  It appears that the line up in regard to this amendment will be Fine Gael and The Workers' Party against the Government.  Many of the provisions of the Bill will have to be complemented by regulations and for that reason I do not think we should let the opportunity pass without putting suggestions to the Minister for inclusion in the regulations.  It is possible that Members will feel that the regulations, when published, do not follow the views put forward by the Minister during the debate.  We are likely to have a big number of regulations following on the passage of the Bill.  I accept Deputy Ferris's point that it would be wrong of us to stall any regulations which provide for payments to pensioners and social welfare recipients but I take a different stance in regard to the regulations that will follow the passage of the Bill.  For example, regulations will have to be made in regard to the appointment of trustees.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 56 in the name of the Minister states:</P>
      <P>(2)  Regulations under this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  shall specify the manner in which decisions of members of schemes, and the selection of persons for appointment as trustees of schemes by the members of schemes, for the purpose of subsection (1) shall be made,</P>
      <P>(b) may make such other provision as the Minister considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of this section and for enabling it to have full effect.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point that must be made in relation to that amendment is that the number of trustees will have to be specified in the regulations.  It will also be necessary to specify the number of persons who shall be appointed to the trustees of the scheme approved by the employers.  Those provisions highlight the need for a debate on those regulations.I will be supporting Deputy Flaherty's amendment which suggests <Col N="244" /> that the regulations should be debated in the House.  I am not here long enough to understand the implications of the alternative method of introducing regulations but I am led to believe that for a small party like ours it is very difficult to introduce motions objecting to regulations before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the regulations that will be published concerning disclosures.  In my view two important regulations will be made in relation to that topic.  The main features of the Bill relate to preservation, funding, disclosure of information and the setting of general standards in regard to pension funds.  Under the heading of disclosure I have no doubt that a regulation will be introduced concerning the right to information on request and one excluding certain schemes from the disclosure requirements.  We do not know what we are buying in regard to regulations.  To what extent the protections contained in the Bill be taken back under the regulations?The position is very unsatisfactory.My fear is that under the funding section there will be substantial exclusions.  Any interference with the section dealing with the disclosure of information will undermine the Bill.  Will the Minister reassure us in regard to the regulations?</P>

      <P>The Minister can change regulations and the National Pensions Board will be working with the Department to try to frame appropriate regulations.Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Ferris said earlier they appreciated that a large number of regulations must be implemented.  This is a huge Bill and we certainly could not include the regulations.The regulations will allow the flexibility needed to deal with different sections.  Of course the Minister can amend a regulation if something is highlighted or it can be turned down in the House and annulled.  That is &mdash; and always has been &mdash; standard procedure. The section provides that regulations made by the Minister under the Act must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This is a safeguarding section to make sure that any regulation made by the Minister must be laid before each House and, if the House does not like them, they can, within 21 days, annul them.  In practice, when a problem develops the regulation is amended and, if people do not like the amended version, they can vote against it in the House.  It is a perfectly normal procedure for control on the administration and it does not shackle it.  Occasionally, people may feel that there should be a specific requirement but that may only affect civil rights or matters of that kind.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I expressed concern as to the potential future cost of the administration of the Act.  It specifies later that the board's expenses will be met by a contribution from the schemes.  That seems reasonable in view of the size of the industry and the figures which have been mentioned. However, the Minister said&mdash; and I am aware of this from my consultations with the industry &mdash; that many schemes are fragile.  This is the case in small to medium businesses where it may be touch and go in relation to a pension scheme and where additional costs may influence a firm not to implement a scheme or, if they have one, to wind it up.  This Bill will not change anything in that regard. This is a delicate balancing act and perhaps the Minister will be able to reassure me in relation to the cost of running the <Col N="247" /> scheme.  Does this provision &mdash; and the one later on which indicates how the board will be funded &mdash; exclude the Exchequer being involved in the direct funding of the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just a provision which enables the Minister to be involved in expenditure.  Obviously the Minister will be concerned about how small schemes operate but there is a section dealing with the whole question of funding as operated through the board and we can deal with it then.  However, this is a standard provision applying to Acts of the Oireachtas generally and it gives the basic authority for the payment of expenditure for administration.  There might not be a requirement but it is very important that the Act has a provision enabling expenditure to be made if that is necessary.  I take it that the Deputy is referring to very small schemes which will not be covered by the board and that the Minister should be in a position to do something about it.  This is the enabling power but we will deal with it in the section dealing with the board and moneys available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not quite met my point.  I gather that very sizeable boards have been established in other countries with hundreds of employees.  In Britain &mdash; and most of the other countries &mdash; part of the costs are Exchequer funded because it is part of the service of the State to protect the members and employees.  It is not desirable to have a big board, especially if it will be a burden on the schemes.  There may come a time when the Exchequer would have to take up some of these schemes and I should like the Minister to clarify whether this power would be sufficient in that regard.  Does the latter section prevent the Minister from being involved in any funding for the board? Does it confine funding to the one source and, if so, how could that point be met?</P>

      <P>We are getting back to the Deputy's amendment which dealt with <Col N="248" /> expenses incurred by the board in the administration of this Act.  In effect, the expenses of a member of the board may be met from the funds provided by the Oireachtas.  For instance, the chairman may have a small stipend.  It is really just an enabling provision for anything that occurs under the Act in which there will be a requirement.  We will have to see what is subsequently required.</P>

Whereas they welcomed the fact that one of the functions of the pensions board in this section would be that they would lay down guidelines I tabled my amendment on the basis that they were anxious, and I agreed with them, that there had been recent experience of guidelines being laid down in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 &mdash; sections 30 and 31 thereof being very specific with regard to the guidelines and code of practice laid down therein.  The trade union movement had accepted that Act as representing progressive legislation.  They were anxious that this section would reflect the provisions incorporated in that Act.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept my amendment on the basis that it represents a more positive manner of laying down guidelines which were specified by the Minister in three lines in the original Bill &mdash; to issue guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of trustees of schemes and codes of practice on specific aspects of <Col N="252" /> their responsibilities.  My amendment is a repetition, almost word for word, of the previous Bill, merely changing the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; in the original Bill to the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; in this one.  Because this wording would be applicable to nine subsections I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it.  I understand that Congress made the same point to the Minister himself and no doubt also to other Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8 November 1988, Deputy Harney from the Opposition side of the House, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, moved a Private Members' Bill &mdash; National Lottery (Amendment) Bill, 1988.  She stated at that time in the Official Report of 8 November 1988 at column 2120 as follows:</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this National Lottery (Amendment) Bill, 1988, is to end the appalling abuse by Fianna Fáil of the national lottery by putting in place a new and independent process for the disbursement of lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She drew attention to the scandalous manner in which members of the then Government were allocating the lottery's proceeds.  At the time of that debate all the Opposition parties objected to the manner in which the then Fianna Fáil Government had personalised the distribution of lottery funds by individual <Col N="256" /> Ministers disbursing moneys as if they were coming out of their own private bank accounts.  The Government were in a minority and the House was united in its demand for change.  Unfortunately, the vote on that Bill was lost when the Labour Party abstained from voting in return for the establishment of a committee to advise on the effective and accountable disbursal of the lottery surplus.If the Labour Party had held their ground that night the Government would have been defeated and by now we would have had a new approach to lottery funding.</P>
    <P>The committee appointed reported in the middle of January 1989.  The committee was chaired by former Deputy Desmond of the Labour Party.  Other members were Deputy Tunney representing Fianna Fáil, Deputy Donal Creed, the then chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, Deputy Harney representing the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Sherlock representing The Workers' Party.  In the crucial area of amenity grants, about which allocations of political patronage had been flying, the committee recommended that allocations for specific projects should no longer be made by the Minister for the Environment but that block grants be made to local authorities who would then be responsible for determining which projects should receive such grants.  The committee also emphasised that recreational grants should no longer be the responsibility of the Minister for Education and stated that there should be a co-ordination of recreational and amenity grants schemes to avoid duplication.  The committee stated that such an approach would avoid duplication and remove any degree of perceived patronage which could have an adverse effect on the lottery.</P>
    <P>Since that committee reported the current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition Government have taken office.  It was to be expected that there would be a radical transformation in the manner in which amenity and recreational grants <Col N="257" /> would be allocated and that the ministerial hands would be removed from the lottery purse strings.  While it was known that Fianna Fáil Ministers had a hands-on approach to the distribution of lottery funds, it was to be expected that the Progressive Democrats would demand a very different approach.  After all, had not Deputy Harney in the Dáil, when moving her own party's Bill with the support of Fine Gael in November 1988, stated at column 2120 of the Official Report that:</P>
    <P>...the national lottery was in danger of becoming a national scandal and that an independent allocation process was necessary if public trust and confidence in the lottery was not to be eroded.  Unfortunately, the abuse has escalated...and the spectacle of seeing a pipe band leading the Minister for Agriculture and Food into a town to announce the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; from the lottery has disgusted and sickened most ordinary, decent people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have engaged in the most despicable exercise in gombeen politics ever seen in this country in the way they have handled the allocations from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Many were of the view that: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil see the lottery as merely a re-election slush fund.&rdquo;  She spoke of the need to set out the criteria on which allocations are made and to submit annually a comprehensive report to the Dáil which would contain the details of all applications received, particularly of applications approved, rejected or deferred and the reasons for the decision.  She emphasised the need to prevent Fianna Fáil from engaging in the old style politics which resulted in abuse.  There was to be an end to members of the Government of the day having total discretion as to how and to whom lottery proceeds are allocated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney went on to say she was not criticising the groups who had, at that time, benefited from lottery funds.  I wish to emphasise, Sir, that neither are the Fine Gael Party criticising those groups in the context of this motion.  She stated <Col N="258" /> on 8 November, 1988, at column 2123 of the Official Report that:</P>
    <P>These groups are involved in very worthwhile community activity but they have been forced to exploit the present allocation system in order to get a much needed grant.  It is wrong that voluntary and independent organisations are placed in this position. Everyone's application should be decided on the basis of the merits of the case and not on any other basis.</P>
    <P>Towards the conclusion of her contribution she stated at column No. 2125 of the Official Report that:</P>
    <P>It would be good to think that members of the Government could put their constituency considerations aside and make decisions in the national interest.  That, however, does not seem to me to be possible for members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The following night, on the same debate, who was to be the next Progressive Democrat to speak in support of the Progressive Democrat Bill after Deputy Harney?  None other than a Member of the Dáil who now likes to project himself as the real Taoiseach &mdash; if not that, at least, a mini-Tánaiste &mdash; Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In an impassioned speech which started on 9 November 1988 and did not conclude until 15 November, the Minister for Industry and Commerce criticised the then Minister for the Environment for allocating lottery funds to projects in respect of which the Department of the Environment had not even received any formal applications for lottery assistance.  He expressed disbelief that the projects to which funds had been granted had been objectively examined and evaluated before decisions were made to pay out grants and made it clear that it is essential that, in the disbursement of substantial funds of public moneys, objective criteria be established and adhered to in determining the payments to be made.  Part of the money he stated was being disbursed in individual constituencies, largely on the basis of the <Col N="259" /> personal preferences of Ministers or Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This, he said, had given rise to practices of gombeenism which were reminiscent of a different era and a different century.</P>
    <P>Referring to the contribution made to this debate by Government Ministers with whom the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, now shares responsibility in Cabinet, he stated at column 469 of the Official Report of 15 November, 1989:</P>
    <P>What is even more ominous and sinister about this whole matter is not just the undoubted and widely acknowledged abuse that is going on, but the attitude of the Government and some of their supporters in relation to it. They have contributed to this debate on the basis that they are perfectly entitled to do what they are doing and that they have to apologise to nobody for this abuse.  Since this is their attitude, while they are a minority Government retained in office by the grace and favour of a majority of the Members of this House, I shudder to think what their attitude would be like if they had majority support in this House.</P>
    <P>In an impassioned conclusion the Minister, Deputy O'Malley asked:</P>
    <P>Can we as legislators not raise ourselves above this mentality?  Must the pettiness of the parish pump always be paramount?  If the Government spent less of their time engaging in the sort of childish trivia we read about in the distribution of national lottery funds and more time on tackling the enormous problems, which beset the country today, they would be serving the nation a great deal better.  It is our duty to try and make them do so.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the mould breakers, if they ever had the opportunity, would solve the problem and force Fianna Fáil, if they remained in office, to behave differently. I can almost see the shrug of the shoulders by the Progressive Democrats that one could not expect anything better of a <Col N="260" /> Fianna Fáiler, that the Progressive Democrats are made of sterner stock.  Is it not all the more astonishing that with a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government and with Deputy Harney as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that nothing has changed and in the context of that Government Department things have got worse since the Government came into office and not better?</P>
    <P>On 24 October 1989 it was announced in the Dáil that the Department of Education would cease to make allocations for recreational grants.  Instead of providing for the allocation of block grants to local authorities who would then distribute recreational and amenity grants, the Government announced that in future all amenity and recreational grants would be disbursed by the Minister for the Environment.  No criteria were announced as to the basis upon which individual projects would be chosen. Local authorities were to recommend projects to the Minister who would then determine which projects would receive lottery funding.  It is a complete facade to suggest that the local authorities determine, or will in any way determine, which projects receive lottery funding.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year it was indicated that £5.5 million would be allocated under the amenity and recreational grants scheme by the Minister for the Environment.  On 10 April 1990 this sum was increased to £6.5 million.  To date, no announcement has been made of any specific allocation of any part of these moneys.  In reply to a Dáil question which I tabled on 26 April 1990 the Minister told the House that he had received from local authorities recommendations to provide lottery funding for 3,968 projects, the capital cost of which would come to £163 million if all projects were approved.  The Minister was unable to give any clear indication as to what criteria he would apply in determining which projects would receive lottery funding.</P>
    <P>In response to my request that he publish details of each project for which funding was sought he replied, &ldquo;the <Col N="261" /> preparation of a statement giving details of each of the 3,968 projects involved would absorb a disproportionate amount of staff time&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary statistics the Minister produced showed, for example, that the Dublin local authorities alone had sought lottery funding for projects the capital cost of which would come to £9 million.  The Dublin local authorities were seeking allocations for a sum of money way in excess of the sum of money available nationally.  The same picture can be painted for other local authorities throughout the country. For example, Wicklow County Council sought nearly £8 million for projects.  Colleagues of mine during the course of this debate will list the amounts sought and the number of projects for which they were sought by other local authorities. The procedure adopted by the Minister was farcical and has undetermined the credibility of the lottery and the Government and clearly has removed one of the political pedestals from the Progressive Democrats when they suggest they want to do things differently.</P>
      <P>In response to a Dáil question on 31 May 1990 asking the Minister the number of persons employed in his Department who were assigned to process and review the projects recommended by local authorities for recreational and amenity grants, I was told that the staff of the relevant section of the Department &ldquo;comprises eight persons, two of whom work on a work-sharing basis and one on a part-time basis&rdquo;.  I was told that &ldquo;it is not possible to provide an estimate of the time devoted by the staff concerned to the scheme in question: this would, in any event, vary considerably throughout the year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One wonders how much time has been devoted by this section of the Minister's Department to this scheme since the 4,000 applications, at a total cost of £163 million, were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for reforming the system of <Col N="262" /> allocating lottery moneys.  So much for publishing the details of the projects for which moneys are sought.  So much for the application of objective criteria.  So much for Deputy O'Malley's and Deputy Harney's cries of anguish.  In the matter of lottery funds, the mould-breaking Progressive Democrats are now firmly fixed in the Fianna Fáil mould.  Does anyone seriously believe the Minister for the Enviornment intends to conduct an objective analysis of the merits of each of the approximate 4,000 projects that have been submitted to him for lottery funding?  Does anyone seriously believe that the small number of staff allocated in the Minister's Department to sift through these 4,000 applications have the resources to examine in detail the viability of each of the projects for which funding is sought and, at the same time, carry out their responsibilities to undertake all other work that arises in the environmental services section of the Department of which they are a part?  No matter how devoted or competent the staff are, this small number of people cannot be expected in any reasonable time to deal with so many applications.</P>
    <P>Of course, as everyone on this side of the House knows and as most on the back benches on the Government side of the House suspect, there is no real intention to conduct an objective examination of each of these projects.  The Minister's intention on this issue is to keep his head down and do nothing until the Dáil goes into recess.  In the meantime, lottery funds which could be used by local communities for worthy projects are languishing in Government bank accounts.  Worthy groups and organisations devoted to community work petition their local Deputies to write to the Minister to exhort that they be favoured with the lottery largesse.  From the Opposition side of the House the Department of the Environment is peppered with letters requesting moneys for individual lottery projects.  Only a few of us have not been asked by local groups to write such letters and out of consideration to them we have made representations to the Minister asking that <Col N="263" /> he favour them with lottery allocations. However, none of us knows the basis on which the decisions will be made.</P>
    <P>On the Government side of the House, a different approach has been adopted. There is much ministerial whispering in ears and no doubt there is much ministerial whispering in the ear of the Minister for the Environment with back bench tugging of the political forelock. When the Dáil goes into recess and in the run-up to the Presidential election allocations will be made at a time when the Government, the Minister for the Environment and the two Ministers of State in that Department are immune from questioning by Members of this House on the methodology applied in the allocation of moneys.</P>
    <P>The horse of political patronage will once again be ridden and the Minister, Deputy Flynn, like the Lone Ranger of old, will gallop off into the sunset with his faithful Tonto, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State, galloping along beside him.</P>

      <P>The only question that remains to be answered is how much of the £6.5 million to be allocated will be allocated at the discretion of the Minister for the Environment and what proportion of it will be allocated at the discretion of his Progressive Democrats Minister of State.  Knowing the Minister, Deputy Flynn as I do, as a resourceful and determined Minister, I have very little doubt that the main slice of lottery cake will be reserved for his table and the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, will merely receive a few crumbs from the Ministerial lottery table.</P>

      <P>It is a scandal and a disgrace that this Coalition Government have refused to implement the recommendations of the all-party working group that amenity and recreational <Col N="264" /> grants be allocated to specific projects by local authorities.  It is a charade for the Minister for the Environment to talk of the need for local government reform and then refuse to develope this function to local authorities throughout the country. It is a charade for the Minister for Energy, in his capacity as a sort of PD senior locum in the Department of the environment, to talk of the need for local government reform and give as an example to the media a suggestion that local authorities should be able to allocate lottery funds, while supporting in Cabinet a system which has prevented that recommendation of the Dáil working group being implemented.  It is not good enough for the PDs to say they dislike the current approach and then go along with it.  That party will, when voting on this motion tomorrow night, have the opportunity to vote with their principles in the division lobby.  They will have their opportunity to vote with us on this side of the House to implement the recommendations of the working party.  If the PDs vote with the Government on this issue, let us hear no more humbug about mould breakers who are opposed to political patronage.</P>
      <P>I hope this motion will have the support of all parties on this side of the House and the support of the independent Deputies.  I still wait in hope that it yet might have the support of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned the lottery moneys are viewed <Col N="265" /> as a slush fund for the re-election of local Deputies.  This is obvious from the way they have already distributed the money and even more obvious from the farcical and basically dishonest exercise by the Department of the Environment in their pretence of handing over the job of recommendation to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Nowhere was the Government's cynical approach to the use of funds more clearly demonstrated than in County Sligo.  In April 1988 we were told in Sligo by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, that we were getting a 25 metre swimming pool and that £1 million was being granted from the lottery funds.  This was a clear-cut, absolute, definite promise. There were no ifs and buts.  One million pounds was to be given and a schedule in writing of how the money would be spent was given by the Minister of State &mdash; £300,000 in 1988, £400,000 in 1989 and the remaining £300,000 this year.  There was even the now famous phantom cheque for £1 million.  The mayor of the day, Michael Carroll, swears that he got an envelope with the supposed £1 million cheque, the money for the pool, from the then Minister for Finance.  This is now known as the phantom cheque of the mayor's parlour.  Cheque or no cheque, we still have not received a penny of the lottery money.  Instead, 18 months later, the Minister of State announced a feasibility study to see if the pool was feasible at all.  Here we had a Government committed to spending £1 million of Exchequer money, telling us 18 months later that they did not have a clue about the project and would have to carry out a feasibility study to see if it could go ahead.  What way is that to handle £1 million of Exchequer funds?  Once national lottery funds are handed over they become Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of my knowledge of my own constituency I am aware of that piece of mounmental bungling.  It was only finally righted by the swimming pool committee and local public representatives.  We must presume that there was a similar cock up in most other areas.  If cheques arrived by Fianna Fáil couriers to organisations who had not even applied for <Col N="266" /> grants, never mind given details of plans, what other attitude can we assume the Government have to this money other than regarding it as a slush fund for the re-election of local Deputies and representatives?  The politicising of the national lottery's surplus money is deeply resented by the public who subscribe to the lottery and by all of us as citizens who expect the community to benefit on an even-handed basis, not on the basis of political pull.</P>
    <P>Cynicism was replaced by farce when the Minister for the Environment unveiled his plans for the local authorities to recommend projects.  The Minister served, and maybe still does, on Mayo County Council and knows better than anyone else just how ridiculous it is to ask county councillors to recommend one project and reject another, to give it to Crossmolina and not to Belmullet, to give it to Louisburg and not to Newport.  What happened was totally predictable.  Everything would be recommended.  One must conclude that this was part of the masterplan.In Sligo County Council we recommended 139 projects costing £5.8 million. The total available for distribution in the entire country was £6.5 million.  I do not know how we missed out on the remaining £500,000 or so.  The Minister can now point to the fact that in theory he gave the councils the opportunity to make recommendations.  All the time he knew this would be impossible and that he would make the decisions himself as he always intended, with the good support of his Minister of State, Deputy Ger Connolly, who is a good man at recommending these things himself.  Once again we would have the Fianna Fáil TDs, this time presumably accompained by the PDs, dispensing lottery largesse as if it were their own personal gift to the chosen few.</P>
    <P>The national lottery was an imaginative move to benefit sport, the arts and health.  It was brilliantly successful in collecting that money&mdash;some would say it was too successful.  At last it seemed we could do something meaningful for sport and for the arts and repair to some extent the total neglect of 50 years by all <Col N="267" /> Governments.  All this was possible until the Fianna Fáil Government were unable once again to resist the temptation and were unable to do the decent thing by handling this money on merit, not on a political basis.  Then they proceeded to compound this and to show disrespect for the workings of this House by setting up an all-party working committee on national lottery funding, going along with its recommendations and then not only doing nothing about it but doing the opposite.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with the allocation of funds I must mention that I had the interesting experience and pleasure of attending last Friday a national lottery draw in my parish in the Gweedore Gaeltacht in north-west Donegal.The first participant in the draw spun the wheel and won £250,000.  He was a gentleman from the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State, one Christy Cahill from Ballybrittas who went home from Gweedore a very happy man.  We hope to see him back in the Gweedore Gaeltacht before the end of the summer to leave some of his winnings there because we could do with a little boost to tourism in that beautiful part of the country.</P>
      <P>It gave me great pleasure as the Fine Gael spokesman on Gaeltacht affairs that the entire proceedings were conducted trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Ronan Collins agus an t-iomlán acu, rinneadar gach rud i nGaeilge.  Therefore I compliment the staff of the national lottery for the professional way they go about their duties. They are doing an excellent job.  Some would say they are doing it far too well since other charities are suffering.  I would not attach any blame to the staff of the national lottery.  They were given a job to do and are doing it very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> They are succeeding in bringing in £140 million or £150 million a year. We have no bone of contention with them.  It is entirely with the disbursement and allocation of funds carried out absolutely on a political basis by our political masters on the other side of the House. Almost two years ago to the day I in this House, presented the Taoiseach with an account of the misappropriateion of lottery funds in north County Dublin. It was brought to my attention that 49 allocations were made at that time in north County Dublin, 26 applications were submitted to the Department and the other 23 projects that got £175,000 did not even submit an application form. If that is not a misappropriation of funds, what is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what was intended, but I have a list of the projects. Perhaps they were worthy, good projects and deserved everything they got, but for some of them an application form was not even submitted.  I was innocent enough at the time to believe this was confined to north County Dublin, but no sooner had the news broken than I was getting phone calls from Deputies, colleagues and local authorities in various parts of the country, to the effect that what I had uncovered was only the tip of the iceberg, as far as they knew half the allocations in 1988 were given to projects for which an application form had not even been submitted.  How were the designations arrived at?  How were the projects designated?Who made the decision?  Of course it was entirely political.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the furore created at the time the all party committee were established. All parties participated in that committee, recommendations were made and the powers of allocation were to be given to local authorities.  Here we are two years later and every one of us knows these recommendations were never implemented.  It was just a farce.  We know extensive lists of projects were sent to local authorities and my colleague, <Col N="269" /> Deputy Shatter, mentioned a number of applications from Dublin.  I am proud to say that my county, County Donegal where we are a most industrious people, had 207 applications &mdash; all very worthy projects &mdash; at a total cost of £2.464 million.When our local authority got that list the councillors, sound politicians that they are, went through the projects and nodded agreement that each was worthy of assistance, and sent it to the Department because they were not given the responsibility to make the allocation. They were not given the funds.  They were told to read the list and send it back to the Department.  So far there has been absolutely no change.  It rests with the Minister at the moment.</P>
    <P>Until this year the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, had some say in the matter, but the major change that has been brought about &mdash; it is stated in the Minister's own amendment &mdash; is that the Minister for the Environment will look after the educational and environmental projects, and we all know the job he did last time and how he decided where the money should go.</P>
    <P>I know very well there are Deputies and Senators on the Government side who have a path beaten to the Minister's door in these last few weeks and these allocations are about to be made &mdash; and we all know what the yardstick will be if what has happened in the past is anything to go by.  The money will be given out on a political basis.  That happened in the past and I am very much afraid the same yardstick and criteria will be used in the future.  I pity the many voluntary organisations and groups in my county and constituency, and throughout the country, who have put so much work and effort into community projects, playing fields, clubs and many other worthy projects.They have spent thousands of pounds, and unless they are digging with the right political foot, they have no chance of getting any allocation.  It is a disgraceful use and abuse of lottery funds.</P>
    <P>It still is not too late.  The Minister should give an independent authority or <Col N="270" /> body authority to make these allocations. It gives everyone a bad name and it does not help the lottery if it is seen to be a slush fund, as it has been until now.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an all party committee formed after this debate who will see the projects that have been grant aided so far, how the money is being spent and whether it is being spent in the right way, and report back here to the House.</P>
    <P>Mar arlabhraí Ghaeltachta, ba mhaith liom an oiread seo a rá, go gcuireann sé isteach go mór orm nach bhfuil aon chiste Gaeilge sna Meastachain.  There is no ciste Gaeilge in the Estimates this last two or three years.  The ciste Gaeilge has been abolished.  There is no subhead in the Estimates for the Irish language organisations.  They get their allocation out of lottery funds now and this is placing the Irish language organisations in a very difficult position.  It is almost impossible to plan for the years ahead when you do not know what you are going to get until the Minister, in his own good time, decides, and that is open to political abuse as well because if you are depending on the Minister for your allocation it is in your interest to be nice to him, to be respectful and not criticise him.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I would like to say but I want to give my remaining few minutes to my colleague, Deputy Finucane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether Deputy Donal Creed, Minister of State, when he introduced the lottery ever thought it would be debased and would degenerate into the present situation.  I am sure that what is happening was not the original concept.  Is what has evolved over time not a terrible disappointment? Not so long ago in my own county of Limerick two Ministers were openly competing to allocate money and we had the farce of a reverend mother of a convent saying one Minister who was claiming credit had never even approached her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all expected something imaginative in relation to this national lottery, but the situation seems to have worsened. Recently in the Dáil I referred to it as the <Col N="271" /> potential miracle of loaves and fishes with £6.5 million being allocated by the Minister and over £160 million worth of applications.  How is the Minister to satisfy all those interests?  Is it any wonder that local authority representatives, councillors elected around the country, who saw possibly some role for themselves in the disbursement of this funding, are disappointed?  Is it any wonder we were all made fools of?  An amount of money had already accumulated in the Department of the Environment when the Minister decided in a magnanimous gesture to hand the role back to the local authorities, as he stated.  Councillors went out and beat the bushes and said, &ldquo;For God's sake send in applications&rdquo;, particularly Fianna Fáil councillors in my constituency.  We thought a bonanza had arrived.  What happened?  Applications for a total of £5 million came from Limerick County Council, and the same can probably be said about every county. Expectations had been built up and fuelled unnecessarily.  Money has been expended on projects which will see no largesse dispensed in their direction.  It cannot be if the Minister sticks to £6.5 million.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better if the situation prevailed as in the past, when amenity grants were given as block grants to county councils and the county councils had discretion in allocating those funds because they knew the projects which most deserved help?  How many of those applicants know there is a criterion which stipulates that they have to find 30 per cent of the funding themselves?  These facts were not explained to the people who made submissions for national lottery funding.</P>
    <P>The whole thing is in a Mickey Mouse shambles at present; it is even worse than what preceded it.  The Minister now has to decide what to do.  Everybody is waiting in expectation of his great announcement of this £6.5 million.  I tell him to venture into the country like a Messiah. Where is he going to give this money? Where are our righteous, responsible brethren over there, solitary and all <Col N="272" /> alone, Bobby?  Where is Mary this evening to back you up?  You were looking for responsibility for this funding. Where is all the noise at this stage?</P>

Of course, that is not the way Deputy Shatter sees things and so I am obliged to go over that ground once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The all-party working group on the method of allocating national lottery funds were set up in November 1988 to advise the Government on the effective and accountable disbursement of the lottery surplus.  They held six meetings and <Col N="275" /> presented their report which mentioned that within the limits of the time available they had made a brief examination of the then system of allocating and accounting for national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>As regards the amenity grants scheme, as it was then, the working group recommended that the scheme funded from the national lottery in 1987-88 should in future be operated by the local authorities with block grants being made by the Department of the Environment to the local authorities at Estimates time. The working group considered this would avoid duplication and would remove any degree of perceived patronage which could have an adverse effect on the lottery.That, in essence, was the working group's recommendations on amenity grants.  Prior to any Government decisions on the matter, their report was examined and basic flaws in the recommendations affecting the amenity grants scheme were identified.  These have been mentioned already in the House but obviously I must put them on the record once again.</P>
    <P>Basically what the working group recommended would have involved duplication of effort and would not have been in keeping with the spirit of flexibility which is essential in the administration of the amenity grants scheme. What was envisaged was the submission of a programme of amenity works by each local authority which realistically would have meant a list of projects with descriptions of the works, costings, extent of local contributions and so on.  This data would then have to be evaluated by my Department who would, having regard to population and the amenity grants already allocated to that area, have to determine a block grant.</P>
    <P>No indication was given in the group's recommendations of how much weight ought to be given to the various factors I have mentioned.  A determination of grants on a strict population basis would have meant the more densely populated areas like Dublin and Cork would have received the lion's share of the allocation while counties like Roscommon, Leitrim, <Col N="276" /> Cavan, Mayo, etc., would have received virtually nothing at all.  Similarly, the determination of a block grant on the basis of programmes submitted would have meant a disproportionate amount of funds going to a few areas which were quick off the mark&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with an impressive list of projects.  If the group's recommendations were followed, the block grants as determined by my Department on whatever basis would be communicated to local authorities who would then process applications locally and make allocations.  This would have involved duplication since a similar exercise would, in effect, have already been done in the Department in arriving at the amount of the block grant.  There was a strong likelihood that many local authorities could and would choose different projects thereby rendering the selection exercise conducted in my Department and the concept of the block grant absolutely meaningless.  Local authorities would probably have given undue preference to their expensive projects, some of which might otherwise be financed from their own resources.</P>

      <P>If the making of the allocations was to be an executive function, strong pressure would undoubtedly have been put on managers by councillors and others for preference to be given to projects in their own particular areas.  If councillors were to select the specific projects I do not need to spell out the scope for controversy which would exist there. It has already been recognised by the speakers opposite.  Thus, controversy about methods of allocation would merely be transferred from national to <Col N="278" /> local level.  In addition controversy would continue at national level about the amounts of the block grants.  Deputies must agree that these are very real difficulties.They must accept that there is no way of allocating these funds that would give universal satisfaction.  I accept that.  To suggest that a system operated by local authorities would be less open to allegations of patronage than the present one is simply nonsensical.</P>
      <P>The procedures envisaged by the committee or something similar might have some chance of being workable in an allocation of say £20 million or £25 million could be made available annually for amenity grants.  However, in a situation where there can be no guarantee of funds from year to year and where the amounts available is relatively insignificant in relation to the demand, the only real conclusion is that the group's recommendations were too bureaucratic, invited too much duplication and would tend to discriminate against the small projects in more remote rural areas.</P>

      <P>Taking account of considerations such as these, the Government decided that the amenity grant scheme administered by the Department of the Environment and the recreational facilities grant scheme administered by the Department of Education were to be amalgamated into a single scheme and that grants under the new scheme were to be allocated by the Minister for the Environment to projects recommended by local authorities who will be responsible for processing applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resulting from the Government's decision there was a number of practical administrative arrangements to be put in train.  All applications made to my Department under the amenity grant scheme and to the Department of Education under the recreational facilities grant <Col N="279" /> scheme were transmitted to the relevant local authorities for consideration under the new scheme and it was left to each local authority to consider what arrangements were appropriate at local level to advise the public of the new scheme. They were told to do that, and they did it.</P>
    <P>In any event about 4,000 applications were recommended by the local authorities to the Department by the time the deadline, 28 February, for submission of recommendations was reached.  By way of general comment, I assume that when local authorities and their elected members were processing applications under the scheme they would have involved themselves in the process of eliminating unsuitable, untimely or inappropriate projects.  I am entitled to assume that all the projects recommended to me for consideration for grants are good projects deserving of support and I can proceed with confidence to make individual allocations on that basis.</P>

The demand is great and it is a clear indicator in the community that environmental awareness exists around the country and that people would like to get a grant to help out in these projects.  Everyone of the 4,500 applications has been cleared, are eligible and have some backup of demand for the money.  They cannot all get it.</P>

      <P>About 4,000 applications <Col N="283" /> have been sent to me.  All of these have been recommended by the local authorities as worthy of grant assistance and I would not want to quibble with the local authorities' assessments.  The sum available to meet these applications represents 4 per cent of the amount claimed. This, I can assure the Deputies, is not an easy matter to resolve.  The problem is a complex one.  First, one has to attempt to ensure that each local authority area receives an appropriate total allocation. Then there has to be a fair allocation with each local authority area.  From that we go to assessing the merits of the individual projects and in doing so a large element of competition comes into play.  I would very much like if it were otherwise but when the amount available for distribution forms such a small part of the amount sought and where it is desirable to distribute the money on the fairest possible basis then there is no alternative but to assess the various projects on a comparative basis.  I have to say that the small staff in that section have been working pretty hard on this taking into account the time that was available.</P>

      <P>Associated with this is the question of assessing the actual amount of cash which ought to be made available for each successful project.  Here again the problem is a multifaceted one.  Among the matters which must be taken into account is the worthiness of the project from the amenity or recreational point of view, its total cost, the amount of the grant sought and the amount of money available locally and other relevant factors.  Those factors must be taken into account and fitted into the local and national context before the allocations can be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that I want to announce the grants at the earliest possible time.  A lot of the work has been done and I am not prepared to <Col N="284" /> countenance any slipshod or haphazard method of selection.

      <P>The success of the national lottery has, I believe, far exceeded the expectations of this House, as expressed in the debate in the legislation setting it up.  It has emerged as a source of major funding to Government and my party have been greatly concerned to ensure that a fair and accountable system for the allocation of these enormous funds be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important at the outset to remember that this very fundamental requirement was not undertaken by Fine Gael and Labour when they, in Government, established the national lottery.  There <Col N="285" /> were no set procedures for applying and, consequently, there was no transparency, enabling the ordinary citizen to see whether lottery funds were being fairly distributed.  In the last Dáil, when in Opposition, the Progressive Democrats consistently highlighted the need for such a fair allocations system and were severely critical of some of the practices that were being indulged in.  There was no formal scheme established whereby any citizen or group could lodge an application that could be seen to compete on its merits with other applications; there were no statutory criteria laid down for the assessment of applications; there was no formal procedure to be complied with in deciding and allocating these vast sums of money.  Reports and rumours were rife of individual favouritism, decisions based on inadequate information and even cases of large grants being allocated where the named applicant was not aware that an application had been lodged.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael spokespersons who have participated in the debate tried to place the blame for this on one named party but I should like to remind them that the first allocation of lottery funds was made by Fine Gael prior to the 1987 elections.  Funds were allocated for sports projects and I consider that they were bogus allocations because there were no projects, no sites and viability studies were not carried out in regard to any of the applications.  The whole thing was a cheap-shot vote purchasing exercise carried out by them before the 1987 election. They were hypocritical in some of their comments tonight in respect of their record and if Deputies want evidence of that I am in a position to produce it.</P>
    <P>It was because of what happened that public confidence in the system was at a low level and there was need for urgent reform.  In pursuit of the objective of establishing accountability and fairness in the allocation of lottery funding, the Progressive Democrats brought forward <Col N="286" /> a Private Members Bill in the Dáil in 1988 which had as its core objective&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>But no core values.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth reminding the House tonight the reason that Bill failed to be adopted, given that the country at the time had a minority Government. The reason it failed was because one of the Opposition parties, the Labour Party, failed to support it.  A glorious opportunity was lost on that occasion to establish an independent agency to oversee the disbursement of lottery funds.</P>
      <P>Moving on then to last June-July's negotiations on the formation of the Government, this issue was brought forward by the Progressive Democrats.  As a result, the agreed Programme for Government included a provision that the incoming Government would consider the interim report of the all-party working group on the system of administering and allocating lottery funds with a view to introducing a new method of allocation.  The Government undertook such a review shortly after taking office and this led to the revised method of allocation which was published last October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government amendment before the House highlights the key elements of the new lottery allocation scheme agreed then.  These included the amalgamation of the amenity grants scheme and the recreational facilities grants scheme, into a single scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for the Environment.  The new system also introduced a uniform and standardised <Col N="287" /> system of application for lottery funding whereby interested organisations, groups and individuals around the country would make initial application for national lottery funds to their local authority, who were given responsibility for processing the applications, and making recommendations to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The further measures agreed also mean that the Minister for Health allocates block grants to the health boards to be assigned by them to local voluntary bodies, while grants to voluntary bodies in the welfare area continue to be administered by the Minister for Social Welfare.Grants for the arts are now administered by the arts council, and, in accordance with the findings of the all-party working group on lottery funding, there was no change made in the arrangements for administering lottery funds allocated for youth, Irish language projects and for current sports expenditure, while the Minister for Education retains responsibility for allocations for sports centre projects.</P>
      <P>I, and my party, are quite satisfied that this revised system of allocating lottery funds represents very significant improvements on the previous situation. It introduced accountability and transparency.It regularised the manner in which groups and individuals could seek assistance from the national lottery, and it gave local authorities a pivotal role in deciding what projects would be forwarded to the Minister for the Environment where amenity and other recreational grants were being sought. Under the new scheme also the local authorities could prioritise the various applications they were receiving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">

      <P>The comments of the Minister for Energy sounded rather strange as he seemed to say that the existing system of local government would not be satisfactory or adequate to administer the grant scheme but that an amended form of local government structures &mdash; which may come about &mdash; would be perfectly adequate.  His response is very much at variance with the comments he made when his party's Private Members' Bill was being debated in the Dáil on 16 November 1988.  Very little has changed since then, the same powers are still vested in and retained by the Minister for the Environment for the disbursement of funds.  At that time, Deputy Molloy interrupted on many occasions when the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, made his speech, for example, at column 847, volume 384, of the Official <Col N="292" /> Report of 16 November 1988 the Minister, Deputy Flynn said:</P>
      <P>The allocations made are not in strict proportion to the population or other equivalent criteria as between different areas.  There were crucial considerations to be taken into account other than strict demography.</P>
      <P>At this point, Deputy Molloy chipped in: &ldquo;We know all about them&rdquo;.  Well, we still know all about them, and Minister Molloy knows that they apply now with the same force as they applied then.  In the same column further on, Minister Flynn said:</P>
      <P>I had to make a judgment between two good options and, inevitably, in every case I had to disappoint at least one of those good options.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: Is that why you got rid of Cong?</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to see what becomes of Cong in the next disbursement made by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment was at pains in his speech to say that the local authorities were totally unsuitable as a body to administer the grants scheme, that there were many shortcomings, that it was much better to retain them in his Department because the local authorities did not have the resources to examine them and that small groups would not be fairly treated.</P>

      <P>He gave a host of reasons for local authorities not being the appropriate bodies to deal with the disbursement of lottery funds.  I do not know how many Members of the House disagree with the Minister's statement in that regard but you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, certainly disagree with that statement because, apart from what you may say, you signed your name to a report on 18 January 1989 &mdash; I have a facsimile of the document with your signature on it &mdash; in which you <Col N="293" /> said that local authorities are best placed to ensure that facilities are provided where they are most needed.  Therefore, you appear to be at variance with the Minister's statement in that regard and, no doubt, you will consider your voting position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure your signature was there as a result of co-operation and the briefing of your party and the same applies to Deputy Harney.  Quite clearly, the message there is that local authorities are in the best position to disburse the funds.  Of course, many of the recommendations of the joint committee were adopted by the Minister in his statement, with one exception, the provision of block grants to local authorities from which disbursements would be made.</P>
      <P>On 8 November 1988 Deputy Harney moved the Private Members' Bill, which has been referred to, to reform the national lottery and was absolutely scathing about the way in which Fianna Fáil had abused the disbursement of lottery funds for political purposes.  She referred to the fact that, during the previous April, she had drawn attention to the scandalous manner in which members of the then Government were allocating the proceeds of the lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney stated, at column 2120 <Col N="294" /> of the Official Report of 8 November, 1988:</P>
    <P>I said then that the national lottery was in danger of becoming a national scandal and that an independent allocation process was necessary if public trust and confidence in the lottery was not to be eroded.  Unfortunately, the abuse has escalated since then and the spectacle of seeing a pipe band leading the Minister for Agriculture into a town to announce the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; from the lottery has disgusted and sickened most ordinary, decent people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have engaged in the most despicable exercise in gombeen politics ever seen in this country in the way they have handled the allocations from the national lottery.  The behaviour of this Government is seriously jeopardising the future of the lottery itself and leading many people to the view that Fianna Fáil see the lottery as merely a re-election slush fund.</P>
    <P>In the course of that speech the present Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, went on to draw particular attention to the responsibility given to the Minister for the Environment to allocate £6 million for amenity and recreational purposes. Having analysed the way in which that money had been disbursed up to that time, the then Deputy Harney pointed out to the House at column 2125 of the Official Report of 8 November, 1988:</P>
    <P>... The criteria the Minister for the Environment used were clearly based on his own constituency consideration and not on the basis of need.  Of the 49 applications approved by the Minister for the Environment for the County Dublin area up to the beginning of May this year, 26 went to the Dublin North constituency represented by the Minister, Deputy Burke.</P>
    <P>In concluding her speech Deputy Harney referred to a six point policy priority programme launched by the then Deputy <Col N="295" /> Desmond O'Malley for the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>She went on:</P>
    <P>One of the six points to which we believe priority must be given in Irish politics is the question of decent standards in public life.  This Bill is about the issue of public confidence in political standards and it is far too important an issue to be funked.  Anyone who thinks that a majority Fianna Fáil Government would be good for this country has only to observe their antics in relation to the national lottery.  Anything left to their discretion is abused and when one sees the way they allocated the £71 million from the lottery one must wonder what they would do if they had full control over the nation's finances.</P>
    <P>What we are now doing, the Minister for Energy notwithstanding, is leaving that control with the Minister for the Environment.Later on in the same debate &mdash; at column 2437 of the Official Report of 9 November, 1988 the Leader of the Progressive Democrats had this to say:</P>
    <P>After 65 years of our independence the citizens of this country if they want to apply for public assistance for some project of public merit and value that they want to undertake, are entitled to do that on the basis that as citizens of this country they have equal rights with any other citizens and they can go and look for something on the basis of the need of the project and the merit of the project.  They are entitled as Irish citizens under our Constitution not to have to act like 19th century peasants aproaching a gombeen man with their cap in their hand virtually on their knees, begging and pleading as a favour to them from an omnipotent and omniscient TD that they should be entitled to some kind of financial assistance for some project that they and others are pursuing in their own locality.  I had hoped we had put that <Col N="296" /> sort of approach behind us, that we could deal with citizens on an equal and fair basis.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy O'Malley drew particular attention to the &ldquo;amazing coincidence&rdquo; that of 49 applications approved in Dublin during that time, no fewer than 26 should come from the Dublin North constituency of the then Minister for Energy, Mr. Burke.  He pointed out that the remarkable thing about it was that the Dublin North constituency was the only three-seat constituency in Dublin under the present disposition.  Therefore, he said, it was the smallest constituency and had the smallest population in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the debate in which these remarks were made was that on a Progressive Democrats Private Members' Bill, the purpose of which was to establish an independent method of distributing lottery funds.  Following Labour Party intervention in that debate the then Government agreed to the establishment of an all-party committee on the national lottery.  As everybody knows, that committee was chaired by ex-TD, Barry Desmond and included yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and Deputies Donal Creed, Mary Harney and Joe Sherlock.  It is worth recording what the committee had to say about amenity grants, the essential subjects of the motion before the House this evening.  The committee's report said:</P>
    <P>The amenity grant scheme funded from the national lottery in 1987-88 should in future be operated by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I might point out that that proposal was agreed by all parties and signed accordingly.The committee's report continued:</P>
    <P>From the total amount allocated by Government for this purpose block grants should be made by the Department of the Environment to the local authorities at the time the authorities estimates for the year are being set. <Col N="297" /> In determining the level of the block grants of lottery funds for each authority consideration should be given to the population of the area, the programme of amenity works submitted by the authority and the amount already allocated to the area for amenity grants.  Each authority would then be responsible for processing applications from local organisations, making allocations to voluntary and community groups and for projects undertaken by the authority itself and issuing payments and accounting for payments.</P>
    <P>This would avoid duplication and would remove any degree of perceived patronage which could have an adverse effect on the lottery.  Local authorities are best placed to ensure that facilities are provided where they are most needed.</P>
    <P>The group notes that, under the present amenity grant scheme, local authorities are required to approve and recommend projects.  The group considers that local authorities would tend to be more objective about approving projects, ensuring that they were viable and avoiding duplication, if the grants were being paid from the authorities' own budgets.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the content of this recommendation is extremely specific.  This is the only point in the report of the working group to which reference is made to the issue of &ldquo;perceived patronage&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that in December 1988 and January 1989 even yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as the sole Government representative on that committee, shared the general view that there was something seriously wrong with the existing method of handing out lottery money.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, a considerable time elapsed between the issuing of the report of the all-party committee and the Government indicating that they were <Col N="298" /> prepared to do anything about its recommendations.In fact, the announcement came as late as October 1989 in response, unusually, to parliamentary questions tabled by myself, Deputies Spring and Sherlock.  In the meantime Deputy Desmond O'Malley had become Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Harney Minister of State in the self-same Department she had so effectively abused in her contribution to the debate in November 1988.  The Government response came as no great surprise to anybody on this side of the House &mdash; that they had decided to keep for themselves the granting of national lottery funds for amenity purposes and that the authority to disburse such funds was going to be retained in the hands of the self-same Minister for the Environment, now Deputy Harney's boss.</P>
    <P>Against that background I find it absolutely beyond belief that Ministers O'Malley and Harney, and the other four Progressive Democrat TDs, are going to troop into this House tomorrow evening to vote for the maintenance of that self-same system they so roundly condemned not much more than 18 months ago.  At that time they were so convinced of its potential for abuse they were prepared to go to the lengths of publishing a Private Members' Bill and to argue in this House that the management of national lottery funds could not be entrusted to Fianna Fáil but ought, instead, to be entrusted to High Court judges and the like.  One has to ask: what has changed?  In particular, what has changed the minds of Ministers O'Malley and Harney?  If the system was corrupt then, surely it is still corrupt?  If the principles were fundamental then, surely they are still fundamental?Or is it the case simply that being in possession of high office automatically changes the standards and outlook of people like the Progressive Democrats?  We already had evidence within the past week of the willingness of the Progressive Democrats to come to the aid of Fianna Fáil in their attempt to <Col N="299" /> damage the interests of RTE.  It now seems clear that the Progressive Democrats are not to be trusted when they talk to us at great length about integrity and the need for high standards in high places.</P>
    <P>Of course there is another consideration.The sum of £6.5 million has been set aside this year for allocation for amenity grant purposes.  So far, according to the latest information available, approximately 4,000 applications have been received, amounting in total to requests for grant aid of approximately £163 million.  In effect, this means that the average amount applied for is in excess of £41,000 for each organisation looking for assistance and the average amount available to the Minister per organisation is approximately £1,600.</P>
    <P>Surely it is abundantly clear, even for the most practicable of purposes, that organisations wishing to apply for assistance under the national lottery should have spelled out to them clear, basic, understandable criteria?  They should be told in advance that there is a bottom line and a very limited amount of money available.  Local authorities who &mdash; as the all-party committee report states &ldquo;are provided where they are most needed&rdquo;&mdash; should be given the task of allocating the money according to specified criteria. That is not just the honourable way to proceed; it is also the practical way to proceed.  Instead, the money is being held by the Minister and the only conclusion that can be drawn is that he is holding it until such time as it can be distributed in the most politically advantageous way.</P>
    <P>I fully expect to see large sums of money being scattered around the Dublin West constituency in the autumn with a view to preparing the people in that constituency for a by-election in the increasingly unlikely even that the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, succeeds in his bid to become President of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The saga of Verolme Dockyard has been going on since it went into liquidation in 1984.  Numerous attempts have been made by the liquidator to dispose of the assets and hopefully have the yard reopened.  In the last three years there have been rumours that the yard was reopening, including talk that an American company were going to build an oil rig there which would be towed to the Mediterranean and used for drilling oil off the Malta coast.  This was to be commissioned by the American Government.Our Government were also in conference with the Government of the Soviet Union early last year when there was talk that a deal would be done with the dockyard for the repair of Russian fishing ships and the Irish Government were to give the Russian Government something, which was unnamed, in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About this time last year I said that neither of these options should be entertained by the Government because they were not in the interests of the workers in Verolme Dockyard.  The American deal would have been a temporary arrangement because once the rig was built it would be towed away and the yard would be shut again.  As regards the Russian deal, there were too many question marks over the <i>quid pro quo</i> and it was not clear whether a quota of Irish fish would be part of the deal.  At that stage I said I was in favour of a Norwegian company which were negotiating with the receiver for the purchase of the yard.  The <Col N="301" /> company concerned had a lot of experience in ship repairing and ship-building and I felt they would perform extremely well and give continued employment over a good number of years.  By way of Dáil questions, on a number of occasions since, I have tried to get information on precisely what was happening, but without much success.</P>
    <P>Last Friday in Cork the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said the dockyard would reopen within a year, that the Government had instructed the receiver to negotiate a contract with a European ship-building firm, that the deal would be clinched within a fortnight and the yard would reopen for ship repairing with initial employment of 80 to 100 people and, depending on the orders, increasing to 300 in three or four years time.  The Minister declined to say who the company concerned were except that they were from a European Community country.  On the same day the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, said the company concerned were Dutch-based. The following day, the Minister for Finance, who is here to reply to this debate, acknowledged that there had been a drive in the last seven or eight years to reopen the yard and said there would be an announcement in the next few weeks.  He said a company who have links with a Belgian company just beat a Dublin-based company in a £2 million deal to reopen the dockyard.</P>
    <P>There are three Government Ministers involved here.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said, without naming them, the company concerned are an EC company; the Minister for Energy said they are a Dutch based concern; and the Minister for Finance, on Friday or Saturday last, said they are a Belgian company.</P>

      <P>I was going to say the Ministers know what is going on but obviously the two Ministers from the Progressive Democrats do not.  About a month earlier they allowed a Broadcasting Bill through which contained matters that they subsequently had to twist the arm of the Government to change.  I wish they would show the same enthusiasm in getting the Government to change their minds about matters such as divorce and extradition.  They do not seem to have any muscle when it comes to important issues like saving lives, but they have plenty of muscle when it comes to getting publicity in regard to RTE.</P>
      <P>On 6 June the Minister for Finance said during Question Time, at column 1339, volume 399, of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by the receiver of Verolme Cork Dockyard (VCD) to have the yard reopened... My Department along with other Departments and State agencies are actively involved in this process.  Several Norwegian companies have shown interest in the yard, including one company which has come forward very recently.  My Department along with the other Departments/agencies involved have had direct contact with the various interested parties, including the Norwegian companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three Ministers and four countries involved.  I would like to find out precisely what is happening.

      <P>The case presented by Deputy Barry here tonight clearly outlines the confusion which exists in relation to the plans for the dockyard.  I hope the Minister will give clarification as to the plans.  Without a doubt, in the past number of weeks there has been a great deal of speculation in the area that good news was to be announced, but so many people have been announcing the news, and so many different types of news have been announced, that people are concerned that their optimism is not well founded.  I hope the Minister will clarify the issue tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to go into the issue in detail.  Obviously all Members here tonight are fully aware of the situation that has existed since the closure of the yard.  It is worth while saying that most of the people who lost their jobs when the yard closed have not only failed to find employment since then but in many cases have had no option but to emigrate. It is absolutely essential that the Government ensure that a deal is put together that the ship-building industry will operate again in Cobh and that the people there, and indeed the people of Cork, will be given some hope and that they <Col N="304" /> will be rid of the despair that has existed in the area for far too long.</P>

I am aware that over the past number of years the Minister and his officials have been making serious efforts to attract a company to the dockyard to make it a viable proposition.  The attack that has been made this evening, particularly by Deputy Barry, is completely unwarranted.  I must put on record that in 1984 the then senior Minister in Cork would not meet the trade union members or the workers in Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>

      <P>I have looked at the two extracts from the newspapers to which Deputy Barry referred: one is by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other by Deputy Molloy.  I do not see that I am quoted in any of the Cork papers.  If anyone can assist me on that I would be only too happy to answer that. A European shipyard company is interested in Verolme Cork dockyard. No deal has been signed.  The deal is well advanced and we are hopeful that it will be finalised.  As soon as it is finalised and is confirmed on both sides I will be only too happy to announce it to the people of Cork, to the House and to everybody else.  Until that happens I am not making any announcement and I am not making any further comment other than what I am saying here tonight.  That is the exact position.  The previous deal with the Norwegians, which Deputy Barry queried went to, one could say 11 to 4 on.  The reason we talked about the Norwegians in the reply on 6 June was that the question put down asked specifically if a Norwegian company was still interested. At that time two Norwegian companies were interested, one partly interested in association with a Norwegian company. At the last moment some German shipyard intervened and offered a subsidy. Of course, the major problem about trying to sell shipyards is that every company interested wants both subsidies and soft loans because that is the general practice around the world.  We have tried to avoid that from the very start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the basis on which the present agreement is being drawn up: no subsidies, no soft loans but a straight purchase price based on a business plan that will show a build-up from ship repairs <Col N="306" /> into ship building over a period of years and with &ldquo;no assets stripping&rdquo; clause involved.  The deal is still not signed, still not finalised.  I would hope to finalise it as soon as possible.  It is a European firm so I do not see any conflict between what any of us are saying in relation to it.  I am sure I reflect the views of everybody when I say: &ldquo;get the yard open as soon as possible&rdquo;.  We have made many efforts in the past to sell it but they have fallen through at the last moment.  I hope this will succeed.  It is there since 1984.  It is in the interests of the workers of Cork and the future of Cork.  It is heavy engineering and it is a fine yard.  I constantly resisted, both in my role as Minister for Industry and Commerce and as Minister for Finance, having the yard split up.  It could have been disposed of on many occasions it it has been broken up but I did not allow that because ship repairing or ship building would never have the facility to take off again.  I will be making the announcement if and when we finalise the deal.  I am hopeful that we can finalise it but then one is never sure until the ink is dry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in bringing this matter to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare.  It involves the procedures within the Department of Social Welfare in relation to appeals made by three young men in Tralee regarding decisions made pertaining to their entitlement or otherwise to unemployment assistance.  Whereas the immediate problem relates to social welfare the problem also would involve the Department of Labour and the Department of the Environment in relation to the efforts these men have been making over the past 12 months to form a viable recycling co-operative covering the town of Tralee and, indeed, the County of Kerry.</P>
      <P>The situation at present is that they have received a decision from the Department of Social Welfare.  I understand the Minister is aware of the names of these people but I can give them if required.  They received a decision, on the grounds that they were not available for employment from 21 March 1990, that they would not qualify for unemployment assistance because of the clause &ldquo;being available for work and genuinely looking for work&rdquo;.  I have heard many statements from the Minister for Social Welfare during his term of office as Minister for Social Welfare, that he was seeking to introduce flexibility in the regulations pertaining to unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit to ensure that persons have opportunities to come back into the workforce.  This is the exact type of case he has referred to on many occasions here in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three young men, who have had difficulty in breaking out of the unemployment cycle, took it upon themselves to try to organise a recycling co-operative in the town of Tralee.  Indeed, they have been working as volunteers for nearly a year to create the possibility of a legitimate income for themselves and their families in the area of reclamation and <Col N="308" /> recyclables collections.  At one stage they had tremendous co-operation from the local FÁS office and had feasibility studies carried out by the Regional Technical College in Tralee which established that the project would be viable provided initital grant assistance is forthcoming to the group.  Unfortunately, because of the Department of Social Welfare decision of 21 March 1990 and also of the threat by the local health board, the three people in question will now lose their supplementary welfare benefit.  These people are faced with a very unsavoury prospect.  They have been trying to create work for themselves on a voluntary basis. They are available for work.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the unemployment rate in the town of Tralee and in County Kerry at present varies between 18 per cent and 21 per cent of the work force. There are no immediate prospects available to them.</P>
    <P>Because of the difficulty and the lack of work opportunities they set out to create an opportunity for themselves with the co-operation of FÁS, which has ended, and with some initial co-operation from local authorities, which is not as forthcoming as I would like to see particularly in the context of the project they are trying to set up.  The project is one which I would have thought the Departments of the Environment and Labour, in particular, would have genuinely set out to assist, given the necessity for bringing about recycling programmes.  I would like if the Minister &mdash; I am glad he is in the House this evening &mdash; could ensure that these people are again given the opportunity to obtain assistance from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In relation to their appeal, which was heard, they were not informed of their right to be legally represented at that appeal.  Also all the three members of the recycling co-operative were heard together, not individually as they should have been entitled to under the social welfare code.  They are available for <Col N="309" /> work.  Without any stretch of the imagination they are doing something which may provide them with viable jobs in the long-term.  They are doing it on a voluntary basis.  There is no profit being derived from what they are doing at present.  I would ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he could intervene to reverse the decision which has been made by his Department.  The Minister has frequently stated his commitment to the introduction of legislation which will allow non-paid workers with community co-operatives and other bodies to receive unemployment payments.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to show his commitment in this area and to show he is prepared to ensure that a system within the social welfare code has the necessary degree of flexibility.  I would also ask him to call on his colleagues, the Minister for Labour and the Minister for the Environment, to examine the project which these three young men, all with families, have been trying to get off the ground, and which holds a long-term prospect.  If the Department insist on refusing their unemployment assistance claims they will kill off any prospect this project has of getting off the ground thus leaving the three people concerned no choice but to Minleave the country.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene and ensure while they are trying to get the project off the ground that the Department of Social welfare allow them claim their social welfare entitlements.  The decision in this case has been harsh beyond reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, the people concerned are dealing with the Department of the Environment and the Department of Labour at present in relation to the development of this project. That is true but as the Deputy is, no doubt aware, decisions on entitlements under the Social Welfare Acts are given by deciding officers and appeals officers who are statutorily independent of the Minister.  Whether we agree with their <Col N="310" /> decisions or not, I must emphasise that my experience is that these deciding officers and appeals officers act with honesty and integrity in their application of the provisions of the Acts.  For this reason I must say I am saddened by the terms chosen by the Deputy to frame his motion.  By any objective interpretation these terms cast a shadow on the honesty and integrity of deciding officers and appeals officers in their application of the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts. They suggest they may at times choose to be deliberately harsh on applicants rather than act objectively.  This has not been the case, is not the case and will never be the case, especially while I am Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>A claimant for unemployment assistance must satisfy a means test in order to obtain a qualification certificate and, in addition, must satisfy the other statutory conditions of being capable of, available for, and genuinely seeking work to qualify for payment of assistance.</P>
      <P>When it became known that the three claimants were involved in the operation of an enterprise known as the Kerry Recycling Co-op, their claims were submitted to a deciding officer to determine whether they continued to fulfil the above mentioned conditions.  They were interviewed in connection with their involvement in the co-op and each of them admitted they were not available for alternative employment.  Accordingly, the deciding officer disallowed their claims on the basis that they were not available for work.</P>
      <P>They appealed this decision and were granted an oral hearing of their case on 16 May 1990.  Having considered all the evidence and the arguments vigorously presented to him, the appeals officer concluded that, by undertaking the foundation of the Kerry Recycling Co-op and by working full-time in the development of that scheme, the claimants were not available for work within the terms of the legislation.  He, accordingly, disallowed the three appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> I hope the Deputy will accept that in the circumstances I have explained and within the context of existing social welfare legislation the claimants in question have not been treated harshly.  They have been treated as sympathetically as possible within the terms of the legislation. We are in a changing world and the thinking and methods of yesterday are not appropriate to the circumstances of today and will be less appropriate for those of tomorrow.  Since I became Minister for Social Welfare I have introduced significant flexibility into the system governing unemployment payments.  I am continuing this process and I aim to achieve further progress within the confines of the principles which govern these payments and on which the relevant legislation is based.</P>
    <P>I have introduced measures to facilitate the participation of the unemployed in education courses, to allow them take up part-time work and do voluntary work of benefit to their communities while still receiving payments.</P>
    <P>At present I am finalising a pilot scheme to give certain unemployed persons the opportunity to pursue third level education courses on a full-time basis.  I also propose to include participation in certain community enterprise-type projects in this pilot scheme.  What I have in mind is an initiative which would bridge the gap between developing a project and qualifying for community enterprise programme or other assistance or becoming self-supporting.  The type of project the kerry Recycling Co-op are engaged in would, to my mind, be suitable for inclusion in the initiative.  Other projects <Col N="312" /> I hope to accommodate are projects for groups, such as travellers and the homeless, which have as their objective the reintegration of particularly disadvantaged people into the workforce.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it takes time to design and implement initiatives of this kind having regard to the need for controls and to the financial implications.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement about this in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured of my strong views that the unemployment system should be flexible and supportive of people when they are making every effort to make productive use of their time or to get back into the labour market.  That is why I am introducing the pilot scheme. I can assure the Deputy that this will be put in place in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 65 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>There is a total of 12 operational programmes under the Community Support Framework.  Five programmes have already been approved by the EC Commission.These are:</P>
      <P>(i) Environmentally Friendly Farming (Control of Farmyard Pollution) in August 1989;</P>
      <P>(ii) Industry and Services in late December 1989;</P>
      <P>(iii) Tourism in late December 1989;</P>
      <P>(iv) Exceptional Measures (one of the Human Resources Programmes) in January 1990;</P>
      <P>(v)  Training for the handicapped (another of the Human Resources Programmes) in January 1990.</P>
      <P>The other seven operational programmes, which are at various stages of negotiation with the EC Commission are:</P>
      <P>(vi)  Rural development;</P>
      <P>(vii)  Forestry;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> (viii)  Sanitary Services;</P>
    <P>(ix)  Peripherality &mdash; roads, rail, access transport;</P>
    <P>(x)  Training Infrastructure and Training of Trainers;</P>
    <P>(xi)  Adult long-term unemployed;</P>
    <P>Occupational integration of young people.</P>
    <P>The process of approving programmes has taken longer than expected.  The various Government Departments are, however, working in close co-operation with the EC Commission with a view to having the programmes approved at the earliest possible time.  I am optimistic that the remaining programmes will be approved in sufficient time to allow us to draw down our full entitlements in 1990. In the meantime I would like to assure Deputies that where Exchequer expenditure is involved, the programmes are already being implemented in advance of approval.</P>
    <P>As regards the sub-regional breakdown of expenditure, the Community Support Framework provides that each sub-regional review committee receive regular progress reports and financial statements on current and planned implementation of operational measures in, or significantly affecting, the sub-region concerned.  The relevant information is at present being compiled in respect of operational programmes approved to date and will be conveyed to the sub-regional review committees in accordance with the terms of the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to go beyond the requirements of the Community Support Framework and provide a breakdown of expenditure on a county basis.  The breakdown being provided will, therefore, relate only to the sub-regions specified in the National Development Plan and also referred to in the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>Information on the expenditure by operational programme in each of the sub-regions will be placed in the Dáil Library for the information of Members of the Oireachtas when available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 59 and 80 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total surplus available to the Exchequer from the activities of the national lottery in each year since its inception was as follows: 1987, £42.145 million; 1988, £38.553 million; 1989, £46.734 million.  As the Deputy is aware, <Col N="48" /> the procedure for allocation of the national lottery surplus is specified in the National Lottery Act 1986.  In accordance with section 5 of that Act, the determination of the broad purposes for which the surplus may be applied and the allocations to be made to each sector is a matter for the Government.  Lottery allocations are issued to approved projects by the relevant Government Departments as bills mature for payment.  Funds which are not required for immediate distribution remain on deposit in the national lottery fund in the Central Bank where they earn interest which adds to the surplus for distribution.</P>
    <P>Thus, actual issues to approved projects in each of the first three years were as follows: 1987, £10.815 million; 1988, £43.446 million; 1989, £47.685 million. There are allocations totalling £17.888 million approved over the period 1987-89 which have not yet been drawn down. These funds have been carried forward to the current year and are included in the detailed 1990 lottery allocations totalling £71.927 million as set out in the annex to the Revised Estimates for the Public Service 1990.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to provide midyear Estimates of the national lottery surplus already earned.  However, the £71.927 million allocated for 1990 includes the surplus forecast for 1990 as well as all unallocated and unspent balances brought forward from earlier years. I do not anticipate, therefore, that any further allocations will be made for this year.</P>
    <P>To-date, £17.3 million has been made available in respect of grants for amenity and recreational purposes administered by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education of which £8.125 million remained unspent at the beginning of this year.  Questions as to the take-up of these grants by individual clubs and organisations throughout the country should be addressed to the Minister into whose area of responsibility these grant schemes fall.</P>
    <P>Detailed questions about the spending <Col N="49" /> of lottery funds allocated for any purpose, including questions about the geographical distribution of grants, should also be addressed to the Ministers concerned.Of the funds administered by my Department, and by the Office of Public works which is within my area of responsibility, none has been provided for projects in Waterford county and city.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 38 together.  It is estimated that there are over 100,000 sites of archaeological significance in the country.  Two thousand four hundred have been registered and preservation orders have been made in respect of 391. There are over 600 monuments or groups of monuments in State ownership or guardianship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987 provides very extensive powers for the protection of historic monuments and archaeological areas.  It <Col N="50" /> provides for the setting up of a register of such monuments or areas and for very heavy fines for damage caused to them. The completion of the register is a major task which will take a number of years but I am satisfied that good progress is being made.  The Office of Public Works record and fully investigate any reports they receive of damage to monuments. They have no evidence that widespread damage and destruction is taking place.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Central Bank that the average prime lending rate in real terms for the years 1985 to 1989 was as follows: 1985, 6.7 per cent; 1986, 8.0 per cent; 1987, 7.8 per cent; 1988, 6.1 per cent; 1989, 5.2 per cent.  The current rate is around 7 per cent, only marginally above the average for the last five years and considerably below the 1986 peak. Moreover, the Irish real prime lending rate is not out of line with rates in other EMS countries; indeed the Irish rate is considerably below the rates in some of them.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, which are being taken to improve the position of clerical workers in the Civil Service, many of whom are on relatively low pay; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Civil and Public Services Union has said that it may ballot its members on industrial action, unless progress is made in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to the <Col N="51" />&ldquo;relatively low pay&rdquo; of many clerical workers in the civil service.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that pay rates in the civil service are set by a process of independent arbitration, the basic principle of such reviews being that civil servants should be paid the going rate for similar work outside the civil service.  Special increases of 6-9 per cent which were awarded to the two clerical grades in question following such a review at arbitration are currently being implemented under the terms of the Public Service Pay Agreement.  These increases are in addition to the standard increases under the agreement, which included a minimum increase specifically aimed at low paid workers.</P>
      <P>I understand the reference to ballots in the question to refer to the ballots taken by the Civil and Public Services Union in the office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare on the issue of the external recruitment of executive officers.  The union are attempting to prevent the appointment of the successful candidates in a recent competition for executive officer aimed at school leavers.  In effect, they are trying to impose a closed shop on recruitment to the Civil Service.  In the Office of the Revenue Commissioners a proposal for all-out industrial action was approved in a ballot and industrial action is already being taken by the union in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The union action is totally without justification.No attempt has been made to process this matter in accordance with the agreed negotiating procedures.  In view of the fact that externally recruited executive officers have been appointed to many Departments but industrial action has been taken only in the Department of Social Welfare, one must conclude that the union have decided to target the disadvantaged in their efforts to deny jobs to candidates who have succeeded in the executive officer competition.  Because of the flagrant breach of proper negotiating procedures, the General Council Staff Panel, comprising all of the civil service unions, has been approached in an <Col N="52" /> attempt to have the matter dealt with in accordance with proper procedures.  In view of the seriousness of the threatened industrial action the matter has also been brought to the attention of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I am hopeful that congress and the staff panel will take appropriate action to ensure that the agreed procedures are observed.</P>
    <P>The union would appear to have set themselves the objective of cutting off the main traditional source of recruitment to the civil service above clerical level.  The present position is that there is a longstanding arrangement, agreed with the civil service unions, under which half of the positions at executive officer level are filled internally and the other half by way of open competition (for which, of course, serving civil servants may compete if they have the necessary qualifications).However, in recent times, because no open competitions were held during the period of the embargo, virtually all appointments were made internally.  For example, in the Department of Social Welfare, where the union are taking industrial action over three appointments from the open competition, 75 internal promotions have been made to executive officer since the beginning of 1989; there were over 100 internal promotions in that period in the office of the Revenue Commissioners where the union have threatened all-out industrial action in that office if even one appointment is made from the open competition.In all, over 1,000 members of CPSU grades throughout the civil service have been promoted in that period.  The fact that CPSU members have benefited to such an extent from the suspension of open competitions for three years makes the present CPSU action all the more difficult to justify.</P>
    <P>I might mention that this is only the latest in a series of actions taken by the union in recent times which have disrupted services and inconvenienced the public.  Many of these disputes have been in pursuit of a general objective of increasing staff numbers to pre-1987 levels, the effect of which would be to dissipate the achievements of the last few <Col N="53" /> years in bringing the public finances under control.  The confrontational approach being adopted by the union is inconsistent with all good industrial relations practice and with the spirit underpinning the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The Government cannot countenance a situation in which services are continually being threatened and the public, particularly the most disadvantaged sections of the community, are being placed in the front line on industrial relations issues by the CPSU.  Unless the union are prepared to observe proper procedures in processing their claims and to instruct their members who are taking industrial action to work normally, there will be no alternative but to respond with the appropriate disciplinary measures. The Government have no desire for confrontation on this or any other issue but we will take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the public are protected from continuous disruption of services.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I would strongly urge the union to terminate the industrial action in which they are currently engaged, to withdraw all threats of further action and to abide by the agreed procedures in processing their claims.  Should the union abandon the path of confrontation and enter into negotiations in the proper manner, I can assure them that serious consideration will be given to any reasonable case they may put forward.  However, it must be accepted that the Civil Service must retain the means necessary to recruit an adequate number of qualified staff through the open competitions from which the top levels of the service have largely been drawn in the past.  Furthermore, school leavers and young graduates must not be denied employment opportunities which have traditionally been available to them.</P>

      <P>There is no right-of-way for vehicular traffic along the bank of the Barrow navigation at Fenniscourt Lock. There is pedestrian access to the canal banks.  Consequently the Office of Public Works have not extinguished any right-of-way.No concrete wall to seal off access has been built in that location since the Office of Public Works took over the property in July 1986.  The main entrance gate to the lock is open during normal working hours but for reasons of security it is locked outside those hours.  Pedestrian access is available, by means of a stile, at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourism already benefits from a wide range of tax incentives and I have no plans to introduce further new incentives this year.  Tourism will of course benefit from the general tax measures &mdash; including the reduction in the rates of VAT and excises, in corporation tax and in income tax &mdash; which I introduced in this year's budget and which were legislated for in the recent Finance Act.</P>
      <P>The extending of the business expansion scheme to qualifying tourist traffic undertakings in 1987 was a major incentive for new projects which are also receiving substantial assistance under the EC Structural Funds.  In addition, most tourism service activities qualify for the favourable 10 per cent rate of VAT, and tourists can benefit from the retail export scheme which allows them refunds of VAT on goods purchased and exported by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> I would also draw attention to the special transitional arrangement which I included in section 81 of this year's Finance Act in respect of accelerated capital allowances for the provision of hotel and other tourist accommodation.  This arrangement enables the 50 per cent rate for such allowances to continue to apply in the case of hotels, holiday camps and holiday cottages, where the contract for these buildings is entered into before 31 December of this year and where they are registered with Bord Fáilte within six months of their completion.  This incentive should stimulate the early provision of additional tourist accommodation facilities.  Hotels, holiday camps and holiday cottages will continue to qualify for the normal annual capital allowances even after the accelerated allowances are phased out.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 50, 51 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>I believe that the general consensus at Community level is that a satisfactory degree of progress has been made during our Presidency in the preparation for the Inter-governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union which is to take place in December.  Stage I of Economic and Monetary Union will start on 1 July and the decisions necessary to its successful implementation were approved by the ECO/FIN Council in early March.  As recently as last week, ECO/FIN undertook the first surveillance exercise under the terms of the new convergence decision.  I might add that the discussion was extremely useful and was generally adjudged to have been a valuable learning experience.</P>
      <P>Regarding the later stages of EMU, the ECO/FIN Council have had substantive discussions under our Presidency on the shape which a completed EMU might take.  These revealed a wide measure of agreement on certain key principles in the economic and monetary areas.  Work on detailed institutional issues and on the phasing of the various stages of EMU has also been initiated under our Presidency and will continue over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the progress I have just outlined <Col N="57" /> has been significant, the final arrangements for EMU remain to be settled. Until that time, it would be quite impracticable to attempt a valid assessment of the impact of EMU on tax revenues and public spending.</P>
    <P>Like the majority of our Community colleagues, Ireland favours an independent and federally-structured central banking institution, which will be democratically and politically accountable. This institution would be responsible for implementing a single monetary policy, geared towards price stability, which we believe to be an essential part of monetary union.  The debate concerning the details of the structure of this institution is continuing.</P>
    <P>As regards the creation of a single currency, such a currency would have certain advantages in terms of further reducing transaction costs and in cementing the commitment of member states to EMU. However, to date there has been no detailed analysis by the Community institutions of the implications of a single currency and I would reserve my position on this issue until that examination is completed and until there is a clearer picture of arrangements generally for EMU.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 45, 52, 57, 72 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Requests for the removal of VAT from hurleys have been rejected by all of my predecessors over the last decade.  The deciding factor in that regard has been the fact that the introduction of new zero rates of VAT is prohibited by EC law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Like previous Ministers for Finance, therefore, I must turn down the latest requests.  I would point out, however, that hurleys should have benefited from the reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 25 to 23 per cent which took effect from 1 March last and which is the first step in a process aimed at reducing our rates closer to those of our EC partners.</P>

      <Quest>the reason many taxpayers are experiencing considerable delays in receiving repayments from the Revenue Commissioners where tax payable has been agreed and repayments are due for (a) over payments made in relation to the year 1988-89 and (b) overpayments made for the year 1989-90; and if he will make a statement on the matter with reference to the action to be taken to ensure that no such similar delays occur in the future.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to income tax repayments due to directly assessed taxpayers who are within the self-assessment system.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is a backlog of income tax repayments for the years 1988-89 and 1989-90 awaiting attention in some inspectors offices.  Clearances of this backlog has been hampered by the system of assessment which applies for 1988-89 and 1989-90.  Under that system some incomes are assessable in a preceding year basis and some on an actual basis.  Accordingly, two years returns are required in order to finalise the tax liability of any one year for a significant number of taxpayers i.e. in order to finalise a repayment due for the tax year 1988-89, it would be necessary to have received and verified the returns for 1989-90.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the basis of assessment the seasonality of the work has contributed to the backlog.  A significant number of returns are received just prior to the final date for submission of returns &mdash; 31 December 1989 in the case of the <Col N="61" /> 1989-90 return.  This caused a significant peak of work in the offices of inspectors of taxes in the early part of the year.</P>
    <P>The problem of two years' returns being necessary to finalise liability for one year was addressed in Chapter II of this year's Finance Bill which is now law.  This changed the basis of assessment so that, for 1990-91 and future years, one return will determine the liability for a year. This will be completed and submitted after the end of the tax year, at which stage the final income figure for assessment will be available.  The doubling up of the work which arose for back years in revenue offices will no longer arise. This change will also help taxpayers and tax practitioners.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are conscious of the need to respond quickly to taxpayers who have overpaid tax.  This is an essential part of the self-assessment process.  They have drawn up revised administrative arrangements for the processing of repayments to achieve this. The implementation of the revised arrangements have been the subject of discussion with staff unions for some time.  It is expected that these will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>The Goverment's present budgetary framework covers the period up to and including 1993.  I outlined this framework in my budget speech on 31 January 1990 when I indicated that:</P>
      <P>...the aim will now be to maintain a significant rate of progress in reducing the Debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent and, as part of this, to achieve broad balance on the current budget for the first time in twenty-one years. Borrowing for capital purposes, and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement, will need to be held to the minimum level consistent with this strategy and with the needs of balanced economic growth and stable monetary conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also pointed out in my budget speech that reaching these objectives will not be easy, given the heavy costs involved in the planned reduction of the standard income tax rate to 25 per cent and the achievement of a single higher rate of tax, and the implications of tax approximation in the EC.  We will need to have a favourable international background and sustained growth, as well as continued tight control of public expenditure and <Col N="64" /> measures to broaden the tax base.  The Government are determined, notwithstanding the difficulties, to make progress on the basis of these objectives.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring primarily to price differences resulting from different levels of indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards short-term action I would refer the Deputy to the reduction of the standard rate of VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per cent, and the reduction and abolition of certain excise duties in this year's budget.  This was an important first step in the medium-term process of reducing our indirect taxes so as to bring them closer to those in other EC countries particularly the UK.  Approximation <Col N="67" /> of indirect taxes in the EC will, of course, involve major costs for Ireland and these are at present being studied by the EC Commission.  Subject to the budgetary constraints we are anxious to participate as fully as possible in the process of indirect tax approximation so as to prepare ourselves for the opening of frontiers and the completion of the internal market.</P>
    <P>Price differentials do, of course, reflect various factors apart from tax differences.These include the margins taken by distributors and retailers in respect of which my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce has responsibility.  More generally, we must do everything possible to maintain downward pressure on costs and inflation in the economy so as to ensure that our goods are competitively-priced.  In this regard I wish to point out that the figure for the latest UK inflation rate is close to 10 per cent as compared with a forecast of little more than 3 per cent on average for Ireland in 1990.</P>

      <P>The abolition of fiscal frontiers in the EC, which is scheduled to take place by 1 January 1993 as part of the process of completing the internal market, will mean that VAT can no longer be collected at point of entry on intra-Community goods.  The examination of the Commission's latest proposals on the precise arrangements and controls to be put in place after the border controls are abolished is commencing under the Irish Presidency later this week.</P>
      <P>The once-off cash flow cost to the Exchequer of foregoing VAT at point of entry on intra-Community trade is estimated at about £150 million.  This cost will be over and above the annual budgetary loss of some £600 million associated with approximation of indirect tax rates. For the run-up to 1993 I will be examining how best such a cash-flow cost can be met as well as the question of timing of the changes here which can only be settled when the EC discussions are more advanced.</P>

      <P>The shipping industry already benefits from a generous regime of capital allowances which includes provision for allowances on second hand as well as new ships, the only such provision in the tax code in respect of second hand plant and machinery.  In addition, the Finance Act, 1987, introduced two significant incentives for the industry.  Firstly, the rate of corporation tax payable by shipping companies was reduced to 10 per cent, thereby enabling shipowners to channel profits into the expansion and development of their services.  Secondly, qualifying shipping services were made eligible for the business expansion scheme.  I extended the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to offshore supply and support vessels under section 42 of this year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that the Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987, provides for the payment of grants of up to 25 per cent of the total cost of new and second hand ships up to seven years old.</P>
      <P>In view of this generous tax treatment, I have no proposals to introduce further tax incentives for the shipping industry.</P>

      <P>The bank levy was renewed at a level of £36 million in this year's Finance Act.  As I indicated in the course of this year's Finance Bill debate, no definite decision has been taken on the future level of the levy.  The matter is reviewed every year in the context of the budget, when the question of the renewal of the bank levy comes up for consideration.I do not, therefore, propose to comment further on this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Irish corporation tax contribution made by the banking sector, this amounted to £50 million, exclusive of the levy, on profits earned in the accounting periods ending between end-December 1988 and end-March 1989.  It must be remembered also that the banks <Col N="76" /> pay significant amounts of overseas as well as Irish corporation tax.</P>
    <P>I expect that the further measures taken in this year's Finance Act to restrict the cost to the Exchequer of section 84 lending, and the phasing out of accelerated capital allowances, as well as the increase in bank profits, will lead over a period to an increase in the corporation tax yield from the banking sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer Questions Nos. 86 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Passport facilities are granted to children in accordance with terms of several Acts, mainly the Adoption Act, 1952, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and the Status of Children Act, 1987, and with various court decisions dealing with cases arising under these Acts.</P>
      <P>In brief, this legislation, and the interpretation of its terms by the courts, provides that the father and the mother of the child are its joint guardians, and that, in the case of a child born outside wedlock, its mother is the sole guardian.  Under the Status of Children Act, 1987, however, the courts may, in the latter case, grant the father guardianship rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In issuing passports to children, the Passport Office, in line with a court decision in 1982, require the written witnessed consent of the parents or of the <Col N="80" /> single mother as the case may be.  Since the passing of the Status of Children Act, 1987, the single mother is also required to submit an affidavit affirming that she is the child's sole guardian.</P>
    <P>In the case of a child being placed for adoption the natural mother remains the legal guardian of the child until the making of the adoption order.  Accordingly, the requirements relating to her written witnessed consent and the affidavit regarding her status as sole guardian must be met.  This is in order to safeguard both the mother's rights and those of the child's natural father who may seek guardianship rights up to the time of the making of the adoption order.</P>
    <P>On the question regarding the issue of a passport in the child's original name, I should point out that until a child has been adopted, its name remains as shown in the register of births.  The Passport Office are prepared to issue a passport to the child awaiting adoption in the name of the prospective adoptive parents but with the name of the child as registered in the register of births also included in the passport.  Once the adoption order is made, it is open to the adoptive parents to apply for a birth certificate showing their name only.</P>
    <P>In granting passport facilities to a child placed in care, the Passport Office have to act in accordance with the terms of the relevant legislation.  In the absence of alternative arrangements under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the natural parents of a foster child retain guardianship of the child.  Accordingly, in the case of passport applications for foster children, the Passport Office are obliged to seek the written witnessed consent of both parents before issuing a passport.</P>
    <P>If one or both natural parents are not contactable or if their whereabouts are unknown, the Passport Office ask for a sworn affidavit from the responsible social worker regarding the whereabouts of the natural parents and indicating, if appropriate, that the relevant health board have no objection to the issue of passport facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> Passports issued in both sets of circumstances are strictly limited in time and relate to a specific journey.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that the Passport Office are well aware of the sensitivities associated with such applications and will continue to deal with them as sympathetically as possible.</P>

      <P>The staff in certain grades working in the office of the Inspector of Taxes, Public Departments, Hawkins House, were engaged in industrial action from 10 April 1990 to 23 April 1990. This action involved a refusal to deal with taxpayers at the public counter or on the telephone.  Correspondence from taxpayers was dealt with as normal.  Unfortunately during the course of this action delays and inconvenience were experienced by taxpayers in their dealings with that office.</P>
      <P>Following negotiations between management and the unions the industrial action was ended and normal working was resumed in the area on 24 April, 1990.

    <P>It should be noted that the balance outstanding in the case of each of the taxes includes amounts under appeal or inquiry, not disputed then but likely to be the subject of claims for admission of late appeals or revision on submission of returns, under demand or enforcement, and-or not likely to be collected.  In effect, therefore, the difference between the balance and the amount likely to be collected is largely accounted for by anticipated reductions of estimated amounts included in the balance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the collection of arrears, I have been informed by the commissioners that in the absence of satisfactory returns many of the amounts in question had to be estimated.  These <Col N="87" /> are now being checked on a case by case basis to eliminate, as far as possible, any unsatisfactory estimates before commencing enforcement action.  This review process involves the joint staffing resources of the Collector-General and Chief Inspector.  Upon verification, all collectible arrears are pursued by way of the various enforcement powers available to the commissioners (sheriff, judgment mortgage, attachment, bankruptcy and wind-up action).  The collection and enforcement phase involves in various degrees all staff of the Collector-General's Office.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners vigorously pursue interest in the most resource effective manner so as to minimise the risk to Exchequer receipts arising from late payment of tax.  Prior to being pursued the interest charge requires to be verified at case level.  Once this is done the various enforcement powers of the commissioners are applied to its collection.  Given the need for individual case level verification of the charge, global statistics are not available for the quantum of interest accrued in any given period.  The commissioners inform me that interest collected in respect of the taxes in question in the period January 1988 to date amounts to some £17 million.</P>
    <P>Statistics on the total amount of refunds due to taxpayers within the self-assessment system and the number of cases involved are not kept.</P>
    <P>The handling of a refund is only part of the overall work involved in a case in the tax office.  Staff are not allocated solely to refund work.  It is not possible, therefore, to quantify the number of persons dealing with such work.</P>

      <P>Under section 8 (1) of the Civl Service Regulation Act, 1956, the compulsory retiring age for civil servants is fixed at 60 years of age for prison officers, and 65 years of age for all other grades in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>However section 8 (4) of the Act permits the appropriate appointing authority, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to (a) raise the retiring age of an established civil servant by up to three calendar months; or (b) allow any civil servant to be retained in an unestablished capacity, up to a maximum age of 75 years.</P>
      <P>In the case of managerial grades, the provision at (a) above is used only where it has the effect of increasing the officer's superannuation benefits, by enabling him/her to secure an extra increment on the salary scale, or to avoid &ldquo;averaging&rdquo; of salary for superannuation purposes. The provision at (b) is used where the Ministers concerned (or the Government in the case of a Government appointee) are satisfied that the retention of an individual officer beyond the prescribed retirement age is justified on grounds of public interest.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first and third parts of the Deputy's question are in the form of tabular statements which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part of the question I would direct the Deputy to section 7 of the Harbours Act, 1946, which outlines the composition of harbour authorities.  The nomination of members of a harbour authority by the relevant interest groups is entirely a matter for the interest group concerned. In effect, they may nominate any person so long as they are not disqualified from membership under section 19 of the Harbours Act, 1946.  In relation to ministerial appointments I may say that the experience and suitability of the nominees are the main criteria used in determining any such appointment.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Number of Qualified Electors</i>
      </P>
      <P>The following figures were furnished by the representative harbour authorities in relation to the Harbour Elections of 1985.  Such figures are only updated in the year in which elections are held and as no elections have been held since that date the figures have not been updated since 1985.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>if he proposes to establish a ban on the import of tropical hardwoods into Ireland; if he will encourage the EC to operate a similar ban at EC level in order to reduce the economic pressure on the threatened tropical rain-forests; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to establish a ban on the import of tropical hardwoods into Ireland.  Ireland's obligations under the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983, the terms of which were approved by the House on 28 June 1984, preclude active discouragement of imports of tropical timber.  Such a step would also run counter to the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</P>
      <P>I fully agree, however, that the problem of tropical forest destruction, encompassing as it does environmental, economic, trade and political issues, requires urgent action based on a worldwide co-ordinated strategy for tropical forest resources.  Ireland's participation in such action can be best achieved within the framework of the EC where it is agreed that any action, to be effective, would have to be on the basis of a broad consensus between consumers and producers.</P>
      <P>The EC General Affairs Council of 29 May 1990 endorsed the following principles and activities:</P>
      <P>Responsibility for tropical forests lies with the countries concerned. Donors should concentrate on supporting action taken by the developing countries themselves and, where necessary, help them to develop forest conservation strategies and to strengthen their institutional capacity in this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tropical Forestry Action Plan (TFAP)* should be the basic framework for co-ordinated funding and <Col N="108" /> action in the support of forest activities.The council urges the Community and the member states to support current efforts to implement the principles of the TFAP, considers these efforts need to be reinforced and made more effective, and welcomes the review of the TFAP now under way.  The council will examine the results of that review at a forthcoming meeting together with ways of making the TFAP more effective.</P>
    <P>*The TFAP is an FAO sponsored mechanism, involving the UN and the World Bank, designed to co-ordinate the efforts of a variety of international entities &mdash; governmental and non-governmental, co-operating towards the conservation and rational use of tropical forest resources.</P>
    <P>Countries actively supporting the conservation of their remaining natural forests through legal, fiscal and institutional measures, and the revision of land use policies should merit special attention.  Action to correct policies which encourage forest destruction should also be fostered and supported.</P>
    <P>Member states and the Commission should ensure that all their activities which directly or indirectly affect forests are coherent and co-ordinated among themselves and with other donors and recipients and that they have effective units with the necessary forestry expertise.</P>
    <P>The future geographical allocation of forestry aid should be co-ordinated using the mechanism of the TFAP. Priority must continue to be given to the poorest countries and those without the resources to help themselves. However, regions where the threat to forests is particularly serious and which may not previously have been a priority for donors should receive particular attention in the allocation of additional resources.</P>
    <P>The type of support will vary from country to country in accordance with their particular needs.  Particular emphasis must be given, in line with <Col N="109" /> the priorities of the TFAP, to the integration of forestry actions with agriculture; restoration of fuelwood supplies; the establishment of reserves based on the environmental and biodiversity functions of forests; the sustained management of natural forests; and so strengthening and supporting institutions, with a view to increasing local capacity for sustainable management.There is a need for donors to co-ordinate their actions as regards countries and sectors.</P>
    <P>Particular importance has to be attached to the social dimension of forestry.The traditions and experience of indigenous forest dwellers should be respected and drawn upon while at the same time the needs and problems of new settlers and those living on the periphery of the forest should be addressed.  Active steps should be taken to involve local populations in planning and implementation of projects.</P>
    <P>Special emphasis must be given to the involvement of international and national NGOs in the TFAP process, particularly at local level.</P>
    <P>Particular consideration should be given to the role of the International Timber Trade Organisation (ITTO) in promoting sustainable management, notably in establishing guidelines for best practice in this sector.  The ITTO should be encouraged to carry out its actions in a manner consistent with the TFAP framework.</P>
    <P>The Council notes the recent adoption, at the 8th session of the ITTO, of guidelines for the rational management of natural tropical forests and of an action plan and work programme on forest industry, and particularly the objective that total exports of tropical timber products should come from sustainedly managed resources by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Forestry research is of fundamental importance.  Particular emphasis <Col N="110" /> should be placed on improving sustainable productivity of forests; identifying non-timber resources of the forest and key areas of biodiversity, and evaluating the environmental services provided by trees and forests. Reinforcement of the research capacities of the developing countries themselves should be a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 153 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>I believe that all income maintenance services should be delivered in a co-ordinated and cost-effective manner and that clients should, as far as practicable, have one point of contact in claiming their entitlements.  This means that, in the long term, I would envisage the transfer of supplementary welfare allowance and disabled person's maintenance allowance from health boards to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>There are major issues to be addressed in relation to any such transfer.  These include making arrangements in relation to staffing, computerisation, and the setting up of suitable management structures.It will also be necessary to ensure that certain features of the schemes, such as a localised service and links to health and welfare services, are not adversely affected in any transfer.</P>
      <P>These aspects need to be worked out in detail by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Health and the health boards.  When this process is completed, I will be in a position to present more definite proposals on a possible transfer.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for appeals under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme will be considered in the context of the future arrangement for administration of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of the scheme is kept under review on an ongoing basis and revised guidelines or circular letters are issued in response to emerging needs.</P>
      <P>The guidelines on the operation of the scheme are kept under review and general directions are issued to health boards from time to time as appropriate. Following a comprehensive review of the provisions for rent and mortgage supplementation revised guidelines on this aspect of the scheme have been issued.  The area of exceptional needs payments is under review and revised guidelines, which are also aimed at achieving greater uniformity of treatment, are being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> The provision of assistance towards the cost of school clothing has been one of the most important elements of exceptional needs payments.  In this connection the new back-to-school clothing scheme which I am introducing this year will benefit over 170,000 children whose parents are dependent on social welfare and health board payments.  There will be two rates of allowance &mdash; £40 for each secondary school child and £25 for each primary school child.  These particular payments will replace the discretionary aspect of the arrangements in operation heretofore under the exceptional needs provisions of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme as applied in the case of school uniforms and will also bring about greater uniformity of treatment.</P>
    <P>In relation to persons aged 16 to 18 years the supplementary welfare allowances scheme is sufficiently flexible to cater for the needs of vulnerable 16-18 year olds who are without financial support and need an independent income in circumstances such as those outlined in the commission's report.  I have no plans at present to change the scheme's provisions in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 I extended the national fuel scheme to the long term unemployed. This year, I am further extending entitlement under the free schemes.  <i>Inter alia,</i> pensioners over 80 years are to be allowed to retain their free electricity <Col N="116" /> entitlement when people come to live with them.  In addition, the anomaly whereby an invalidity pensioner with free scheme entitlement loses this entitlement on transferring to retirement pension at age 65 is being removed.</P>
    <P>Further extentions of these schemes to include additional categories of beneficiaries would have cost implications and is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

It is for this reason that special increases have been given to this group.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the duration of unemployment benefit beyond 15 months would have to be considered in a context of available resources and the need to target those resources at the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I made arrangements under the Social Welfare Act, 1988, for the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions to a specific group of insured persons with intermittent social insurance records.  These persons had been excluded from compulsory social insurance cover for periods prior to 1974 by reason of the upper earnings limit which then applied.  They were brought back into compulsory insurance in 1974, when that limit was abolished but subsequently failed to qualify for contributory pension because of the gaps in their insurance records prior to 1974.</P>
      <P>This arrangement does not cover the situation of persons with mixed insurance records partly at the full rate and partly at a modified rate who do not qualify for pension because of an insufficient contributions record at the full rate.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 136, 137, 139, 140 and 141 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare I have made a number of changes to the PRSI contributions system, in line with the view of the commission that the base for contributions should be as wide as possible.  Social insurance has been extended to the self-employed, including farmers, and to ministers of religion and members of religious orders.  As announced in last year's budget, the Government have decided in principle to extend full social insurance cover to public sector workers currently on the modified rate of contribution.  My colleague the Minister for Finance and myself have commenced discussions on this matter with the interests concerned. The social insurance base has been further widened by the raising of the income ceiling for contributions.  When the commission furnished its report the ceiling was £14,700 for both employer and employee contributions; it is now £17,300 for employees and the self-employed and <Col N="119" /> £18,600 for employers.  Any further changes to the ceiling, including its possible elimination, would have to be considered in a budgetary context having particular regard to the interaction between the tax and PRSI systems and their joint impact on take-home pay across the whole range of income levels.</P>
    <P>The question of integrating the levies into the income tax system is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  It is estimated that receipts from the health contribution and the employment and training levy in 1990 will amount to over £250 million. The implementation of the proposal would have to be considered by the Minister for Finance having regard to its impact on the levels of taxation for individual taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The question of the PRSI tax allowance would also have to be considered in this context.  However, since the commission reported, the Government have also taken steps to reduce the PRSI burden on the low paid.  This year we introduced a new arrangement whereby employees on low earnings, £60 per week or less, do not have to pay PRSI contributions, but continue to qualify for benefits.  It is estimated that this measure will improve the take-home pay of over 50,000 workers. Low paid workers will also benefit from the increases in tax exemption limits in the past two budgets, and the introduction of the new exemption limits for people with children.  An interdepartmental committee is currently examining the effects of tax and PRSI contributions on the incomes of the low paid, and further developments will be considered in the light of the committee's recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare <Col N="120" /> recommended that the components of the means test should be widely publicised so as to ensure that lack of knowledge in relation to the means assessment provisions does not adversely affect the level of take-up of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that detailed information in relation to all aspects of social welfare entitlements is widely and easily available to claimants and a considerable amount of progress has been made in this area since the publication of the commission's report.</P>
      <P>The information leaflets on each of the schemes administered by my Department have been revised.  These leaflets contain detailed information in relation to the particular scheme including comprehensive information on the means assessment provisions.  The most recently revised leaflets including information on means tests include those for old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives and other lone parents.  A new leaflet on unemployment assistance also gives detailed information on the means test.</P>
      <P>In addition to the information leaflets on individual schemes, a comprehensive Guide to Social Welfare Services has also been made available from my Department.An updated version of this guide is being prepared at present and all aspects of the guide, including information in relation to the assessment of means, are being reviewed in this context.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement <Col N="121" /> (FIS) when introduced in 1984 was designed to increase the take home pay of those on low earnings from work relative to weekly social welfare rates.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that for the moment FIS should be retained and improved, modifying the conditions of entitlement in order to increase the rates of payments and the take-up of the scheme.  Substantial improvements have been made in the FIS scheme since publication of the commission's report.  In the last year I have improved the scheme in several ways, namely; income limits have been increased from between £4 and £38 depending on family size; maximum payments have been increased by between £2 per week and £21 per week depending on family size; extra payments for families with more than five children; the rate of supplement has been increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the difference between family income and relevant income limit; and the number of hours required to work in order to qualify for FIS has been reduced from 24 to 20; hours worked by both spouse can be added to reach this total.  As a result of these improvements there has been an almost 20 per cent increase in the uptake of FIS in the past year.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget an extra £1 million has been allocated for FIS improvements.This will be used to increase payments and the new rates will be announced shortly.  I feel that the FIS scheme provides an essential boost to low income families and there are no plans at present to phase out the scheme.</P>

      <P>This year I am introducing a new back to school clothing allowance to help families on social welfare payments with the costs of school clothing for their children at the start of the coming school year.  This allowance will be of major benefit to the families concerned and recognises the difficulties that many families on social welfare experience in meeting these costs.</P>
      <P>I have taken the opportunity to combine the clothing and footwear assistance which I am providing in a new simplified clothing and footwear scheme at two rates &mdash; £40 for each secondary school child and £25 for each primary school child.  Over 170,000 children of people dependent on health board and social welfare payments, including unemployment assistance, will benefit at a cost of £5.3 million.  This figure includes the extra £3 million which I am now providing for clothing and the amount hitherto provided for children's footwear under the footwear scheme and for school uniforms.</P>
      <P>Christmas is another expensive time for families, and for a number of years now it has been the practice to pay a Christmas bonus to all long-term social welfare recipients.  Last year's bonus was 70 per cent of the weekly payment.</P>
      <P>As well as providing these additional payments on occasions when they are most needed, the Government have been pursuing a policy of generally improving the position of long-term social welfare recipients with children.  This year's improvements include an increase in the minimum child dependant payment from £10 to £11, the payment of child dependant increases until age 20 to recipients of long-term payments where the child continues in full-time education, and a 5 per cent increase in the rate of child benefit.</P>
      <P>I believe that these measures represent an effective and well targeted approach to meeting the income needs of families who are long-term dependant on social welfare.</P>

      <P>There are three orphan's pension schemes administered by my Department &mdash; the orphan's contributory allowance, the orphan's non-contributory pension and the orphan's pension payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The purpose of these schemes is to provide an income maintenance payment in respect of children where both parents are dead or where one parent is dead and the other parent has abandoned or failed to support the children.  The orphan's pension is normally paid to the guardian with whom the child lives or who is looking after the child's finances. In the majority of cases orphans are cared for by relatives, e.g. grandparents, aunts, uncles.</P>
      <P>In examining the social welfare payments structure the Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the level of payment for child dependants should be £10 per week, in 1985 terms &mdash; approximately £12 per week in current terms.  The orphan's pension payments range from £30 to £36.90 a week, July 1990 rates.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board are currently preparing their final report on the future development of a national pension system and are examining in that context the pension arrangements for survivors, including orphans.  The future development of the orphan's pension schemes will be examined in the light of that report, which is expected to be completed later this year.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 145, 148, 155, 157 and 158 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully committed to the provision of a modern, accessible and integrated service to social welfare clients at local level and considerable progress has been achieved in this regard in recent years. <Col N="125" /> The appropriate computer and telecommunications infrastructure has been designed and is already substantially in place.  Many of the Department's local offices outside Dublin are now fully linked to the system and all offices will be connected to the network within two years.</P>
    <P>Plans for a new management structure, increasing the role of the local offices, have also been developed and will be brought into effect shortly when consultation are completed.  Various interim improvements in the payment systems have also been made in the last few years and discussions are taking place on options to provide a fully comprehensive set of modern arrangements tailored to the needs of social welfare recipients. These new arrangements will involve new signing arrangements for many of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Computer facilities are used extensively in the processing and payment of all types of social welfare benefits, allowances and pensions.  With the exception of claims to unemployment benefit and assistance at the smaller offices outside Dublin, every claim made is now registered promptly and managed throughout its life cycle on the computers giving a nationwide consistency in treatment and a speedier and more accessible service at local level.</P>
    <P>Computer facilities are being progressively deployed at local level on a phased basis.  Thirty four information centres in local offices throughout the country use the computer links to directly access the Department's computer database for the purposes of answering clients' queries about their claims or entitlements.  Many of the points of contact at local level can now provide clients with detailed, up to the minute information in relation to their claims.</P>
    <P>In an important and innovative development, these inquiry facilities have also been extended to certain other agencies which deal with social welfare clients e.g. FÁS, certain health boards and a housing authority adding greatly to the improved service social welfare clients can expect as a new norm. <Col N="126" /> Where facilities permit, data on unemployment payments is passed weekly by my Department to FÁS.  These arrangements will be expanded as more offices are computerised.  In addition, under the Jobsearch programme, certain of the long term unemployed are referred to FÁS for interview and assessment with a view to finding suitable training or employment.</P>
    <P>In a development which I launched at Cork in 1987, intermediate medical certificates in respect of disability benefit claims are entered directly to the computer system at 17 locations across the country.  This was work which previously was confined to headquarters with some inevitable resultant delays and queries.</P>
    <P>By the end of the year, this important service will be available at a total of 27 offices and the remaining offices will come on stream next year.  This project demonstrates the manner in which existing computer systems will be enhanced extensively to provide cohesive support to a new range of local services.</P>
    <P>Very considerable resources have been made available in recent years to achieve the current progress and to generate the potential for further developments of the type I have outlined.  Now that the physical infrastructure is on course for completion within a short time frame, I will be ensuring that the computer applications which run on the systems are enhanced and made available at a quickening pace. With that objective in mind, I recently augmented the management in the computer development area as a first step in the next phase of progress.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that education and training play a vital role in helping unemployed persons to improve their prospects of securing employment particularly in the case of those who left the school system early.  Social welfare legislation already allows persons, other than full-time day students, to engage in educational courses without affecting their entitlements and I have taken measures to ensure that deciding officers at employment exchanges are fully aware of the scope of these provisions.</P>
      <P>In addition I have taken a number of special initiatives in recent years to facilitate unemployed people wishing to undertake full-time courses of education.</P>
      <P>Under regulations which I introduced last year, certain unemployment assistance applicants may engage in a full-time course of education and at the same time satisfy the statutory condition of being available for work.  The regulations cover participation by a person aged 21 years or over in a course of education at second level at a recognised centre.</P>
      <P>The education opportunities scheme, which is now the vocational training opportunities scheme enables certain unemployed persons to follow a full-time education and training course in vocational education colleges at 12 locations throughout the country.  To be eligible to participate in one of these courses a person has to have been receiving unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance for at least 15 months and must be over 21 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently drawing up arrangements to facilitate the participation of long-term unemployed persons in third <Col N="128" /> level education course and community enterprise type projects by way of pilot scheme.  In relation to part-time working there is a considerable amount of flexibility in relation to part-time working within the existing legislation.  For instance, a claimant may work part-time for up to three full days in any week and be eligible for unemployment payments for the remaining days of that week.</P>
    <P>In addition, the part-time job incentive scheme, which I launched on a nation-wide basis in 1988, provides considerable scope to long-term unemployed persons who get the opportunity to take up a part-time job.  Under this scheme eligible persons may work up to 24 hours a week in insurable employment while receiving a flat rate allowance instead of their unemployment payments.  The allowances are £30 for a single person and £50 for a person with a dependent spouse. These rates will be increased in line with the general increase in payments in July. There are about 250 people participating in the scheme at present.</P>

      <P>The new scheme will incorporate the existing schemes for unmarried mothers, widowers and deserted husbands.  In addition, recipients of widow's (noncontributory) pension, deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance who have dependent children will be brought within the scope of the scheme. The new scheme formally recognises that all parents bringing up children on their own face similar problems, regardless of the circumstances giving rise to their situation.  Accordingly, the scope of the lone parent's allowance scheme is being extended to cover all separated persons, who will in future be able to qualify without having to prove that they have been deserted by their spouse.</P>
      <P>I am also introducing new measures to assist lone parent families who are having difficulties obtaining maintenance.  I have provided in legislation an obligation on men and women to maintain their dependent spouses and children.  Where a liable relative fails or neglects to maintain his dependants and payments have been awarded under the deserted spouses', lone parent's or the supplementary welfare allowance schemes, the liable relative will be required to contribute towards the cost of such payments.  These new provisions will be brought into force by way of commencement order at the same time as the new lone parent's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of these provisions will mean that the Department of Social Welfare and the health boards, in the <Col N="130" /> case of supplementary welfare allowance, will in effect be assuming responsibility in such cases for requiring liable relatives to meet their maintenance obligations to their dependants.  This outcome will be very much in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to ensure that new claims are determined as quickly as possible so that payment can be made to those who are entitled to it with a minimum of delay. To this end a number of measures have been taken in the last few years which are designed to speed up the processing of claims.  For instance, certain straightforward types of unemployment assistance applications are no longer referred to a social welfare officer for investigation; instead the means are assessed on the basis of the facts presented and on information already available to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other cases which are referred for investigation, the social welfare officer now generally interviews the claimants at an Office of the Department in the first instance and, as a result, the means in many cases can be assessed without the need for a visit to the claimant's home. It is planned to extend these types of arrangements in the coming years, not only as regards unemployment payments, but also to embrace other categories of social welfare claimants.  In this way, the number of substitute payments made under the supplementary welfare <Col N="131" /> scheme will be substantially reduced.  The objective is to have a one-stop local centre where people can call and transact their business with my Department, no matter what scheme is involved.</P>

      <P>Training policy and the management of training is already integrated in my Department's staff Development Unit.

      <P>As part of the second EC Poverty Programme I arranged for a report on poverty to be prepared by the ESRI.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 166 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>I am providing a special extra allowance of £3 per week for low income households to offset the additional costs arising from the ban on bituminous coal in built up areas of Dublin.  Households in the restricted areas which already benefit under the national fuel scheme will qualify for the additional allowance.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new allowance will apply to persons who are receiving short-term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit for at least three months and persons receiving family income supplement who meet the other conditions for receiving a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.  It is expected that approximately 81,000 households will benefit, at a cost of £6.32 million.  The additional allowance will apply for the period of the heating season under the national fuel scheme, namely mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>These measures go well beyond the categories of persons covered by the national fuel scheme and represent a substantial package to counteract the extra cost of smokeless fuels.  Any further measures would require additional funding.</P>

      <P>A Garda patrol car with mileage of the order referred to in the question was on patrol in Blanchardstown on the night concerned.  This vehicle was a temporary replacement car to Blanchardstown station pending repair of accidental damage to that station's regular patrol car.  The Garda authorities inform me that the vehicle in question, despite its high mileage, was only two years old and in perfect mechanical order.  It has since been withdrawn from the Garda fleet for auction.</P>

      <P>The decision as to the method by which a local authority project is to be undertaken is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned subject to the relevant legal and other general requirements.In particular, where a project is to be undertaken by contract the local authority must comply with the provisions of EC Directives on public works and supply contracts, which require that contracts of a value over the thresholds set out in the Directives must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities.  The threshold value (net of VAT) with effect from 1 January 1990 are as follows: Public Works Contracts &mdash; £777,550; and Public Supply Contracts &mdash; £155,510.</P>
      <P>Procedures to be followed in the award of public contracts generally are set out in the document, &ldquo;An Outline of Government Contracts Procedures&rdquo; issued by the Department of Finance. These provide that, as a basic principle, a procedure based on a competitive tendering should be used save in exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>Following my Department's invitation of proposals for a toll franchise for the Dublin ring road in March 1989, a steering group representative of my Department, the Department of Finance and Dublin County Council was established to assess the proposals received. On foot of a recommendation from the steering group, it was decided to enter into detailed negotiations with a consortium led by Manufacturers Hanover Ltd.  and including Cofiroute, with a view to concluding an agreement under the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979, in relation to the ring road, subject to the statutory procedures.  In September, Dublin County Council was advised by letter of this decision.  It was made clear to the local authority that any agreement reached with the consortium would be governed by the provisions of the 1979 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the opening of the Naas Road-Galway Road section of the ring road, it was decided by the steering group that some preliminary works should be undertaken which would facilitate tolling in the <Col N="152" /> event of such decision being made by the local authority.  These works included the construction of toll plinths.  The cost of the plinths would, of course, fall to be ment by the consortium in the event of a decision being reached by the local authority to enter into an agreement with them in relation to tolls.  The decision to undertake these works in advance of opening of the road was made so as to avoid closure of sections of the route and consequent disruption of traffic, which would be necessary in the event of a decision by the local authority that tolls should be imposed subsequent to opening of the various sections of the ring road. The cost of the works at that stage would also be substantially greater.</P>
    <P>I understand that the council has since directed the assistant manager concerned to arrange for the removal of the plinths which have been constructed at the Nass Road and Galway Road entry points. My Department will facilitate the local authority in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 203 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management and maintenance, including replacement programmes, of their rented dwellings are the responsibility of the local authority and do not require ministerial approval.  Such works would be funded by the authority from its own resources, which include their <Col N="154" /> rental income and the revenue portion, 40 per cent, of the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes.  Approved projects under the remedial work scheme, under which the housing authority may carry out major refurbishment of estates, come within the public capital programme.  It is a matter for the authority to formulate such proposals and to indicate relative priorities, within their allocation, when proposals are being made to the Department.No proposals under this scheme have been received in respect of the Liberty House flats.  This year £5 million &mdash; one third of the total available nationally &mdash; has been allocated to the corporation under the scheme.  The allocation is being funded this year from the corporation's own housing capital resources.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board's priority for the delivery of dental services for children is to ensure that all school children are dentally fit when they leave national school.  The board organises services for school children on the basis of an assessment, and treatment where necessary, of children in first, third and sixth standards of the national schools.  However the board is aware that this arrangement has been curtailed in some areas recently as the need to provide emergency services for adults made inroads into the time of the health board dentists.  The Southern <Col N="164" /> Health Board, in common with the other health boards, has now received a special allocation for the provision of routine dental treatment of adults.  This will result in an improvement in services for children.</P>

      <P>Registration for the purpose of practising medicine in this country is a function of the Medical Council.  Since the case to which the Deputy refers first came to public attention, the council have used their statutory power to make rules governing the type of training courses and examinations necessary to qualify for full registration.  Full registration is available under these rules to non-EC nationals.</P>

      <P>The withdrawal of this scheme was an essential element of the recovery plan drawn up by the VHI to ensure their continued viability.</P>
      <P>If VHI were requested to provide cover for routine medical costs, premiums would be too high to be affordable by most people.  While the question of the reinstatement of the outpatient drugs scheme is primarily a matter for the VHI, it is difficult to envisage such an initiative being sustainable at the present time.</P>
      <P>Assistance is, of course, available under the health boards drugs refund scheme which gives full recoupment for all expenditure in excess of £28 per month on prescribed drugs.  I would also like to point out that the health boards may also give special consideration to persons who suffer undue hardship as a result of exceptional drug costs.</P>
      <P>As stated in my reply of 6 June 1990 to Questions Nos. 18 and 29, Volume 399 of the Official Report, the introduction of a new community drug subsidisation scheme for persons with limited eligibility who have a regular and continuous need for expensive medication is currently the subject of ongoing discussions with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>A new three year agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries was entered into last week.  The agreement which replaces the current agreement, which expires on 31 July this year, will ensure that Irish prices will be protected from UK inflation where this is out of line with EC price movements. The main features of the new agreement are as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;The wholesale price of any product sold on the Irish market cannot be higher than the corresponding U.K. price.  A standard 2 per cent discount will be payable on GMS medicines which will effectively bring the prices in the scheme below U.K. prices.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Prices will be frozen for 12 months from 1 August.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The prices of products which come on the market after 1 August will be based on a comparison with other European country prices for those products.</P>
      <P>&mdash;In twelve months time the prices will be realigned.  The realignment will limit increases to the average movement in a range of EC countries. This will ensure that where UK prices are significantly out of line the Irish price will be protected.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Hospitals and health boards will continue to get a minimum 15 per cent discount but will be free to negotiate higher discounts where possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;My Department, under the terms of the agreement, reserves the right to <Col N="172" /> influence the prescribing habits of doctors.</P>
    <P>I am personally committed to the greater use of generic durgs and the medical profession will be encouraged to prescribe generic drugs where appropriate to ensure the full potential of savings to the Exchequer.  My Department will very shortly be issuing a National Drugs Formulary for doctors which will be a major boost to cost-effective prescribing.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new agreement in conjunction with the measures outlined above, provides a sound basis for controlling drug prices on the Irish market.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the European Charter for Children in Hospital adopted by the European Parliament has not as yet been adopted by the Community.  The position is that the question of a charter is being examined by the EC Commission prior to the presentation of a proposal to the Council. Until such time as a charter is formally adopted, I will be pursuing the question of appropriate provision for children in hospital.  I have been in communication with the Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital in this regard.  All hospitals, including childrens' hospitals, have recently been requested to consider taking initiatives on quality of patient care and to make proposals for action on this subject.  These proposals will include a hospital code of conduct concerning visiting arrangements and amenities for patients and relatives.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to his questions which I answered on 6 June, 1990, relating to drug abuse and would reiterate the statement which I made in those replies indicating that considerable progress has been made in combating the drug problem in Dublin. Community-based Drop-in Centres have been provided at the Drugs Advisory and Treatment Centre, Trinity Court, Dublin 2, by the Eastern Health Board at the Talbot Day Centre, Dublin 2 and at Baggot Street.  In addition satellite centres have been provided in the North and South Inner City of Dublin catering for persons who cannot attend at Baggot Street.  Help-lines operate out of the Drugs Advisory and Treatment Centre, Trinity Court, and out of the Eastern <Col N="175" /> Health Board's Baggot Street Drop-In Centre.  Drug addiction counsellors are employed by the Eastern Health Board. In-patient detoxification beds are provided at Beaumont Hospital and in-patient facilities are also provided for drug abusers of all ages where there is a medical reason for such services.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my replies on 6 June, 1990, I have asked the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drugs to report to me on a National Plan on Drug Abuse. The committee will be examining the existing services and the voluntary agencies operating in the drugs area have been invited to make submissions to the committee and I can assure the Deputy that their views will be taken into consideration in the context of the national plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mrs. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in so far as my area of responsibility is concerned is as follows: Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3820/85 sets out, <i>inter alia</i>, the maximum permissible hours which coach drivers may operate and the minimum permissible durations of breaks and rest periods.  Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3821/85 prescribes the installation and use of tachographs in vehicles.  The regulations are implemented in this country by the European Communities (Road Transport) Regulations, 1986 (S. I. No. 392 of 1986) and European Communities (Road Transport) (Recording Equipment), Regulations 1986 (S. I. No. 393 of 1986).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations apply to the carriage of passengers by road by passenger vehicles constructed and equipped to carry more <Col N="188" /> than nine persons including the driver and where routes covered exceed 50 kilometres &mdash; 31 miles.  The regulations require the use of either tachographs or duty rosters and service timetables, depending on the operation in which the vehicle is engaged.</P>
    <P>The regulations are enforced both by the Garda Síochána and by the transport officers of my Department.  Inspections are carried out by the transport officers in conjunction with the gardaí at roadside check points.  While I am reasonably satisfied with the level of compliance with these regulations, the situation will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Other safety requirements, for example, relating to the roadworthiness of vehicles, are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main public transport investment schemes in the greater Dublin area undertaken since 1971 were as follows: (1) the electrification of the Bray-Howth rail service (DART) at a cost of £114 million, inclusive of £10 million VAT.  This service came into operation in 1984; (ii) the provision of a commuter rail service from Maynooth to the city in 1980 at a cost of £0.25 million. This service will be upgraded with effect <Col N="189" /> from July 1990 at a cost of £0.73 million; (iii) the installation of automatic vehicle monitoring systems in the Dublin Bus fleet in 1980 at a cost of £1.3 million; (iv) the upgrading of passenger facilities at Tara Street Station in 1990 at a cost of £1 million; and (v) bus priority and traffic management measures at a total cost of £4.2 million.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the projects at (ii) to (v) above was inclusive of VAT at 10 per cent.  The projects at (i) to (iv) above were funded by CIE borrowings.  The projects at (v) were funded by grants from the Tourism and Transport Vote. The cost of the interest charges on the DART, which amounted to £71.5 million by the end of 1989, have been borne directly by the Exchequer.  The cost of the interest charges on the projects at (ii) to (iv) were borne by CIE.</P>
      <P>Apart from the specific projects mentioned above, CIE's capital investment programme in the period also provided for an upgrading of the group's rail rolling stock, replacement and renewal of its bus fleet and the renewal of railway signalling.The rail and bus services provided by CIE in the greater Dublin area benefited significantly from these investments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.</P>
      <P>Whether forecasts issued by the Irish Meteorological Service are based on a vast range of data from a wide variety of sources including reports from Irish stations, from other countries and from ships in the Atlantic, on data from meteorological satellites and weather surveillance radar.  In a volatile weather situation the absence of data from some normal sources could have adverse effects on the quality of forecasts.  On 4 June relatively quiet conditions prevailed and there was no such impact and a comparison of actual weather conditions with the forecast issued revealed no detectable loss of quality.  There was no impact on public safety.</P>
      <P>Observations on 4 June were completed on site at the Irish synoptic stations and, while not transmitted for some stations, will be available for climatological and statistical purposes.</P>
