      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I wish to advise the House that we have with us this morning the Minister for the Arts from the United Kingdom, the Right Honourable Richard Luce, together with some distinguished members of the steering committee of the British-Irish inter-parliamentary body, including our friend Mr. Peter Temple-Morris, MP, Mr. Tim Wood, MP and Mr. Stuart Bell, MP. I am sure Members would wish to join me in extending to them a most hearty céad míle fáilte.  May your stay with us be happy and your deliberations crowned with much success.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6 and 7.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight; the sitting shall be suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m.; and the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 6 if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m., by one question, which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the <Col N="1378" /> Minister for Defence.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 20.</P>

      <P>The proposals for dealing with No. 6 are not agreed.  It is outrageous to shorten discussion on this important Bill in the way proposed here by the Government.  There are many matters still to be teased out and I ask the Government to withdraw this provision and to let Committee Stage debate on this Bill continue for as long as is necessary.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Opposition parties are taking this attitude.  The Government have been concerned to give the maximum possible amount of time to this important legislation and we have done that.  My calculation is that when we finish Committee Stage this evening something in the region of 26 hours will have been devoted to the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Sir, could I ask the Taoiseach if he would confirm to the House a remark attributed to him in the media this morning to the effect that the review of local authority structures, which the Government intend to undertake over the next few months, will not include the question of funding? Would the Taoiseach not agree that any review of local authority structures that does not deal with funding can only be the merest figleaf for their attempt to put off the local elections?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make any reference to it, even though I feel very tempted to do so.  Some weeks ago, in response to questions from myself and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dukes, the Taoiseach said he would attempt to provide time for a debate in this House on important matters in regard to Anglo-Irish relations, consequent upon certain far-reaching decisions of the Supreme Court over the past few weeks.  May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government have given that request further consideration; if time will be provided, and if it is not possible to provide time during the course of this week, which is the last week of this session, may we have an early debate on the very important matters affecting Anglo-Irish relations as soon as the Dáil resumes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like briefly to recap on what is being sought to achieve by amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 in the names of Deputies Nealon, Ryan and myself.  We want to expand on what is <Col N="1392" /> currently permissible under section 2 (1) as issues to be dealt with by any representative association as already established. The section as drafted by the Minister, allows for the issue of remuneration only and such other matters if any as the Minister may specify in the regulations.  The position of the Deputies on this side of the House is that as the Minister has taken the regulations away from us and because this House will have no further say, good, bad or indifferent on the content of those regulations and on the basic structure and terms of reference of any representative association once established, we are anxious at this stage to write into the legislation the features we consider to be important and essential to the proper working of such a structure or scheme once in place.  The Minister has adopted a very curious and, perhaps, misguided formula for laying down the terms of reference because of the primary emphasis being placed on remuneration. The Workers' Party believe that there are many other concepts and issues such as welfare, health, education, housing and related matters that should be specifically in the remit and terms of reference of any representative association be it for officers or other ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the guiding Act that has been borrowed for arguments on the Government side, the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, they have used a different and far wider formula allowing the Garda representative associations to deal with all matters concerning their welfare and efficiency.  Even the concept of welfare could embrace a far wider range of issues and bring it out of the narrow define.  In relation to efficiency it would allow for debate and discussion and the better ordering and running of particular barracks or commands, the better deployment of personnel, the better scheduling of hours of duties and any number of matters that would improve on the standard of performance, if that is possible, of our Defence Force members.  Remuneration is a much too narrow concept and the Minister is allowing us to have no say in any of the other matters he might <Col N="1393" /> consider, because they are for the regulations, and for that reason it is important that we stamp our imprint in some way on the legislation.  We must go beyond the issue of remuneration.  Certainly the issues of welfare and efficiency are an advance on what is contained in the 1977 Act but the concepts outlined by Deputy Nealon in amendment No. 5 where he goes beyond welfare to talk about medical and family support systems and in amendment No. 7 where Deputy Ryan talks about conditions of service and my own amendment which deals with health, education and housing, are matters that can easily be accommodated and should, as a matter of record and principle, be written into the legislation at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support amendments Nos. 5 and 6 and I want to speak on my own amendment No. 7.  I would say to the Minister that the narrow definition contained in the Bill is unsatisfactory. It is in deep contrast to the opinions expressed by the Minister at various stages.  The aspects we mentioned in our amendments would seem to be very much in line with the Minister's interpretation of what he is prepared to give. At the end of the day we have to look at the Bill and I would say that the remuneration aspect is too narrow.  In relation to the words &ldquo;and such other matters (if any)&rdquo; I would hope that the Minister would take on board what we are saying that we can exclude &ldquo;if any&rdquo;.  By taking on board a combination of amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 and if the Minister looked at a different form of words he might come forward with his own amendment to take cognisance of what we are saying. This would enable us to omit the whole aspect of &ldquo;if any&rdquo;.  In looking at that section one would have to ask what are the wider implications of this section?  It is not satisfactory to come along and say: &ldquo;We may discuss it&rdquo;.  At the end of the day, who is going to decide what shall be discussed?  That is the reason we feel it has to be elaborated on in the Bill.  There are a wide range of aspects that have to be discussed and it is up to the new organisation to get involved and have <Col N="1394" /> discussions.  That is the reason we say in our amendment we want to insert &ldquo;and conditions of employment or service&rdquo;. That is a very wide-ranging aspect of conditions of employment and we would hope the Minister would take on board that amendment and also amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  I hope we will have a fruitful report from the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider bringing forward a simple amendment on Report Stage, because almost all the words are contained in the structures.  I want to point out that this is something that the Army personnel with whom I spoke, at every level, felt very strongly about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly about it.  It is precisely because I feel strongly about it that I intend to incorporate all of these points concerning conditions of service and related subjects and the whole range of welfare matters in the regulations.  These discussions will incorporate all aspects of welfare which are envisaged.  I believe it would be very foolhardy and not be in the interests of what all of us want to do to incorporate the amendment in the legislation in this manner.  I will give my reasons for saying this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy McCartan and Deputy Ryan said that this section covers a wide range of aspects.  Welfare does cover a wide range of aspects, a number of which are not covered by the amendments put down by the Deputies.  The issues covered by welfare are infinite, various and flexible and will arise from month to month and year to year.  As time goes on, additional areas of welfare and social impact will arise which will need to be <Col N="1395" /> considered and these can be incorporated in regulations which can be amended easily as the representative bodies settle into action during the course of their discussions and consultations.  My point is that this is a perfect area for incorporation in regulations.  It is not an area for incorporation in legislation.  Incorporating some of the aspects of welfare in legislation in this manner would be restrictive and we would be confining certain aspects of welfare when, in fact, to use Deputies Ryan's phrase, the range of aspects which can be incorporated is almost infinite.</P>
    <P>The section should be left as it is so that as welfare issues arise in the future the representative bodies can consider whether there is discrimination and injustice which should be remedied by way of a scheme which may not be in the legislation but which can be changed by way of a regulation.  I ask the Deputies to consider the points I have made in greater detail.  The point I have been making can be shown up in the amendments proposed by the Deputies.  Deputy Nealon's amendment refers to pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact that the word &ldquo;pensions&rdquo; has been removed from the Deputy's amendment elaborates my point that the range of areas is infinite. All of the areas covered in the amendments are interesting for incorporation in regulations, and must be incorporated in regulations, but they do not include some of the matters I committed myself to including in my letter accompanying the Chief of Staff's proposals.  For example, credit unions are not covered in any of the amendments.  Deputy Nealon has included a family support system in his amendment but neither Deputy McCartan nor Deputy Ryan have included it in their amendments.  I have included recreational facilities but these are not included in any of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical benefit schemes are included under the word &ldquo;medical&rdquo; in Deputy McCartan's and Deputy Nealon's amendments.  I have included the words &ldquo;welfare matter such as&rdquo; in section 2 (1) which emphasises that these are only examples of welfare matters.  If we put into legislation the specifics the Deputies are talking about we would be putting restrictive clauses into legislation when what we want is the inclusion of allembracing welfare matters in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Deputies to address their minds to this aspect.  I want to repeat that this is enabling legislation and all we want to include is the central issue of remuneration. That is included in section 2 (1) and the definition of remuneration includes pay, allowances, gratuities, grants, etc. Remuneration is included because it is so central and basic to the Bill.  Other matters are important but they are subsidiary to the matter of pay.  Section 2 (1) refers to conditions of service, health and welfare matters and such matters as the Minister may specify in the regulations. All the matters I referred to in my letter enclosed with the proposals are for detailed discussion and consultation with the elected representatives of the <Col N="1397" /> Defence Forces.  These include all welfare areas and conditions of service which they wish to have incorporated in the regulations.  These regulations can be reviewed as the years go on and any additions or improvements made.</P>
    <P>That is the secenario as I see it and it was explained very fully by me on Second Stage.  It was also explained fully by Deputies Hillery and Kitt to the members of PDFORRA who were entirely happy with it.  I want to repeat the open commitment I gave in this House that all of these conditions of service and welfare matters will be incorporated in the regulations reached after agreement with the Defence Force representatives.  I hereby guarantee that every one of the representations in regard to the range of conditions of service and welfare issues they raise with me or my representative will be incorporated in the regulations. If we arrogate to ourselves the right to decide on our list of conditions of service and welfare matters we will be unduly restrictive.  Such a list may not be comprehensive enough, may be too restrictive and the representative association may wish to add some nuance or other and put emphasis on what they regard as their priorities.  I want them to be involved in the consultations and make the decisions, with which I will agree, about what they want in regard to conditions of service and welfare matters.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies look at the issue in this light I believe they will agree that any further definitions would be harmful to the interests of the people whom we are seeking to help, the personnel of the Defence Forces.  The amount of detail required to get it right would make the Bill very cumbersome and may not be exhaustive enough because human aspirations, wishes and requirements can vary and are infinite and may become more so as the years go on.  I am trying to introduce a high degree of flexibility and common sense into legislation.  I want to emphasise that this is not legislation for today and tomorrow but is legislation for real.  If it is going to be legislation for real it must be a flexible framework within which adjustments can be made, first by <Col N="1398" /> way of regulation agreed to by the representatives of the Defence Forces and, second, if they require further review, additions or amendments in the future, they will be able to influence such changes as may be required in the circumstances. I hope I have made myself plain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given an absolutely unqualified guarantee that all of the matters included in the amendments put down by the Deputies will be provided for in the regulations.  There are a couple of points I should like to make.</P>
      <P>The fact that the last four speakers have debated whether the amendments include A or B illustrates the danger of inserting a list into the Bill.  If we insert a list into the Bill it will be interpreted in a certain way.  The list in Deputy Nealon's amendment &mdash; I accept his bona fides in the matter &mdash; is not all-inclusive.  Neither is Deputy McCartan's list all-inclusive. Because these lists are not all-inclusive they exclude certain matters and are limited. The amendment which most commends itself to me is Deputy Ryan's because it seeks to be open-ended.</P>
      <P>It is worth reminding ourselves of what the Minister is saying in the draft.  His approach is to improve matters affecting remuneration and such other matters as will be specified in the regulations.  The Minister has now given a guarantee that he is prepared to incorporate a whole range of other issues even greater than the Deputies have proposed in their amendments.</P>
      <P>The first point I would make is that unless one includes a truly comprehensive list covering all matters, one is being restrictive.  Deputy Ryan intends to avoid being restrictive by suggesting an amendment which comes close to being open ended.  The approach which is being adopted by the Minister, however, is more open ended still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I would make is one which is well worthy of consideration.  I accept the point made by Deputy Nealon &mdash; I am not scoring a point here &mdash; but if we incorporate words such as pensions, welfare, schemes for medical benefit, <Col N="1399" /> family support systems, health, education, housing and all other related matters, we then have a drafting problem in that one would have to incorporate a precise meaning for every one of those words in the definition section of the Bill. We have already accepted that that is not a totally comprehensive list, but many of those things would take weeks, possibly months of drafting time to define.</P>
    <P>Deputies said last night that we should throw over all this nonsense about parliamentary draftsmanship and have modern words for modern law.  Getting away from some of the archaic words has much to commend it but we present laws in this format and if we attempted to establish a totally comprehensive list that would satisfy everybody who truly have the interests of the members of the Defence Forces at heart, it would be a very long list indeed.  The whole matter would be thrown back into the drafting arena where months would have to be spent providing specific definitions.</P>
    <P>There is a further point which was raised by Deputy McCartan last night.  If we go the route which is suggested in amendments Nos. 5 and 6 the matter is then left back to the courts for interpretation and perhaps not this year, perhaps not next year, perhaps never, but some time the courts could take the view that the listing which is incorporated in the Act is an exhaustive listing and excludes all else.  That would produce an inflexible situation which none of the Members who have spoken want.  I submit that it would be far more sensible to adopt the open ended approach which the Minister has guaranteed will take into account all the aspirations and wishes of the Deputies who have taken the trouble to put forward amendments.  It will go further; it has the very considerable benefit that it will act as a reassurance to the duly elected representatives of the Defence Forces personnel that they will be able to come along and raise such other issues as concern them.</P>
    <P>I am not questioning any Deputy's bona fides.  I am sure the Deputies who feel they speak on behalf of PDFORRA <Col N="1400" /> are being sincere, but we cannot possibly satisfy ourselves that any listing which we would put into law would be totally comprehensive and would totally represent the wishes of the elected representatives of the Defence Forces.  We know what we wish to attain.  The Minister has given an unequivocal guarantee as to what he will see is incorporated in the regulations.  The Deputies having made their point it would be much better if we now left the matter thus, let the issues be incorporated into the regulations and let the duly elected representatives of the Defence Forces personnel add their wisdom to the wisdom of the House in the matter.  That is not in any way disingenuous. It is an open ended approach and it certainly achieves what the Labour Party wish to achieve in talking amendment No. 7, that is, the widest possible range of options.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister feels strongly about everything.  Unfortunately he is not willing to do anything to change the Bill.  Where is the point in parading his concern to us and simply not accepting the most reasonable amendments as, according to himself, they reflect his own thinking.  We are simply asking for a procedure.  The Minister, with all the expertise of his Department and all the draftsmen at his disposal, can frame an amendment for Report Stage.  As far as I am concerned I want this in this Bill. Why frame the narrowest definition possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roche said that if we produced a list it would not be an exhaustive one. We are not suggesting that we should eliminate any other such matters.  I accept the Minister's point that there will be further developments and that things we have not thought of now will happen in the future, but these can be easily covered.  The Minister, however, is persisting with the narrowest possible definition and is not even willing to delete the phrase &ldquo;if any&rdquo;.  There will be changes, as Deputy Roche says, but the Minister is not even willing to concede to us and remove that in order to get a good Bill of which he could be proud when he <Col N="1401" /> moves on to higher regions in later life. I am very disappointed.  What is in the Bill is very important, even if the Minister can cover it by regulations, because it indicates the thinking of the legislators as to what we are seeking to do for members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>We failed to get any movement on section 7 and whatever regulations are made will never be debated in this House. Therefore, it is all the more important that everything possible should be written into the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister at this late stage to consider at least offering us an amendment incorporating what Deputies Ryan, McCartan and I have in mind on Report Stage.  Otherwise I will persist with my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally support the Minister. It is not a question of coming in to bat for him.  On the basis of the excellent discussion and debate I believe sincerely in the Minister's approach.  All these matters are inter-related in the broader debate we had on regulations and how they will come into play.  What the Minister is saying is that the Defence Forces representatives should know best because the matters we are discussing relate to them.  They are the ones who want conditions improved.  Deputy Nealon said that the Minister should be more flexible with regard to amendments. The Minister does not want to see anything left out.  He has already referred to some of the matters which have been left out in the combination of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would support one point made by Deputy Nealon.  Obviously there will be other matters to be raised by the representatives.  My view is that the Minister should consider leaving out the phrase &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, whatever the parliamentary draftman's reason for its inclusion. The Minister is saying that all matters are up for discussion and Deputy McCartan is talking about the definition of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; being restrictive.  The contrary is the case.  If we leave out the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; it will cover a broad spectrum. I would strongly ask Deputies <Col N="1402" /> opposite to absorb the message being delivered by the Minister.</P>

We are trying to add matters which we consider of equal importance, retaining all such other matters as the Minister might consider.  This does not restrict or curtail considerations in the slightest.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about an important drafting point.  Regarding the phrase &ldquo;remuneration and such other matters&rdquo;, there is a possibility that the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; will be taken as a reference to remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that I am addressing a lawyer.  The risk is that a court asked to interpret what is meant by other matters will decide that the phrase &ldquo;and such&rdquo; is an indication that these other matters refer to remuneration.  I would ask the Minister even to take out <Col N="1403" /> the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;.  If Deputy Kitt thinks it would help to omit the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, I have no difficulty.  I am concerned that the expression &ldquo;remuneration and such other matters&rdquo; will be taken to mean remuneration and related matters.  For that reason I am asking the Minister to consider it before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>What is this House about if it has no function at this stage?  The general drift of Government contributions addressed to this side of the House is that everything can be dealt with in the regulations and that we should not seek to amend the provisions of the Bill.  That is not good enough for me as a legislator and as someone who has a role to play in seeking to influence and improve the legislation before the House.  I cannot understand why the Minister suggests that we are being foolhardy or seeking to do something which would be harmful.  He says that in the context of suggesting that matters are infinite.  Of course they are and nothing that we are suggesting in any way denies that infinity.  Of course it would be impossible to litanise all the matters that would emerge.  My amendment is there to highlight the basic issues which have troubled soldiers in recent times, which have been highlighted in debates inside and outside this House and which should be incorporated in the Bill. Remuneration is only one of them.  That point was made time and again by representatives of the soldiers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche has suggested that Deputy Ryan's amendment is the one which would be best of all.  I support that in the spirit of a unified Opposition.  If we take Deputy Ryan's amendment, which I have no hesitation in supporting in the absence of anything better being suggested, we would be then providing for remuneration and conditions of employment and service.  One of the fundamental causes of the spouses was to identify the vast ranges of issues and concerns outside direct remuneration and employment, for example, the housing of families and the health and welfare of children which would not be covered.</P>

There is a list of one item and all other matters; we are proposing a list of three or four items and all other matters that might arise.  I cannot see the slightest difficulty.  I am concerned that the wording as it stands may be interpreted as the very restrictive ground of remuneration and related matters only.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister why the wording of the 1977 Garda Síochána Act was not borrowed, given that it is the precedent for everything else he has argued for.  Why not adopt the formula there, if nothing more, of welfare and efficiency?</P>

Notwithstanding that, I ask the Minister to delete &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; and then come forward with a range of words that would strengthen the measure.  I know we cannot incorporate everything, but on this side of the House we want to strengthen it somewhat.  The Minister has the staff who can draft a form of words that would be acceptable to the Opposition and would be at the same time in line with his own stated objectives of the wide range of aspects that may be discussed when the Bill is passed.  That might go some way to resolving this.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan has referred to a one-item list, but it is worth recalling that remuneration is a comprehensive thing in itself.  It covers the central issue of pay together with, as legally defined, allowances, gratuities, grants, pensions, retirement pay or gratuity on retirement, so it covers a number of central issues as far as the bargaining relationship is concerned.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it is worth recalling what is regarded as good industrial relations practice on the broader scene.  Returning to a point we made earlier in the debate, flexibility is of the essence, and both sides, particularly the employees' side, the personnel in the Defence Forces, need to have the flexibility to push the bargaining boundaries in discussion with the official side.  The thrust of what the Minister and we on this side have been saying, is that we do not want to restrict anything in advance and that it will prove to be very comprehensive in practice in due course, but within the regulations. Therefore, we must be careful about not restricting under legislation something that is much more appropriately handled in the give and take of discussions at a later point.  In summary, good industrial relations practice would suggest that the list of items should be left to discussions between the two sides and then comprehensively incorporated in regulations.</P>

In that context in case there is a perception that the words &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; might be a saver, as it were, to exclude the matters I am talking about &mdash; which I think we all agree is certainly not the intention &mdash; if it gives rise to that, what I would call, misguided interpretation, misconception, wrong perception or whatever, I will suggest the deletion of those two words.

It is not to be interpreted as Deputy Nealon interpreted something I said yesterday on Second Stage.  Deputy Ryan and Deputy McCartan spoke on a point concerning the phrase &ldquo;welfare and efficiency&rdquo; used in the Garda Síochána Act and Deputy Ryan spoke about strengthening or adding to &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;. If I was going about it I would not add any list.  There is terrible danger in adding a list of matters.  They are really for regulation.  If you have a list of matters you have to define them all. Remuneration is so important and fundamental that it had to be written in and defined.  If you start including a list in this and a definition for each item on that list, and that list might not be exhaustive, you are into all sorts of drafting troubles.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), lines 28 to 32, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;, but excluding&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;that Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My proposition is that in the event of not having met success on the previous two major items of discussion, that is section 7 on the regulations and in regard to expanding in some way on the terms of reference of the organisation, we should in no way tie our hands or those of the negotiators who are going off to do this wonderful job once the Bill has been passed into law.  For that reason I suggest we should not exclude any matter.  Let it be decided between the negotiators, the Minister on the one hand and the Defence Forces' representatives on the other.  Therefore, I propose in my amendment No. 8 that we delete all the words &ldquo;but excluding matters relating to any operation and the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces under the Principal Act and offences in relation to the Defence Forces and military property under that Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be a matter that will be dealt with through the discussions and negotiations on the part of the representatives. That is what the Minister has advocated from the outset should be the approach in this Bill.  Consequently I see no reason why we cannot then agree to <Col N="1408" /> taking out this rather extensive and expansive inclusionary clause that the Minister wishes to write in here.  The process is one of negotiation, of getting it right in negotiations and discussions in formulating the regulations, so why exclude anything at this stage?</P>

      <P>I am sure the House is well aware of what I am going to say. This is one amendment that I cannot accept because it goes to the very heart of the matter.  We must have it written into legislation that matters relating to the operation, raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces are excluded from this Bill.  It is so basic that it is incorporated in the objects and rules of PDFORRA on the very first page. They recognise their responsibilities in this matter and, after the first two innocuous paragraphs in their constitution, they emphasise the fundamental principle in paragraph (c) which says that the association shall be of a consultative nature and shall at no time seek to interfere with the organisation, structure or command of the Defence Forces.  Paragraph (d) states that the association recognise that they have no power to take industrial action.  They also say that the association shall be non-political and shall not be aligned to any other opposition whatsoever.  It shows that their thinking in relation to this matter is cautious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter germane to the amendment tabled by the Deputy is in paragraph (c), to which I have already referred, that the association shall at no time seek to interfere with the organisation, structure or command of the Defence Forces. I congratulate them on being so emphatic and showing recognition of the proper division of powers and responsibilities between a representative association with a military organisation and the exigencies of a military organisation.  There is a very solid perception of the realities of the situation in their own constitution. I regard it as fundamental to follow the lead given to me by the people concerned <Col N="1409" /> who started this organisation and many of whose members will, I hope, be part of the new structures.  They have given the Oireachtas a lead in showing their very clear perception of the distinction between what a representative body within the force can do in regard to pay, conditions of service and a whole range of welfare matters and what I have excluded here and which Deputy McCartan is seeking to amend.  They can see the point in excluding matters relating to the operation and the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces.  These are matters strictly under the command and discipline heading of the military which are excluded from the organisation's considerations.</P>
    <P>We must show our responsibilities in regard to this matter.  I appeal to Deputy McCartan to withdraw his amendment because it is quite clear on any logical assessment of the legislation what it is intended to do.  One must exclude this area of command and discipline having regard to the nature of the Defence Forces because they are incorporated in our Constitution as having a very specific security role.  All that makes it mandatory to ensure that military matters are not open to discussion because, otherwise, there would be a complete collapse of military command and discipline. However, I will not go into that.  On all these grounds I object to the amendment and I appeal to Deputy McCartan to recognise the legitimacy of my view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to this very basic matter on Second Stage and it goes to the core of our Defence Forces.  I draw a clear distinction between command, constituton and discipline within the Defence Forces and the matter we discussed earlier in relation to pay, remuneration and welfare.  There is a very clear demarcation line between the two and PDFORRA have recognised this.  The Army have a special role and the distinction which the Minister has drawn recognises their special role constitutionally, their role in relation to the Oireachtas and the State.  I said on <Col N="1410" /> Second Sage &mdash; and I repeat it &mdash; that we should steer clear of that area in the interests of the Army, the nation and the public generally.  We should keep away from basic hard core military matters.  I urge Deputy McCartan not to pursue this issue because we are going to the heart of their standing.</P>
      <P>We are covering the other area very comprehensively and that is the key.  It was dealt with in the last amendment and also discussed yesterday.  They are the matters which we want the Defence Forces' association to pursue to a satisfactory conclusion but this is on a different level and nobody at any level in the Army would like to see us impinge on this very important area of Army life.</P>

      <P>I have been completely misrepresented in the House.  Anybody who listened to me on Second Stage &mdash; or to what I said five minutes ago &mdash; would recognise that I did not for a moment suggest that we should give power and authority to the representative association to do any of the things covered in this amendment.  I merely said that we should exclude nothing and leave it for negotiation and discussion.  Clearly PDFORRA, as is obvious from their constitution, do not want it so it will not arise.</P>
      <P>I am happy to have moved this amendment because it illustrates the double thinking of Members in this House.  We are trying to improve this Bill but we are told &ldquo;Hands off, leave it to the people whom it concerns&rdquo;.  We are told these matters must be excluded under the legislation. I have made my point and I do not wish to pursue the matter.  I am withdrawing my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 32, after &ldquo;Act.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;All disputes in relation to issues of remuneration or conditions of employment or service shall be referred to the Civil Service Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope when discussions are concluded we will have agreement on these amendments. The scheme for conciliation and arbitration is the core of the problem to set in place a mechanism to deal with the various aspects of regulations, terms of reference and all the various items which were discussed here this morning.  The Minister and Fianna Fáil TDs clearly acknowledged that there is an infinite range of matters to be discussed.  Given that the Minister and the Government were not prepared to take our amendments on board in relation to section 7, it is vitally important to write into the Bill the whole system of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various comments have been made about the Garda representative association. One of the main aspects in the setting up of that body was the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is vitally important that the personnel of the Defence Forces have an opportunity to discuss claims relating to pay and allowances, hours of duty, standards of accommodation and so on.  Principles governing recruitment, promotion, transfers, the general application for promotion and the efficiency of the force are all items on which the personnel of the Defence Forces legitimately have a right to express an opinion.  They should also have recourse to an independent body to decide on matters such as claims for pay and conditions, adjustment of rates of pay and allowances, periods of annual leave and sick leave, weekly hours of work and overtime pay.  Throughout the debate Members, particularly on the Opposition side, have pointed out and acknowledged anomalies that exist at present.  We have heard of these matters in our clinics and we are aware of them. <Col N="1412" /> This Bill, on which I commend the Minister, is providing an opportunity for these people to have a say in their working environment, and that is important.</P>
    <P>In the past there has been opposition to this representative body from people who have been in the Defence Forces all their lives and who perhaps did not want change.  I have seen this happen in industry in the past.  People wanted a legitimate say in matters that affected them but there was resentment and it took time to bring about change.  Perhaps there are objections as to how far we are going when we give a say to the members of the Defence Forces on all the matters I have mentioned, and which were mentioned by the Minister.  The matter will be outside the power of the Minister once this Bill is passed and we must incorporate in the Bill a provision for conciliation and arbitration.  The Minister said last night that there is perhaps 99 per cent agreement on this matter but given the number of issues that arise I doubt that.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that there is no conflict and that we make progress in this Bill in bringing together for the first time all the bodies of the Defence Forces.  It is important to write into the Bill a system of conciliation and arbitration so that most of the difficulties can be resolved.  I hope there will not be many but I would ask the Minister very sincerely to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 in my name seeks to have written into the Bill an agreed process of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration.  This area is of vital and basic importance to the success of the association or associations that are set up, to morale within the Defence Forces and to the on-going development of what we are about in this Bill.  It is obvious in many ways from his own expression, and indeed from the Government proposals, that this is also the intention of the Minister.  What I am asking in this case is that this provision, because of its vital importance, be written into the Bill.  It should not be left to anyone's <Col N="1413" /> goodwill or to the Minister of the day but it should be clearly shown here.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will say that in regard to the Garda, civil servants, teachers, local authorities, health boards, vocational education committees and branch managers of employment exchanges there are many schemes of conciliation and arbitration in existence already and he may very well claim that these did not require legislation.  The fact that they have not been included in previous legislation is no valid argument for not putting them into legislation how.  We are developing a new round of legislation and this is a major step as far as the Defence Forces are concerned.  We are breaking new territory and pushing out the parameters as far as the Defence Forces are concerned.  Therefore, why not push out the parameters and make this a better Bill by writing in this vital element?</P>
      <P>The provisions in my amendment are much the same as those in Deputy Ryan's amendment; however I take it he is referring to a scheme like the Civil Service scheme of conciliation but a separate scheme would be required.  Negotiations would take place between representatives of the authorities, whether they be the Department of Defence or the military authorities, and the associations, or in lay terms, the management and staff.  In regard to the agreed system of conciliation, we could follow the pattern that already exists because I think everyone is quite happy with the way that works.</P>
      <P>In regard to arbitration, I had included in the original draft of my amendment an arbitration board but I was told the amendment might not be in order if that was listed.  Therefore, I did not include it but obviously that is what is intended.  At present there is an arbitration board with an independent chairman appointed by the Government, by agreement with both sides, and I do not think there is any difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it the mechanisms the Minister has in mind are precisely the same as I have and Deputy Ryan has in our amendments, but we are seeking to have them <Col N="1414" /> included in the Bill.  It is very important and necessary that we copperfasten this element into future legislation as far as these associations are concerned.  Irrespective of what arguments the Minister might make, I cannot imagine that I could be convinced that this provision should not be included in the Bill as it leaves the Houses of the Oireachtas to be signed by the President.  I am very keen that it be included because we would have a much better Bill if it were and it would get a far better reception from all the ranks in the Defence Forces.  It would add a new dimension to the Bill and, in the end, would be doing no more than the Minister intends at this stage anyway.</P>
    <P>We are not inhibiting the validity of the Bill in any way as far as the future is concerned because I cannot conceive of any situation where negotiations, conciliation and arbitration would not be a vital part of the activities of these associations. If such a transformation comes about by virtue of a situation that we know not of at this point in time, obviously new legislation will be needed. I hope the Minister in his new conciliatory approach will be willing to take this element on board.</P>

Anyway we will not make a point of it &mdash; all I am saying is that there can be no element of lack of trust as far as I am concerned in my commitment to establishing a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  That scheme will be introduced as priority No. 1 in the regulations. I do not see anything else we are talking about as being anything as important as having a scheme of conciliation and arbitration at the end of the day.  That is what makes the whole thing worthwhile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>But I see no reason whatsoever for writing it into legislation.  It is not in legislation that you incorporate a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
      <P>There is a wide range of schemes already in existence over the whole range of the public service.  The schemes currently in existence cover civil servants, teachers, gardaí, local authority and health board officers, vocational education committee staff and so on.  In all of these schemes there are two essential features: the conciliation level where there are agreed procedures for discussions of claims between representatives of the staff and management; the arbitration level where there are arrangements for arbitration on major issues, including pay if agreement is not reached at the conciliation level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various features in the different schemes, but all of them have one thing in common, they are flexible and variable depending on the particular employment concerned.  That is an important consideration.  There is no blanket scheme and each scheme takes cognisance of the requirements of the particular area of employment.  That is <Col N="1416" /> why I think it would be entirely inappropriate to adopt Deputy Ryan's proposal, with all due respects to him, that all disputes in regard to remuneration and conditions shall be referred to the Civil Service scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  I am not going to do that but I am going to refer it to a specific scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Defence Forces.  I envisage a far wider concept in this regard.  I think that putting the Defence Forces arbitrarily into a Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme is not what is required.  We want to see incorporated in the regulations a conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Defence Forces agreed between our representatives and their representatives and one that is suitable for them.  Indeed there are many issues that will arise from time to time that need not necessarily go to arbitration but which the association and the official side could work out themselves on a regular basis.  This is the way it works in the case of the Garda Síochána conciliation and arbitration scheme.  They have regular meetings, have regular exchanges and make regular representations and agreement is reached without recourse to conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way the system works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to ensure that the Defence Forces are not buried within a general Civil Service scheme but that they have their own scheme.  That is my intention as of now and that would be their wish as well.  I want to warn Deputy Ryan &mdash; and this shows the weakness of incorporating matters of this kind into legislation &mdash; that as long as there is a commitment to doing so let us include it in a regulation where we can be flexible, adaptable and have the scheme that is particularly suited to the requirements of the Defence Forces which can be called a Defence Forces scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  We can incorporate that in the regulation after agreement has been reached between the representatives of the Defence Forces, the official <Col N="1417" /> side and the Minister as to what should be incorporated in the regulations.  I say in all sincerity that the amendments are inappropriate and restrictive.  Deputy Nealon's proposal that:</P>
      <P>An association shall represent its members through the agreed process of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration schemes</P>
      <P>is a general aspiration to which I am committed.  However, I do not see the need for that in legislation.  It is restrictive, it is holding back when in fact that I want to see, in addition to the list of conciliation and arbitration schemes that already exists for the Garda, teachers etc., is a scheme for the Defence Forces. In none of the other cases is there any statutory basis for the conciliation and arbitration schemes.  They are based on a contract system between the relevant employer and the staff side, in other words the employer and staff side come together and decide what type of conciliation and arbitration scheme they want and they agree it on a contract basis rather than on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>All schemes are on the basis of contract and not of statute.  In effect that will be embodied in the regulations and there will be a contract between the official side and the representatives who will sit down and tease out the type of conciliation and arbitration scheme they want and whatever scheme will emerge from their discussions will then be incorporated in regulations governing the Defence Forces.  That is the outline of the scheme and I would be very proud to see it introduced. In my view it crowns the whole system.  A representative body acting without a conciliation and arbitration scheme would be just a talking shop, a vehicle for making representations, excellent and all as that might be, but without the follow-up of a conciliation and arbitration scheme to add real weight to the case they are making in the event of agreement not being possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Forces must at the end of the day have the right to conciliation and arbitration to further their case to the ultimate conclusion in the event of <Col N="1418" /> non-agreement with the authorities.  I lay great stress on having an appropriate scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Defence Forces, but I place equal weight on the fact that it must be worked out on an agreed basis between the representatives and the authorities and incorporated in regulations that can be flexible and can be amended from time to time.  Again I made the point earlier on another aspect that the regulation can be amended and adjusted in the light of changing circumstances in the future.</P>
    <P>I place great importance on it but I do not consider it necessary to incorporate it in legislation, if you incorporate it in legislation you make it unduly restrictive. It is my clear intention to have such a scheme but I want it to be the most flexible scheme possible and written into regulations which can be changed for the better in the future.</P>
    <P>As the process goes on, and as consultation between the representative body or bodies and the authorities take place over the years, this can develop in the sensible manner that our existing schemes of conciliation and arbitration have on a non-statutory basis.  In this case we will have flexible provisions incorporated in the regulations.  The scheme will be flexible and will suit the requirements of the members of the defence forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this provision is the nub of the Bill. Without it the Bill would be useless.  It is for that reason that I am concerned that there is no reference to conciliation or arbitration in the Bill.  It is the Minister's intention to set up such a scheme, but under the regulations.  The document circulated by the Minister refers to independent conciliation and arbitration processes but there is no reference to that in the Bill and that is unfortunate.  That is a weakness in the Bill.  The Bill should have at least referred to a system of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must bear in mind that we are talking about 245 representatives from the various units.  It should be obvious that it will not be possible to bring <Col N="1419" /> those representatives together to negotiate on, for example, pay levels, just as it is impossible to bring all the shop stewards of one industry to a sitting of the Labour Court.  There is a need for the setting up of an executive structure, a select group from the representative body who would negotiate under the conciliation and arbitration schemes.  I do not disagree with the point made by the Minister about the need for a separate system for the Defence Forces.  In my view it would be better to have a new structure established.  It is my intention to support the amendment tabled by my colleague because it is along the lines of the Minister's proposals.  My colleague is afraid that the Bill will not contain a reference to conciliation and arbitration machinery. It is not sufficient that that machinery will be referred to in the regulations.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister takes cognisance of the fact that a manual on industrial relations in the Defence Forces has not been produced.  There are no experts on industrial relations in the Defence Forces.  The welfare officers in the different units deal with routine queries. The experts on conciliation and arbitration are in the Department.  I am not suggesting that the Minister, or his officials, will not make every effort to set up a structure that will stand the test of time but it is important that such a structure has an independent chairman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not have an independent chairman negotiations will go on forever.  A person skilled in industrial relations negotiations should be appointed because that person at the end of the day may be asked to give a casting vote for or against the case made.  It is important that negotiations do not get bogged down at conciliation and arbitration level and that it is explained to members of the Defence Forces that when we are talking about arbitration we are referring to a decision-making function.  At conciliation negotiations can go on for a long time but at arbitration a <Col N="1420" /> decision is made.  It is necessary to give training on industrial relations procedures to selected representatives of the Defence Forces, particularly those who are successful in the elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 10 which represents a general statement of principle.  It does not contain any concept of restriction whatever.  It merely states than an association shall represent its members through the agreed process of conciliation and arbitration schemes. The Minister has told us that he intends to establish a specific conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Defence Forces and I should like to emphasise that on that basis there should be no difficulty in writing that into the Bill.  The Minister has often reminded us that this is an enabling Bill that simply announces in general terms, and provides the enabling basis in general terms, of the establishment of representative bodies. The Minister points out in his document that a system of conciliation and arbitration will be established.  That is a blunt declaration and there is unanimity for that concept.  The idea was presented by the officers in their submission to the Gleeson Commission on pay and related matters which was presented six days in advance of the publication of the Minister's document.</P>

They sought advice since last July but did not receive any from the Department.  As a result they prepared their own constitution, a brave but to some degree uncertain step by them.  It is acknowledged that the Minister is taking a step in the right direction and that is appreciated.  However, we are suggesting that the Minister write the principle into the Bill, the grounding document for this process.  If that is done we can rest assured that there will not be a hiccup in the future should the mood <Col N="1421" /> or the views change in whatever quarters. I appeal to the Minister to accept amendment No. 10 which does not represent any incursion into his plans and endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to focus on Deputy Ryan's amendment which states that all disputes in relation to issues of remuneration or conditions of employment or service shall be referred to the Civil Service scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  The first part of the amendment is unnecessary in that good practice and actual practice will mean that the vast majority of problems and disputes will be resolved directly in discussions without reference to the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  The record shows that in all those schemes, and in industrial relations generally, the overwhelming majority of disputes are settled where they should be settled, nearest the problem in direct discussions between the parties. In the give and take of day-to-day practice it will not and should not be necessary to insert a provision that all disputes shall be referred to the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>The distinction between the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme and a specific one for the Army has been well made.  We have a duty to provide one to meet the particular circumstances of Defence Forces employment.  The conciliation and arbitration schemes do not have any statutory basis and that brings us back to the flexibility which characterises good practice.  It is to avoid inflexibility and to avoid rigidity that the detail of the conciliation and arbitration schemes are not spelt out in legislation.  Of course the detail will require to be spelt out under regulations which will be the result of direct discussions and agreement.  In regard to what is arbitrable Deputy Bell made the important point that there is a finality to what is arbitrable but it is also a fact that both sides &mdash; and I include the representatives of the Defence Forces &mdash; will have a direct input into what will be arbitrable in due course so they will have an ownership and a commitment to what will be agreed in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> In relation to the final point made by Deputy Bell regarding training it is evident in all sorts of employments that the key to success in the area of relationships, negotiations and discussions hinges heavily on the knowledge, the skills and the attitudes of the people directly involved at the work place and that therefore training is very important.  It is particularly important in the case of the Defence Forces because they are new to this system.  It is not within their experience to be dealing with matters of this kind.  I would strongly suggest that training facilities be made available in due course for these representatives because it will be money well invested in terms of what we are all trying to achieve, that is, good policies and practices in the Defence Forces in the areas we have in mind.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who have contributed to what has been a very constructive discussion on this aspect.  I am glad it has been of that nature because, as Deputy Bell said, it is the fundamental aspect of what we are doing here that a scheme of this kind for the Defence Forces is being introduced. I also reiterate that in order to have the scheme as flexible as possible it is better that the detail be spelt out in regulations.  Deputy Hillery has accentuated that point.  Having said that, there is something to be said for the point of view mentioned by Deputy McCartan and which is, in effect, incorporated in Deputy Nealon's amendment, that is, that we should incorporate in the Bill a general declaration that there will be an agreed process of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration or something of that nature, that we should have a general one line statement in the Bill to that effect, without going into any detail.  We can leave the detail, as Deputy McCartan suggested, for further inevitable negotiation. I will certainly look very closely at that point and I will do something on that one line statement on the lines of Deputy Nealon's amendment for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" />&ldquo;(3)  An association shall have the right of free access to the media by means of spokespersons nominated by the association.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with free access to the media which is another fundamental element but perhaps not as fundamental as is the process of conciliation and arbitration.  Nevertheless it is one that could cause much greater difficulties. From the history of this Bill my opinion is that the Minister would not be nearly as committed to this particular aspect as he was to the issue of conciliation and arbitration which he said he brought forward. I can envisage great difficulties arising here because of the exposure, by its very nature, to the media, which is something that attracts attention and can create difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has conceded that there will be media exposure or that there will be entitlement of the various associations to have access to the media but he did so on a very gradual basis.  It appeared that this concession was reluctantly dragged from the Minister and from the various authorities.  It came by a nod and wink indication that the Department would not have total objections to media access but this was after this had become one of the important elements.</P>
    <P>I keep saying that the Permanent Defence Forces representative groups document is the Minister's proposals and the Minister described it as a military document but as far as access to the media is concerned there is no question as to what it is.  It is repeated three times that the Government have decided they will permit statements on behalf of individual groups to be made to the media at Defence Forces headquarters level by spokespersons nominated by the group. That is a Government decision and to the extent that it involved access to the media it is very welcome but it is also very curtailing in that it states that access to the media can only be made by spokespersons at Defence Forces headquarters level.  We have a multiplicity of media at present.  It can be a very inhibiting factor that statements should only be made at Defence Forces headquarters level by <Col N="1425" /> spokespersons nominated by the group whereas my amendment suggests that it should be spokespersons nominated by the association.  We will have responsible associations emerging and it is only right that they should be entitled to nominate their spokesperson.  There may, in fact, be different types of spokespersons required for different aspects of an area in which the media are interested.  It is also possible that some of the things that will be dealt with will be concerned specifically with command areas so that a spokesperson from that command area concerned would have far greater knowledge of what was involved and would be able to put over the case more cogently, more concisely and with greater benefit to his own organisation than would be the case if a spokesman was called in from Defence Forces headquarters level. It should be left to the association to nominate their own spokespersons. There should not be any confinement. The issue of access to the media, is repeated three times in this document. The decision to have such access at Defence Forces headquarters level seems to be exclusive of all other levels.  We believe this provision should be included in the Bill and not in regulations.  Because it is such a fundamental issue which may give rise to controversy down the line and generate disputes, it is important to include it in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Nealon's amendment.  My amendment No. 23 and Deputy Nealon's amendment No. 11 basically seek to achieve the same thing but obviously we are going in a different direction by seeking to insert a restriction on the Minister.  Amendment No. 23 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not make any regulation which prevents members, officers, or nominated spokespersons of an association from having free access to the media for purposes associated with the aims and objectives of the association; nor any regulation which seeks to instruct an association as to the purposes for which it will use its <Col N="1426" /> own funds; nor any regulation which seeks to interfere in any election process provided for by the rules of an association.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental to incorporate this provision in the Bill and not to leave it to the Minister to incorporate it in regulations. Access to the media is a very thorny issue particularly as it relates to the Defence Forces.  This has been acknowledged in the recent past by representatives who felt under pressure from their members to take a certain stand.  Many people believed they had no other option but to go public on certain issues which affected them.  I do not intend to delve into that case which is probably <i>sub judice</i> but it shows the delicate issues involved when members of the Defence Forces go public on a particular issue.  We have to acknowledge, by way of regulation and legislation, the right of people in defined areas to make their case.  We will have to assure PDFORRA or the representative association proposed in the Bill that there will be no interference in the organisation, structure or command of the Defence Forces.  I believe this is what we all want to achieve.</P>
    <P>I believe it is necessary to include amendment No. 23 in the Bill in order to tighten up its provisions and to ensure that everyone is clear about the direction we are going so that there will be no conflict between the top and bottom levels in the Defence Forces.  The Minister has acknowledged in this House the right of members of the representative body or bodies to have recourse to the media in certain circumstances.  If this provision is incorporated in the Bill it will strengthen it and be in the interests of all members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the inclusion in the Bill of a statement on the right of access to the media by spokespersons of the representative groups.  While I appreciate the approach taken by Deputy Ryan in his amendment I prefer the positive declaration in Deputy Nealon's amendment.  As Deputy Ryan said, both <Col N="1427" /> amendments seek to achieve the same thing while going in different directions.</P>
      <P>The question of access to the media is a very odd and curious one and has been a feature, almost by default, of the peculiar history we can attach to the development and maintenance of the Defence Forces. For some reason it was believed that they were not allowed to talk to anyone and there were regulations in place which said they could not be seen or heard in public on issues affecting them.  That is not the position and should never have been. This helps us to understand the need for representative associations and why we should now record, as a general principle, that we believe access to the media is a democratic right which the people in the Defence Forces, like people in all other areas of trade, should have.  I prefer the simple declaration in Deputy Nealon's amendment that the representative association should have the right of free access to the media.  The Minister has acknowledged both on Second Stage and in his letter accompanying the Chief of Staff's proposals that they should have this right.  He said, and I quote: &ldquo;Spokespersons will be permitted to make statements to the news media on specified matters which fall within the scope of the representative groups.&rdquo;  I believe we are on all fours in regard to this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged the importance of including declarations of principle in enabling legislation. During the debate on the previous set of amendments the Minister thankfully said that he will work with us on Report Stage towards incorporating such a declaration. To abandon that process at this stage of this important issue would perhaps give the wrong impression to those concerned that the Minister cannot go the same distance in regard to this issue.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge that what we are doing is laying down some principles which we believe should exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the proceedings taken at defence military level against Mr. Michael Martin.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that the <Col N="1428" /> disciplinary action is brought to an end in the good spirit of what we are doing here and will do in the months to come. It would be regrettable if the disciplinary action taken against him within the Defence Forces overshadowed what we are doing here.  Mr. Martin spoke to members of the media who met him, without notice, at the airport on his return from a meeting with groups abroad about the duties assigned to him by PDFORRA.  I do not think this matter should be pursued any further by way of disciplinary action within the Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that the matter is resolved fairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to comment on the last remarks made by Deputy McCartan.  Because it is a very sensitive matter and probably <i>sub judice,</i> I believe it is better not to discuss it.  The Minister is an old soldier who knows a bit about that game too.  It is referred to in section 5 and, in more detail in annex G on page 7, and that is the one that concerns me. It would seem to indicate that a statement can only be made from Army headquarters. It raises the question as to who would authorise a statement.  Does it mean that the Chief of Staff would have the responsibility of deciding what might or might not be given to the media?  Also the representative body will probably be located in some barracks or preferably outside of an army location.  As is normal in industrial relations, that representative body would issue statements from time to time following meetings.  If that is covered in regulations and not in the Bill there would be a problem.  If this were incorporated in the Bill it would encompass the main thrust of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the broad sense it is important to incorporate it in the Bill.  There is no doubt that otherwise section 14 of annexe G will cause problems because somebody will have to decide what is to be said. There is no problem in relation to statements following conciliation and arbitration because in such case the normal practice is to issue an agreed statement <Col N="1429" /> from both sides.  What worries me is the situation where the representative body is discussing the result of conciliation and arbitration and the media want to know what they discussed and how they came to a conclusion.  If this had to be referred to Defence Force Headquarters there would be all sorts of problems.  Who would actually make the decision on what was to be said?  It would be better to have a broad statement encompassing the two amendments along the lines that the Minister accepted on the previous amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate what I said in my letter regarding the document sent out by the Chief of Staff in which I pledged myself to the proposition that spokespersons will be permitted to make statements to the news media on specified matters which fall within the scope of the representative groups under the heading of access to the media.  That such groups have such access to the media is so self-evident that it is totally unnecessary to incorporate it in legislation.  One cannot establish representative groups and not give them access to the media.  They must have access to the media.  They must be able to express their point of view in accordance with their mandate in representing their members on matters of pay, conditions of service and the whole range of welfare issues that we discussed this morning and on conciliation and arbitration proceedings that may or may not follow particular discussions and negotiations. It is so obvious that they must have the right to communicate with the media concerning matters that arise out of their mandate in these areas that it is a reflection on me as Minister to suggest, as is suggested in amendment No. 23, that the Minister may not make any regulations which prevent members from having free access to the media.  That question does not and could not arise.</P>

      <P>Regulations exist in a situation where there are no representative bodies.  This is what we are trying to remedy by establishing these representative bodies.  What Deputy McCartan speaks of will no longer be relevant. There will be representative bodies established by way of regulation under this legislation, and <i>a fortiori</i> they must have the right, within the parameters of their mandate, to appoint spokespersons to speak to the media.  We are in an open society.  This is guaranteed and written into the Constitution.  They cannot be deprived of that right.  No Minister can deprive them of that right.  I find it highly offensive that it should be suggested in an amendment that it requires a specific line in legislation to order me, the Minister, not to make any regulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my next point. That is a matter for them to determine. We are back again to what they wish to see incorporated in regulations.  This surely is a matter that is particularly suited to incorporation in regulations, and I am sure the representative bodies will seek to have a whole range of matters on which they can speak to the media incorporated in regulations.  Broadly speaking, it will be in accordance with what I am suggesting in paragraph 5. There will be provision for the representative bodies to make statements to the media on specified matters that fall within the scope of the representative groups, and that scope will include pay, remuneration, conditions of service, welfare matters and all that each of these covers. Within those parameters the manner in which they wish to present their case to <Col N="1431" /> the media, the title of the spokesperson or spokespersons that they wish to appoint and the circumstances in which they want that done are all matters on which the men themselves will have points to make.  My two colleagues themselves are very much aware that this is a matter of great importance.</P>
      <P>They do not want <i>carte blanche</i> to talk about everything.  They have their own sense of discipline and responsibility. They will have their views on a range of issues.  I may not be comprehensive enough in what I am saying but it is self-evident that they should be allowed to speak through appointed spokespersons on all matters covered by their mandate. They may wish to have their views incorporated in the regulation regarding the circumstances in which they speak to the media.  I want to hear them on that.  It is important that access to the media in a free society should be spelled out in the regulations.  This is particularly a matter for the men themselves, much more so than other matters we have discussed. They know what they will wish to discuss with the media and can impose their own terms and conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us forget about that contentious point.  I agree with Deputy Bell that this is too restrictive and it will be ironed out in the course of discussions. In that spirit I have put paragraph 5 in my letter in which I emphasise that they will be permitted to make statements to the news media on specified matters which fall within the scope of the representative groups.  I left it open and general.  I stand by that terminology which is over my signature.  That is the way I envisage the overall principle but the details can be worked out in consultation with the men.</P>
      <P>This is ideally a matter for discussion and consultation with them.  Their spokespersons will be talking to the media and I imagine they will have a very definite point of view on the extent and nature of what they transmit to the media.  The only parameter is that their interventions, submissions and transmissions to the media should be within the mandate envisaged in the Bill.  The mandate is quite clear.  It covers remuneration, conditions of service and all aspects of the welfare services, but excludes command and discipline.  Within the terms of the mandate they are free to talk to the media.  The details of how and when they do it are a matter for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official side will listen very carefully when the detail of the regulations is being drafted and agreed upon.  There is <Col N="1433" /> no reason there should not be agreement. Writing it into legislation is offensive and carries the implication that in some way one could move otherwise.  One cannot conceive of setting up this sort of body unless they have recourse to the media. They must have such recourse in a free society.  It is self-evident that they cannot be bottled up and not allowed recourse to the media.  It is essential for their purpose. Any other suggestion is totally unreal.  I do not think it appropriate to have this self-evident constitutional right as a free association guaranteed by statute written into legislation.  It is totally superfluous and unnecessary.</P>

They were the distilled thoughts of the Government at that time as to what this association should be.  They were projected as Government proposals issued by direction of the Minister.  It could not come better authenticated than that.  If we got the wrong idea, it was totally the fault of the wording.

There is no use saying everyone accepts there must be.  If that is so, why not put it in, copperfasten it and add to the authenticity and strength of the Bill?  I think it will be very welcome overall, but I will be very happy to see the Minister's own words going in there.  If the draftsmen to whom he pays such attention think any element should be changed, then any change of that nature will be <Col N="1436" /> acceptable to me.  I cannot see that the Minister's own words will be anything but an excellent addition.</P>

      <P>When we are forming a historic, new representative association it is a pity that Deputies go back over old ground.  I have spoken here about the positive mood that is on this side and I see it within individual Deputies, but it is unfortunate that we take up documents that have been clarified time and again as discussion documents and pick out bits and pieces that might cause problems here and there.  The case has well been made that these people will have a democratic right to speak to the media and the media, rightly, will be interested in the early days of the formation of the new group.  I believe we will find also a diversion of opinion with the people from PDFORRA on this issue.  I know from discussions Deputy Hillery and I had with them that they are very much aware of the unique position they hold in speaking to the media.  Deputy Ryan talked about the delicate nature of discussions between the media and people of the Defence Forces.  That is recognised clearly and PDFORRA accept that.  I saw Michael Martin speak to the media after our discussion and all I can say is that the manner in which he spoke to them was most responsible and constructive.  He appreciates what is being done here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bell quite rightly referred to the <i>sub judice</i> aspect.  I think at times there is a better understanding outside this Chamber of what we are doing.  Access to the media has been agreed in principle.  There is no point in putting this into the legislation itself.  It is a matter to be agreed when it comes to regulations and the regulations will deal with that issue.  The Minister quite rightly referred to the range of issues with regard to media access.  Issues of details of who will speak and how they will speak, of pay and service are very clear in my mind. We will find a great deal of agreement <Col N="1437" /> with the representatives of the associations when it comes to dealing with this matter.  I know from my discussions that they are very conscious of the special role they will have in dealing with the media. I have watched the Garda representatives speak to the media and I think this will be something on the same lines.  I can appreciate that they are always conscious of their unique position.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister totally in this. We are into the early formation of a new group, these people will have a democratic right to speak and they will do so. The media will be interested. PDFORRA and Michael Martin in particular will handle that in the manner they have handled it so far.  I support the Minister's view strongly.  I think it is the correct approach, indeed the only approach.  We should not put into an enabling Bill matters that can be handled at regulation stage.</P>

      <P>There has been a peculiar history in the past relating to access to the media and the right of members of the Defence Forces to speak or to be heard.  They have been in a unique position.  There is no comparison or parallel anywhere else in any order of the right of access to the media of people in the workplace.  They have as an illustration the interviewing of Michael Martin coming out of Dublin Airport.  It is incredible.  The person then could be subjected to military discipline.  It illustrates the peculiar, uncertain and woolly thinking about the right of soldiers to be heard.  This is well illustrated by the fact that when it suited the Government or people in authority to have Michael Martin interviewed on the radio after the meeting with Deputies Kitt and Hillery, there was no difficulty.  What was different about the day he was coming home from Europe and met with his colleagues at Dublin Airport or when he was coming out after his meeting in the Aisling Hotel?</P>

Ach, go bunúsach, is eagraíocht fhorbartha tionscail atá ann le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú.  Maidir leis an gceist faoi chuidiú, ceapaimse go bhfuil sé sin léirithe agamsa i mbliana, os rud é go bhfuil suas le £13 mhilliún á chur ar fáil do Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus gur ardaíodh na deontais-igcabhair ó £4.8 mhilliún go dtí £7.4 mhilliún.</P>

Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl do <Col N="1439" /> mhuintir na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil rud ar bith mar sin i gceist.  Is muidne sa Rialtas a bhunaigh Udarás na Gaeltachta leis an reachtaíocht, Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta i 1979.  Tá a lán muiníne agam as an Údarás agus tá go leor jabanna curtha ar fáil acu.

Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil an tAire i ndiaidh a dheimhniú anois go bhfágfar na cúraimí sin ar an Údarás agus go bhfuil sé mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas ligean dóibh leanúint ar aghaidh leis an obair atá ar siúl acu.  Is í an t-aon cheist ná, an gcuirfear na hacmhainní ar fáil dóibh?  Deir an tAire go bhfuil níos mó airgid ann i mbliana ná mar a bhí anuraidh, ach níl acu i mbliana ach an oiread céanna airgid agus a bhí acu sé bliana ó shin.  Má bhíonn acmhainní ar bith ag teastáil ón Údarás an gcuirfear na hacmhainní sin ar fáil dóibh?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 14, 36, 38, 44, 70, 71, 81 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>A task force was established in May 1989 by decision of the Government to identify all realistic investment options for the facilities at Whitegate and Whiddy.  With the assistance of international consultants, the task force are currently evaluating the technical, economic and financial aspects of the options which have been identified.  This work is nearing completion and I expect to receive the report in the very near future.</P>
      <P>No decision has been made yet on the publication of the report of the task force. In view of the confidential and sensitive nature of information which is likely to be contained in the report, it is unlikely that the entire report will be published. I will consider the question of publishing the report when I have studied its contents.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I am continuing to pursue appropriate opportunities which might lead to an oil producer or an international oil company participating in the proposed upgrading of the refinery and reactivation of the terminal.  Because of their confidential nature, however, I am not in a position to discuss the details of individual approaches made by third parties regarding these facilities.  Discussions with interested parties are ongoing but no final proposals are under consideration by me as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the commission have been informed of the Government's general <Col N="1446" /> intentions on the upgrading of the refinery, any further formal approach to the commission could only be based on firm proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister inform the House whether he intends to publish a statement outlining the philosophy behind these attempts at joint venture and to what extent it is his purpose to make Ireland independent of multinationals in respect of oil imports? Can he tell us what is the present status of the Nigerian National Oil Corporation proposals?  What has happened to the £50 million the State received for the disposal of its share in Tara Mines which was supposed to be used to upgrade Whitegate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The Deputy has asked a series of questions, some of them unrelated to the question before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure mentioned by the Deputy is incorrect; it is £25 million. That is being held and is available for investment in the upgrading of the refinery if and when a decision is made to undertake that work.  No application has been received from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation but there was an application from a consortium which had a Nigerian interest.  I replied on numerous occasions to questions about that matter in this House and indicated that that application was rejected last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to the proposals to upgrade the refinery has been explained in the House on a number of occasions.  I do not mind stating very briefly that the intention is to seek to achieve a situation where the oil supplies available to this country are made as secure as possible.  The Government see the retention of a refinery as an important part of the policy in achieving that objective. Because of the age of the refinery, the new standards that are required and other factors, the refinery as it stands is not able to produce the product at a price which is competitive with the imported product.  Therefore, there is a mandatory <Col N="1447" /> régime in operation whereby oil distributing companies here are required to take 35 per cent of their oil distribution requirements from the national refinery at Whitegate.  In order to guarantee the continuation of the Whitegate refinery. the Government have invited interested parties to come forward with proposals for investment in upgrading that facility, which would result in the removal of the mandatory régime and a modern refinery being available to the Irish consumer. That is the philosophy behind the approach that has been taken and there has been no change in that.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a blanket ban by me, or, indeed, by any of my predecessors, on the INPC appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored bodies.  Normally, I would insist that my Department or the <Col N="1448" /> State bodies for which I am responsible would facilitate the committee in every way possible.  It is very difficult, however, if not impossible to see how the committee could examine the activities of the company without touching on issues which are <i>sub judice</i> at present.  An examination in these circumstances could prejudice the interests of the State.</P>
      <P>I have recently written in full explanatory terms to the chairman of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the European Court has ruled in his favour with regard to the mandatory regime?  Would he further agree that the offer from the committee that should the INPC feel at any point that matters that remain to be settled were involved in their evidence they could feel free to turn down the question but address the other matters concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of the opportunity to convey to the members of the committee my desire to try to facilitate them if at all possible but I have been very strongly advised that it would be highly improper of me to authorise the INPC to appear before the committee until the issues which are <i>sub judice</i> are dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to help the members of the committee I will go over the decision of the European Court on 10 July 1984 when the court gave its ruling on the question which was referred to them by the High Court.  In effect the ruling of the European Court stated that while the mandatory regime amounted to a positive restriction on imports, an exemption from the prohibition was justifiable under Article 36 of the Treaty on grounds of public policy and security, if certain conditions were fulfilled &mdash; that is important &mdash; and the decision on that was a matter for the Irish High Court.  Since that ruling, no further action has taken by the six companies to resume the High Court case.  The European Commission, which had also challenged the mandatory <Col N="1449" /> system, withdrew their proceedings finally in May 1987 in the light of the European Court ruling.  The current status of the legal proceedings is as follows: in the aftermath of the European Court decision, the six companies have not resumed proceedings in the High Court and with the exception of an offer made in late 1985 to abandon the matter if their legal costs were paid by the Department, the case has been effectively abandoned by them.  The State, on the advice of the Attorney General, wants the case dismissed, even by default, the issue would then be <i>res judicata</i> and the issue could not be contested further.  I would be very happy, if that was achieved, for the company to appear before the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was attempting to be brief.  Is the Minister making the net point that the issue of costs is all that remains in dispute, and that while he is free to talk about present and future plans for Whitegate, the joint committee of the Oireachtas appointed to do so is debarred on spurious grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  The case is not dependent on the cost being paid and it remains for the High Court to interpret the European Court's decision. If these companies wish to proceed, they still have the option of doing that.  On the other hand if they withdraw their case, the matter is resolved as far as I am concerned.  However, they have done neither.  They have merely said they are prepared to abandon their case if we pay their costs, which is a situation I could not entertain.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>whether he is concerned at the standards of safety precautions in place in the nuclear industries of eastern Europe; and whether he has taken any initiatives at EC level to deal with this problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a widespread concern about nuclear safety in eastern Europe which I share.  Since the Chernobyl accident, there have been a number of incidents which, although they did not receive much publicity, raised serious questions about the safety of nuclear reactors in eastern Europe, both in their design and operation.  My concern is shared by other EC member states, and the matter is being discussed within the Community under Ireland's Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's position is that the EC should avail of every opportunity to influence eastern European countries in regard to nuclear safety.  In this context, I will continue to press for the establishment of a Community inspection force, to ensure compliance with the safety standards laid <Col N="1451" /> down in the Euratom Treaty.  The EC should try to lead eastern Europe by example, by ensuring that nuclear installations in the Community have the highest possible safety standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that referring to the Community inspection force, whose sole remit will be within the EC, does not meet the question?  In view of the fact that eastern Europe is planning a rapid expansion of nuclear capacity by the end of the century, would the Minister not agree that he has a unique opportunity on behalf of the Community to put some concrete proposals in place?  Would he consider going further than he has gone up to now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the eastern European countries also participate in that agency.  On the basis of an Irish initiative, the agency has missions which review the effectiveness of national regulatory bodies.  There are also operational safety review teams, OSRT and the eastern European countries have availed of the services of the review teams and have had them visit and inspect their plants.  They have been involved in some of the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency so our work in this area is not confined to whatever influence we may have within the European Community as we are also able to influence matters by our membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  That is a more effective body because the eastern European countries participate in this body.  While I referred to the Community inspection force I was only making the point that we would be giving better example to our eastern European neighbours if we put our own nuclear energy safety matters in better order within the Community, something which Ireland has been pressing for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the EC is now acting as the main conduit of international funds to <Col N="1452" /> assist eastern Europe and is it not the case that the Minister has a unique opportunity to go beyond merely giving example, which is not that great given the situation in Sellafield?  Should the Minister be going further and trying to get something done about these problems within that programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be fully aware that Ireland is leading the drive within the Community for higher standards of nuclear safety.  We have had support from some countries but there are other countries which are very committed to nuclear energy.  It is not reasonable to expect that we will achieve the objectives we have set ourselves within a short period of time because of the high level of opposition to some of the proposals we are sponsoring from other member countries.  We have to face that reality.  For instance, in France the electricity system is largely based on atomic energy.  I think the Deputy recognises the difficulties we have but this does not deter Ireland from continuing its campaign for a European wide inspectorate and for higher rules and regulations in regard to nuclear safety and inspectorate.</P>

      <P>The appointment of a chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Board is a matter for the board and I was not involved in any discussions with them on the matter.  Recently, the chairman informed me that Dr. Noel Nowlan, the present chief executive, has tendered his resignation from 30 June.  The board did not wish to enter into a procedure to fill the post of chief executive of the NEB permanently in view of the imminent establishment of the new National Radiological Protection Institute.  A chief executive appointed from 30 June would <Col N="1453" /> have a very short term of office before the institute, with a new chief executive, was in place.</P>
      <P>The chairman, therefore, notified me that the board propose to fill the chief executive post on an interim basis by appointing Dr. T. O'Flaherty as chief executive from 1 July next until the Nuclear Energy Board is replaced.  Dr. O'Flaherty served on the board of the Nuclear Energy Board from 1982 to 1987, has been acting as an adviser to the board since 1987 and has been chairman of the board's advisory committee on process irradiation for some years.  He was a senior staff member in An Foras Talúntais before taking up duty in my Department in 1988.  It was necessary for the board to consult me to ensure that Dr. O'Flaherty could be released for whatever period is necessary.  In the interests of the efficient operation of the board I agreed to his release.</P>

The matter was resolved but there were other matters which delayed it, such as international agreements which we wanted to include in the Bill.  We had to make provision for them and that has been done.  I used the word &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; because the intention is to circulate the Bill today or tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position was not advertised.  It would have been very foolish to advertise it at that time because one could not expect to get a reasonable response to an advertisement for a position which was only going to last for a couple of months. This will be a very senior appointment <Col N="1454" /> and when the Bill is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and brought into force the new institute will be established.  The position of chief executive for the new institute will be advertised then.  It would have been very foolish, a waste of time and money, to have advertised for a temporary chief executive for the couple of months that remained.  I do not think we would have had any response.</P>

How can the Minister substantiate his statement that any statement in regard to the lead and zinc discovery in Galmoy was a matter for the company and did not have anything to do with the Minister for Energy?  The Minister must remember that he is responsible for all mining and exploration here.  Has he information as to what exists at Galmoy?  Is he prepared to make a statement about that?</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for statements made by the company.  Until such time as an application is made to my Department I have no intention of making any statement about the activities of the company.  The departmental practice has been that all information furnished by a prospecting licence holder during the currency of the licence is treated as confidential.  It is a matter for the company to publish to the degree they consider appropriate.  No negotiations have taken place on a mining lease for the simple reason that Conroy have not yet applied to the Department <Col N="1456" /> for a lease.  It is expected that an application will be submitted later this year following a planning appliction to the local authority.  The company are fully conversant with my requirements in regard to the needs for environmental impact assessments which are new and will be required before any decision is made in regard to such leases.  Planning permission will have to be obtained first and an application for a lease can then be made.  It has not been made as yet.</P>

It is not intended that this will in all cases, require two environmental impact studies to be carried out but I am merely stating the Minister's independence in the matter.  It is the clear policy as laid down in the Programme for Government that no mining licences will be issued until the Minister for Energy is satisfied that an independent environmental assessment study has been carried out.  There is now a double precaution in regard to environmental aspects of proposals, firstly the planning process has been strengthened greatly by the recent decisions and, secondly, there is the <Col N="1458" /> decision in regard to the issuing of mining licences.</P>

      <P>This bank vole is a small mouse like animal which is believed to have entered Ireland in recent decades. It was first found in 1964 in Kerry and Limerick.  It is known to have been in Cork in 1965 and survey work carried out in 1969-70 established its presence in counties Limerick, Cork, Kerry, Clare and Tipperary.  It is thought to be spreading at a rate of about three miles a year.</P>
      <P>The bank vole prefers a habitat of dense cover such as long grasses, brambles, hedgerows, scrub or woodland.  Its normal food is berries, fruit, herbs and animal material.  In certain circumstances, which are not yet fully understood, it can strip the bark from the base of young trees about three or four years old.  So far damage has been confined to spruce trees.  Apart from isolated cases during 1976 and 1987, the first significant damage was noticed in late 1988 and 1989.  Affected trees turn yellow and die.  The attacks are limited in extent and are generally concentrated in one area in County Limerick.  Research is being intensified into the factors which may be related to the recent upsurge in activity and into the development of effective control measures.  A number of possibilities, including the encouragement of natural predators, are being considered.</P>

      <P>The Government have made considerable progress in making adequate preparation for a radiological emergency.  Funding for extra personnel and equipment was provided to the Nuclear Energy Board immediately following the Chernobyl accident.  A new laboratory for the Nuclear Energy Board was completed in 1988 and its equipment is being upgraded continuously.  These resources would allow for extensive <Col N="1464" /> monitoring in the event of any accident resulting in contamination of the Irish environment.</P>
      <P>In addition the Government in 1988 approved an emergency plan for radiological emergencies and allocated £890,000 for its implementation.  The plan, which is being phased in, is designed to provide a rapid and co-ordinated response to any radiological emergency.</P>
      <P>Progress to date is as follows: an alerting system has been established, including the establishment of an emergency control centre at the Nuclear Energy Board headquarters which will make recommendations and provide information to the Government and the public; a national continuous gamma dose rate monitoring system has been installed to detect and monitor any increase in radiation levels; a computer system which will speedily process all monitoring information has been commissioned at the Nuclear Energy Board headquarters the Civil Defence Organisation has been equipped for and is being trained in the use of portable monitors to undertake local and regional surveys; a whole body monitor has been installed at St. Vincent's Hospital; and systems for monitoring air, grass, soil, livestock, etc., are being installed.  Progress to date is very satisfactory and we are far better prepared for an emergency than we were at the time of the Chernobyl accident.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if the plan has been tested on a dry run and, if so, whether it performed satisfactorily? May I also ask whether the plan will need legislative backing so far as powers may be required to seize transport mechanisms, etc., in the event of an emergency?  Finally, will the public be given proper information about this plan? A plan of this nature can never successfully work if the public do not know what it entails when it is triggered in the event of an emergency.  Keeping people in the dark will just lead to panic.</P>

      <P>I know that the Civil Defence organisation have undertaken <Col N="1465" /> national trial runs in this area.  The equipment referred to is tested regularly. I agree with the Deputy and I will be glad to consider this &mdash; that we might need to give greater publicity to the plan. It is hoped to have all aspects of the plan fully in place by 1991.  That is the present funding proposal.</P>
      <P>I want to give the Deputy some idea of the main items of expenditure proposed during 1990 and 1991; a calibration system, a TLD skin dose monitor, further portable instruments, communication systems and portable personnel monitoring instruments have been acquired.  I will be glad to consider whether it would be appropriate for us to give more publicity to the existence of the plan and I will certainly act upon it if I am so advised or come to the same conclusions as the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The number of exploration wells drilled in the Irish offshore in each of the years from 1980 to date is as follows: 1980, 3; 1981, 7; 1982, 4; 1983, 6; 1984, 5; 1985, 6; 1986, 6; 1987, 3; 1988, 3 and 1989, 4.</P>
      <P>I expect six exploration wells to be drilled in 1990 involving at least 15 companies. The drilling of any appraisal wells will depend on the results of these exploration wells.  One appraisal well was drilled in 1989.  As with all exploration drilling, this year's wells are being drilled in the belief that commercial finds of oil or gas could result.  I have no plans to change the terms applying to oil and gas exploration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Irish National Petroleum Corporation operations encompass the purchase and refining of crude oil, the supply of 35 per cent of Irish market requirements of petrol and gasoil to the distribution companies and associated trading of intermediate and final petroleum products. There are, at present, no plans for an expanded role for the corporation in the areas of exploration or retailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether the role of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation is under review in the context of this working group who, I understand, are considering among <Col N="1467" /> other things, selling off all of the purchasing, refining and supplying of their 35 per cent role to other interests?  Are the working group considering a future role for the Irish National Petroleum Corporation if this occurs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a successful outcome to the proposal to enter into a new arrangement for the ownership or management of Whitegate, the future role of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation will have to be considered from that point on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister said he is considering selling the refining and supplying aspects of the market either in part or <i>in toto</i>?  If this is done <i>in toto</i> it would seem that the carpet is being pulled out from under the feet of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of some kind of sale or joint venture arrangement being entered into, it might be necessary to review the role of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  In the event of an outright sale it seems obvious that it would be necessary to review their role from there on in but in the event of a joint venture it may not.  We should wait and see the outcome of the invitations issued to tender.  There is an open invitation to any interested company to come forward with proposals to the Government. That invitation still stands and we are still distributing information on Whitegate to companies who contact us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 31, does the Minister not accept that it is important for the Irish National Petroleum Corporation or Whitegate to have a role in the retail area in view of the very serious threat to supplies when the multinationals, who control most of our retail at this time, have in recent years threatened to cut off supplies at the retail end?  In order to maintain our economy internally, it is essential for the Irish National Petroleum Company or <Col N="1468" /> Whitegate to have a role in the retail area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it is essential, but I certainly agree that it is an option which must at all times be kept in mind.  It is one possibility in the event of future arrangements.  I see no reason it could not be involved in the distribution trade as the terms under which it was established would allow for that.  My objective is a satisfactory future for Whitegate refinery.  Other decisions would have to be contingent on the decisions made about the future of Whitegate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point the Minister makes about commercial arrangements in regard to Whitegate.  My point is that a crisis point was reached here some two years ago when the multinationals effectively declared war on this State by refusing to distribute products through their retail outlets.  The Minister at the time assured the House that he would look seriously at the question of Whitegate having a role in the retail area. Is the Minister taking that into account in considering the options?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the succeeding Ministers ever took that step.  The possibility is still there and it could be a very worth-while proposal in the event of certain new arrangements being made.  I am not discounting it but it would be foolish to make any decision in regard to that matter before we know what the future of Whitegate will be.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated additional costs to the ESB arising from the absence of an electricity interconnector with Northern Ireland; if the Government have conducted any feasibility study on the possible reinstallation of the interconnector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a North-South electricity interconnector were in place, it is <Col N="1469" /> estimated that the annual cost savings to the ESB would be between £1 million and £1.5 million.  Similar savings would be achieved by the Northern utility.</P>
      <P>The question of its reinstallation is not one of technical or economic feasibility, but is rather a security matter because of the various disruptions caused by subversives and the danger to the safety and health of workers at each attempt to re-establish it.</P>
      <P>The early re-establishment of the connection would, no doubt, be valuable in the context of cross-Border economic and development co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that we are the only State in the EC that does not have an interconnector with a member state and that we are effectively isolated in this regard? Would he not also agree that it is necessary to establish the right of this State and the State in Northern Ireland to have this facility between them and that every effort should be made to ensure that the reconnection is maintained?  The argument about safety could be applied to every road and rail link and a range of services between North and South.  This has been effectively ignored for many years and the Government should make a decision in principle at least to have this connector re-established at an early date. Finally, could the Minister say what the cost might be of establishing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would cost £1 million to reconnect.  The Government have made the decision in principle to re-establish the connection.  The Northern authorities have expressed serious concern about the security and safety of their operatives in the event of it being reconnected.  It is absolutely disgraceful and totally unacceptable that these men's lives should be put in danger through carrying out this very valuable work for the communities who live on both sides of the Border. There would be a saving on the island of about £3 million annually.  It is disgraceful, therefore, that any group would seek to take unto themselves the right to <Col N="1470" /> deny that type of economic benefit to the people living on the island.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's firm intention, in co-operation with the authorities in the Six Counties, to have the electricity interconnector reconnected as soon as both parties agree that it is safe and practical to do so.  It is disgraceful that we have to admit that it is not safe to do so at present.  I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to bring this up at meetings held under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy De Rossa and I am sure they are reflected in the views of every Member of this House.  It is a disgrace that this is allowed to continue but the Government cannot operate this on their own; they require the agreement of both parties that the time is right.  It would cost £1 million to put it together.  If it is to be blown up and people's lives put in danger the following week, that is a serious matter we have to consider before we make the decision to go ahead.  I am very anxious to see it connected.  I agree with the Deputy that we are probably the only member of the Community which does not have an electricity interconnection or some form of energy interconnection.  It is the norm on the Continent; England is connected to the continental electricity system.  As President of the Energy Council, I can tell the House that the principal item on the agenda is to establish a régime whereby each member country will have the right to transit electricity to another member's system and to transit gas to another member's pipeline and in that way build an internal energy market by 1992.  These are the items being discussed under the Energy Council umbrella.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Presidency is seeking to advance this proposal during our term as President to get it adopted or moved closer to a point where the next Presidency could have it adopted.  We fully support this policy and are working actively to achieve progress on it.  Interconnection of electricity and gas are priorities.  We also want to make arrangements for the gas <Col N="1471" /> interconnector.  It is a shame that we are denied the economic benefit of doing this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would cost £1 million to restore the interconnector.  What is the cost to the electricity board?  There was an estimate in 1981 of £4.5 million annually.  That would probably be around £8 million now.  If there is that much cost to the ESB, which would be cost to the consumers, then £1 million to reconnect it and even another £1 million annually to protect it would be well worth while. Could we have an idea what the actual costs are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only figure I can recall is that it would cost about £1 million to reconnect it.  If the Deputy wants specific information in regard to any other costs I will be glad to supply them, but I do not have them here.</P>

Is he aware that this little wave power station is particularly useful for island communities; that it is estimated that in relation to island communities energy could be provided at an initial cost of between 6p and 7p per kilowatt and that if it is developed beyond that this prototype would provide a test bed for components enabling the development of larger installations which would feed directly into the national grid?  In that respect I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this experiment and to have consultations with the group in Belfast I mentioned.</P>

It is my intention to seek more detailed information about the project from the Department of Energy in the United Kingdom, which is a regular contact point for my Department.  I appreciate the work being done at Queen's University in regard to this matter.  The project still requires a lot of research before the conclusions are known.  Should the claim made turn out to be valid, then I see no reason why the installation should not be introduced on some of our inhabited offshore islands or elsewhere on the coastline on a commercial basis.  The matter cannot be considered until the conclusions of the project are known.  I will take a personal interest in the matter and I thank the Deputy for bringing it to my notice.

      <P>In Ireland, hydrogen is commercially available only in small quantities and then is mainly used in science laboratories and in a certain limited number of industries.</P>
      <P>At present, hydrogen as a motor fuel is too expensive to produce as it can cost up to four times as much as petrol.</P>
      <P>Hydrogen is very difficult to handle and to contain safely and is considered to be very explosive.  The practical problems of its storage and handling rule out its use in automobiles for the foreseeable future.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P>In page 2, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  An association shall have the right of free access to the media by means of spokespersons nominated by the association.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I was making some brief comments in response to the case made by the Minister and Deputies on the Government side as to why we could not or should not provide for writing into this important enabling legislation a recital of our commitment to the concept of freedom of access to the media.  I was borrowing on the experience of recent practice where it would appear there is a lack of clarity and the right is certainly subject to some degree of control.  I instanced the case of one member who was subject to discipline on one occasion because he spoke to the media but on the next occasion he could do the same with the benediction of all concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said it is a feature of our free society that there should be freedom of access to the media.  The society in which we have expected soldiers to live and operate has been anything but free.  Their right to speak publicly on matters that would not directly concern order and discipline within the Defence Forces has been severely curtailed, interfered with and set at nought for all practical purposes. Except for recent events, I do not recall a member of the Defence Forces of any rank giving an interview on any matter relating to conditions of work, remuneration or anything else.  The spouses association was established to get around the problem since soldiers could not speak on their own behalf.</P>

      <P>This is what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  We have some indication about how new or different it will be.  The discussion document referred to curtailing that right of access through GHQ or regional command headquarters.  Even though the Minister talks about a new situation, he still talks about this in areas where matters have to be specified.  There will have to be specification about what can or cannot be talked about.</P>
      <P>The essence of Deputy Nealon's amendment is contained in the words &ldquo;free access&rdquo;.  We must recognise that if we give soldiers the right to organise or associate on issues, there can be no equivocation about their right to talk to the media in respect of those issues.  That is the importance of freedom.</P>
      <P>I wanted to make those points in response.  I am glad the Minister has indicated that the specifying of areas, if ever it is to be done, will be done in consultation and will not be coming by way of diktat from the Department or the officers in command saying, &ldquo;you cannot speak about this, that or the other.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Finally, it is important to underline the principles of freedom of access to the media.  In the commanding officers' document to the Gleeson Commission they put forward the concept that some issues can be talked about through the representative associations while other issues should be reserved to GHQ and to the officer commanding.  This is important. All Deputy Nealon is asking for is a declaration, a statement to be encapsulated into this enabling legislation honouring, expressing and supporting the right of freedom of access to the media.  That is crucial.  We are living in a new era and legislating for an entirely new situation. It is important that we do so in an enlightened fashion reflecting the modern thinking of society.  No one in this House should have any reservation or concern about laying down a principle as broad, profound and important as that contained in amendment No. 11 here.  I hope it can be accepted.</P>

      <P>Considering the number of other amendments we have to discuss in a limited period it is important that we bring this to a conclusion.  Putting a few things together in the context of the two amendments and taking on board that the Minister is saying that what we are demanding is already there or will be provided for in regulation, the Opposition, given the situation and the views and attitudes expressed here in the House, want that expression incorporated into the Bill.  I see few difficulties with it but if the Minister has certain difficulties with either amendment No. 11 or amendment No. 23, as Deputy Nealon suggested earlier, he could incorporate into the Bill something on the lines expressed in his own document on access to the media.  In that case I would be very happy and would be prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan) Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met the wishes of Deputies in regard to other matters such as the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I was drafting an amendment to that effect during lunch time and it will be incorporated tomorrow on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question under discussion I do not see eye to eye with the Deputies.  This matter is much more particular, much more capable of inclusion in regulation or regulations.  There is a fundamental matter here which we have already referred to in discussing the whole command and discipline area of the Defence Forces.  Deputy Bell spoke very well on this aspect this morning and the PDFORRA people, who have talked with Deputies Hillery and Kitt, in their <Col N="1539" /> own constitution which they submitted and to which I referred this morning, are very conscious of the importance of the demarcation between on the one hand pay, remuneration, conditions of service and welfare, and on the other hand the whole command and discipline aspect with regard to the Defence Forces.  It is very important that that demarcation be written into the regulations, and there will be no difficulty with the representatives of the Defence Forces in that respect.  I am absolutely confident that they will have no difficulty in agreeing to regulations in regard to media presentation that will exclude their speaking on matters of command and discipline. There is no question about that.  They will sit down around the table and agree upon detail so that they and the representatives of the official side in drawing up the regulations can clearly specify the various areas on which a spokesperson or spokespersons can, following meetings they may hold, talk within the parameters of the mandate which the body will have. That is also flexible within these parameters which I would like to see left to the representatives of the military personnel themselves to draw up in conjunction with the official side.  It is a matter that concerns them.</P>
    <P>The right is not unlimited by reason of the fact that command and discipline will be excluded.  They will be as keen as I am and as everybody else in this House is to ensure that matters of command and discipline are excluded from any aspect of media contact or presentation in which they may wish to engage.  Therefore, their media presentation, will be confined to the areas of pay, conditions of service, and welfare, within the parameters of their mandate.  If they want to be specific or at large within that mandate it is up to themselves to make their point of view known.  They may wish to go into detail in the regulation on such matters as spokesperson, the situation in which they may make their media presentation or the meetings after which they will speak.  They may wish to have some meetings as committee meetings, others <Col N="1540" /> as &ldquo;at large&rdquo; meetings.  They may wish for any one of half a dozen methods of presentation and exchange of their views to the media within their parameters. I want to leave that to them.  That is their business.  It is they who will be operating the representative body, the elected representatives of the members of the forces.  They will have the responsibility.  It is up to them to decide what they wish to convey to the media in any circumstances or situation and I would go along, within those broad parameters I have mentioned, with any formula or any set of situations or circumstances they may wish to see incorporated in regulation to facilitate them in that respect.  That is my guarantee to them.  I do not see how it could or should be desirable that the whole area we have just been talking about be incorporated in the legislation.  It is a flexible matter within certain parameters and it is up to the men themselves to decide.  Having incorporated it in a regulation, if it does not work and they feel they are not getting the right message over the media, it could be that they were not adopting the right procedures.  In that case the regulation could be amended to deal with the issue in another way.  That is agreeable. Let them sit down and do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I do not think that should go into legislation.  The very fact of putting it into legislation carries the implication that in some way the right is not admitted.  Of course the right is admitted, subject to the parameters I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan is talking about yesterday's business.  Yesterday there were regulations there because there was no representative body in existence.  We are now talking about the situation that will arise when a representative body or bodies come into existence.  In that new situation of course they will have the right to <Col N="1541" /> convey, discuss and present to the media what their points of view are within the parameters I mentioned.  Whereas in regard to the conciliation and arbitration matter I was agreeable to a declaration in principle to go into the Bill, with regard to this matter it is trivialising it to include it in the Bill.  It is being restrictive. This is a fundamental right which is there anyway under the Constitution. The details and the specific issues should be left to them to work out in consultation with the authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

If that wording could be improved upon in some way and the words &ldquo;spokespersons shall be permitted to make statements to the news media on specified matters which fall within the scope of the representative group&rdquo; included in his own amendment I would be very happy.

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  An association shall be empowered to raise moneys by subscription of its members and shall have sole discretion as to the allocation of such and any other moneys within its control.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is another fundamental issue and is as important as the amendment dealing with the media and with the one dealing with conciliation and arbitration. Without finance, you do not have independence, it is as simple as that.  This matter is too important to be left to regulations. During the break I had an opportunity to see a submission from another command area and the kernel of their objections is that too much is being left to regulations even though they are in general agreement with them.  It is central to independence that financial resources are available, that the members shall have sole discretion as to the allocation of such money, and that they have authority to raise money.  The degree of independence is tied to the area of finance and the kind of money they have.  The standing of the association with its own membership will depend, to a great extent, on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will they be doing with the kind of finance which I have in mind in my amendment?  They may wish to employ specialised agents to undertake expert work for them or to do a series in connection with their media representation. There is a vast area in this regard which need not be specified.  I have a certain amount of doubt as to the total good will of the authorities.  I notice in the document of the PDFORRA that while it was accepted that the association would <Col N="1543" /> be entitled to raise subscriptions, the level of such subscriptions was to be the subject of discussion with a representative who would emerge after the election. The members of the association will be elected by the Defence Forces.  It is their own association and it will be a democratic one.  They will be representing their own people and they should certainly have the right to decide on the level of subscription.  If the people whom they represent do not agree to the level decided on they have the machinery, through various sections of the association, to make sure that it is changed.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the command area, the Department or the Minister should have a say in deciding the levels of subscription. Any curtailment of the association having sole discretion about the allocation of any moneys under their control would affect their independence. They might use the money to carry out surveys within their areas of competence and the authorities might not favour this because they might not like the findings which would emerge from such surveys.</P>
    <P>From the very start the submissions made by the officers &mdash; in so far as we have been able to see them &mdash; and PDFORRA were to the effect that if we could not give them the protection of independence deriving from the ability to raise their own money and to spend it at their sole discretion, something would be lacking in this organisation.  I know that the Minister has decided there can be subscriptions and the only curtailment I can see is regarding the level of such subscriptions.  I do not know what his attitude is to the association's sole discretion regarding the money within their control but I should like this amendment incorporated in the legislation, as distinct from regulations.  Amendment No. 23 in Deputy Ryan's name contains something similar and it too should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point that Deputy Nealon raised but the question of subscriptions has already been agreed in principle.  The determination of the levels, among other aspects, is a matter <Col N="1544" /> for democratic decision.  Obviously the associations will not be able to operate without a source of income, which, typically, would come through subscriptions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nealon is drawing on the document <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups</i>.  I would like to stress &mdash; and the Minister has already stressed this &mdash; that this is a discussion document only.  There is the risk of ascribing a permanency, in quoting from that document that the document does not deserve.  Deputy Kitt and I underlined to the members of PDFORRA that this is a discussion document only and that every single clause in it will be up for discussion after the elections when the parties get down to thrashing out the detail for regulation purposes.  It is important to stress once more that there is no question of pre-empting the situation or restricting matters and that everything will be up for discussion.  There is a lot in that document that will be acceptable and there is a lot that has to be talked about when the opportunity arises.  However there is no point in ascribing an authority, a weight and a permanency to this document that it just does not deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very definite reservations about this amendment and I will explain why.  I can fully appreciate the reason for it but two important points come to mind.  First, I would assume that in a situation like this, with an organisation under the one paymaster, now paid by computer, the same system should apply as applies in the public service generally, namely, the deduction scheme or check-off system as it is know within the trade union movement.  In order to achieve that one would have to get written permission from each individual member.  I would expect that the Truck Acts would probably apply equally to members of the Defence Forces and therefore moneys could only be deducted from their pay by way of contribution if they gave written permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, they could very well decide not to make a contribution at all, for example, they might want the operation <Col N="1545" /> to be funded by the Department of Defence.  I would assume, on balance, that they would want initially to give a small contribution and to have a level of independence in financial matters.  As regards travel, for example, I assume all travel to meetings and so on would not be provided by Army transport.  God knows the transport situation is bad enough without getting involved in that type of activity.  I assume that travel to meetings would have to be funded in the normal way that delegates or people attending meetings outside their own area would have to be paid by any association or trade union.  It would be better to leave this matter flexible so that the members could decide it they are going to make a contribution, the level of that contribution and how it would be collected. I would not envisage, nor would I like to see, the old system of the shop steward or representative going around the barracks on pay day collecting money and marking the person's membership card.  That would not be desirable and would lead to all sorts of complications within the system.  We have talked about constitutional rights.  I assume members will also have a constitutional right not to become a member of the association and that constitutional right has to be safeguarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The last contribution by Deputy Bell was a very interesting one, obviously based on experience, and we should take note of his views.  I too am of the view that these matters have been agreed in principle and will be discussed with the elected representatives. However, there is no need to include them in the legislation.  We should not interfere with this process unless it would be beneficial to the members of the Defence Forces.  As Deputy Bell has said, the raising of funds, the level of subscriptions and the use of those funds are matters for the democratic decision of the members of the association.  If we follow that line we will all be clear as to where we stand and the members will get the best possible deal for themselves.  It goes back to the old argument whether <Col N="1546" /> you legislate or regulate.  The process of regulation is the essence of democracy and in this instance would be in the interests of the Defence Forces.  What Deputy Bell said has copperfastened my views that we should leave this matter to the process of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This, more than the last series of amendments, is a matter for the representatives of the Defence Forces.  It is an important matter, a key matter, that is related very much to what they want. Also written into this is the fact that it applies to all members of the Defence Forces.  There is no compulsion that all members be associated with the representative body or bodies.  The funding particularly will be an aspect for consideration by the new representative body or bodies that emerge from these elections.  Associated with that will be the level of funding, and this is important. As I said in my covering letter, groups will be given certain facilities by the State in the matter of accommodation and staffing.  Subscriptions to meet other expenses will be permitted, the level of subscriptions to be the subject of discussion with the representatives who emerge from the election process.  The reason for that is that one must be flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not presume at this stage to set out herein what areas the new representatives would require facilities from the State.  We are willing to be co-operative in this respect, specifically in the area of accommodation and staffing, and will give the facilities we feel are appropriate. There is no question about that.  The new body and their representatives may feel they want a degree of independence.  I am sure that is one of the reasons they want a right to raise money by way of subscription to meet certain expenses that they consider are important as far as their organisation is concerned, over and above the expenses incurred by reason of the facilities and staffing which will be made available by the State.  I agree with that.  However, some balance between what the State is providing and that which will be raised by way of subscription <Col N="1547" /> will be required, and that is what I mean by a level.  Various matters have to be negotiated after discussions and consultation; these are ongoing matters. There may be a more suitable method of funding.</P>
    <P>This type of case may be made from time to time as events develop and as the months and years go on.  It is particularly a matter not for legislation and for regulation if one applies common sense to how this will operate in the new situation. I am giving the fullest guarantee to the incoming body or bodies that they will be entitled to raise funds.  I would not confine them to subscriptions because there are other ways of funding.  Whatever way they wish to go about raising finance, I am certain we will go along with it and this Administration will help by way of accommodation, staffing and so on.  We will work out some balance where we will provide facilities and they can preserve their independence by this ancillary method of funding.  The official side and the members can work out by way of discussion, negotiation and agreement exactly how we will apportion responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>I have made the matter very clear and it will not help in any way to deal with this in the legislation.  If the Deputies think about it, it is a matter particularly suited to discussion, consultation and negotiation and for inclusion in the regulations, which can be adapted as time goes on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  In amendment No. 12, Deputy Nealon talks about the association having sole discretion as to the allocation of moneys, and the question arises as to the association's discretion to employ civilians or to establish a permanent office, such as an office similar to the office of the Garda Representative Body.  Does the Minister see any difficulty in deploying the mix of funds coming from the Department and from the members?  Does he see any difficulty in the resources being applied to either or both those situations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite feasible that the association may require outside expertise to facilitate them in negotiations pending the training, which Deputy Hillery referred to earlier, of their own personnel.  To take on outside experts to advise them on how to proceed with their association is a perfectly legitimate expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, that is also a third element and it helps in understanding the extent to which the Minister agrees with the principle of Deputy Nealon's amendment. However, there are two specific issues which the representative association have raised that are not covered in the discussion document.  It is important to have clearly on the record the extent of the association's discretion in applying funds whether they get them from their own members or from a joint contribution. First would they be entitled to set up similar structures to the Garda Representative Body such as a full time secretary and staff and second will they have the right to publish an internal bulletin such as <i>Garda News</i>?</P>

      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Bell has said, there is nothing in my amendment about the manner in which money might be raised or the manner in which it might be collected.  I am simply asking for the right to raise money to be written into the Bill.  The manner in which it is raised or how it is collected is an entirely different matter.  This should have been in the Bill but obviously the Minister is not prepared to give on this issue.  Therefore, in the interests of moving on a little further and due to the outrageous guillotine on this Bill when we will find that we will not get past the first section despite the economy of words, I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)  An Association shall have the right to employ civilian agents or agencies as it deems appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has just said that the Association will have those rights.

      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 13 and 18, I repeat what I said on the last series of amendments that there is absolutely no curtailment on the right of the association to take on civilian <Col N="1550" /> agents, in fact it may be desirable to do so if they are going to initiate themselves in the intricacies of conciliation and arbitration, an area where they do not have any experience, and they may have to take on people.  That is appropriate.  On the question of establishing offices and maintaining a permanent staff, exterior to the military chain of command, that is a fundamental right and at all stages we have been strongly in favour of that.  That is the way it will be.  Obviously an association of this kind will have to be properly staffed and have a permanent office and we will facilitate them.  I see the State facilitating them in making office arrangements.</P>

It is implicit that they will have these rights and I do not see the need to have them written in to the legislation.  Of course, we will have regulations to define matters more specifically as the representative association wish but as a matter of general principle by the very fact that the groups are being established, they will have offices and a permanent staff exterior to the military chain of command.</P>

We could be including something that would disturb this.  This is very important.  In general the public service have this facility and trade union representatives are paid while carrying out their union duties during normal working hours.  The majority of trade unionists are treated in the same way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to re-emphasise that this is a discussion document.  I have <Col N="1552" /> changed my mind in this respect.  When considering this earlier I thought it would be fair to approach it on the basis of having three bodies, one for privates, one for NCOs and one for officers but, having given the matter some thought over the past few months and, got views on it, I believe that the private and non-commissioned officers should be in one group, not two groups, and that the officers should be in a separate group. When I said that I had a preference for three groups I emphasised that it was just a preference and I also said that, in the light of experience, there could be a change in that view.  I am now convinced that there should be two groups as suggested in the amendment and I believe that is the view of the majority of the PDFORRA people that Deputies have spoken to.  That having been said, it is a matter they should take up with the presiding officer, Mr. Timothy Sexton of the Department of the Environment, with whom they are having discussions at the moment and will be having further discussions over the next few days.  This matter will impinge on the format of the elections and, obviously, it is of great interest from the structural point of view and in regard to what they will be voting for.  To that extent it is part of the election procedure process.  When asking people to vote they should know beforehand whether they are voting for two or three groups.  That is being teased out at the moment and is a matter for discussion and consultation.  That is why I do not want to write it into the Bill.  I agree with what Deputy McCartan had to say on this matter.  All of us in our various contacts are getting a consensus view that there should be two bodies.  I want the men to work this out for themselves.  It was a mistake in the first place to suggest three associations.  The consensus now appears to be working toward two associations, one incorporating NCOs and men and one for the officers.  If that clarifies itself over the next few days I would envisage the election procedures being agreed and this aspect being agreed as part of the election procedures.  Therefore, the <Col N="1553" /> men when voting will understand exactly what they are voting for.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 35 to 37, to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to delete subsection (3).  The proposition that an association cannot, without the consent of the Minister, be associated with, or affiliated to, any trade union or any other body is obnoxious.  We recognise the right of representative associations to be formed and to have all the responsibilities that are reflected in the constitution of PDFORRA and in the discussions and deliberations that have taken place with the negotiators.  We recognise the sense of duty, discipline and honour that the Defence Forces uphold in the execution of their duties but having said all that, we are now saying to them that, while we will let them form their own association, they cannot do anything or go anywhere unless the Minister gives his approval. That is not the way we should be legislating in a so-called enabling framework. It should be a matter for the responsible members of the Defence Forces under the umbrella of their representative body to discuss, negotiate and decide who would be best suited to advance their objectives or who they should be involved with.  It is not acceptable that we should leave that subject to the vagaries of any Minister who might be in office in the future.  Who knows what will develop, how it will develop or what issues will <Col N="1554" /> need to be addressed?  As I have said many times it is not so long ago that we have had Ministers who held a contrary view to that of the present Minister.  At any time in the future we could have a Minister who may say one step and no further.  For that reason I do not believe that this should be left in the absolute remit of the Minister of the day.  He or she will have the right to countermand any proposal.  The fact that nothing can be done without the consent of the Minister is, if I may use Deputy Hillery's useful phrase in academic works on good industrial relationships, non-flexible. That does not allow for flexibility for the idea of people working together.  It is an element of big stick legislation of the Minister being able to say, yes, no or not at all.  For that reason I ask the Minister to withdraw that subsection.  I have no difficulty in supporting either one or the other of the proposals put down by Deputy Nealon or Deputy Ryan as a way of dealing with the matter.  Subsection (3) should be deleted and the issue left for consultations with the Minister and the good sense of the soldiers in representative discussions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment eminently meets the criterion of flexibility.  The Minister has the right to decide or to give his consent.  It is obvious that he will give his consent. For instance, the Garda Representative Association are affiliated to another body.  I have no doubt that if an application is made by any of the associations to join another group the Minister will give his consent.  I can think of many excellent bodies they could be associated with without their activities being inhibited.  This is the flexible or diplomatic way out of this.  If there is any dispute over the giving <Col N="1555" /> of or refusal to give consent it should be left to the excellent system of conciliation and arbitration which will be built into the regulations.  That is the way out of this problem and I have no doubt that it will be approved by this side of the House.  I hope the Minister will be willing to go along with that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to acknowledge the progress that has been made in recent months and to bear in mind that members of the Defence Forces have constitutional rights that must be protected. PDFORRA in their constitution state that they do not wish to be given permission to take industrial action.  They acknowledge that they are in a different position to other workers.  They accept their responsibilities to the State and Dáil Éireann.  However, it is up to us to protect their rights.  My amendment, No. 20, states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting an association from being affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, or to international bodies whose principal purpose is to represent associations of similar character.</P>
      <P>At the moment the members of the Defence Forces do not have any wish to be affiliated to congress but at some stage in the future they may be anxious to have associated membership.  They have a right as citizens of the State to be affiliated to congress, like other citizens.  We should not discriminate against them in the Bill in any respect.</P>
      <P>There has been a reference to the similarity between the provisions in the Bill and the legislation that governed the formation of the Garda Representative Association.  However, that body is affiliated to an international police federation. We are aware that PDFORRA are affiliated to an international organisation and consultations with them have proved of great help to the new body. We should not include a provision in the Bill prohibiting the new associations from affiliating to international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1556" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>We should tread very carefully in regard to this issue for a number of reasons.  I do not disagree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Ryan but the problem is that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will only accept into membership a body which is an accredited trade union and is registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The new organisations will not be so registered.  In my view we need to have some discussion about this with congress. I suggest that we try to find an acceptable formula to deal with that issue between now and Report Stage.  I have not had time to consult with my colleague about this matter but I have no doubt he will accept my views.</P>
      <P>Section 3 does not preclude the new associations from affiliating with international groups, but it requires that the consent of the Minister be obtained. PDFORRA have many connections outside the country but they are not official. I do not think it would be in the best interests of the Defence Forces to move in that direction without the consent of the Minister who is after all the person responsible to the House of the Oireachtas and the country for what happens in the Defence Forces.  I do not think we should have an organisation representing the Defence Forces going all over the place.  It should be remembered that we are talking about the Defence Forces of the State and not about an ordinary trade union.  For example, if we do not include this provision what is to stop any of the associations affiliating to a South African organisation or affiliating to an organisation whose policies will be contrary to our neutral stance?  We have stayed away from NATO and we have jealously guarded our neutrality but now it appears that we are encouraging the Army to link up with international organisations who came under the NATO umbrella.  We should have another look at this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that members of the Defence Forces should not affiliate to international organisations but such affiliation should be subject to the consent of the Minister.  From a purely military point of view, and in the interests of the Defence Forces and the country, affiliation to any organisation should be subject to consultation and agreement with the Minister of the day.  I am sure that can be agreed with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputy Nealon <Col N="1558" /> of what occurred when there was compulsory arbitration in regard to a claim by teachers.  A sum in the region of £80 million was agreed at arbitration but the Government of the day decided after a long hassle that only £30 million would be paid to the teachers and £50 million remains outstanding.  Conciliation and arbitration for the Defence Forces should be agreed by the representatives following discussions.  In other words, if agreement is not reached at local level or at conciliation it should be a matter for the members to opt for arbitration.  If they opt for that course they will be aware that the decision will be binding.  I do not think it should be written in because it would pre-empt the outcome and everything would be pushed into arbitration on that basis.  Some flexibility should be left there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view that there should be an independent association similar to that of the Garda Síochána. The draft PDFORRA constitution submitted by individual members provides that: &ldquo;the association shall be a non political organisation and shall not be aligned to any other organisation whatsoever&rdquo;. That is another interesting point to which I would like to refer.  Deputy Bell is right in saying that the important thing is to have an independent association up and running and to have it set up properly.  Quite frankly this is not a major issue with PDFORRA and it did not emerge in the 11 hour discussions which Deputy Hillery and I had with them.  They want their own association set up and they want to get that right. The point referred to by Deputy Bell on the whole question of affiliation with international bodies is an inportant one. I referred to it on Second Stage and it has been referred to also by Deputy Ryan and his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House may be aware, there is an unofficial link with Euromil and PDFORRA but, basically, that exists in the absence of an association. PDFORRA are very conscious of the need to have their own association in line with legal requirements.  I see the danger <Col N="1559" /> of a linkage with international bodies. There is a direct link between the Army of a nation or an Army association and with the country and with the whole policies of that country with regard to military neutrality.  We have a particular stance on our neutrality.  I strongly support it.  It is an issue of crucial importance and the vast majority of members here would agree with me but there are some who do not and I accept that, but I see the direct link in this debate with that issue.  It is a major issue and I am convinced that it is an important issue within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>If these people get their own association up and running it is in their interest and in the interests of the country in general to have an independent association. Deputy Bell is correct in saying that if there is a need for affiliation the consent of the Minister should be provided for in that event.  It has all to do with the special position of the Defence Forces.  I subscribe to the view that they have a special role.  Because of that special role we require an independent association free from any interference with other organisations.  It has to be a very clear-cut independent organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious to put this matter properly into perspective.  I agree with Deputy Kitt that this is very much a side issue.  The main purpose of this whole endeavour is to get our own independent Defence Forces organisation up and running by agreement, consultation and so on.  Affiliation with other bodies is a matter that will be very much down the road.  There is an important point of principle involved.  That is the reason the specific provision is there requiring the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation, and the regulations that are envisaged, will all relate to the Defence Forces body or bodies.  That is the whole purpose of this exercise.  Now we are talking about affiliation with other bodies that are not being regulated by regulation or are not subject to statute as this body will be.  We will set up our own <Col N="1560" /> national body under the legislation of the Oireachtas and the regulations agreed with this new body or bodies will be incorporated in legislation of the Oireachtas.  We are talking about that national position.  This is very important when you consider that we are talking about a body or bodies who will encompass members of our Defence Forces.  One is into a totally different ball game if we talk about organisations outside the legislation.  Surely that is particularly a matter which should lie with the discretion of the Minister. He must take into account that any involvement with other bodies will not and should not in any way compromise the position of the Defence Forces either within or without the State.  That is a particular responsibility which I, or whoever is in my job, has to fulfil.  That is the essential requirement of his oath of office.  His prime responsibility is to the State in regard to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Surely it is a matter of primary concern who the major national body associates or affiliates with, inside or outside the country because that is a matter that could have a security implication.  I am not going to say that that will be the position in every case.  There will be numerous cases where there will be requests for affiliation with a body such as the Irish Conference of Professional Services Association, which would require the consent of the Minister but, of course, that would be one I would clearly consent to or any other association of that kind that would encompass members of the representative group or groups, for example, engineers; there may be involved members of an outside engineering association, as well as members of the Defence Forces organisation. Clearly there is a whole range of constructive or innocuous affiliations which a Minister for Defence would allow but there could be &mdash; and this is where the responsibility comes in &mdash; undesirable affiliations that would cut across policy matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell was perfectly correct in relation to policy matters.  I knew what he was talking about but Deputy <Col N="1561" /> McCartan did not.  Deputy Bell was talking about our military neutrality which is the policy of this State at present and on which all parties agree.  There might be some question of a wrong association with another such body, association or union of an army or state that had a strong aggressive military policy in certain directions.  I am taking that as an example of what Deputy Bell was talking about.  There is a major policy aspect involved.</P>
    <P>In my view 90 per cent of the affiliates with which Defence Force members would wish to associate would be acceptable but I must keep, on behalf of this State as Minister for Defence, a section of this kind there to ensure that I, as Minister, acting in the broad responsible manner, about which I have spoken, would be obliged to examine on its merits each such application for association or affiliation.  Where I see a conflict between such affiliation or association, either inside or outside the country, and the security of the State, either internally or externally, then obviously I will have to make a decision.  That is my primary function.  The function provided for in this Bill is a very important one.  I am glad to be in a position to facilitate this very progressive measure through the Dáil and the Seanad and to ensure its implementation.  It is still secondary to my primary duty, as Minister for Defence in an Irish Government, which is to the national interest and the security of this State.  I must have that subsection in the Bill to fulfil that duty.</P>

There is no question that could arise about tainting our neutrality or our policy position on that matter when we are talking about one trade representative association <Col N="1562" /> within the Defence Forces being associated in any way with a trade or representative association on a European basis.  No one has ever suggested anything of the like.  It is regrettable to hear it from a Labour Deputy who is trying to do down his own colleague who is here trying to advance nothing more than the work conditions, pay and remuneration of the Defence Forces.

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it necessary to have a definition on the chief appeals officer, given that later in this legislation we are creating a new appeals office with new independent functions which we hope will be seen to be a new development with independent management structure? I am concerned that the proposals as they stand would be seen as simply an internal reorganisation.  The expectation of all organisations was that there would be an attempt to set up a separate executive structure.  Surely the appeals officer's position could do with an expanded definition over and above any powers <Col N="1567" /> given to him in existing legislation.  I ask the Minister to give us his view on whether such a definition is needed.  My view is that it is desirable in the context of the very much expanded role being given in Part V.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The new appeals officer has a special office attaching to him and we hope he will have some autonomy in hearing appeals.  We want to be absolutely certain that the definition is sufficient but we accept the Minister's view. We look at this section as a new departure because of the special role of the chief appeals officer.  I felt that the consolidation Act did not contain a definition of &ldquo;chief appeals officer&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with definitions which are necessary in the context of the Bill.  I assure the House that the definitions are adequate and proper and that &ldquo;appeals officer&rdquo; is properly defined in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  That definition has been tested in the courts and it has been found to be an independent office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, &ldquo;appeals officer&rdquo; means a person holding office as an appeals officer under section 297. There is not a separate definition of &ldquo;chief appeals officer&rdquo;.  The Minister might look at the powers given in section 297 and consider whether an updating is required to deal with the powers given in this Bill. It would give more weight to the introduction of an important new section if <Col N="1568" /> there were a new difinition.  This is a much sought after development in the social welfare code and we hope it will be radically different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 297 (2) provides that one of the appeal officers shall be designated by the Minister to be the chief appeals officer and another of them shall be designated by the Minister to act as a deputy for the chief appeals officer when that officer is not available.  It is quite clear that &ldquo;chief appeals officer&rdquo; is already covered in the basic Act.  We are simply giving new functions here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that they have been ruled out of order and I accept the reasons.  We were trying to bring forward the benefit dates but that would entail a charge on the Exchequer.  There is a view that the year should be half or three quarters over before people in the social welfare category benefit from increases.  All Governments have been guilty of postponing payments and I am repeating efforts made by my colleagues to bring forward these dates.  The Minister when in Opposition also tried to do it.  Some time some Government may agree to give increases to social welfare categories on <Col N="1569" /> a date which is regarded as more reasonable, nearer the beginning than the middle or end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point and the importance of making these payments as early as possible.  The Deputy will be aware that when I took office in 1987 the date had already been put back to October or early November and we managed to bring it forward to July.  The difficulty at present is that to bring the payments forward to April would cost the State an additional £46 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chairman might provide me with a list of all the amendments which have been ruled out of order.  I am aware that amendments Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, have been ruled out of order and I should like to give some of the reasons for their tabling.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system must provide proper support for those who cannot avail of job opportunities.  A huge number of people cannot be successful in the job market and must be provided by the social welfare system with sufficient to live on.  The system must provide people with a living income and must be seen to be fair, efficient and non-judgmental.  We need a system which guarantees every individual a minimum income which is sufficient to live on, regardless of sex, marital status, domestic or work situation. That is why we requested that the figure of £60 per week be inserted in the Bill.  There is general agreement in 1990 that nobody should be expected to survive on anything less than £60 per week. The supplementary welfare allowance stands at £45.  That shocks people into realising what it is like to live on social welfare.  In effect, the State is saying that £45 is what an adult social welfare dependant can survive on.  It is just impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are heading into the Single European Market in 1992 and there is a need to be seen not just as good Europeans but as being good to our own citizens through our welfare code.  We should be working towards a national minimum wage.  Here we are trying to <Col N="1570" /> address the question of dependency. Notice the ratio.  The minimum payment in respect of each adult dependant should be not less than 70 per cent of the amount paid to the claimant.  The question of dependency is something The Workers' Party would like to see eliminated.  We want to eliminate the concept of an adult dependant, specifically adults being dependent on other adults.  The first step is eliminating the concept of an adult dependant in the social welfare system and establishing the right to an independent income for every adult.  We want the payments for adults who are not in the labour force to be fixed at 70 per cent of the relevant social welfare rate.  It is unfortunate that that has been ruled out. However, so be it.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is an attempt to bring forward the date and we have a number of amendments &mdash; which I presume are all out of order &mdash; providing for various start up dates; I made these points in my speech on this Bill.  We have attempted to bring forward the payment dates by three months.  People on welfare are desperate for funding.  Every penny is crucial and they hear about the Estimates, budget debates, figures bandied about, rates, percentage increases and so on, and here we are going through the Bill and still they have had no increase in their pockets.  Some of them will have to wait until as late as October.  We have attempted in amendments Nos. 2 to 8, inclusive, to bring forward the starting date for many of these schemes from July to April.  April starts the tax year and in the minds of many people it is the month you get your welfare increases.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 refers to dependent children under 15 years, 15 to 17 years and 18 years and over.  Let me refer to a recent bulletin of the Combat Poverty Agency which highlights the point that the funding for children is totally inadequate. According to the findings of Dr. Lee and Dr. Gibney, two well known medical practitioners, the current social welfare allowances for children are inadequate to meet the basic calorific requirements of teenage children.  A 12 year old <Col N="1571" /> child consuming an average 2,500 calories a day needs a minimum of £11.90 per week for food alone.  Families with several children in the age bracket 11 to 18 years would be seriously disadvantaged and only by considerable sacrifice on the part of the parents are their nutritional needs met.  This often means severe hardship particularly for the mother who usually goes without.</P>
    <P>The Lee and Gibney report gives details about 50 families interviewed about their diets over a one week period. They found that four out of ten families had less than £100 a week to live on and of that £100, 84 per cent spent £60 or less on food and half the families relied either on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or on moneylenders for financial help. Depending on the age of children, we should slot in the rates to suit the demands of children.  The more junior or infant the child dependant the less he or she will consume and the less he or she needs by way of clothing and so on.  As the children grow older, and particularly into teenage, the demands on their social welfare recipient parents are horrendous. Those of us who have children know that even with a relatively decent salary, such as we have here as TDs, children's demands for funding for all sorts of things, personal, clothing, books, cinema and leisure activities, are tremendous. You can multiply that pressure on parents in receipt of social welfare a thousandfold because their children have similar demands and the inability of the parents to meet these demands is all the more complicated.</P>
    <P>A number of nutritional problems were evident, according to this report, especially for the mothers.  These problems reflect a lower intake of fresh food, vegetables and cereals and specific social difficulties encountered by single parents. The report proposes an age increment for older children in social welfare allowances. When responding to this section the Minister might give us his opinion whether we should be targeting various tiered age groups for extra funding.  I will leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very concerned about sections 3 and 4.  They contain this Government's major financial input into the lives and the quality of life of people in receipt of benefit and assistance which are central to the Bill.  If one looks at the gross increases in the total spending the Government had at budget time, in view of the extra contribution from PRSI and savings made within the Department the increase in the amount allocated to the Department of Social Welfare showed that they did not take the problem of poverty seriously and that the share given to the Department was inadequate to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Byrne, mentioned families with children.  Nothing in either the benefit or assistance sections particularly addresses the problems of families with older children.  I pointed out on Second Stage that the child over 11 or 12 years is nearly an adult with an adult's needs, which have to be paid for.  Therefore, my amendments refer to the various Schedules to the Bill.  Let me seek at this point a little orderly direction.  Given that these sections refer to the Schedules, do we debate them separately later, or can we refer to them now?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendments are confined largely to two or three areas, in particular, problems relating to older children.  The Minister said the most important thing about poverty studies was that they should indicate where the real problems are.  In the last eight to ten years study after study has indicated that as unemployment for a longer period has become a fact of life, children of the unemployed are particularly at risk of poverty.  This group were not targeted in the budget, and that is regrettable.  In that context the amendments we in Fine Gael have tabled relate in particular to increasing the dependent element by an additional £5 for children over 12 years and these amendments relate to the Principal Act referred to in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> The second area of particular concern &mdash; which I have raised before with the Minister &mdash; is the fact that, extraordinarily, persons in receipt of disability and unemployment benefit are at the bottom of the social welfare pile if they are entirely dependent on these benefits. I know that some of them have pay related benefit and &mdash; in the case of disability benefit &mdash; there may be an additinal income, but I know, from my own direct knowledge, that this is the case in relation to a large number of recipients. The Minister's figures indicate that 22,000 people have been in receipt of disability benefit for between three and eight years, and certainly half of them would be depending on that benefit alone.  They are particularly discriminated against and two of my amendments attempted to deal with that matter; they relate to the creation of a disability assistance scheme for persons who were long term in receipt of disability benefit and who could, if they satisfied a means test, move on to disability assistance which would be comparable with long term unemployment assistance.  It is a principle of simplification and a response to need.</P>
    <P>As I said, these people are at the bottom of the pile because, by virtue of the fact that they are defined as being on short term benefits, they are refused all supplementary payments other than the possibility of getting a medical card if they have an illness, and I suppose it is reasonable to assume that people on disability benefit would have.  I am seriously concerned about this group because they fall through the net.  I know it is complex dealing with them because they are part of a category of recipients of benefit who have many and varied characteristics.  However, they exist in substantial numbers and I do not know how they survive.  Many of these people come to me in significant numbers before Christmas and the only place to which I could direct them for assistance was the voluntary agencies.  Their plight is not acknowledged and my amendments propose that we should establish a new payment for people in that category.  If they <Col N="1574" /> pass a means test and have been in receipt of benefit for the same peiod as we award long-term social assistance and unemployment assistance, they should be included in that category.</P>
    <P>I accept that there have been substantial increases in social welfare but, in the context of the figures set by the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; and when inflation is taken into account &mdash; the figures fall far short of those projections. We must ensure that our social spending is targeted at the proper groups and it is the failure to do that which creates anomalies in the system.  In that context I give great credit to the Minister for his achievement in the social welfare allowance area which is the best in this Bill because it brings together the various rates of allowances which will allow him to establish the lone parent's allowance. It took two to three years' preparation to bring this about and &mdash; as I said in my Second Stage speech &mdash; it is in accordance with the best principles and achievements in bringing together the different allowances. However, it has created huge anomalies, there is now a lone parent's allowance but there is no lone parent's benefit.</P>
    <P>To address the needs of older children would be targeting resources at the group which have been identified by the ESRI, the CMRS, the National Campaign for Welfare Reform and the Combat Poverty Agency.  Over the last year these organisations have identified families with children as being at high risk of poverty.  The reason the improvement in relation to numbers of children does not respond to this is that it obviously is not selective because a small family with an older child has the same &mdash; or additional &mdash; expenses as the large family who ultimately benefit if they have enough children, although not on the basis of the need being tailored to the age or demands of the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to some of the points made before they accumulate.  Deputy Byrne raised questions about the adequacy of payments generally and I will return to that in a moment.  He also raised the question <Col N="1575" /> of the supplementary welfare allowance. He has the knack &mdash; like most of his colleagues in the party &mdash; of picking out one area which seems to lag behind others, concentrating on it and suggesting to everybody that this is the one that matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it in context. These increases are being paid to 1.26 million people.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is a fallback for people for whom there are no other schemes, is paid to 11,000 people. We are talking on the one hand about very substantial increases, of very much higher basic rates across the board for a total &mdash; between recipients and dependants &mdash; of 1.26 million people.  However, Deputy Byrne picked out the scheme relating to 11,000 people plus 3,600 dependants.  That is the scheme people fall back on for a short time when their other payments are not in order.  By introducing the lone parent scheme people will not have to depend on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  We want to have recognised schemes which will include everybody.  However, it is not possible to include everybody all the time and, consequently, some people will fall between two stools.  If they do, the supplementary welfare allowance will help. I should like to put that in context because I would not like other Members listening to the debate &mdash; or the public &mdash; to focus on that scheme as if nothing was happening anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also raised the question of adult dependants generally, what their position should be and how they should relate to the household.  He also queried whether they should have an independent income in their own right and how it would be controlled and applied.  The Deputy will be aware that we have set up a special household group to survey and study this matter.  It is being carried out <Col N="1576" /> by distinguished people and their study is quite complex.</P>

      <P>It will be published reasonably shortly.  They had hoped to have it through for December last but this was not possible.  I can well understand that and I am sure when we see the result of it we will more fully understand the technicalities and difficulties.  That is being addressed and it is not a simple matter.  The adult dependant allowance has been increased more than the normal percentages over the last couple of years. We are now looking at what should be the objective for the future under this household group.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne also mentioned that some of the increases in payments were put back to October.  The increases in payments we are talking about here will all be made in July.  It is true the increase in the child benefit will come into operation in October but that is dealt with in a different section and we will discuss it later.  I would not like the false impression to go out from the House that any of the increases in basic payments to individuals will be applicable from October.  That is not the case; they will be applicable from July and let us be quite clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned a study that was carried out and feels it relates to the general position that pertains today.  This is an old piece of research, undertaken in 1987 and at the beginning of 1988. Deputies must remember that there have been considerable increases since that date and they have an impact on the levels mentioned in the study, which was carried out by two distinguished workers, Dr. Pauline Lee and Dr. Michael Gibney.  They carried out a study of 53 houses in a particular estate in Dublin and of those, 50 households agreed to participate.  They looked at the position in relation to the general health and dietary habits of the people.  The result <Col N="1577" /> showed that certain dietary elements were missing due particularly to lower intakes of fresh fruit and vegetables and a lower overall intake of food.  People get iron, vitamin C and other trace elements from very small quantities of food.  Trace elements are very minute &mdash; I used to work on them &mdash; and if you take a little of the right food regularly you will get the trace element but if you do not take it you are in serious trouble and that is where the problem arises.  There is a problem with diet but nonetheless&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That report also stated that to meet the dietary needs of a 12 year old would cost £11.27 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My information states £11.90.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This report states £11.27 but there is not much difference anyway. It was pointed out that at that time the child dependant allowance was £8 to £9 and up to £9.50 in some cases.  As we know, the long-term unemployed were on the lower rates.  At this stage the basic level is £11 to £14.50 and again we are looking at a different situation.  We have been active in the meantime.  I am glad the Deputy brought up the whole point because it serves, as does the report, to indicate that we have made substantial progress in the meantime.  I appreciate there are problems in relation to diet and that money is a very important issue but anyone who looks at the report will realise we have been making considerable progress in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out to Deputy Byrne that there were 36 different rates of payment for children at that time.  We have <Col N="1578" /> reduced those to six rates and everyone in the House said that was the right thing to do.  The commission said we should reduce it by averaging downwards &mdash; do not forget that &mdash; but what we did was average upwards, a much more difficult and expensive task, and we have kept moving upwards.  When you get down to six or four rates you are then in a position where, with the resources you have, you can look at where you go next.  Certainly these other possibilities can be considered in that context.  We have been applying additional resources and targeting them to children in particular. That shows up in a whole lot of different areas, in relation to the total income of a household and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty said she is very concerned with these two sections and feels that we could have given greater increases considering all the savings we have made.  All the additional resources were redirected to this area and in addition the Exchequer had to come up with additional resources.  The extra money which came from the self-employed has also gone back into making these improvements.  All the savings that were made &mdash; and they were substantial &mdash; and the moneys which we garnered from other sources went to this area and in addition the Exchequer has provided extra money.  The total cost of all these improvements, on a full year basis, is £216 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty said she would like to see us targeting the older child.  I am very conscious that the costings for older children are obviously higher and that is something we can look at on future occasions.  Further improvements have been made by the Government in a total package.  These include the £300 tax allowance for the child-related tax exemption scheme.  Deputies have not seen this come into operation yet.  The improvements in this area are quite substantial: the £200 allowance for each child introduced last year for the first time, the slow working of that into the system and now the increase in the allowance to £300.  It is very well targeted towards <Col N="1579" /> those on lower incomes at work and is of great importance in that area.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know we are also extending the child dependant allowance to those up to 20, which again is directed at improving the position of older children. That is in line with the commitment we made last year to increase the age to 19, then to 20 and 21.  By next year it will have been increased to age 21.  In this package there is a number of things very specifically directed at the people about whom the Deputies are so concerned.  It was the Government's intention specifically to direct the resources towards those who are clearly in greatest need and also to take into consideration those who are at work and on low incomes because it is very easy for them to get into difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty has said there is a special problem with disability and unemployment benefit.  There is a difficulty because, as the Deputy said, disability benefit and unemployment benefit are short-term payments but our concentration has been on the long-term unemployed.  The research and studies indicate very clearly the position regarding the long-term unemployed.  As the Deputy fully realises, pay-related benefit applies in many of these cases.  One approach for the future could be to bring these payments up to an adequate level and have no pay-related benefit.  At present the pay-related aspect can add about £18 a week to unemployment or disability benefit unless, as the Deputy has said, you are long-term on disability benefit and you either do not qualify or do not want to go onto invalidity benefit which is the appropriate cover at that level.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out &mdash; and I would go back to what Deputy Byrne had to say at the outset &mdash; that from the time I became involved three years ago, the long-term unemployment assistance rate for a husband and wife with three children has gone up by £26.55 per week.  In fact people in employment would not have received a wage increase in the region of that amount unless they were on higher incomes.  This is almost a 30 <Col N="1580" /> per cent increase in unemployment assistance for a husband, wife and three children. That is the bottom line and it means that from July this year the payment to a husband and wife with three children will be £116 per week with an additional £11 for each additional child dependant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the short-term payments such as the supplementary welfare allowance. The payment for a husband and wife with three children is £109 per week, an increase of £27.35.  The Deputy will see that we have been increasing those payments by a somewhat greater percentage than the increase in the unemployment assistance. However, the problem is that they were very low when we started out and we have been closing the gap between them. All the payments have increased considerably, so that a husband and wife with three children will receive £116 on long-term unemployment assistance, while a husband and wife with three children on supplementary allowance or short-term unemployment assistance will receive £109.  A person in similar circumstances will receive £112.80 unemployment benefit and we must bear in mind they can receive another £18 on top of that in pay-related benefit.  A widow with three children on a contributory widow's pension will receive £101 whereas the non-contributory pension for a widow with three children is £93.50, and we are closing the gap.  On this occasion I took special care to increase the means tested widow's pension more than the contributory widow's pension because the contributory pension was already much higher.</P>
    <P>How do our level of payments compare to those in the United Kingdom?  The personal rate of unemployment benefit for a person in Ireland from July will be £48 and the long-term unemployment assistance rate will be £52, whereas in the United Kingdom the current rate of unemployment benefit is £37.  A couple with two children will receive £101.80 whereas a similar couple in the United Kingdom will receive £96.50.  Similarly the personal rate of widow's pension is <Col N="1581" /> £46 whereas it is £43.30 in the United Kingdom; a widow with two children receives £86 whereas a widow with two children in the United Kingdom receives £79.  In Ireland a couple on disability benefit with two children receive £108 per week, whereas they receive £96.50 in the United Kingdom.  Our payments compare very favourably with those in the North of Ireland.  In most cases they are higher, which is a considerable change. This has been brought about over the past three years by the consistent and substantial improvements that have been made.  Our social welfare rates are higher than in the UK.  In the past people have felt that the rates in Northern Ireland were a source of division and that we received smaller social welfare payments but that is not the case any more.  Our social welfare payments are higher than those in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I contend that we have made very substantial progress in this area.  Deputy Byrne also referred to some of the studies that have been carried out.  It has been said that one-third of the population are living in poverty but I refute this.  I do not agree with it, it is a misleading statement. I know there are people in poverty and we have to deal with them and make sure that we improve their position. There are many people who are not in poverty but they need to have their position improved.  The Commission on Social Welfare indicated that the elderly were all right and were not at risk.  The ESRI study also indicated that they were not at risk; notwithstanding that, it is important that we keep up the levels of payments and improve the non-contributory payments, as we have done this time.  There is no statistical evidence to prove the level of poverty claims.  Pressure groups who persist in using this figure are doing no service to themselves or to the disadvantaged members of our society whom they say they represent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty made a good point when she pointed to a group who appear to be falling behind and need attention. Our resources should be directed towards the people most in need.  The pressure <Col N="1582" /> groups look to the work of the ESRI to support their views on the level of poverty and in doing so they show a complete lack of understanding of the nature of the research conducted by that organisation. The approach adopted by the ESRI is not to measure the number of people falling below the poverty line, because as they rightly point out there is no objective method of setting such a line, rather they establish alternative income levels or, poverty lines and estimate the number of people or households who have incomes below those levels.  The real value of their work is the comparative value which shows what people are more at risk than others.  The value is not in absolute terms because the study is not designed to deal with absolute terms, nor could it.  They estimate, for example, that 10 per cent of households and 12.8 per cent of people fall below the 40 per cent poverty line.</P>
    <P>The ESRI make it clear that figures such as these do not represent their view of the extent of poverty in Ireland.  They do not include non-cash benefits in their figures so they know they do not paint a comprehensive picture.  The poverty line figures, useful as they are, do not tell the whole story with regard to standards of living.  Very substantial transfers are made to the less well off through the provision of free or subsidised State services in education, health and housing. These need to be included in an overall assessment of the standard of living of low income groups.  The critics of Government policy are wrong not only in their interpretation of research on poverty but in their refusal to acknowledge the substantial progress that has been made by the Government in improving the position of the less privileged in our society.  Since the data on which the ESRI based their analysis were collected in 1986 and early 1987, major improvements have been made in the level of support for social welfare recipients. Deputies know that this is the case.  I have already mentioned some of those improvements and I will not repeat them.</P>
    <P>Very substantial progress towards meeting the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare have been <Col N="1583" /> made in the basic rates of payments.  The Commission on Social Welfare set a priority rate of £45 and if we adjust that figure to account for inflation since that time it comes to £53.  From July next the personal rate of payment will be £61.50 in the case of old age contributory pensioners, £56 for widows contributory pensioners and £54 for invalidity pensioners. The long-term unemployment rate will now be brought up to £52, which is only £1 below the adjusted figure.  We have made a lot of progress and are making further progress in the two sections we are discussing.  It is important to keep what is in the sections in perspective.  We serve a substantial number of widows, old age pensioners and others and they received fairly substantial increases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that he is to some degree accepting the case we have made for older children, but I was disappointed at the tenor of his remarks.

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reference to pressure groups reflects an attitude to organisations who are acting in a purely disinterested fashion on behalf of groups who do not have anything to gain. That attitude, unfortunately, was <Col N="1584" /> expressed clearly in the House by the Taoiseach.  It sends ominous chills through me and compares with attitudes across the water.  Had there been anybody else in power across the water other than Mrs. Thatcher he would not have been able to make such pleasant comparisons.</P>
      <P>The Minister chose to use the 1987 figures and relate them to current figures when it suited him, but when he related current figures to 1987 figures he picked the lowest possible figure for 1987 and took the highest possible figure for 1989. That was not an honest presentation of the target set by the Commission on Social Welfare which at this stage would be between £65 and £75.  The Minister should not think that he is codding us with the figures he is juggling about.</P>
      <P>We will give the Minister credit for any progress that has been made but he should not use the figures in the way he has.  We may not have the figures at our finger tips but we are familiar enough with the inflation changes over a number of years.  We have entered into a broader debate on the extent of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Minister likes to refer to the 1987 figures in isolation, but in November last the ESRI produced a report, &ldquo;Poverty, Income and Welfare in Ireland&rdquo;, which showed that there are serious poverty problems.  Tomorrow I hope to press the Minister at Question Time to indicate the line he is adopting and to give us his definition of poverty.  That report indicated that there is a substantial level of poverty here and children were identified as being at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that he will give consideration to our views in regard to expenses for older children, but I urge him to do that as soon as possible.  In relation to the categories of unemployment benefit and disability benefit, will the Minister instruct, through his supplementary welfare section, that the needs of those on long-term disability who do not qualify for invalidity pension and are dependent on that alone, are met until he has sorted out the difficulty in regard to disability benefits, assistance and invalidity pensions?  Some <Col N="1585" /> people do not qualify because they are mistermed as short-term beneficiaries when they have been in receipt of a benefit for three years and up to eight years. They are the poorest of the poor in the social welfare net.  Those on supplementary benefit, while their weekly income may be a little lower, receive assistance with bills and all the supplementary payments that are going, but the group I have referred to are excluded. I do not know how they manage to survive but I imagine that they do so through assistance from the voluntary agencies. If the Minister is not willing to accept our amendments he should consider those who do not have any other income.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy feels that his good example was not followed he should not lower his standards. I was about to remind the House of the requirements on Committee Stage. We should not have a rehash of Second Stage and Members should bear in mind the time limitation.  On Committee Stage, as Deputy Ferris was about to advise the House, we are expected to confine ourselves to what is in the section and not to make Second Stage speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come through another House which teaches Members to be as good as possible when dealing with legislation.  One Member asked if a reference could be made to the Schedule and it was confirmed that that was in order and Deputy Byrne referred to payments to children which are covered in the following sections.  Unfortunately, the Minister gave us a Second Stage speech because he felt he had to cover all the points mentioned.  I realise that he wanted to answer all the questions raised but I will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister to consider rationalising the dates involved and he told me that bringing forward dates as I suggested would involve the Exchequer in an <Col N="1586" /> expenditure of £46 million.  He told us that the benefit extended to 1,400,000 people.  Is that the gross figure which the Department will expend or has the Minister taken into account the clawback through other Government agencies?  I am referring to the clawback by local authorities in rents, by the supplementary welfare office which deals with mortgage relief and the local authorities who give relief from various service charges.  The Minister may not know about that because he represents a Dublin constituency, but there are service charges in county council and urban areas throughout the country and there is a clawback based on social welfare income. A person in receipt of more than £100 per week in social welfare does not qualify for relief from water charges.  In other words, we are charging people with children for water.  If they did not have any children they would be in receipt of less than £100 and would qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister, in reply to my original comments on sections 3 and 4 regarding the dates of payment, has taken into account the net cost to the Department and to the Exchequer.  I think he agrees with us that they should be made as early as possible &mdash; he scored a political point by saying that they were worse when he arrived in office.  I accept that Governments have moved these feast days &mdash; as they would be termed for the poor &mdash; from April to July and to October and back again and there is general agreement that these payments should be made as close as possible to the year in which they are applicable, that is, 1990.  There will be clawbacks.</P>
    <P>He went on to deal with supplementary welfare payments.  This is a very important instrument which is available to the Department and to unfortunate people who are disadvantaged for many weeks. I will leave my thoughts on this matter to another section, but I am worried because this is the lowest form of income. It is the fall back, it is the fire brigade service when the cheque is held up in the post, when something goes wrong, when a certificate is late going to the Department and when there is no income for <Col N="1587" /> the family.  The Minister has admitted that over 11,000 people benefit from the scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record immediately that the last place anybody wants to go is to the supplementary welfare officer, first, because of the lack of privacy and, second, because they have the feeling that they are looking for something to which they are not entitled.  Although it is only an interim payment, it is recouped by the Department when payments sort themselves out.  It is the bottom of the rung for those who have nothing else to fall back on.  Because of cutbacks over the past few years we know that supplementary welfare payments have been discontinued to many categories who up to now had qualified, and particularly for those on means tested payments, supplementary welfare was usefully used to supplement them.  I am concerned at the rate of supplementary welfare, although the Minister has admitted he has increased it.  I welcome many of the things which the Minister has done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise that it is our duty on this side of the House to keep prompting, urging and hoping that with all our wisdom and our advice &mdash; we do see anomalies on the ground &mdash; there will be some improvements.  Deputy Flaherty mentioned some of the anomalies between contributory categories and non-contributory categories.  There are now anomalies where people on disability benefit receive less than people on long-term unemployment assistance.  The one advantage of the disability benefit is that it is not means tested but somehow it is related to contributions.  I would like to confine myself to the dates, to the total cost and whether the Minister has taken into account the net cost, taking into account the clawback system between rents, water charges, supplementary welfare and so on.  I shall deal with the children, the benefits and the lack of benefit in the next two sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go through my notes as quickly as possible.  I think it is a case of hear no evil, see no evil.  Having heard the Minister today he appears to be incapable of recognising the degree of poverty that exists, particularly in this city, with which I am familiar.  For some odd reason he seems to be embarrassed that I should have highlighted the incredible poverty of payments of £45 under the supplementary welfare scheme.  He chided me for daring to highlight this fact and went on to explain it away by saying that only 11,000 people with 3,600 dependants fall into this category.</P>
      <P>The figure of 1.26 million people in receipt of benefit is impressive, but I am not referring to them at present, I am referring to the 11,000 plus 3,600 dependants who are forced to rely on that miserable £45.  I do not know whether the Minister is trying to avoid answering that question when he gave the figure of 11,000, but when one looks at the figures for unemployment assistance, miraculously they fall into the same category of £45 per week.  How many people are in that category?  He went on to say how reasonably well off we are and compared us with England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the unemployment assistance for a married man with a wife and three children.  He gets £109.  The Minister tries to deny the level of poverty that exists.  If we take the figures produced by Dr. Gormley &mdash; whom the Minister quoted earlier &mdash; we see that according to the Lee and Gibney report it costs £11.90 per week to feed a child and if we round off that figure to £12 per child per week and if there are three children in the family, that amounts to £36 out of the £109 to feed the three children.  If two adults eat as much as three children that is another £36.  That amounts to £72 to feed the family.  How does the Minister imagine people on an <Col N="1589" /> income of £109 can afford to live?  For this man with three children £72 will be spent on food and if he lives in local authority housing, he will have to pay rent, bus fares, heating, electricity and fuel, not to mention clothes.  These are frightening figures.</P>
    <P>Dr. Gormley, when talking about a proper nutritional intake, said that the weight and size of the majority of children were only slightly less than the Irish norm, a small number were significantly underweight and undersize in two of the schools.  The Minister seems to be suggesting that these figures were old and out of date.  If 1987-88 is old and out of date when we have just come into the nineties, I think the Minister is stretching it.  Even if these figures are out of date his concluding remarks were that low income families need an adequate minimum income of £60 per week per adult and a subsequently improved child income allowance.  If £60 per week was the amount argued for by Dr. Gormley in 1988, then my figures are generous when I ask for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All these authorities were quoted very liberally on Second Stage and you are not allowed to do it again.  May I remind the House that it is not in order to make a Second Stage contribution when we are dealing with specific Commitee Stage requirements. The Deputy will have to apply himself to what is proposed here.  He has already been advised that anything that would require additional expenditure is not permissible.  He has to apply himself, as best he can, within those parameters.</P>

I did not want to give old age pensioners or anyone else a concern which could arise from what the Deputy had said.  In deference to the Chair, I will say very little more at this stage.  I have noted what Deputy Flaherty said and I will see what can be done.  Dr. Gormley actually said that a top priority was deemed to be a nutrition education programme for children and parents with emphasis on breaking the dominance of food such as chips, burgers and sausages.

      <P>To answer the Deputy's question, it is the gross figure we pay out. Obviously the question of any clawbacks would be outside this.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I tried to highlight the fact that part-time working should play a much bigger role than in the past in easing or solving our unemployment problems.  If this does not happen, tens of thousands of our people will be doomed to long-term unemployment with no hope of a job for the rest of what should be their working lives. That is why part-time working is so important, and this Bill is a welcome opportunity to address the problem.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my view that we need a department of employment.  Such a department has existed in the UK for the past five years with notable success. We have a Department of Labour but it is not a department of employment.  This Department has a role in industrial relations and education in the workplace but they do not consider replacement ratios, the interaction of social welfare with labour costs and industrial development; and there is no co-ordinating department.  The Department of Industry are there to entice industry here and protect the industry that is already here but they have no role in relation to training, industrial relations, labour costs, etc.  Nor do they participate in wage negotiations or in productivity negotiations.  The Department of Social Welfare make social welfare payments and make proposals for increases in social welfare which are completely unrelated to the labour market or to tax and social insurance proposals.  Thus many people at work, especially if they are married with three or four children, are worse off than if they were on unemployment assistance.  Therefore people on unemployment assistance who are married with children are trapped in unemployment, trapped in poverty.  While they do not want to be unemployed, many at work feel they are worse off than if they were unemployed.  All of this happens because of the lack of a coherent approach on the part of the Department and the lack of a department of employment.</P>
      <P>Another reason I welcome this Bill is that there is now widespread abuse by employers of the provisions and exemptions in relation to part-time workers.  For many it is an unavoidable arrangement which suits their industrial needs.  For others it is merely a way to shirk their commitments under the social legislation; it is a way to avoid coming within the ambit of the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act, the Holidays Act; it is a way to avoid having to pay full PRSI contributions. In amending this legislation we must be objective in analysing its effect on employment.  We know the motivation is excellent but the results of much of this legislation are quite different from those intended and it impedes the creation or maintenance of jobs.  Many employers are using it as a ruse to deny their employees the rights which are the norm in the European model of democracy, which model is distinct from the American one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other ruses which employers use to avoid their obligations under legislation. Increasing numbers of people are working under contract.  Many employers have made their drivers redundant, sold the lorries to them at concessionary rates and rehired them on contract, leaving the <Col N="1595" /> employer free of the obligation under social legislation to pay PRSI contributions for employer and employee, PAYE contributions, etc.  There is widespread abuse in this area.  Not everyone who resorts to this arrangement is abusing it, but this arrangement allows many employers to avoid extra costs and responsibilities of employing people directly.  If this Bill goes further than the Second Stage or if the Minister introduces his own measures, I hope we will not just deal with issues directly connected with part-time working but also with the employment of people under contract or as consultants.</P>
    <P>The time has come to more clearly define a consultant, a contractor and an employee.  We cannot allow loopholes to remain whereby employers can avoid having to pay tax on social insurance or to grant workers their legitimate rights. It would be a grave mistake if this House were to make provisions rendering it more difficult to employ people either as full-time or part-time workers.  The end result must be that we protect adequately the social needs of all employees, whether part-time or full-time, in a way that lessens the impediments to employment and reduces the cost of employment.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly one of the great inhibitors to employment and one of the reasons the good economic indicators of the past five years have not resulted in more jobs is cost.  Sometimes the cost is obvious and visible but in many other cases it is not.  We have had discussions on a number of occasions in the past year or two regarding the total cost of putting £1 in a worker's pocket.  The CSO and Eurostat in Brussels, the central statistics office of the European Community, accept that over and above the gross wage of an employee the average overhead of an Irish employer per employee is 35 per cent.  The average industrial wage last year was about £210.  If we add 35 per cent to that the figure we see that it costs an employer an extra £73.50 per employee, or £283.50 to give a gross pay of £210.  That £283.50 frequently ends up <Col N="1596" /> in a disposable income of about £120.  A married worker gets no allowance for children in the tax system.  I am not just taking account of tax, PRSI, trade union contributions, voluntary health contributions and pension contributions but also post pay packet costs like mortgage costs, increased differential rents or transport costs to and from work.  That is the central problem.  The major component of what has become known as the tax wedge between the £120 disposable income and the £283.50 gross cost is mostly tax and social insurance.  We can throw in things like public liability and employers insurance.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread view that nothing can be done about our unemployment problem.  I want to repudiate that dismal analysis.  Much can be done about it if we get our structural and other problems right.  They have got them right in the UK during the past five years.  In the last 46 months, notwithstanding the dramatic increase in inflation and interest rates, unemployment in Britain has gone down without a break.  That is because they have got their costs and structures right.  The same challenge faces this House and this Government.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will bring forward his own proposals speedily if he intends to reject The Workers' Party proposals. We cannot be very confident since he has been promising provisions for a long time.  He said last night they are coming soon but not in this session &mdash; after the Industrial Relations Bill.  This is certainly not the hallmark of an aggressive attack on the problems of workers whether full-time or part-time.</P>

      <P>The Bill before us is <Col N="1597" /> obviously concerned with the protection of part-time workers.  This is an issue which needs to be addressed.  The debate offers an opportunity to express the latest thinking of Members in this regard.  We might first look at the scale of the issue. In recent years in Ireland &mdash; and this has been the continental experience as well &mdash; there has been a significant increase in the number of part-time workers entering the labour force.  Of particular importance is the number of regular part-time workers which in this country has doubled between 1977 and 1978, rising in 1988 to a total of 72,000.  A further breakdown of this figure shows that more than two out of three of these regular part-time workers are female and almost all of them in the Irish case are married. This reflects the European experience where the great majority of part-time workers are female.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's Bill and his contribution last night highlighted a number of important points but my view is that the thrust of his Bill largely reflects one side of the coin only.  That is in no way to detract from the importance of the issue and the views he has put forward. The job of the Minister for Labour is obviously to strike a balance, to reach a compromise between on the one hand providing basic protection for part-time workers while at the same time not discouraging the important development of part-time work as such.  There are many people in the workforce who want only part-time work.  Many women find that this type of work gives them the flexibility they require to fulfil other roles, including those of housewife and mother.  Furthermore, part-time employment is literally keeping the bread in many people's mouths.  Part-time work is not in any way confined to the better off.  There are many people, including many women, who need both the flexibility afforded by part-time work and the money it brings to meet their basic needs.  Of course there are two sides to it.  The flexibility in work patterns that part-time work affords employers gives them the competitive edge they need in the marketplace. Deputy Mitchell has just referred at some <Col N="1598" /> length to the importance of costs and they are particularly important in the competitive sense.</P>
    <P>The eighties, a decade which has reflected much change in terms of part-time participation in the labour force, have been characterised in Ireland and in countries around the world by an intensification of international competition, of deregulation in several industries, of recession, of changing technology.  In Ireland we live by our exports and therefore the focus on costs, particularly on labour costs is getting much attention.  In terms of work and employment patterns, we still have a substantial amount of full-time conventional employment but increasingly we have the part-time model and contracting out.</P>
    <P>By achieving and maintaining a competitive edge companies are in a position to provide valuable employment for both part-time and full-time employees.  In a nutshell, the flexibility that part-time work brings is now often a requirement for both employers and employees.  All the indications are that part-time work is here to stay and that it will form part of the employment patterns of the future, all the more reason that we in the Oireachtas should be addressing the social implications at this time.</P>
    <P>While accepting that part-time work is here to stay, there is justifiable concern that the availability of part-time workers will lead to exploitation by employers. Deputy Rabbitte underlines the exploitation pattern, and that is indeed a legitimate concern for the Oireachtas.  There is the obvious risk that some employers are getting off the hook, that they are not meeting their social obligations and that there are loopholes in the law which allow that.  There is exploitation and, as far as possible, it needs to be regulated. However, over-regulation by the State could be detrimental to part-time workers who for one reason or another need that type of work as well as to employers who need flexibility in order to compete in the marketplace.  The Minister and the Government, therefore, are faced with the normal challenge in legislative affairs, that is, of striking a balance <Col N="1599" /> between the desirability of part-time work for both employer and employee while providing basic protection to prevent exploitation.</P>
    <P>At present under many employment Statutes the requirement that the individual must work at least 18 hours a week is the norm to qualify for statutory benefits. The legislative intention originally in the context of this 18 hours was to exclude persons whose unemployment was of an incidental or subsidiary kind.  What has emerged during the eighties in particular, however, in common with the experience in other countries is a substantial increase in part-time employment, especially in part-time jobs.  The nub of the matter, therefore, as we enter the nineties is that there are permanent part-time workers who are not entitled to the basic protections which are afforded to others under our labour law.</P>
    <P>For example, after many years' service with the same employer there are employees with no entitlement to holidays, no entitlement to maternity leave, no entitlement to a minimum notice, no entitlement to redundancy payments and these people do not have redress in respect of unfair dismissal legislation. That needs to be redressed and that is the task of the Government.  From what the Minister told us, he is tackling this vigorously and hopes to have legislation before the House within a year.</P>
    <P>Turning to Deputy Rabbitte's Bill, the main drawback is that it presents a one sided picture and it has not been preceded by the necessary consultation with both social partners, or representatives of them.  It does not, therefore, represent a balanced approach to the problem.  The Bill tries to be all things to all people.  It would, I feel, reduce the flexibility which many companies undoubtedly require in the labour market.  It could well have the effect of reducing the possibility for part-time employment with the substitution of machines for that work.  If the provisions in the Bill as proposed were introduced, we could end up in a worse position.</P>
    <P>The Bill could also have the effect of reducing the possibilities for part-time <Col N="1600" /> employment with the substitution of machines, as I have just said.  Given the surplus of labour in the country and the clear preference of some people, including many women, to work part-time, the last thing we want to do is to reduce part-time opportunities for them.  We have to be careful, therefore, that as legislators we enhance the possibilities for maximising employment growth by way of full-time employment in the first instance as well as by way of part-time work.  If we come down as heavily as the Bill before us suggests, we will be discouraging women, whom employers need and want.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the requirement from a legislative viewpoint of full consultation with both employers representatives and workers.  Consequently the Minister has been engaged in discussions with ICTU and the Federation of Irish Employers, with a view to working out acceptable and workable legislation for the protection of part-time workers.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in other countries and a pattern is beginning to emerge of two different classes of employees.  First, there is the core labour force characterised by highly skilled status jobs with good pay and a range of fringe benefits, and second, there is the risk of a peripheral labour force which is viewed as low in status, low in skill and with few or no fringe benefits.  As legislators we must be concerned that such an undesirable division in a dual labour market is checked.  The specific role of the Government and the Oireachtas is to provide protection for those who are not in traditional, full-time, well remunerated jobs.</P>
    <P>The Blackwell Report, entitled <i>Part-Time Work &mdash; The Facts</i> published last year, provides a valuable basis from which to inform policy making in this area.  I pay tribute to the author of that report because it is precisely the kind of hard nosed data and research that are required to produce informed policy making and it addresses a number of the key questions.  The Government are well aware of the importance of protection for part-time workers.  The status of part-time workers was identified as an issue <Col N="1601" /> to be addressed by the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> reflecting the interests of both sides.  The Minister for Labour initiated the review of the situation in September 1988 &mdash; he has a track record in this regard and he sought the views of the ICTU and the FIE.  Predictably, the ICTU and the FIE are not at one on what needs to be done.  There is a gap there.  I understand the ICTU would like to see <i>pro rata</i> entitlements for all part-time workers while the FIE do not want such radical legislative change.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the Minister's record, in May 1989 he initiated a seminar on part-time work.  The focus of the seminar was a debate on the differing concerns which exist in relation to the application of employment law of part-time workers. The Minister wants to bridge the gap and to build concensus, and in that regard he has an excellent track record.  He believes in concensus.  Reference was made to experience across the water; consensus is not characteristic of the approach to such matters there.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this seminar and meetings with the two peak organisations, the FIE and the ICTU, progress has been made on the road to agreement towards the goal of providing greater protection of persons employed on a regular part-time basis.  The Minister has been active and proposals are already in place, as he told us last night, which are now being finalised with a view to submitting them to Government and producing the necessary legislation.  I understand that the Minister's intention is to improve significantly the protection for most regular part-time employees who are at present denied those benefits of a wide range of labour laws because of the 18 hours per week limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite clearly wants to improve the lot of part-timers, especially those employed on a permanent basis. At the same time he has to be constantly conscious of not over-regulating the market to such an extent that it would reduce opportunities for people who want and need to work part-time.  Furthermore, we all have to face the fact that part-time work will be a feature of our <Col N="1602" /> society in the immediate years ahead. Therefore, in the interests of labour market flexibility and efficiency, the Minister has to ensure that the provision of more part-time work should be encouraged &mdash; with safeguards for the employees &mdash; and he should especially tackle the exploitation we know exists. The Minister in his Government role will be concerned to provide statutory support for good employment practices and to respond to the genuine concerns which have been expressed about the exploitation of marginal groups.  This legislation which the Minister has promised will also help to counter allegations that at present the unprotected status of part-time workers represents indirect discrimination against women since more than two-thirds of the people in the part-time work category are women.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts the Minister has made and I am as anxious as anybody else that this legislation reach the House as soon as possible.  I know the Minister is treating the legislation as a matter of top priority and I look forward to debating the Government Bill in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> There are a number of flaws in The Workers' Party Bill but the fact that it has been introduced opens up a debate on part-time workers.  It is an area about which I expressed concern on a number of occasions in the past.  Indeed, I expressed concern as recently as last week during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any debate about jobs is welcome because so many people are unemployed. Whether we are talking about full-time or part-time jobs, it is good for political parties and politicians to discuss the different ways and means of trying to tackle the problem.  It is unfortunate that the number of full-time jobs over the last ten years has been more or less on the decline.  Wexford has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and there is a need for part-time work.  In many cases the wife must work part-time to earn money to provide a decent <Col N="1603" /> standard of living for the family.  Part-time work, in some ways, suits the social welfare system in that if the wife is earning over £50 per week the husband cannot claim for her.  Therefore, it suits many women to earn under £50 per week but that is the only thing in its favour.</P>
    <P>Over the last ten years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of part-time workers entering the labour market. The number doubled from 39,000 in 1977 to something in the region of 72,000 in 1988.  There are also up to 16,000 people working occasionally or part-time; 4 per cent of the work force in 1977 were regular part-time workers and in 1988 the figure rose to 8 per cent which shows that there has been a dramatic increase in this area.  Seventy per cent of regular part-time workers are females and while such work suits women &mdash; particularly married women &mdash; any new legislation must take that into account.  Usually married women have a family to look after and part-time work allows them to earn extra money while, at the same time, rearing their families and looking after the house.</P>
    <P>In many cases flexibility of working hours usually suits the employee and the employer and this will continue to be the norm over the next couple of years.  The growth of part-time employment is one thing but how such workers are treated and protected is another and we all have concerns in regard to this area.  Politicians, trade unionists, the media and a variety of other groups and individuals have expressed growing concern about the increasing number of regular part-time employees who are not protected by some of the most important protective employment legislation and who are open to exploitation.</P>
    <P>These concerns have been reflected in collective bargaining efforts to negotiate normal protection and benefits for part-time employees.  A number of concerns have been expressed in the last few years in different areas about the abuse and exploitation of the regular part-time worker.  A number of protective employment Acts contain a requirement that an <Col N="1604" /> individual must work for at least 18 hours per week to be covered by the provisions. The Unfair Dismissals Act, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, the Workers' Participation Act, the Redundancy Payment Acts and the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act were designed to exclude persons whose employment was not regular or full-time.</P>
    <P>It is estimated from the 1988 labour force survey that the 18 hours' threshold has the effect of excluding approximately 20,000 employees, mostly women, 83 per cent according to the Minister's figures last night, from the benefits of the legislation which I outlined.</P>
    <P>The status of the part-time worker was identified as an issue to be addressed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> As a politician who has expressed concern here on a number of occasions, I welcome the fact that this area was identified and is to be part and parcel of that programme because, in relation to this or a future Government, it is important to have debate, discussions and conclusions in this whole area to improve the status of the part-time worker.</P>
    <P>The Minister of Labour initiated a review of the situation in September 1988 and, as part of the consultative process, he sought the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers.  Naturally, there is a difference of opinion between those two organisations as to what type of legislation should be introduced but I would be inclined to side with ICTU.  The fact that I was a former union member and a shop steward makes me realise that there are areas about which the employer would be concerned if radical changes were introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i>&mdash;&mdash;because of the way part-time workers are exploited in some areas at present.  The right to written terms of employment only apply to those who work for 18 hours <Col N="1605" /> or more per week.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act only applies if you work for 18 hours per week. Annual leave also gives cause for concern in that a person must work for 120 hours per month or 1,400 hours in a leave year to be entitled to paid holidays.  For those aged under 18 the minimum hours worked are lower &mdash; 110 hours per month or 1,300 hours in a leave year.</P>
      <P>The hours requirement for holidays makes it rather difficult for most part-time workers to have statutory entitlements to paid leave.  The Minister must look at this area because it needs to be changed.  A part-time or temporary worker must work at least 120 hours, or 110 hours if under 18, during the five weeks ending on a public holiday to have the same entitlement as a full-time worker.  Anyone who works fewer hours does not have an entitlement to a public holiday and it is an area which poses serious problems.</P>
      <P>The Unfair Dismissals Act applies only to employees who work at least 18 hours per week.  Many employers dismiss workers, they use and abuse this Act, especially in relation to people who do not work 18 hours per week and there is nothing the person can do about it.  The Minister must redress this in new legislation.</P>
      <P>The Redundancy Act also applies to employees who work 18 hours per week. If you work fewer than 18 hours you have no hope of getting redundancy.  Some people negotiate redundancy payments with their employers but more often than not it is a non-runner and they find themselves dumped on the scrap heap without any redundancy payments whatsoever. Maternity leave is another area that is abused by the employer.  While expectant mothers may have a right to 14 weeks maternity leave if they work 18 hours or more per week, that is not always adhered to and this is of grave concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals and suggestions outlined by the Minister last night are worth while and need to be teased out.  The Minister should ensure that there is a balance between the employer and the employee. The flaw that I see in The Workers' Party <Col N="1606" /> Bill is that it crosses a divide between the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare.  There are two different Ministers and two different Departments involved and that needs to be dealt with.  I understand the Minister for Social Welfare is considering the matter at the moment and there is a pensions group carrying out in-depth investigations into the social and financial implications of this system.  It is only right that the Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare should consider this whole area.</P>
    <P>There are good employers and bad employers.  Employers in supermarkets, petrol stations, hotels and pubs, cleaning contractors and security firms exploit the part-time workers and this is nothing short of a national disgrace.  Some of our major supermarkets and hotels are the worst offenders.  In my town some of the supermarkets have staff working for 17 hours per week, which means they have no absolute rights and no entitlements. They work on a day-to-day basis.  When they finish work in the evening they may be told they are not needed the next day but they are contacted next morning to say they are needed.  After a couple of hours they are told they are not needed for the rest of the day, in case they go over the 18 hours which would mean the employer would have to pay for their entitlements.</P>
    <P>This scandalous exploitation of our workforce should not be allowed to continue. It is important that the Minister introduce a Bill as quickly as possible following the ongoing discussions with the social partners.  Not alone are the people whom I have mentioned abusing the staff on the hours system but they are also abusing them by way of the mere pittance of wages they are paying them. In my county &mdash; I will speak only for my own county &mdash; people working in supermarkets, petrol stations and so on are being paid £1.27 an hour, slave labour in my opinion.  Recently a girl came to me seeking a county council loan and I asked her to bring along her P60 in order to fill the forms and apply for the loan. That girl was working as a hotel receptionist and her total earnings for a full <Col N="1607" /> year were £2,984, less than £60 a week. That is total exploitation of a young lady who has a leaving certificate standard of education and who had also completed a year's secretarial course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Is it any wonder that a large number of our CERT trainees are going abroad to seek work when hotels are exploiting the workers in this way?  We need to look at the area of part-time workers, their entitlements, disability benefit, unemployment benefit and maternity benefit.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the minimum wage certainly needs to be looked at because workers are being exploited and abused at present.  The Minister has expressed his concern in this House on a number of occasions and I know he will ensure that legislation is brought in as quickly as possible to protect part-time workers and also to put in place proper wage structures for part-time workers, while at the same time ensuring that there is a balance whereby employers will not be penalised for employing people.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to bring in that legislation as quickly as possible to protect the most abused section of the community, part-time workers who are, in the main, women.  We should not allow that practice to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this measure which is timely given Ireland's Presidency of the Council of Ministers and the commitment by the Governments of the European Community to implement a social charter to protect workers' rights as an integral part of the completion of the internal market in 1992.  The philosophy of the Bill is spelled out in section 4 (1) which states: &ldquo;A part-time worker shall be entitled to equal treatment with a full-time worker in respect of his terms of employment and working conditions&rdquo;. That spells out clearly that this is a nondiscriminatory Bill.  The purpose of the <Col N="1608" /> Bill is to rid the workplace of discrimination which now exists.</P>
      <P>Part of the frustration of sitting on this side of the House is that there is acceptance in the Minister's party that there is exploitation, and terms are being used in this House such as slave labour, with CERT trainees, who are funded to a large degree by the State, having to emigrate to earn a wage.  Nevertheless the only flaw that I have heard of in regard to this Bill is that it crosses a divide between the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Social Welfare, and I would have thought that this was a simple administrative problem that could be resolved by officials from both Departments sitting down and hammering out the differences.  There is acceptance on the part of Government Deputies that things are not right.  I do not see anything in this Bill that any Minister should find reason to reject but something &mdash; I think it is an element of one-upmanship &mdash; prompts the Government not to accept any legislation from the Opposition.  That is one of the shortcomings of this House.  There was another manifestation of this some time ago, and I was somewhat surprised, when Deputy Hillery jumped the gun, while I had sat here throughout the debate last night waiting to contribute.  This one-upmanship prevails all the time and I regret that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about the part-time worker, who precisely are we talking about?  The Blackwell report has been quoted by every speaker who has contributed so far.  Were it not for that report, this House would not have been able to quantify the extent of the problem with which we are faced.  Professor Blackwell quoted from the EC Commission and stated: &ldquo;The EC Commission proposed Directive on part-time work of 1983 defines it as work performed on a regular basis in respect of which an employer and an employee agree to shorter working hours than the normal hours of work&rdquo;.  Since then there has been little agreement between employers and those who have to avail of part-time work.  If the vast majority of these people <Col N="1609" /> had a choice or were offered full-time employment they would readily take it up, but unfortunately people are now being pushed into the situation by unscrupulous employers.  I will now quote from the figures given in the Minister's speech.  The number of regular part-time workers increased from 39,400 in 1977 to 72,000 in 1988, and an additional 15,200 were working on an occasional part-time basis in 1988.  At the real bottom of the scale are the 15,200 occasional part-time workers who do not have regular part-time work and this means when they report for work in the morning they may be told they are not needed.  I worked in the State sector all my life and in the fifties and sixties I used to see a temporary postman who had reported for duty being told to cease because he was surplus to need.  I regret to say that 40 years later this still prevails and we have not advanced a great deal in this regard, if anything there is greater exploitation than ever before in the history of this country.  For that reason I unreservedly support this Bill which is timely.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister, who is already burdened by the duties of his Presidency of the EC, cannot do a normal week's work and that we have been asked to shorten the session to enable Ministers to participate in our Presidency.  I am glad that we hold the Presidency and I wish the Minister every success in his role as President but how can we come up with legislation that is urgently needed if the Government are trying to serve two masters?  I do not think it is possible. Deputy Browne has said that part of the problem is that the matter transcends two Departments, without considering Europe where the Minister is fulfilling his dual role.  I do not think he is in a position to produce legislation in the short term before the summer recess.  Will we have legislation before summer to substitute for this Bill, which I find quite acceptable?</P>
    <P>The issue of the treatment of part-time workers is in many cases tied to the question of real equality for women.  We know from a survey carried out by John Blackwell of University College, Dublin, <Col N="1610" /> that the majority of part-time workers are women.  Discrimination against part-time workers has been inadvertently facilitated in a minority of cases by the social insurance code which means that the contribution rate of employers is higher for workers, working 18 hours per week or more compared with the employer's contribution rate for an employeee working 17 hours per week.  The standard contribution rate of 12.2 per cent compares with the 0.5 per cent in the latter case.  In the case of the employee's contribution rate there is a 5 per cent differential, the standard rate is 7.7 per cent compared with the 2.2 per cent rate for part-time workers.  In practical terms there is an economic incentive for employers to avoid employing any part-time workers for 18 hours or more a week.  The general thrust of this Bill is timely and we strongly support the general principle of applying <i>pro rata</i> conditions in every aspect of employment for employees without exception.</P>
    <P>The experience in this country as in the UK in relation to the hours threshold suggests that no matter what mechanism is put in place, employers in certain types of employment such as distribution, and supermarkets in particular, will, because of the fierce competition in their business, resort one way or another to get around the hours threshold no matter how it is formulated.  However, if the Government are prepared to lauch a new measure in relation to part-time working, they will have to take on board the reform of the social insurance contribution rates to remove the economic incentive for employers to circumvent the hours threshold whether defined on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis.  In countries such as Australia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden part-time employment covers about 20 per cent of the workforce but the latest data from the 1988 labour force survey reveals there is a much lower level of part-time working in Ireland, although this has doubled in the past decade.  If the predictions of the international management consultant, Charles Handy, are to come about, then the pattern for work in the United Kingdom in the year 2000 <Col N="1611" /> will see 50 per cent of the workforce in full-time jobs, 25 per cent in part-time jobs and a further 25 per cent in casual or temporary employment.  The flexible workforce is now standard jargon and unfortunately for workers involved this has translated in practice to a downward flexibility where pay and conditions are concerned in many cases.</P>
    <P>The Blackwell study found that 40 per cent of part-time workers had equivalent earnings of less than £3.50 per hour in 1988.  It is also known that in the majority of cases part-time workers do not receive the many benefits of their full-time colleagues, particularly in redundancy where they virtually have no rights and are in effect summarily dismissed.  It might be said that the case being put for comprehensive reform of labour law, social welfare and taxation in relation to part-time workers could be expected to be advanced by the trade union movement and by the parties on the Left.  However it is credible to put forward the proposition that if the workforce in the future are to be the so called flexible workforce then it is totally unrealistic to believe this flexibility will be accepted by workers if it involves a growing social apartheid in the terms and conditions of work of so-called peripheral workers.  I reject the concept of the necessity for a peripheral workforce. It smacks of a new form of division simply encrusting the old division between management and workers which we all recognise has to be transformed from the model based on antagonism to the partnership model.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of society and employers in the long run that part-time staff are valued for their contribution. I would like the legislation to promote conditions where part-time work is taken up as a matter of individual choice.  If we look at how job sharing operates in the public sector, for example, we can see precisely the kind of flexible work patterns that meet the requirements of employers and employees.  Those who opt for job sharing do so on a voluntary basis and cannot be required to take up an offer of job sharing unless they wish to do so.  Second, they have the right to <Col N="1612" /> return to full-time jobs and their service during job sharing accounts for entitlements such as pensions and other benefits. The free market lobby believes that the operation of market forces, if allowed full pay, will eliminate unemployment and ignore the discriminatory conditions which would effectively attach to those outside core employment.  It is very easy for any of us to eliminate unemployment at a stroke by reducing wage rates and lessening employment conditions, but, unfortunately, the bitter experience of the trade union and labour movement is that the solution to this problem of unemployment is not through wage cutting. I make this point because the argument put forward by the free marketeers against protective legislation for part-time workers is that ultimately this may lead to a reduction in employment.  This will not happen if the legislation is such that it applies equally in every country, and given that Ireland has the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, there is a unique opportunity for our Government to take the lead to implement a code of best practice legislation for part-time employees.</P>
    <P>While I alluded earlier to the economic incentive to employ part-time workers for less than 18 hours a week, it should be noted that approximately one-third of regular part-time employees work less than 18 hours a week and the real effect of this Bill, if taken on board by the Government, would be to remove discrimination against the occasional part-time employee where approximately three-quarters of the part-time workforce work under the correct hours threshold. Based on the 1987 labour force survey, this effectively means granting <i>pro rata</i> pay and conditions to 5,000 male and 21,000 female regular part-time workers who work less than 18 hours a week.  The people who would benefit most from <i>pro rata</i> treatment would be mainly in the catering and distribution trades.  In both cases of regular part-time workers and occasional part-time workers, we are talking mainly about women, in many cases married women, and the measure would provide equality of treatment for <Col N="1613" /> women as much as equality of treatment for part-time workers.</P>
    <P>The Bill puts forward a very wide definition of equality, and rightly so, which goes beyond the issue of equality in relation to statutory conditions governing holidays, redundancy, short-time, dismissal and other important conditions such as occupational benefits, particularly pension benefits.  So far as I am concerned the future structure of the workforce will involve many more people than at present working less than full-time hours.  We need to adopt an approach to deal with this development. First, we need to have a sustained European Community-wide Directive to gradually reduce working time in respect of the standard working week.  This needs to be done on a Community-wide basis so that the benefits of the integration will be distributed fairly.  Second, unless we are comfortable with a growth of inequality as an essential feature of the new Europe, which I suggest none of the member states who have backed the Social Charter have indicated they want, then we also need a levelling of the playing field, so to speak, in an area of conditions of employment.  The third leg of social legislation in this regard is, of course, a European-wide Directive on minimum wage legislation.  I would support Deputy Rabbitte in his call to the Members of the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>Experience to date here where the hours threshold has been reduced &mdash; and I refer here to the scheme negotiated by the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Department of Education &mdash; shows that even the Government as an employer are inclined to resist full application or the <i>pro rata</i> conditions, particularly with regard to pensions and are, in effect, powerless to prevent vocational education committees from abusing the lowered hours threshold.  In practice, therefore, only a minority have benefited from this scheme.  I am a member of a vocational education committee and I regret to say that there are some VECs who are not implementing this agreement in full.  This should act as a warning to <Col N="1614" /> the Minister, and the House, with regard to the likely action by employers in the market sectors of the economy if legislation contains a new threshold.  While I am aware that the trade union movement do not in many cases wish to facilitate part-time employment at the expense of full-time employment, they have come around in recent years to the view that legislation is absolutely essential on the basis of a full <i>pro rata</i> treatment for all workers regardless of the hours worked.</P>
    <P>The women's affairs official of SIPTU, May O'Brien, speaking to the 1988 National Consultative Conference on Women's Affairs organised by the ITGWU made it clear that only legislation which would apply to workers, irrespective of hours worked, would be adequate and that <i>pro rata</i> conditions should extend to pension rights, pay and conditions, and equality legislation, in addition to the standard labour legislation. Recent development in the banks where employers have sought the introduction of part-time casual empoyment further underline the need for a comprehensive approach, if the financially secure companies in the market sector of the economy introduce discrimination against part-time employees.  It is folly to expect employers in weaker positions to do anything but follow their lead.  It is regrettable that profitable banks are introducing this type of workforce.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, it appears that at least one of the major banking groups have taken a leaf from the example of the more progressive employers and are providing full <i>pro rata</i> pay conditions for this new part-time workforce who, I believe, work an average of 28 hours per week.  This would be more in keeping with the 1983 EC Directive.  Some of those who opted for the 28 hour week did so by agreement, unlike others who were forced into it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party fully endorse the provisions of the Bill and we urge the Minister to take not only the spirit of the Bill but its substance on board when he comes to formulate his own proposals.  I regret that he is not going to take the Bill on board given that Ireland is in the so-called second division of the European <Col N="1615" /> Community.  It is important to set a standard which reflects an aspiration of the convergence of living standards and conditions of employment as being the policy which the Community must pursue in the nineties.  Anything less would be a poor reflection on what our concept of equality is.  It is not a time for half measures in this area.  If we accept second class pay and conditions for a minority of workers, the so-called peripheral workforce, how can we expect the richer regions of the European Community to accept our proposals for affirmative action in the case of peripheral regions which the Government and Opposition parties here equally support.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already indicated his reluctance to take on board this Bill. However, I have no doubt that he will take into consideration some of the points raised when he is formulating his own policy.  The weaker sections of the workforce are being exploited and members of the Minister's party have already acknowledged that.  I regret to say, and as a trade unionist I do not derive any pleasure from this, that a number of these people are not members of trade unions through no fault of their own.  There is a reluctance in some trade unions to accept them as members.  I am not happy with this reluctance because, effectively, what we are doing is throwing part-time workers to the wolves.  I can understand that some firms to remain viable find it necessary to employ part-time workers but the banks, which are the greatest example of all, have callously introduced part-time work and that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of my party to fully support this Bill and I ask the Minister to take on board some of the points which I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the issue of part-time workers is one which demands attention.  The only issue on which we differ is how rapidly the attention is needed.  I accept that speed is of the essence and that attention is urgently required but it would not be wise, prudent or, indeed, in the interest <Col N="1616" /> of part-time workers if we surrendered thoroughness or thoughtfulness just to achieve speed.  We have all come across disgraceful cases of blatant and unforgivable exploitation of part-time workers.  For example, last Friday a woman with two children, who was recently separated, came to my house. Earlier that day she had presented herself to a new restaurant in my town.  This restaurant seemed to have money in abundance for everything except for the workers.  She was offered the princely sum of £1.20 per hour for a split-hour day, starting very early in the morning and ending very late at night.  The manageress was told by the lady, with all the dignity that she could muster, what she could do with the job and the exploitation.  The woman, though badly in need, retained her dignity and went elsewhere.  I hope she will find some employment.</P>
      <P>Another scandalous case concerned a major hotel in south county Dublin.  A man came to me recently and told me that he was working very odd hours, he worked 70 or 80 hours in the month and was paid on average £1 per hour.  There is no doubt that there is a need to give urgent attention to this area.  However, I do not think that the answer is simple. The problem is complex.  Individual case histories aside, one of the striking things that emerged during the course of the debate in the last two days, a reason the debate is good and welcome, has been the highlighting of the extraordinary growth in part-time workers in our economy. As has been said by the Minister and a number of other speakers, as recently as 1977 we had under 40,000 people who were categorised as part-time. The last survey for 1988 suggests that we have in excess of 72,000 people in part-time employment and up to 15,200 people working part-time on an occasional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such growth has, as the Minister suggests, been particularly fuelled by the number of women coming back to participate in the labour force.  If one looks at the breakdown of those figures in the survey one finds that 50,000 of the 72,000 <Col N="1617" /> part-time workers, and who work full-time on a part-time basis, are women and about 33,000 of those are married women.  That again illustrates not just the complexity but the tendency and the danger that people will be exploited because they are very vulnerable.</P>
    <P>While the statistics are dramatic it would be wrong of us to suggest that we in Ireland are in some way novel or ahead of the pack in this regard.  In fact, we are very far behind the experience in Europe.  If one looks at the Blackwell report which was cited by the last three speakers one will find that in the Netherlands 25 per cent of people in the labour force are working in part-time employment and that the female proportion of part-time employment is as high as 55.2 per cent.  They are extraordinary figures. In Sweden the figure is about 25 per cent, in Denmark it is 23 per cent, Norway 23 per cent and the UK 21 per cent.  The other EC member states, with the exception of Portugal, Italy and Greece, are all significantly higher than us in terms of the proportion of the workforce engaged in part-time work and, in particular, in terms of the proportion of the female labour force engaged in part-time work. That is not just to throw out a blizzard of statistics with no particular purpose because I believe that one of the things we can do is learn &mdash; we are lucky in the sense that we are coming to the legislative process &mdash; from the experiences in EC member states.</P>
    <P>The growth has been dramatic here but we are not unique.  The data produced by the Minister, and the data produced in the various studies that have been cited in the debate, illustrate the extent of part-time work and the particular vulnerability of women and the specific vulnerability of married women who come back into the workforce through economic necessity or otherwise.  We have to admit that the former is happening all too frequently and that there is an unwelcome increase in that.  Women return to the workforce also because they have reached a turning point in their lives.  Their family may be reared and they may wish to work again <Col N="1618" /> outside the home but not wish to work on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>Other data recently emerging illustrates where the concentration of part-time working is and where the problem needs to be addressed.  If we refer to this data we will be convinced that this is a very complex problem and not one which lends itself to one line or a two section resolution.  Part-time work, as we know is dominant in the service industry.  Four occupational groups account for the great bulk of part-time workers.  The service industry is high in part-time workers, particularly in catering and cleaning.  I understand that 25 per cent of those involved in catering and cleaning are there on a day-to-day basis throughout their working lives on a part-time basis. That is an extraordinary high statistic. Agriculture, surprisingly enough, is the next highest at 19 per cent.  The labour force in the commercial group of occupations, which includes shop assistants and those in the bar trade, accounts for about 16 per cent and the percentage is about the same in the professional and technical occupations.</P>
    <P>The data provides us with an indication of the complexity and the nature of the problems which need to be addressed. Clearly, it should be said that not all part-time workers are exploited.  Many part-time workers, particularly women making their way back into the workforce are facilitated by part-time work.  They find part-time work sufficiently remunerative and stimulating to be attractive.  We should not lose sight of that or suggest that every case of a part-time worker is a case of exploitation.  I do not think any Member suggests that and I should not be regarded as saying it.</P>
    <P>This, however, raises another aspect of the problem.  We must ask the question, why is there an increase in part-time work?  What are the imperatives that come forward on the take-up side &mdash; the employers' side &mdash; or on the supply side? What factors give rise to part-time work? If we do not understand the factors, and are not careful to understand them, we could do more damage than good if we seek a quick and simplistic solution.  It is <Col N="1619" /> accepted generally that there is a general shift in the composition of employment trends towards the services sector and the services sector is one where there will always be, and has always been, a large proportion of part-time work.  That is a historic fact and it is not one that will change whether we would like it to change or wish it to change.</P>
    <P>Unit costs to employers for part-time workers are lower and that is another unassailable fact.  We have to consider whether measures we bring forward will so change those unit costs that they may deny people who would wish to have part-time work that type of work.  Non-wage labour costs are lower for the part-time workers and, therefore, non-wage labour costs are always an element in the calculations of employers.  We should try to keep them low for the simple reason that they are the margin that make an employer make the decision to bring a person into employment or not.</P>
    <P>Statutory provisions are less onerous and several speakers made reference to the way some employers, in particular some of our national supermarkets, manipulate the hours of workers in order to avoid those statutory provisions and, specifically, in order to avoid in the case of women maternity leave and benefits. It redounds to the discredit of those supermarkets and some of the larger institutions, particularly banks who are moving in this direction, that they seek to manipulate them within the law without observing what Deputy O'Sullivan referred to as even playing field conditions or conditions of fairness.</P>
    <P>The desire by employers to achieve more general flexibility is another reason we have had part-time workers.  As we try to increase the protections available we should be conscious of the fact that we are creating an inducement to an employer to create several part-time jobs instead of one full-time job.  In Ireland the social employment scheme and job sharing have given rise to an increase in the number of part-time workers. However, the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan about job sharing in the public <Col N="1620" /> sector and the way it works to the advantage of the workers should be borne in mind.  Hopefully, when the legislation is introduced we will have the concept of proportionality of benefit included.</P>

      <P>The conclusion one must come to is that the problem of part-time workers is not a simple one.  The phenomenon is not particular to Ireland, it is widely spread.  The solutions which we must bring to bear on that issue will not be easy ones.  The Workers' Party's Bill is a short one.  The first two sections deal with the Title, the commencement and the interpretation.  The final section deals with other enactments which are to be repealed by the Bill.  The Bill focuses on the problem in only three short sections. The first section runs to only two lines. This is by no means a charter for the part-time worker.  It is not sufficient; it does not go far enough and it does not deal comprehensively with the matter.</P>

      <P>It deals with the issue from one particular focus and if one does that one is doing damage to the issue.  That is the danger of dealing with a particularly complex problem from one mental set. That is the problem with the Bill.  In essence the problem is not that the Bill is short but that it is narrow in its focus. One cannot legislate for the problem in this manner.  It is an act of self-delusion to suggest that this is a charter that will resolve the issues of part-time workers. The question of part-time workers, and their rights, ranges over a wide area &mdash; over revenue, social welfare, social insurance and so on.  The implications are massive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given clear indications here and elsewhere that he is not just familiar with and conscious of the problem of part-time workers but that it is a problem to which he will give his energy and will seek to resolve.  He has gone further <Col N="1622" /> than simply saying he is conscious of the problem.  He has initiated steps which deal logically with the issue.  The issue is adverted to, as Deputy Hillery said in his contribution, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The Minister has, as he outlined last night, commenced a review of the problem.  Correctly, the Minister not being of a dictatorial inclination, as one or two of the sponsors of this Bill may be, has sought to establish the views of the social partners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In May 1989 the Minister and his Department organised a seminar. Indeed, it was an important date in regard to the issue of part-time worker.  The Minister tried at that time to get both sides of the social partners to give their views on the subject and, indeed, he engaged a number of academics who had done research work on the subject.  These included John Blackwell who has been referred to frequently here.  Both the ICTU and the FIE gave their views.  Following the election draft proposals were prepared and were put forward by the Minister dealing with this very complex issue.  The Minister seeks in those draft proposals &mdash; and no doubt we will see them soon &mdash; to deal with the issue on a comprehensive basis.  They have been circulated, as the Minister has told us, among Government Departments.  That is the right and appropriate way for it to happen because this is a multi-faceted problem.  It is a problem that touches on many Government Departments.  This is the way one would expect that this particular issue which needs to be dealt with on a serious basis should be dealt with and is being dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the circulation of the draft memorandum the matter has now come back to the Minister and to his Department. The Minister has given this House, and the sponsor of the Bill can take some credit for this, an undertaking that he will be bringing proposals before the Dáil soon.  That is the Minister's intention and I do not think his bona fides in that regard can be questioned because he has proven himself to be a man of his word on other issues.  The Minister has rightly suggested that it would be prudent to have due regard to the experience at European Community level in this matter before concluding our proposals.  I would submit to Deputies <Col N="1624" /> who are impatient, rightly so, and understandably so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy Barnes was other than silent I apologise and I withdraw that remark but clearly her colleagues in Government did not pay sufficient attention to her advice and that rebounds to their disfavour.  Within the next two months the EC will be completing what they have quaintly termed a directive on a typical work.  I think the drafts have already been circulated and I believe very strongly and very firmly that <Col N="1625" /> there would be no sense in our progressing further until we can actually produce sets of proposals that will dovetail with those.  Whatever else can be said about our European partners in this regard we have to accept the fact that they have a great deal longer experience with the issue of part-time work, particularly in the Nordic countries where the issue is an extraordinary one, where 25 per cent of the workforce is employed on a part-time basis and as high as 55 per cent of women are employed on a part-time basis.  Clearly the solutions they have been experimenting with and putting in train are something we should look at before we address the issue.</P>

      <P>Arrogance is something which comes in abundance from the ranks of The Workers' Party.  Throughout the last two days a number of other Deputies and myself sat here contributing to the Defence Bill.  Deputy Bell who was here was dismissed as somebody who really did not know about the law, Deputy Durkan was dismissed as somebody who was not around and did not listen carefully enough, Deputy Hillery and myself were dismissed by The Workers' Party as being mere emissaries of the Tánaiste and now it seems I am accused of coming in and speaking on a Bill without even having read it, despite the fact that I have taken some trouble to prepare by contribution.  I think Deputy Rabbitte should do me more justice than that.  He knows me better than to make such a <Col N="1626" /> suggestion.  Given the experience of part-time work in other developed EC countries and in European states in general, to press ahead on this matter without adverting to the work which has been done and which is being done at EC level within the social action programme would be not only foolhardy but arrogance of a high order on our part.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his contribution, outlined his concerns in this area as have other Government speakers.  There is one thing we can say about the debate: it has not been acrimonious because we all share a common concern that the problem be addressed in a comprehensive way and in a way that will serve the interests of part-time workers.  I have to say &mdash; and I do not mean to be dismissive because I am sure Deputy Rabbitte put in a great deal of effort into preparing this Bill &mdash; that I do not believe the Bill looks after the issue adequately.  It would be wrong for Deputy Rabbitte to go out of this House with the view that he or those who sponsored the Bill have a monopoly of compassion for those who are exploited and underprivileged.  That is not the case. Compassion for those who are underprivileged and down trodden and, in particular, people who find themselves exploited, as in the cases I have outlined at the beginning of my contribution, is evenly spread around this House.  What all of us should aim to do, is to illustrate our compassion by producing a well drafted charter of rights for the part-time worker.  I hope and I have every confidence that the Minister will produce such a charter.  In spite of the efforts Deputy Rabbitte has undoubtedly put into this Bill I do not think it could be reasonably characterised as a comprehensive and well-thought through charter for part-time workers.  Such a charter could only be produced following careful study of the precise nature of the problems and very close consultation with the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 (1) provides for an increase of 5 per cent in the rates of monthly child benefit.  The rate of payment for each of the first four children will be increased from £15.05 to £15.80 and the rate of payment for each other child will be increased to £22.90.  Section 5 (2) provides that the increased rates of child benefit will come into effect from 2 October.  It is estimated that this measure will cost £2.5 million in 1990 since an estimated 1.129 million children will benefit from these increases.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate on the Bill some Deputies criticised the level of increases provided for in the child benefit scheme.  Child benefit is paid in recognition of the important role of the family within society and represents a contribution by the State towards the upbringing of children.  Child benefit is payable regardless of parents' means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child benefit should not be seen in isolation but rather as one of a range of family income support measures administered by the State.  The needs of social <Col N="1629" /> welfare recipients with child dependants are met by way of the child dependant increases which are payable to the recipient. In the case of workers on low incomes additional support is available through the family income supplement scheme and the special child-related tax exemption scheme.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the financial needs of families with children and I have made significant progress in recent years in increasing the level of social welfare payments to families with children.  I am very pleased that I have been able to make substantial further progress in this year's budget in improving the position of families dependent on social welfare. These improvements include an increase in the minimum child dependant payment from £10 to £11 per week, the payment of child dependant increases until the age of 20 to recipients of long-term payments where the child continues in full-time education, a 5 per cent increase in the child benefit and the introduction of a clothing allowance for families on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The child benefit increase is the first overall increase in this benefit for three years.  There was an increase last year in respect of the fifth child.  The budget must be seen in the context of the package provided, particularly, for children and the way in which the Government have been targeting and directing resources to those who are in greatest need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at section 5 but it is welcome in so far as it increases the amount of child benefit. There was an attempt last year to let this payment fade into the distance and confused messages came from the Government side about its future.  I am concerned that the question of the older child might rise again in regard to this benefit.  As the Minister rightly pointed out this is the only social welfare child benefit which is not related to income and, as such, is of great importance to persons who are outside the social welfare system.  The token increase of 5 per cent after a three year freeze, which only <Col N="1630" /> relates to this year's inflation level, inevitably means that the value of this benefit has dropped substantially since 1986, the last occasion on which there was an increase.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned at the fact that the increase will not come into effect until 2 October 1990.  This will mean a future drift in the value of this increase for families. The first drift occurred in 1983 when the increase did not come into effect until July.  Since then increases in the benefit, along with all other social welfare increases, have been paid in July.  The Minister should reflect on this and agree to bring this increase into operation in July along with the other increases in social welfare benefits.  As it stands this increase is only a token for families who have enormous expenses to meet.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to his package of measures for families on social welfare. As I said during the debate on sections 3 and 4, this package is seriously inadequate and is a poor response to low paid families in the tax net for whom child benefit is perhaps of greatest significance than for families in the social welfare system and those on higher incomes.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendments in my name because I believe they would be of immense help.  My amendments propose the inclusion of a payment for children over 12 years and the payment of the increases in July in line with the payment of increases in other social welfare benefits.  I could ask for 101 other things, for example, a genuine increase which is related to the rate of inflation since 1986.  I know my amendments have been ruled out of order but they would improve the Bill if they were accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the figures in our amendments, which were ruled out of order.  We believe they are still within the realm of reality because they were based on research.  Our basic objection related to the number of children involved.  The Minister has been kind enough to tell us the number of children who will qualify.  This is the section that gives specific income to all parents whether or not they are in the social welfare category.  Over the last number of years this payment has been made directly to the mother and is a very important part of her income that she looks upon as her own.  The Minister has not touched this for about three years.  He contemplated some kind of means testing at one time but this led to widespread criticism.  I am glad the Minister has dropped the idea because, like Deputy Flaherty, I consider this a very important payment as do the recipients.  Having allowed it to languish for three years the Minister has now increased it by 20p, effectively a cut when one looks at monetary trends.</P>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with that.  That is why I suggested an amendment which was ruled out of order.  The amendment took into account the figure that was researched as being necessary to maintain a child with some degree of nourishment. Irrespective of the trace elements contained in it and the nutritional value of the food, this figure was a gesture towards increasing these amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how much one gives some families they may not be able to comprehend their responsibilities.  This happens in the area of rent.  People need more than just money to help them.  They may need counselling and other things. Some families with children are at risk <Col N="1632" /> and tremendous back up services are needed.  In addition to making gestures like this small increase there is a responsibility to children who are at risk in some families.  I know Deputy Woods is a caring Minister and I hope he will take this on board because when we make suggestions like this we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</P>
    <P>The increase is inadequate and almost offensive because of its nominal nature. The independent non-governmental agencies who carried out the research, the people dealing with children, with poverty, with social problems, have identified families with children as being in greatest need.  We have a responsibility to address that.  If the Minister feels some families do not really need this benefit that can be addressed in other ways, but the woman in the home should not be the one to lose the benefit.  I would respectfully suggest that any thoughts the Minister might have had in this area would be dropped now, once and for all.  With the upturn in the economy I hope the Minister will address the question of child benefit separately from payments for children in the social welfare category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred earlier to the amendment that was ruled out of order. We felt that the starting date of October for the increased payment should be brought forward to April.  That point has been made by my colleagues on this side of the House.  Up to 1983 it was paid in April when it was moved to July and now we are to have October payments. October is possibly the worst month to increase this benefit because with the return to school in September low income families are in greatest need.  I would ask the Minister to cast his mind into the real world where people with school going children are struggling on low income and social welfare benefits and think of the stress and strain on such families.  Child benefit is something that some people live for from month to month because it is such an important part of the family's overall income.  I appreciate that our amendment was out of order but it is very wrong of the Minister not to increase the <Col N="1633" /> benefit until October.  Mothers of low income families are going hungry and sacrificing their own health in favour of their children.</P>
      <P>The Gibney and Lee report mentions that half of the families on social welfare rely on the St. Vincent de Paul and on moneylenders for financial help.  It goes on to say that there is also a low level of alcohol consumption which was noteworthy in the light of the popular misconception that much of the poverty in disadvantaged areas is caused by drink. There is a feeling among certain elements of our society that the poor are only poor because they wish to be poor, that they are in the pub every night of the week. It is a pity somebody would not mass produce the reports which show the contrary to be true.</P>
      <P>The rate of increase is very sad, to say the least.  It works out at about 2.5p per day.  My wife mentioned this morning that she had got her revised children's allowance book.  We have two children and we got £1.50, 75p per child per month.  That is 2.5p per day, enough to buy maybe one apple per week.  In the light of the debate today which emphasised the importance of fruit eating by children that is a startling fact.  I am not happy that this increase will not be implemented until October, and the rates are far too low.</P>

      <P>It did not discourage me at all because, I can assure the Deputy, that it is a mild element in the context of rearing children.  It was, however, a slap in the face in that it indicated that our debate today, as far as the Department of Social Welfare were concerned, would be entirely academic in that the increases in relation to the post-October period, have been printed in this booklet.  It is <Col N="1634" /> unfortunate they adopt that attitude. They could at least have pretended to listen to what we have to say here by awaiting the decision of the House.</P>
      <P>I was also anxious to point out that the last increase in 1986 was from £12 to £15 which reflected inflation at the time.  I make a final appeal to the Minister to see if he can do any better than the 5 per cent he is offering to mothers and children, particularly since the 5 per cent relates only to inflation in the coming year.  It clearly does not make up for the fact that there has not been an increase for two years.  This is the single payment that goes to all families regardless of income and is paid directly to the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that child benefit is a universal payment. Deputy Byrne talked about low income families.  We are increasing the payments to low income families.  The money has been targeted specifically and purposely towards low income families over the past three years in accordance with the wish of everybody in this House. The Commission on Social Welfare and the ESRI report said that resources should be targeted to those people who are at risk.  The Deputy referred again and again to low income families.  The Government have directed money to them.  Increases have been given in unemployment assistance, bringing up the minimum weekly payment to £11. The Commission on Social Welfare have said we should aim to have a minimum weekly payment of £10 per week and we have exceeded that.  The lone parent scheme which is being introduced will have a payment of £13.50 per week.  The Government have been addressing the need.</P>
      <P>The child benefit scheme is very important to the broad range of families.  It also supplements low income families.  People are inclined to forget that such families get it as well.  A family with five children on long-term unemployment assistance will have £138 per week from us and another £20 in child benefit, bringing their income up to about £158 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into office a study was <Col N="1635" /> in progress initiated by the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition.  It was felt that the universal system was not well targeted and studies were being done to relate Finance and Revenue records to Social Welfare records so that they could be matched and a cut-off point could possibly be introduced.  This is what I inherited and the argument has been going on for some time.  The percentage of people at the very high level of take home pay is very small.  Only 2 per cent of PAYE and PRSI contributions earn over £20,000, although there would be a higher percentage if one considered the self-employed and the wider population.  I made the argument that the percentage was very small.</P>
    <P>I had thought that Deputies would be very happy that we are back to a situation where the increase is 5 per cent, with inflation expected to be 3 per cent for the relevant period, but perhaps there is still a desire to have some cut-off point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned bringing payments forward.  The cost of that increase in a full year would be £10 million. There are 1.29 million children in that system and consequently it is broadly based and the cost of any improvement is very high.  That is the reality we have to face.  In bringing forward the increase this year to April instead of October we would incur a cost of £5 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Where do we get the £5 million?  That is the problem.  We managed this year to get £216 million in total for those depending on social welfare. Never was such a large amount provided. It is true that most of it is targeted to the elderly, people on means-tested payments and those in receipt of supplementary welfare and long-term unemployment assistance.  There is no point in quoting statistics about people at risk if our actions are not directed towards them.  We must be mature enough to say this is what we are doing this year.  At least let us keep child benefit <Col N="1636" /> moving.  The total cost of child benefit this year is £211.5 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned the problems which face low income people in the autumn with the opening of the school year.  The increase will come at the beginning of October, which is not too far behind.  A family with five children will receive £86.10 per month or £21.52 per week from October.  The Deputy mentioned low income families and we have specifically directed the clothing allowance to them.  We did it because everybody directly involved on a daily basis in that area said it was the thing most needed at the beginning of September. It is a new scheme being introduced this year for the first time.  I met with the community welfare officers and this is what they believe is the most effective way.  I am taking the most practical means to direct money to those who need it most.  This was also recommended by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and I met them, and by other groups.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned low income mothers and mothers in general.  I agree with him about the importance of the child benefit scheme. Some people seem to miss the point that child benefit payments go directly into the hand of the mother.  Perhaps we should be providing that it be paid to the spouse who is minding the children at home.  It goes directly to the mother in the vast majority of cases and is particularly valuable.  I regard it as a very important scheme and I am glad it is being increased to more than allow for inflation this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty talked about the group who benefited from the tax allowance that was there previously. The tax allowance was abolished not by me but by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  That was a problem from the point of view of families depending on child benefit and assistance who yet did not come into the <Col N="1637" /> direct social welfare categories.  The child tax allowance was abolished and in that way the children were dropped out of that system.  We have brought a child tax allowance back for the lower income families.  Following April families who have the £200 child tax allowance which was introduced last year will have that allowance raised to £300.  That is a substantial tax related exemption.  It means in effect that a family with, say, five children and an income of £8,000 will be totally exempt from tax.  The tax is brought in at the lower level.  That is more evidence of the Government directing their efforts particularly towards people at work on low incomes.  There is also a benefit above £8,000 to about £11,000 on a reducing scale.  The Government plan to see how that works.  It started last year and is only running well at this stage.  The rates have been increased very substantially in the budget, consequently it will be very interesting to see the uptake as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The other measure for families at work is the family income supplement scheme. We have increased the payments under FIS very substantially since 1986.  The maximum amount which a family with four children can receive under the FIS scheme has almost doubled from £22 per week to £42 per week and we are planning further substantial improvements in that scheme very shortly arising from the budget and the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>All in all, I am very pleased that this section provides for the continuation of increases in the child benefit scheme.  I hope that can be further considered for the future and that the views Deputies have expressed in relation to the needs of older chidlren, for instance, can be considered in the context of future budgets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with children of varying ages and I compliment the Minister because he has made an effort at least to rationalise the ages at which children are cut off from benefit or, to put it another way, the ages at which children are still considered to be dependants, irrespective of the age of majority.  We in the Labour Party believe that children who are still going to school full-time or who are trying to get additional training but still do not have an income are still dependants.  The Minister has been moving in the right direction in raising the ages for benefits.  He has promised this year to raise the age to 20 in some cases and next year he hopes that the improvements in social welfare provisions will apply to all who can be classed as dependant children, irrespective of age.  Of course, we are never satisfied and the Minister realises that.</P>
      <P>We had hoped that this year the various benefits and schemes would apply to children of all ages provided the children met the requirements specified by the Minister of still attending school and in receipt of full-time education or training and still being dependants.  They are penalised by health boards if their parents do not have the medical card.  Those children are treated as adults although they have no income and legally they are debarred from holding the medical card unless their parents have it.  They are being discriminated against by one State sector and we hope the Department will not discriminate against them.  The Minister has made efforts at rationalisation in regard to ages and we had hoped he would do more, but that is why we put down amendments which, unfortunately, were ruled out of order because of the charge on the Exchequer.  The concept of what we want to do remains and we would like to see further rationalisation of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the fact that in this section the Minister is <Col N="1639" /> bringing in a number of additional benefits and will be paying child dependent allowances up to the age of 20, I am very concerned that the group I mentioned under sections 3 and 4 are once again excluded.  This intensifies the picture I am painting of their becoming one of the poorest and most at risk sub-groups in the social welfare system, and there are many of them.  I am sure the Minister can tell me how many recipients of unemployment benefit are in receipt of pay-related benefit, and how many are not.</P>
      <P>I started school at age five and would have been disqualified during my last year in school had I been dependent on social welfare.  Families come to us who are barely managing on unemployment or disability benefit and suddenly their child who is still at school is cut off at 18 years of age.  There is absolutely no acknowledgement of that.  The only alternative is to take the child out of school and then that child can have unemployment assistance. They face further economic deprivation if they wish to allow their child to remain at school, and it puts immense pressure on the child especially when facing examinations and he is already highly stressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has obviously accepted this issue in principle because he has moved to extend this benefit for all other beneficiaries but in section 6 (1) he still excludes particular recipients of disability benefit and unemplyment benefit from any benefit under this scheme.  Today the Minister told me the cost of extending the scheme.  In a written reply he told me that to extend it to the age of 19 for children of recipients of disability benefit or unemployment benefit it would cost approximately £1.5 million, £2 million to raise it to 20 years of age and £2.5 million to raise the age to 21.  I would be glad if this group could be covered up to the leaving certificate but they should be brought at least in line with the other groups whose benefits are being increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my amendment, which was ruled out of order, I asked the Minister to bring that group in line with the second group. <Col N="1640" /> Obviously he has been convinced by the arguments.  I know the theory about DB and UB being short-term.  If you are on basic unemployment benefit you are on the lowest level of benefit.  You are suffering from a recent period of unemployment and trying to cope with it and to suddenly find that your child is not acknowledged by anybody &mdash; indeed becomes a non-person when he or she goes over 18 &mdash; adds insult to injury in a very difficult situation.  I am startled that the figures are so large and I should like to know how many children are involved.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister's record over the last few years, there will be buoyancy in his Department because, between the time the Estimates were published in December and the final budget figures in January, another £25 million has emerged.  I gather that the Minister has set aside £5 million for the new carer's allowance which will not come into play until October.  The criteria will be a lot stricter than everybody expected and I have no doubt that under that heading there will be substantial savings because he will not expend that kind of money. The Minister has accepted this issue in principle for all other recipients and it could also be conceded here because, if there is another income in the family, at most it would be only a partial child benefit.  There may be a little overlapping in two areas where there may not be the greatest need but, given that we have not got around to reforming this area, it is a small price to pay to give some assistance to a group which, I am convinced, have slipped to the bottom of the pile.</P>
    <P>The pressure groups to which the Mininster referred earlier, in assessing the impact of the changes in this budget, also indicated that this group seem to have slipped to the bottom of the pile and they are concerned that people who should be in benefit and in a relatively good position are particularly disadvantaged, even though they are in receipt of supplementary welfare which can be quite significant.  I hope that the Minister will make some improvements for this group on Report Stage so that there will be a real impact on their circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ferris welcomed the increase to young people of 20 years of age and said that naturally he would like to raise it to 21 years of age.  Last year the age for receipt of this benefit was 19, this year it is 20 and it will be 21 next year.  The Government have accepted a commitment in that regard. That is why I was allowed to say that it was a phased arrangement over three years.  When I say things like that it might sound as if I am speaking off the cuff but that is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This increase applies to the old age contributory pension, the retirement pension, the invalidity pension, long-term unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, the old age non-contributory and blind pensions, the carer's allowance and disablement pension to persons who are also in receipt of unemployment supplement.  It is quite a wide provision and applies to a large number of people.  As I said, the scheme will apply to people aged 21 next year and it will be a uniform scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty referred to disability and unemployment benefit.  These are short-term payments and people may have difficulty in regard to them.  One group are more easily identified, those on long-term disability benefit, who are not able to transfer to invalidity pension because they are not badly disabled.  We know that about 40 per cent of those people were offered invalidity pension but did not change to it.  Obviously, there is a tax consideration and that is why they would not change.  Consequently, I presume the Deputy would not be concerned about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there is a group of people on long-term disability benefit who could be disadvantaged.  We will look at that to see if they can be defined.  This does not occur in other countries, particularly in the EC, because one is not allowed to <Col N="1642" /> stay on disability benefit on that basis &mdash; one either goes on to a long-term payment or gets employment.  Some people on unemployment benefit are in and out of the workforce and again there is a problem of definition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris asked about people who do not have pay related benefit.  From my own recollection, the number is probably something over 40 per cent.  Again it depends on who they are, some of them may be unemployed for a very short time and others for longer periods.  However, if they are unemployed for 15 months they come under the unemployment allowance.  On that basis it is hard to see how many people are affected.  Supplementary schemes cannot be open to all the unemployed because it would mean that people on pay related benefit and on short-time unemployment benefit would be gaining from something intended for people on a lower income.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of solving these issues is the fact that you would then see some of the residuals in areas which had not been considered heretofore.  I take it that the Deputy agrees it was right for me to increase unemployment assistance to £52.  I did that as a priority but we will see if anything can be done about identifying other categories for future reference.  I know that the Deputy is particularly concerned about those on long-term disability benefit who do not have the opportunity to draw an invalidity pension.  How that should be handled is another matter which will have to be considered because there are people who should be on invalidity pension and it is obvious that they are not going over to it because it is taxable.  They are eligible for a long-term invalidity pension and they should be on it.  As I said, in other countries they would not be given this option.  Perhaps some people have not considered that when you are in receipt of long-term invalidity payments you get certain other benefits as well.</P>
    <P>I noted what Deputies said and I will <Col N="1643" /> keep their views in mind for future reference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement in regard to long-term recipients of disability benefit. I am also concerned about recipients of unemployment benefit if there is not a pay-related element &mdash; and indeed even if there is &mdash; because pay-related has become such a tiny additional element of benefit.  The benefit is already £4 lower than that accruing to the long-term unemployed. The periods of unemployment may be short-term but more often than not they are quite long periods and people are faced with a dramatic change in their family income.  I would like to put on the record that this is a group about whom we should be concerned.  I have seen in individual families the impact of the loss of any payment for a child.  They have to stretch the combined payment to cover a child who is 18 years old.  It is just not possible without making sacrifices and it inevitably puts them well below the poverty line, even with pay-related benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare suggested that people on benefit should receive 10 per cent more than those on assistance, to acknowledge the level of contribution.  There was a view that that demarcation should be maintained but in our efforts to respond to a very real need, to increase the assistance payments, we have discriminated against this group and pushed them out on a limb.  As I have said, I have witnessed individual cases which bring this home to me time and time again.  We should put on the record that it is not just disability benefit recipients who are affected but also unemployment benefit recipients, in particular in the context of this payment because it is a mainline child dependant payment and not an optional extra.  It is related to an assessment of their needs and if it was discontinued it would be an enormous loss and would present them with very <Col N="1644" /> difficult choices.  If the age was extended, even to 19, it would at least take those children past second level education and would preserve them from the worst effects of their parents' unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of unemployment benefit rates and the differential, the commission proposed doing away with pay-related benefit and then having the differential.  If you take the pay-related benefit on top of the £48 you would be talking about £66.  The average pay-related benefit is just over £12 which would bring the average payment to slightly over £60.  Therefore the differential would still exist.  I was very conscious of that when compiling the figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but there is still a differential with the pay-related benefit.  The difficulty with doing away with the pay-related benefit is that the other payment would not be sufficient and would have to be increased to a satisfactory level.  Disability benefit and unemployment benefit are short-term and insurance-based payments which means one can have other income.  In many cases there is other income for a variety of reasons &mdash; that is a feature of the insurance schemes generally &mdash; but that does not take from what the Deputy is saying in relation to some cases which arise.  We would probably need to look closer at that area to see what sort of cases arise and the numbers involved. The thinking behind this was that these schemes would not be means tested and one could have any other income coming into the household and still get benefit.  I accept what the Deputy says about some people falling into that difficulty and not being able to get any of the supplements which apply and therefore I will look at that position.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister <Col N="1645" /> is going to look at the particular case that has been raised.  He said that because unemployment benefit and disability benefit are considered to be short-term, it is not easy to handle them.  People on long-term disability benefit do not receive pay-related benefit and indeed after a year and three months people on unemployment benefit are also outside the pay-related category.  Leaving those aside, there are many people &mdash; and the Minister has records of these in the Department &mdash; on long-term disability benefit who should obviously be on invalidity pension, which is not means tested either because it is based on contributions.  They have not moved to invalidity pension for tax purposes or otherwise.  We believe that people in those categories should be considered in regard to the amendment suggested by Deputy Flaherty.  The Minister has said he will consider this problem because there is obviously a slight anomaly in this regard.  He knows there are a number of people on disability benefit for five, six, seven, eight or ten years and obviously we cannot treat those people as employable again.  They will obviously be dependent on social welfare and if they have dependants that should be taken into account, particularly if those dependants are under the age of 20 &mdash; the age will be 21 next year &mdash; and attending school.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his last contribution said that disability benefit and unemployment benefit are paid by virtue of insurance contributions and hence one is entitled to have other income.  Similarly with invalidity pension and widow's pension.  They are also based on contributions: the income is taxable &mdash; and the person may receive other income in addition.  It is wrong to exclude this group, because they are a varied group.  People may go in and out of employment for short periods.  There may be part payment in relation to a child if there is other income coming into the home &mdash; presumbaly it will be an earning <Col N="1646" /> wife and only half the benefit would be payable.  Given the Minister's excellent record in relation to savings in his Department, I know he will produce a great deal more than £2 million savings this year and, if he is really convinced, he could deal with this matter and still look at necessary reforms in the general area of disability benefit, in particular in relation to these dependants, even, as I have said, to cover them initially beyond their second level schooling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what is now looked upon as a hardy annual or just increasing the ceiling for pay-related benefit.  I realise the Minister inherited this habit of pay-relating or increasing the ceilings. Is there any valid reason for having a ceiling on this payment?  We are really dealing with people in relatively high income brackets, paying pay-related benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initial concept of pay related benefit as advocated by most socialists and the trade union movement was that pay related benefits were an instrument to cushion people from the truama of losing a job and that it eased them into unemployment benefit or indeed unemployment assistance.  I think that the time is ripe to examine why there is a ceiling on the payment of PRSI and why there is a ceiling on the payment of benefits? Now that the percentage of income related to pay related benefits has been reduced to 12 per cent of income, I wonder what is the whole concept of pay related benefit?  I respectfully suggest that the benefits are no longer related to pay in any way.  The Minister inserted a provision in section 7 (2) for an early date, that is because he is a beneficiary. We would have frightened the Minister <Col N="1647" /> if we had suggested moving the date back to October or other such dates.  I am also trying to help the Minister to ensure that he will have more money.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the reason for the ceiling on PRSI contributions?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is in favour of removing the ceiling and having people on much higher income pay PRSI.  The reason for the ceiling is that employees will pay their PRSI up to a particular point and not beyond that.  I know that in Britain, for instance, there is no ceiling for the employer and that he pays a contribution on the full income.  Our ceilings are very much the same for both the employer and the employee but the employer ceiling is a little higher now; this year it will rise to £18,600 from £18,000 while the ceiling on the employees contribution goes up to £17,300 from £16,700.  The differential was introduced last year for employers but the employees rate of contribution is <Col N="1648" /> being increased only in line with changes in income.</P>
      <P>The wider question of increasing the ceiling further and bringing in the kinds of income that would be involved would fall to be considered by the inter-departmental group who are looking at the PRSI system generally.  As the Deputy probably knows, and we will discuss this later, there are questions about the rate of PRSI for the people on the lowest incomes and about how the scheme might currently be modified.  What matters to the individual is the take home pay at the end of the day and that is affected by both PRSI and the tax take.  That whole question is being considered at present by an inter-departmental committee who began to consider the matter just after the budget.  In the budget we took certain steps such as exempting people earning below £60 per week in any particular week &mdash; and we will discuss this later &mdash; but we then set about considering the whole question of PRSI and we will bear the Deputy's point of view in mind.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is relating the contributions of PRSI to the level at which pay related benefit would be paid but that is more properly dealt with in section 11 so I will leave that until we get to that section as other Deputies may have something to say about it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question as to why the section will come into operation on 6 April.  The reason is that it is tied in with the Revenue and it would create enormous difficulty in collecting revenue if this was not so, and I am sure the Deputy would be chasing me if we let the collection system slip.  When the equation is worked out in the first instance, we look at the income from 6 April and we try to provide as much as possible during the year in terms of the increases that can be provided.  The fact that the section comes into operation from 6 April certainly helps me as Minister for Social Welfare in trying to get the improvements we are interested in.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would it be possible at this stage to refer to the PRSI payments made by the self employed where some people experience the difficulty of having paid contributions for nine years but yet finish up getting nothing in return?  I know we are in the middle of the Bill and it may not be possible to do anything at this stage but would it be possible that the Minister consider paying PRSI to the self employed on the basis of their <i>pro rata</i> contributions so that if they made contributions for nine years they would be entitled to receive nine tenths of the difference between the contributory and non-contributory pension or in the case of having paid contributions for five years that they be entitled to half the difference? There is a substantial difference in the rate of pension for a husband and wife over 66 years, a £27.10 difference between the contributory and non-contibutory pension and it would make quite a difference if the self-employed were to receive the <i>pro rata</i> difference between the two pensions.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1650" /> could consider giving those who will not have ten years contributions something on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  I accept that will cost extra money but I would like to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>

      <P>In the case of widows, some will be eligible as of now but for the majority payment will be much further on.  There was much argument among the experts, and I am not talking about the experts in my Department of course because they are very accurate, about the scheme.  When I say it was succesful, I mean that in the sense that it was our view that the income would be higher than was anticipated and we have been proved correct.  This year the income will be £62 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne asked a very relevant question about those who are 55.  If they are taken into the scheme they will get an exceptionally good deal.  To make the scheme work we should have people joining it from 25 to 40 years of age.  It is not economic to be taking on people in their fifties.  The estimated cost of bringing people in that age group into the scheme is very substantial.  The Deputy recognises that it will involve a huge cost and he asked if it would be possible to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> arrangement.  When we introduced the scheme we agreed to review it at the end of three years and <Col N="1651" /> the points raised by the Deputy will be considered in that review which takes place at the end of the year.  The financial experts tell me that it would be too expensive to include those over 55 but I would rather wait to get an estimate of the number of people involved.  I would be anxious to include those up to 60 years of age but I must bear in mind the cost involved.  However, all is not lost as far as those people are concerned.  It is not the popular thing to point out that the full benefit applies to the widow if the person concerned dies within the nine years.  The full widow's pension, and all that goes with it, will be paid.  There is also a refund paid at the end.</P>
    <P>I am investigating this matter and I am aware that the financial experts are not inclined to go any further because they consider we have gone too far to date.  I will bear the views of Deputies in mind and take them into consideration when we are carrying out the review.  The Deputy may be interested to know that I have asked the National Pensions Board to assess the possibility of introducing the invalidity pension for those people.  That pension is fairly clearcut.  As the people involved are self-employed it would be very difficult to apply a disability benefit to them.  The board will be examining this from an actuarial point of view to see if the suggestion is feasible.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister has told us that he will refund 50 per cent of the payments to the small farmers and business people who cannot benefit but, on the other hand, if they qualify for a non-contributory pension the Minister will be keeping that 50 per cent of their contributions.  That must be the most unjust decision that the Minister has ever made.  Will the Minister explain how he can describe the latter as a non-contributory pension when he is keeping half of the payments?  The Minister should consider that issue when he is <Col N="1652" /> reviewing the scheme at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the scheme has become very popular in spite of the reservations expressed initially by the IFA.  Many people, particularly widows, are requesting information about the scheme from public representatives. I am surprised that the Department are not prepared to deal with applicants until they have a tax number. It is unfortunate that many of the self-employed, widows and small farmers have never been in the tax bracket.  It takes some time for them to make their contributions.  I accept that those who have not made sufficient contributions will only receive a portion of them back. Is it the Minister's intention to discontinue the payment of non-contributory pensions?  Is it the Minister's intention to ask everybody to contribute so that shopkeepers, the self-employed, farmers and on so on will be able to benefit instead of having to transfer their possessions to a relative before they qualify? Will the Minister outline his long-term aim in regard to this?</P>

      <P>Most people are in the scheme but there are still those who are under the £2,500 income limit.  They are not included and must depend on the other scheme.  The reason we are seeking tax numbers is so that people will register. The amount involved is very little, £104 per annum.  One of the difficulties we have is that people who pay contributions are not registered for the benefits. Obviously, we will catch up with them in due course but we would be happier to have them registered.  There is no doubt <Col N="1653" /> that the scheme is going well despite the fears and concerns expressed about it.  It should be borne in mind that we had to run an extensive campaign to get people to understand that the scheme provided benefits as a right and that we were removing the means test.  I will keep the points raised in mind.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne extended the debate wider than we had anticipated.  An amendment tabled by Deputy Browne and myself in relation to the regulations and the awarding of <i>pro rata</i> pensions was ruled out of order.  Is this a general application or is it confined to this section?  In relation to the point made by Deputy Ferris, I gather from discussions I have had with the Minister's Department that the number of people who are in a contributory position is increasing but that need not necessarily be a steady and increasing index.  Because of the level of unemployment over the past decade when those people arrive at pension age we will see an increase again and people will be dependent on non-contributory benefits of one kind or another.  In view of the fact that the Minister responded in such detail to Deputy Byrne I am looking forward to his reply.</P>

Once we get into the mixed insurance issue we are into a very wide ranging situation.

      <P>I would like to deal with the point referred to in Deputy Byrnes's amendment.  I was trying to address this problem in amendment No. 26, which somehow was ruled out of order.  I have to accept that there was obviously a reason for that.  I was trying to remove the provisions that would be subject to regulation and to remove the actual words &ldquo;subject to regulations&rdquo; Deputy Byrne is trying to ensure that the regulations when made will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I, too, was hoping that we would have sight of these regulations.  I know that is not always possible, but we wanted to ensure that the House would have an input into those regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 30, 40 and, indeed, amendment No. 56 are designed to require that regulations relating to the PRSI exemption scheme for low paid workers and the proposed new lone parent's allowance and the carer's allowance schemes will need resolution of approval of each House of the Oireachtas &mdash; in other words that they will have to be brought in here to be debated in the House before they can be put into operation, before I go into any detail that is unnecessarily bureaucratic, would cause delays and is not administratively feasible or desirable.  That is putting it in a nutshell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with my general objections to these amendments I would like to make a specific comment in relation to amendment No. 30, which relates to the PRSI exemption for low paid workers provided for in section 9 of the Bill.  As I announced during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, I intend to introduce this exemption which will benefit up to 50,000 low paid workers with effect from the beginning of the coming income tax year, that is with effect from 6 April next. The effect of this proposed amendment, however, would be to delay the introduction of this scheme.  As Deputies will be aware, the Social Welfare Bill will not <Col N="1657" /> be enacted until Friday next, the same day on which this House will be going into recess.  Consequently, if the proposed amendments were carried the necessary regulations could not be made in sufficient time to have the exemption introduced with effect from 6 April.  That is the classical difficulty which applies at different stages once you put those requirements into a measure such as this.</P>
    <P>On a more general level I must point out that the basic features of the PRSI exemption for low paid workers and the new lone parents allowance and carers allowance schemes are contained in the Bill.  During the Second Stage debate I set out in detail how each of these three schemes will operate, who will benefit and the conditions under which they will benefit.  The regulations which I propose to make will deal essentially with routine administrative matters.  The PRSI exemption regulations will specify that the exemption will apply to persons earning £60 per week or less.  In addition, they will set out how the exemption is to be applied to persons paid other than on a weekly basis &mdash; for example, those paid fortnightly.  The regulations will also deal with other situations such as persons concurrently employed by more than one employer, how persons who benefit under the exemption will be affected by periodic lump sum payments, such as overtime payments, bonus payments and so on.  These are the technical administrative difficulties which arise and they have to be sorted out in an administrative way; otherwise we will choke up the system and get into a bureaucratic system which will ultimately fall down around our necks.  I would strongly advise against that.  That is why I am providing for this kind of flexibility in the arrangement. The Deputy must trust the officials, who, as civil servants, are servants of the public, and the Minister who can be brought before the House at any time within 30 sitting days of the introduction of the regulations so that we can have a full debate and if the Deputy feels some <Col N="1658" /> modification should be made, it can be made in due course.  At least the scheme will go ahead and if the Deputy wants to make amendments he can make them later.</P>
    <P>Regulations relating to the lone parent's allowance and the carer's allowance will deal with routine administrative matters, such as provisions relating to claims and payments, applying existing provisions in relation to the appointment and duties of social welfare officers to the new schemes and provisions for dealing with situations in which persons are entitled to more than one benefit or assistance payment under the Social Welfare Acts.  In addition, regulations relating to the lone parent's allowance will specify the circumstances in which a person is to be regarded as a separated spouse for the purposes of the new allowance. As I made known on Second Stage, all separated persons who make reasonable efforts to obtain maintenance from their spouse will be covered by the new scheme.  This is a major breakthrough in terms of the lone parent's scheme and I must be left to work this out with my officials.  This is a very complicated area and we cannot delay and come back later. It will take some time to work out these issues.  I want the measures to be introduced as quickly as possible and I am trying to sort out the technical difficulties. Even with the best goodwill the Minister for Social Welfare will be under a lot of pressure at the end of the day to try to get the new regualations into operation. The people outside will not thank me or the House if the regulations are delayed at that stage.  This is why I believe the approach we are taking is the better one.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it must be evident to all concerned that the various regulatory powers referred to in these amendments will deal with routine administrative matters. It would be entirely inappropriate to provide that regulations providing for such matters should require a resolution of approval by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I have already indicated, all the relevant features of the three <Col N="1659" /> schemes in question have been explained in detail and adequately discussed on Second Stage.  In addition the three schemes will be the subject of further debate on Committee Stage.  Furthermore, the regulations will have to be laid before the House in any event and Deputies will then have the opportunity of raising any objections they may have to the provisions contained in them.  It is not as if Deputies will not have the opportunity to put forward their views in regard to these regulations; they will.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to introduce the lone parent's allowance and the carer's allowance schemes with effect from October next, or earlier if the necessary administrative arrangements can be put in place.  The necessary administrative arrangements include, for example, all sorts of agreements about what is to be done, how it is to be done, etc., so that we could be tied up in a knot at the end of the day and delay the process even though we may be in a position to go ahead with the schemes.  I am concerned that the introduction of these schemes could be unnecessarily delayed if the relevant regulations require a motion of approval.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I believe the arrangements in the Bill are adequate. Every opportunity will be availed of to let people know about the scheme, in so far as it can be made known at this time. We will have to work out the details subsequently, and this will be done in all good faith.  This is done by the Minister for Social Welfare in many areas and is common practice in the social welfare area.  From that point of view, I believe it would be undesirable to accept Deputy Byrne's amendment.  Of course, the inclusion of amendment No. 30 would cause chaos at this stage.  This measure has to come into effect on 6 April; otherwise people will not be able to receive the benefit on a week by week basis from there on.  I hope Deputy Burne recognises the position he would place me in as Minister if amendments Nos. 30 and 40 were accepted and the difficulties they <Col N="1660" /> would give rise to on the administrative side.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have convinced me to take the same serious view of the first two amendments and obviously I accept that there is a particular problem with regard to the April date, but given that we are so close to 6 April, perhaps the Minister will clarify his thinking behind one of the issues he referred to, that is, the person with two sources of income.  I want to refer to the case of a person I know who, having retired early from teaching due to illness, receives a sickness pension amounting to £30 per week.  Obviously this pension is based on the public service rate for former national school teachers who retire early from teaching and take up low paid positions, which are within the exclusion limit.  I am interested to know how that person will be treated.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply indicated how many of these people depend on the regulations and how they are presented.  The Minister said he hopes to introduce the other two schemes by October.  If the orders have to be made by way of regulation we might be able to indirectly influence the outcome if they have to come back to this House at an early date.</P>

      <P>The Minister has convinced me of his reasons for not accepting the amendments.  However, this begs the question why my amendment to section 9 was not accepted?  My amendment removed any need for the Minister to introduce regulations and would have allowed him to legislate now.  This would have made things much easier for him, <Col N="1661" /> but I realise that legislation needs regulations to bring it into effect.  This will enable the Minister to change certain figures afterwards by way of regulations. I know that we can debate the figures once the regulations are laid before the House, which is the way things are normally done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne wanted to provide that we could debate such regulations in case they would be at a disadvantage.  I am sure that where there will be an advantage we would welcome their speedy introduction by the Minister.  My amendment sought to help the Minister in this respect.</P>

      <P>It is important for us to see the regulations the Minister has in mind as quickly as possible, preferably in conjunction with the reading of the Bill.  There is a reference to disqualification of lone parents from receiving allowances &ldquo;except where regulations otherwise provided.&rdquo; The Minister says he has to work out the details of these regulations.  That seems ominous because the details finally decided by the Minister and which suit him may be upsetting to the Opposition.

      <P>I am having much more difficulty with the general exemption.  It is welcome on one level and it seems churlish to say that one would not welcome an exemption for those with under £60 a week.  I have no doubt, however, that this is a fundamentally flawed approach to the reform of PRSI.  I know the Government are unhappy with it because their response after the budget was a response to the concerns expressed by the junior partners in the Coalition that something should be done with the PRSI area in the context of the fundamental reform of taxation.  The debate on the Social Welfare Bill last year makes very interesting reading with Deputy Harney expressing the PD view of what should be done with PRSI.  We in Fine Gael share a good deal of that view in regard to the targeting of people on low pay because so many of them are in the tax net.  The findings of the ESRI as late as last September were that the removal from the tax net and from PRSI, which is looked on as a tax, of that group of low paid workers would greatly reduce the incidence of poverty in that group.  One of the frustrations of dealing with the Social Welfare Bill in isolation is that so much of what one would like to say would relate to an integrated reform of the tax system as well.  In this case all that is relevant are reforms in the PRSI system. I have no doubt that this exemption for those on £60 was beaten out at the Cabinet table.  Since doing that the Government have established an inter-departmental committee to look at it. This indicates that the Government are concerned first about the broad policy and second about whether this is the right way to approach it.  We in Fine Gael believe it is not the right way to approach it and our suggestion is that £2,500 to £3,000 of the income of all, not just those whose income is under £60, should be exempt from PRSI.  Who can this cut off of £60 be relevant to?  What kind of employment are we acknowledging and encouraging if we are talking about £60? <Col N="1665" /> That kind of income must be a supplementary income.  It simply cannot be an income for a family.  Perhaps it might affect low paid women or very young people.  Introducing a figure like this creates an inevitable trap.  It encourages employers to target employment at this level and it seduces the employees, in their great need for employment, to also look to this figure.</P>
      <P>Once they go over that amount, there is a period before they make up the difference. An increase does not become immediately valuable until the gap is bridged again when they go back to full PRSI.  The experience of payment arising out of equalisation legislation has indicated just how easy it is to trap people. People, largely women, are volunteering to get lower wages and work fewer hours so that they remain within a certain category. It is a fundamentaly flawed approach to reforming PRSI.  It is undoubtedly of benefit to this group of people but perhaps at a very large price. They may be forced to refuse an increase or they may encourage the black market by taking the increase under the table. This is a bad approach.  The unions believe the wrong option has been chosen.  Our proposal that the exemption should be extended is a costly one but it is justified in the context of a substantial move to remove low paid people from the tax net and to encourage employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have recently had representations from the apparel industry who are particularly affected by the PRSI structure.  It is a relatively low paid industry but it is very competitive internationally.  They feel that PRSI exemptions for their workers would be of substantial benefit in creating extra employment.  This debate is important because there is so much long-term unemployment.  The reform of the PRSI system is essential to the creation of an atmosphere where employment is more possible.  This exemption is so limited in its application and has so many possible negative effects, many related to women, that I <Col N="1666" /> am very concerned about the section and will oppose it.  I would press the Minister to adopt the approach proposed by us in our disallowed amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We have suggested a figure of £3,000.  There are two reasons.  PRSI is considered to be a second element of taxation because it is based on gross figures. There is a need to reform the system for the low paid.  The Minister set the figure of £60 per week as a suggested exemption.  Such a basis would have relatively little impact for part-time employees and people in short-term employment.  If the figure were set at £3,000 as suggested by me or at £2,500 as suggested by Deputy Flaherty or on an annual basis, there would be a real benefit for people in short-term employment or in part-time and seasonal employment, particularly in the tourism industry.  There is a belief that people should be exempt from income tax and PRSI payments up to a certain limit. There is also a good argument on the employers' side.  An incentive to the creation of employment would be the exemption of employers from the payment of their level of contribution.</P>
      <P>We must consider what pay-related now means.  It is fast moving away from having any relativity to pay because of the ceiling which has been imposed, the percentage paid to an employee out of work and the length of time it is paid. The original benefits are being eroded and we are not dealing with the kind of people who rarely benefit, which is what we are trying to do in this amendment by suggesting annual figures as opposed to weekly figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have suggested there should be a different arrangement. Deputy Flaherty feels that the provision we are making is not adequate and that we are excluding everyone who earns less than £60 per week.  Other countries within the EC operate an exemption limit.  There is an exemption limit in <Col N="1667" /> Britain below the level of £2,500.  The difference there is that a person does not benefit.  In this case the benefits will still apply once a person is working 18 hours a week.  I would see this as part of a review of the whole scheme.  The reality is that it would take a fair deal of study and investigation to decide how best to do it in the interest of employees and of the social insurance fund and scheme as it operates.  If we are to exempt the first £3,000, which is roughly £60 per week, and leave it as an allowance against PRSI &mdash; a person would not pay PRSI on the first £3,000 anyway &mdash; the cost for employees would be £117 million, for employers £240 million and for both £357 million.  Very large sums are involved once we go right across the board.  The whole system needs more investigation and arrangements have been made for an interdepartmental committee to examine the question urgently.</P>
      <P>The only way to operate this scheme effectively is on a weekly basis.  It would not be of much value to people if they had to wait until the end of the tax year. The weekly basis was chosen so that people could benefit immediately in any week in which they would earn less than £60.  The Revenue Commissioners estimated the numbers who would be involved.  It would cover a wide range of people who are currently earning very low incomes, still doing 18 hours a week. Deputy Flaherty asked what kind of people would be included.  It could include people like students and certain people working in cleaning and other areas.  I would see it as a start to tackling the whole question of people on low pay. The cost is estimated at £11 million in a full year and £8 million in the current year, affecting approximately 50,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the inter-departmental working group is to consider the relationship between PRSI and income tax and their combined impact on the low paid, and to make recommendations.  This is <Col N="1668" /> what Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Ferris have been talking about and it is being considered urgently.  There are very major questions involved and how best to tackle them at the end of the day is a matter which is getting priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty as I am so convinced about the wrongness of the approach here.  The Government are now committed to a substantial review of this area.  Can I have a little more detail about the inter-departmental committee and their terms of reference and the consultations with the unions who are very anxious that this be tackled? Perhaps I can accept this exemption with the reservation that the whole matter is being examined and perhaps there will be some more fundamental proposal next year.  Otherwise I might feel obliged to press this section to a vote because without that understanding I would wish to put a very significant marker here.  It would have been better, if the Government were anxious to deal with this area, to use these funds, if they are aimed at the low paid worker, for increases in exemptions or personal allowances.  Can I hope that next year this will become part of the universal scheme to apply to all low paid workers?  I suppose we all know the situation of the low paid worker in the context of the alleviating arrangements in equality legislation.  They have become a trap, essential as they were, and the Minister's proposal is to extend them by £5 this week.  It is appalling to see women arguing themselves into a lower income situation, as they must because of the consequences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the <Col N="1669" /> Deputy, since she has asked me to explain a little more what is involved, let me say that the Government are concerned at the impact of social insurance and income tax provisions on low paid workers and have established this interdepartmental working group to examine this area. There are various ways in which we can build on the exemption for low paid workers provided for in this Bill.  We could develop the exemption by extending it to other workers or by adapting it to take account of family circumstances. This approach is not without its problems, however, as it could develop a poverty trap for those just above the exemption limit.  This is the trap the Deputy referred to.  Alternatively we could introduce an allowance to be offset against PRSI, but aside from the issue of cost this would benefit high earners in addition to those on low incomes.  We could turn it into an allowance for everyone at the same rate.  It applies to everybody anyway and it is a question of what level to put the allowance at.  It is one possibility.  I raised about ten different alternatives in this area which could be considered.  It involves the Department of Finance as well as ourselves.  The finance involved is quite substantial.  We could introduce an allowance to be offset against PRSI but this would benefit everybody.  A further option would be to introduce a tiered contribution system with those on higher incomes paying proportionately more than those on lower incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these options will have to be examined by the interdepartmental working group to whom I have referred.  As part of their examination it will be necessary to consider not only the effects on take home pay but the effects on the overall administration of the tax and social welfare systems.  It would be necessary to consider the impact on those who must pay for whatever changes are proposed through taxation or otherwise.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the terms of reference are as I have stated, to consider <Col N="1670" /> the relationship between PRSI and income tax and their combined impact on the low paid, and to make recommendations. I believe the terms of reference are broad enough and the systems which will be examined will be very relevant ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the section and I have an amendment down to that effect.  Section 11 is of tremendous importance to The Workers' Party and we are opposing it.  I would like to outline some of my reasons, and then the Minister will probably tell us his ideas. Deputy Ferris referred to pay-related benefit.  Over the years there seems to have been a co-ordinated approach by the Minister to slowly but surely strangle pay-related benefit to death, in other words to do away with it.  It was introduced in 1981.  The provision in this Bill is to raise the amount from £69 to £72. The increase of £3 might seem nominal and it might be argued that it is only keeping pace with inflation, but people who are unfortunate enough to require pay-related benefit through unemployment or otherwise, find a tremendous gap between their former earnings as full-time employees of a company and their payment as recipients of <Col N="1671" /> social welfare on the dole drawing unemployment benefit.  Pay-related benefit was there to cushion families who would be seriously in need of such cushioning as compared with single people.  It was to cushion them after the horror of finding that they were out of a job and having to report that to their family.  At least in the interim &mdash; I believe it is 15 months &mdash; there was a process whereby one's standard of living would slowly deteriorate by virtue of the dropping of benefit to 40 per cent, 30 per cent, 25 per cent and ultimately to 20 per cent before you were a recipient of unemployment benefit. That was an intelligent process and I congratulate whatever Minister brought it in.</P>
      <P>In 1981 a deduction of £14 was made from your weekly earnings.  Last year, for instance, a ceiling of £11,000 was divided by 50 to give the average weekly earnings and the balance divided by 12 per cent which gave the weekly pay-related rate. You held that weekly rate for 15 months and it dropped after some time.  You received 14 per cent up to the 159th day and so on.  Although the upper limit of £11,000, the figure we divide by 50, has not altered in the last three years, the pay-related benefit on that maximum allowable income for benefit would be about £18.12 per week.  It is not a huge sum by anybody's standards and the scheme should have been developed to allow for a bigger sum.  The £11,000 should have been allowed to rise and the pay-related to get smaller which, at the end of the day, would have provided a far greater cushion than before.  We see this as a phasing out process and we are not happy with it.  Instead of phasing out the pay-related benefits we should like to see them reinforced, developed and strengthened to bring about conditions whereby they would act as a more secure cushion for people who are unfortunate enough to be out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay-related benefit, as the Deputy said, is a supplement to disability <Col N="1672" /> benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance and injury benefit and is paid for the maximum period of 15 months.  Benefit is calculated at the rate of 12 per cent of a person's reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year between a floor of £69 and a ceiling of £220 per week.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 11 is to increase the floor or earnings disregard used in calculating pay-related benefit from £69 to £72 per week in the case of new claims arising on or after 9 April 1990.  That is in line with standard practice over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party also consider that the whole concept of the pay-related scheme is being eroded because there is a feeling that if it is continued it will be a disincentive to going back to work.  I do not know any employed person who would regard pay-related as a disincentive to going back to work. Most people with whom we come in contact on a daily basis who are temporarily out of work because of illness look forward to returning to work; they would not allow any social welfare payment to act as a disincentive because people are happier at work.</P>
      <P>This is an excellent scheme which is intended to insulate a person from the trauma of losing a job.  It was a cushion for their family and dependants. However, it is now looked on as being in some way a disincentive, which I do not accept.  There should not be a cut off point at the top for contributions or in relation to benefits.  It should be used for the purpose for which it was originally initiated, a pay-related benefit.  Unfortunately, we seem to have lost that concept.</P>

      <P>We have a long road to travel and we should not be spending too much time on the concept of what is already there.  Conceptual matters in regard to pay-related should perhaps be left for another day when there <Col N="1673" /> will be more time to discuss it.  The section provides for an increase in the allowance and we should not avail of this opportunity to take issue with the concept of pay-related.  We are dealing with facts, we could talk until the cows come home but it will not alter the section.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister will heed some of the points made in the House and perhaps they might alter his opinion.  Presumably, that is why we debate Bills.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question because he said that it has been standard practice over the years and that is how it has been done.  Is the Minister telling me to read between the lines and that I will then realise that he is running the scheme down?  It is being abolished on a yearly basis and the logic of the standard practice is that the scheme is dead.  If the scheme is dead let the Minister say so now rather than having it become a cancerous growth over the next eight or ten years.  That is the sort of honesty I am looking for from the Minister and if he clarified the matter we would know whether we want to push it to a vote.</P>

      <P>The pay-related benefit floor has increased each year since 1981. It is being increased to £72 for new claimants only from next April.  If the relationship between the floor and the flat rate benefit was maintained the floor should now be £120 instead of £72.  Even after raising the floor to £72 in April, therefore, pay-related benefit recipients will be more favourably treated compared with the original design of the scheme in 1974.  What is affecting this is that the flat <Col N="1674" /> rate is being increased.  This was recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and Deputies are now asking me not to adopt this part of their proposals.</P>
      <P>The commission said we should increase the basic flat rate payment and that that was the most important thing because the pay-related benefit could vary.  The fact that we are increasing the basic flat rate payment is the cause of the problem.  We are only changing the rate by the same proportions as it has been changed every year since 1981.  In that sense there is nothing unusual in what is being done here.  I know the Deputy would like to see a greater increase in pay-related benefit and he would also like to see a greater increase in flat rate benefit, but you cannot have it both ways. It costs an awful lot more to increase the flat rate benefit and everybody benefits from it.  It is that increase that is having this effect.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying that the flat rate benefit is being increased and is congratulating himself on the so-called increase, which is somehow making this pay-related benefit scheme out of date and unnecessary, but I do not accept that argument.  What the Minister is trying to indicate is that when a man or woman loses his or her job, there will be only one prospect facing that person and that is that they go onto the flat rate of unemployment benefit.  The cushion is then removed for these families.  That is precisely the opposite concept to what is in the Bill.  I am not happy that we should be facilitating the demise of the pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>The wording of the section gives me power to make the regulations which are essential for the introduction of the lone parent's allowance.  Needless to say I would not have included this very important section if I did not intend introducing the scheme.  As Deputy Flaherty said, I have worked on this scheme for two years and it is totally inconceivable that I would do that and not introduce the scheme.  In amendments Nos. 39 and 55 the Deputy is suggesting that I should include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. Under the provisions of the Bill as initiated the Minister may make regulations in relation to the lone parent's allowance and the carer's allowance schemes.  The purpose of the amendments is to compel the Minister to make such regulations.  The Deputy does not trust the Minister and I find that amusing. Does the Deputy think that I would go to the trouble of preparing such schemes, of getting them through the Government and having the money approved in the budget and not be interested in bringing forward the regulations to give effect to the schemes?  That would not happen.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, a new Member, is very suspicious about everything that takes place in the House.  I hope that in due course he will learn to be less suspicious. We mean what we say and we do our utmost to bring all schemes into operation. I made known on several occasions during the course of the Second Stage debate that I expect the necessary administrative arrangements to facilitate the introduction of these schemes to be in place by October next, and I intend to introduce both schemes from that date.  I should like to remind Deputies that the Social Welfare Act, 1989, contained similar regulatory powers relating to the widowers' non-contributory pension and the deserted husband allowance schemes. Deputy Flaherty referred to them earlier. I undertook during the passage of the 1989 Act to introduce those schemes with effect from October 1989 and as Deputies will be aware, I did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> I do not have any objection in principle to the proposed amendments.  Nevertheless I am disappointed that the Deputy should question my intentions in relation to the introduction of new schemes by proposing amendments designed to compel the Minister to make the necessary regulations.  If I was not so easygoing about such matters I would take umbridge at the Deputy's suggestions. As the person who was responsible for the preparation of these schemes it must be obvious that I intend introducing them.  It is important that the Minister should have flexibility for some of the reasons I outlined earlier.  As I want the Deputy to feel happy about what is taking place in the House and to understand that I am paying attention to what he is saying, I am prepared to adopt his suggestions.  Since it is my intention to introduce both schemes in October I do not propose to oppose the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive response to the amendments. We debated the use of those words in the last Bill before the House.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; appears to be a favoured word of the parliamentary draftsman.  It is contained in a lot of legislation and I have sought on many occasions to change it but without success.  I do not distrust the Minister and I accept that he will introduce the schemes in October.  I have failed so often to have the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; changed that I had given up hope of any Minister making the change.  I compliment the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister to set up the lone parent's allowance scheme.  It will bring a certain dignity and coherence into a whole series <Col N="1679" /> of allowances for persons who are looking after children and families on their own and who up to this were defined by various titles, some of which had a certain stigma attached to them.  The new scheme will remove a lot of discriminatory language.  The circumstances of the people concerned are difficult enough without them having to endure any other traumas.  It highlights the terrible inconsistency of the corresponding benefits.  I know the Minister is well aware that widowers and other separated and deserted husbands have no entitlement to benefit and there is absolutely no justification for that and that it is something that will have to be dealt with and resolved.  Other categories of lone parent of the female variety are excluded while some are included.  There is absolutely no coherence in that area.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate his thinking in relation to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one particular element in this which a number of the organisations representative of welfare organisations have expressed particular concern about, that is section 12, chapter 5A 198D. &mdash; (2) in the context of the disqualifications which the Minister is proposing for persons who may be claiming this benefit.  It may appear entirely logical that if the Minister is establishing a lone parent's allowance that cohabitation as man and wife is a reasonable ground for disqualification. However, deciding whether persons are cohabiting as man and wife involves the most degrading and humiliating searches of their dwellings and residences, checking their bathrooms and bedrooms for evidence of intimacy between any two people.  Along with the issue of the lone parent's allowance, which the Minister indicates he has done a good deal towards resolving, is the provision that somebody who is separated is not required to prove desertion.  That requirement was the main obstacle to people in need of benefit remaining on supplementary welfare for many months. <Col N="1680" /> These groups have asked that this requirement should be examined in the context of looking at how the Department treat people on unemployment assistance where cohabitation does not inevitably mean exclusion from or cutting off of benefit but it does mean reductions in the amount payable, particularly where persons may be marginally disturbed, they may be in a very loose relationship and they may simply be living in the same dwelling with another person. There is undue humiliation not essential to the question of what the Department would be willing to give under other headings in terms of economic support.  I am sure this argument has been made directly to the Minister.  I would like to hear his thinking in relation to it and whether he would be sympathetic to it. Does he see the possibility of movement or change in that area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Flaherty, I welcome this new chapter in the social welfare code of the terminology of &ldquo;lone parent.&rdquo;  It removes some of the stigma that attached to previous payments in these categories and it puts them, at least from the point of view of a description of their status, in the same category, whether they are a widow, a widower, separated, unmarried or whatever.  We even have some divorced people living in this country because their husbands, by virtue of their disappearing to England for five or more years, are initiating divorce cases in England and leaving the spouse at home with no opportunity to contest the divorce case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past number of years we have come an extraordinary way down this road towards accepting that these tragic situations occur.  I am extremely concerned at the restriction on means testing as contained in section 12, Chapter 5A, 198C.&mdash;(2) paragraphs (a) and (b).  We are talking about the same old figures that had been set down in the seventies of amounts exceeding £6 as beginning to have an effect for means purposes.  I tried <Col N="1681" /> to amend those figures and was not successful for obvious reasons, but I am anxious that the Minister would keep this figure in mind.  I have put down parliamentary questions to the Minister requesting that he would update that figure which in today's terms should be of the order of £30.  That would allow people who are separated, unmarried mothers and all those in the lone parent categories an opportunity to go outside the home and to have another small income which, apart from the financial benefit, would have therapeutic value for the person living in traumatic circumstances such as some of those described in the main Chapter.</P>
    <P>There are a group of people in this category who will be means tested because they have no contributions from which to benefit.  I am concerned that discrepancies will arise between those who have contributions, whereby they can receive the allowance by way of benefit, and those who have no contributions and will receive this allowance by way of assistance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issue of cohabiting the Department of Social Welfare are the only Department who apply this notional interpretation of cohabiting.  I know that widows have lost their widow's pension because it was insinuated that they were cohabiting.  I know of couples who are living together who have offspring, who are not married, who have a happy relationship and for the purpose of social welfare the husband who is unfortunate not to have a job is unable to qualify for unemployment assistance even with his dependent children simply because he is reputed to be cohabiting with a common law wife who has a job.  He is means tested although legally he has no access to her income.  There is dependence on the generosity of each side of the union. Whereas nobody wants to stand in moral judgment on people living in these situations, the application of social welfare to people penalises them.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to convince social <Col N="1682" /> welfare officers of legitimate friendships which are outside the sphere of cohabiting. It is almost obscene to have to go into the privacy of one's home to prove it, and to disprove the insinuation is almost impossible.  We are concerned that there are hundreds of anomalies in regard to cohabiting and certainly representations have been made to the Dublin welfare group who do excellent social work and assist the groups at risk.  Representations have been made by the federation of services for unmarried parents and their children.  They have some extensive documentation which compliments the Minister for what he is doing and they hope this is the beginning of the opening up of this whole area which was begun, as I said in my Second Stage contribution, by the late Brendan Corish and ably assisted by the late Frank Cluskey.  Some of these groups were recognised by the State because there was a need for the State to assist them.  The Minister has put all that together in this section and described them all under one heading and I compliment him for that.  However, I am extremely worried about the restriction on means testing which could make it difficult for these people to qualify in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The three areas highlighted by my colleagues both on my right and left are also of concern to me.  I am most concerned about paragraph 198D (2) of section 12 which states:</P>
      <P>A lone parent shall not, if and so long as he and any person are cohabiting as man and wife, be entitled to and shall be disqualified for receiving payment of an allowance.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will outline how he proposes to police the implementation of this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there is no divorce in this country many lone parents whose marriages have broken down should be eligible to receive this payment.  I want to say at this point that The Workers' Party <Col N="1683" /> very much welcome the introduction of a lone parent's allowance.  In fact, we have been arguing for years that there should be such an allowance.  This relates again to the question I raised earlier in regard to the regulations.  It is no accident that three amendments were put down in regard to the regulations.  We were afraid that the Minister would produce regulations on his definition of &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo;. Will the Minister define the term &ldquo;cohabiting as man and wife&rdquo;?  Some people enter into what they believe will be long-term stable relationships which turn out to be short-term relationships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Platonic friendships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I should like to know how the Minister will implement the provisions of this paragraph in those circumstances.  I have no experience, personal or otherwise, of how this provision operated in the past in regard to single parents and unmarried mothers but I have heard enough about the type of policing which goes on to know that it causes great anxiety and fear among single parents and unmarried mothers who are in receipt of benefit.  An inspector from the Department of Social Welfare may allege that people are cohabiting as man and wife when, in fact, it was only a short-term relationship. Single parents or unmarried mothers would lose their benefits in such circumstances. We need to be satisfied that the Minister will adopt an extremely liberal approach to this issue.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the £6 means test.  It is unacceptable that a person should be allowed an income of only £6 per week. When the widow's allowance was introduced in 1975 a person was allowed to have an income of two thirds of the allowance. We would argue that £30 should be the basic starting off point for this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> The Minister and a number of his colleagues referred to the scheme to clawback some payments from the spouse of the beneficiary.  I should like the Minister to explain how he envisages going after a spouse and proving maternity or paternity.  Will blood tests be carried out on such people or will they be dragged through the courts?  In some cases innocent people could be brought before the courts.  This is a very complicated and dangerous area.  I should like the Minister to explain how he proposes to clawback these payments from the spouses of the beneficiaries and to define the cohabitation element.  These are very sensitive areas and I should like the Minister to guarantee that he will bring in regulations dealing with them.  If these two areas are dealt with by way of regulation we will have to see the regulations and have a very serious debate on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies have acknowledged this is a very important section both in its departure and development. I should like to thank the Deputies for the welcome they have given to this section.</P>
      <P>One of the points raised by the Deputies related to the future.  We have taken a major step, with the introduction of the lone parents' allowance, in streamlining the number of schemes for persons with similar needs, that is, lone parents who have the responsibility of looking after one or more children.  Now that the concept of a separate allowance catering for lone parents has been enshrined in the legislation we must go further and ask what additional policy measures we should be considering to meet the changing and diverse needs of that section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obvious need to introduce measures which will maximise opportunities for lone parents to achieve some degree of financial independence.  This is something I am particularly keen on.  We are taking a very major step in what we are doing here now &mdash; it is a very <Col N="1685" /> important step in principle &mdash; but I would certainly like to look at the ways in which we can help people in that situation to get back into the workforce.  These people very often do not realise that measures are available to them at the moment.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Ferris and Deputy Byrne referred to the £6 means test.  This will be £6 for a parent and £6 for each child so that it cannot be less than £12 for a start.  If a person has four children it will be £24 for the children and £6 for the parent, which will make a total of £30 for a start, plus expenses for baby sitting and travelling to work.  These are also provided for and can be brought together under the scheme.  These people may hire somebody to mind their children for £30 or £40 per week.  I am not saying that is what the figure should be &mdash; it happens to be the amount paid by quite a few people I know &mdash; and I do not want to get into an argument about what it should be.  If a person pays £40 to someone to mind his children the reasonable expenditure in that area can be taken into account as well as the £30, which would give a total of £70.  This means that a person can earn £70 plus reasonable travelling expenses to work.  Of course, there would be limitations on these expenses but it means a person could earn £80 per week, hire somebody to mind their children and receive the full payment. The full payment for a person with five chidren will be the basic rate plus the payment for the five children.</P>
    <P>People do not fully appreciate that this will be the position.  I see it from a long-term point of view.  I believe that what we are doing here is very important but I see a danger from a long-term point of view in regard to lone parents, especially young lone parents &mdash; this would apply in particular to young unmarried mothers, a title which will not be used once the Bill is introduced as they will be covered by this scheme.</P>
    <P>Young people in that situation will end up close to poverty.  We may raise the <Col N="1686" /> floor and bring them out of the lowest levels of poverty, but they will never have very much.  That is why we need to provide opportunities for them to get back into the workforce so they can increase their own earning capacity and improve their position for the future.  There is a need to introduce measures which will maximise the opportunities for lone parents to achieve some degree of financial independence.  We are talking about opportunities to improve education, skills and even confidence levels that will facilitate a return to the workforce.  All of these take the time and attention of the Minister and the staff of the Department. In addition there is a need for assistance in finding suitable employment and access to suitable child care facilities at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>Another measure worthy of consideration is the question of continuing some form of payment related to child dependant allowances, rent assistance or other specific needs for a specified period after entering the workforce.  Again all of these have price tags on them and all have to be considered within the contraints of general resources.  These are important questions for consideration in the context of further devloping our services to meet the needs of lone parents in a changing society and give them the opportunity to get back to the fullest possible participation in our society.</P>
    <P>A number of questions have been raised about the sharing of accommodation. We are not alone; the UK operate a similar system with similar criteria. It is interesting that in Australia they use the basis of the <i>domus</i>, in other words, if one is in the house and sharing the house that is it.  That, however, has negative effects on many people.  It is not quite so simple to find a criterion which does not disadvantage other people at the same time.  Many of the systems have criteria like living together as man and wife because one is paying the man and wife on certain bases otherwise.  This <Col N="1687" /> question is touched on by the household survey.</P>
    <P>In relation to the liable relative, which is linked to that, Deputy Byrne spoke about a scheme to claw back payments. This is particularly important.  I do not agree that people can just walk away and leave the taxpayer to pick up the Bill for their dependants.  I do not believe our society should condone that but many people do it and there is evidence that it is normally women on low income who are left with the children without the opportunity of getting back into the workforce or having a decent life at even slightly above the poverty level.  One thing which made me feel very strongly about this was the case of somebody who drove off in a BMW, leaving us with the problem of looking after his wife who had been used to quite a good standard of living.  The husband went off and started another liaison and could not be pursued. The wife got deserted wife's benefit and that gave her a floor from which she could start to operate.  The person in question was self employed and operated various deals and businesses, but the taxpayer was left to look after his family because the wife was not in a position to pursue him after an initial effort.  Even if only a small percentage make a contribution, it is important to introduce this liable relative concept.  That was included in the 1989 Act.  It only needs a commencement order, and we are anxious to get on with that as soon as possible.  The reason this has not been done before now is that we have been doing so much and have decentralised our whole pension office down to Sligo.  However, we are in a position now to pursue that whole issue. In the meantime a working group were set up in the Department to examine the new provisions for the administration in particular of the schemes for deserted spouses and to advise on the most effective ways of implementing the new provision. A detailed report has been completed and is being considered.  It is <Col N="1688" /> expected that it will be soon possible to provide for the coming into force of the liable relative provisions.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for people to be encouraged to get back into the workforce and earn a little so they can get up from the basic payments.  That relates also to maintenance payments which we will have to keep an eye on.</P>
    <P>The lone parent allowance scheme will cover other categories like the separated and divorced, some of whom would have had to go onto supplementary welfare. Deputy Flaherty mentioned Chapter 198D. (2), the question of cohabiting as man and wife.  I will certainly bear in mind the points raised by Deputies in relation to that.  Most of the cases in that area occur following allegations made by people rather than otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  It is getting a little hard at this stage to keep track of either the Minister's or my own thoughts.  I would like to ask whether a particular category of person will be included in the provisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that recently a colleague of mine raised the case of a lady whose husband had an English divorce.  There was a desertion initially and she got the deserted wife's allowance.  There was a death and although she was divorced and the husband was gone she continued to be paid the deserted wife's allowance.  I presume that category of person whose status is fairly grey will be covered in the Bill.  We have the problem since we have not dealt with the issue of divorce and have not dealt with the knowledge that divorces occur.  We have difficulty in including people from other jurisdictions.  Will they be covered?  I welcome the fact that unmarried fathers are being included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the debate in relation to means, I share the view expressed by my colleagues.  The general amendment which was ruled out of order proposes that in all cases the means disregarded <Col N="1689" /> should be raised to £30.  It is absolutely essential that our social welfare system should become more work friendly.  At present the consequence of engaging in employment for as little as £6 is loss of income.  Given that we cannot and do not anticipate being able in the future to offer full-time employment to the many people who would like to have it, we should not penalise them unnecessarily if they can get part-time employment.  Successive Ministers have looked at this matter and left it alone since 1974.  The Minister might indicate the thinking of the mandarins in his Department in relation to the disregarding of £6.  Why was it introduced at all if it was not intended to be relative to the situation in which people find themselves?  Are they thinking of expanding it?  The Minister refers to the existing additional allowances for unmarried mothers where babysitting costs can be taken into account and there is a £6 additional disregard for each child.  This disregard was introduced in 1982.  There has been no substantial improvement since 1982 for that category.</P>
    <P>Those who are most active are pressure groups working on behalf of the persons most at risk in society.  A great need has been identified for them to have greater flexibility.  I know of one case of a separated wife living in Ballymun who has benefits from all the means tests allowed to her.  She is in full-time, reasonably well paid employment but when all her expenses are taken into account she is very poorly off indeed.  Apart from the dignity and closeness to sanity that employment gives her, it is arguable that she would be as well off out of work.  It is a terrible dilemma for people who are trying to help themselves.  It is a problem which should be addressed for this category in particular.  Many lone parents want to work for both social and economic reasons.  It is difficult enough for joint parents to cope with children but the demands on a single parents are very heavy indeed.  The best way to get back into the workforce is through part-time <Col N="1690" /> employment but if the consequence is a pound for pound loss in benefit a person is working solely for social or personal reasons.  It is an urgent issue for this category.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify that the general regulations will be generous, given that they are now to apply to the total group who are being included and that mean testing, will all its inadequacies, will now be applied to this category?  I hope when we look at the regulations in the fine print we will not find an equalising down rather than up.</P>
    <P>I now refer to cohabiting.  It is possible for the Department to look at the income in such a household in the same way as they do where unemployment assistance is involved, not in a particularly intrusive or undignified way.  I have not much direct contact with persons directly affected and I suppose it is not the sort of issue people would talk about fairly freely.  The free legal aid groups and the welfare rights groups say this is a problematic area. Relationships can be temporary and if a person is automatically disqualified when somebody shares a roof, that person may be forced to become a dependant and may be pushed into a relationship which is not in the best interests of those concerned. The Minister might consider altering the rate of allowance for the time of cohabition.  I know it is fraught with difficulties but it is an issue that has been raised extensively and it is worth a sympathetic look.  I welcome the Minister's willingness to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation of additional relief under means testing particularly for deserted fathers.  I know several of them who have to stay at home to look after their children. The information the Minister gave is of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the concept that the deserting spouse should answer to his or her responsibility to the family.  We have insisted that the lone spouse at home should do so and with the restrictions on the free legal aid system such people have <Col N="1691" /> been unable to process proper claims for maintenance under court orders simply because they could not get advice readily through free legal aid because of cutbacks. When the deserting spouse was outside the jurisdiction the deserted person was told that she &mdash; or he &mdash; was not making sufficient effort to trace the spouse and was often forced to live on supplementary welfare.  The Minister has confirmed that within the jurisdiction he will pursue such people as soon as he can bring this commencement order into place.  Has he any hope of pursuing people outside the jurisdiction if they are within the EC jurisdiction?  We have a working relationship with our partners in Europe particularly in the area of social welfare and recorded contributions.  The Minister might have some access to people who have deserted their families and are in England or elsewhere within the EC. Can he follow that through on the basis that it can be done at home here in our own jurisdiction?</P>

      <P>Deputy Joe Sherlock gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter as to the delay in approving the plans which have been submitted for the Patrician Academy in Mallow and the future plans for second level education in that town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1692" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>If the matter was not so urgent we might have waited for the Minister to play around with the issue as she has been doing for some time.  Mallow Urban District Council, who are the local authority concerned, the parents' association of the Patrician Academy, the staff association and the management of the school all regard this as the most urgent matter in the area but it has dragged on for a long time.</P>
      <P>In 1983 development plans were prepared for the reconstruction and extension of the Patrician Academy in Mallow. From 1983 to 1987 the plans went through all stages and in 1988 the scheme was ready to go to tender on the advice that was given at the time and there was no reason to question that.  Contract documents were completed and in 1989 the Minister received a deputation organised by her own party.  An announcement was made to the effect that the issue had been given priority for sanction in 1990.</P>
      <P>The conditions prevailing at the school are by no means conducive to learning. The building itself is dilapidated.  The prefabricateds are totally inadequate and at one time it was agreed that the whole place was a fire hazard.  In 1983 there were 350 students attending the school. By 1989 that figure had increased to 480 and it is likely to increase further as the numbers attending primary school in Mallow have increased and the projections are that they, too, will increase further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the project is £1.3 million and the local community guaranteed their commitment to 10 per cent of that. Out of the Department budget of £18.5 million for capital projects in 1990 surely Mallow is entitled to its fair share after all these years.  Education, particularly of a technical nature, is very important to industrial development.  In this context, it is worth noting that during the week Mitsumi Electric Ltd. of Tokyo, a £500 million company and one of the world's leading producers of electronic components, announced they were to invest <Col N="1693" /> £3.8 million jointly with the IDA in establishing a manufacturing operation in Mallow.  The company will produce keyboard remote control devices and other electronic components for their European customers.  The main point to be made here is that both the Patrician Academy and the Davis College in Mallow are at present conducting courses in applied technology in an effort to meet the growing needs of the area in this field.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the community in Mallow, first to approve the long awaited development of proper and adequate accommodation at the academy and, second, to lay down a policy for future development of second and probably third level education for Mallow and its very large hinterland.</P>

I can only appeal to her to grant the same sort of generosity to the parents, pupils and teachers of the Patrician Academy who at this stage are crying out for long awaited action.  As a past pupil of the academy I feel very concerned about my old school.  I recall that even in my latter days there was talk within the school about major development which it was hoped would come about by the mid-eighties.  Unfortunately, the mid-eighties and the late eighties have come and gone and we still await the development.  I can state without any doubt whatsoever that the conditions in the school are appalling and, as Deputy Sherlock said, are not conducive to learning in the nineties.  At this stage the Minister cannot but be fully aware of the case.  All Deputies from the Cork-east constituency have kept her <Col N="1694" /> fully informed of the situation there over the past number of years.  I appeal to her to act on the matter if at all possible in the very near future.  The time for talk is over.  We need action.  We need a decision by the Minister's Department to allow this badly needed extension to be proceeded with.  I appeal to the Minister to send us home with some good news at this hour of the night.</P>

      <P>I, too, thank the Minister for giving me some of her time.  Let me join the other Deputies in saying that the conditions in the Patrician Academy in Mallow are among the worst I or anybody in my constituency has seen.  I know the Minister is aware of the problems in the school and is looking with favour on the Patrician Academy as she has done in the case of other schools in the area and the constituency.  I am happy at what she has done for those other schools and I hope that in the not too distant future she will do likewise for the school in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have spoken in this debate, Deputies Sherlock, Bradford and Michael Ahern. I am grateful to them for raising the issue and I appreciate their concern about the provision of proper post-primary facilities in Mallow.  I am only saying what people know already, but there are three post-primary schools in the area.  Two of the schools have had considerable capital expended on them and naturally the third school feels it should get the same treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having met a broadly based group last year I am aware that conditions in the school are far from ideal and I am conscious of the need for an early amelioration of those conditions.  In common with all the second level school building projects in planning, the one for the Patrician Academy is currently being reviewed in the context of pupil enrolment for the short and the long term. <Col N="1695" /> Discussions on this matter were held quite recently with the school authorities.</P>
    <P>As soon as the demographic review is completed a decision will be taken on the best course of action in regard to the proposed extension.  In this way we will ensure that the interests of Mallow and the Department of Education are best served.  Mallow will be provided with such additional post-primary facilities as are necessary and my Department will get value for money in respect of their investment in any future project.</P>
    <P>I hope to meet a broadly based, representative deputation within the next two weeks to go through the issues which I have discussed here.  For many years we thought that the numbers of children coming to school would continue to rise but this is not now the case.  We have done a demographic review on a catchment by catchment area and the results are quite startling.  I certainly do not intend to be hauled before a watchdog committee to be told that my Department are building schools for non-existent pupils.  I want to make it clear that I am talking in general terms and not in relation to Mallow.  We must look at every capital project in the light of what happened in the last five or six years in relation to births decreasing. In that context, we are examining every planned second level unit throughout the country.  By the time I meet the deputation I hope that the review to which I referred will have been completed and that we will have a clear picture of the facilities needed for post-primary schools in the short, medium and long term in Mallow.  I am aware of the conditions in that school, which are far from favourable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday, 27 March, at about 2.30 p.m. when making my way to Dáil Éireann, I stopped at the military checkpoint at Aughnacloy, which is customary. When I was temporarily parked <Col N="1696" /> there waiting to be called to the central position to identify myself and get clearance, a soldier walked out of the turret which is about 12 yards from the main building and from where the soldier observed approaching traffic.  He trained a high velocity rifle at me to read &mdash; as I was told later &mdash; the number plate of my car with the telescopic sights on his rifle. It was a most frightening experience although I was almost 100 per cent certain that he did not intend to shoot me.</P>
      <P>When I was called forward a few minutes later I asked the soldier in the central position to get the officer in charge because I wanted to make a formal protest.  He asked me what my protest concerned and I told him that the soldier a few yards back had pointed a rifle at me and had caused me to experience great fear.  The soldier explained that this was normal practice.  I imagine he thought I was Brit-bashing but I immediately put the soldier at ease and identified myself as the Deputy who went across the Border to lay a wreath for eight young British soldiers &mdash; they were teenage boys rather than soldiers &mdash; who had been brutally murdered by IRA violence. My credentials were impeccable.  A constable identified me and I than questioned the correctness of using telescopic sights to read the number plate of a car. They defended the practice and said that they did it all the time.  I suggested that it had been a most frightening experience and that binoculars should be used instead.  It is not an excuse to say that someone has to read a number plate from a distance of 12 yards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened was wrong and that is why I am bringing it to the attention of the House.  It is indefensible that any soldier should raise a rifle and point it in any direction.  In the conversation I had with the military personnel I realised that this is normal practice and I immediately exonerated the soldier who pointed the rifle at me.  I told him I had nothing personal against him but that I certainly had a strong objection to the principle <Col N="1697" /> and the practice of using telescopic sights as binoculars.</P>
    <P>I know that the rifle was loaded and that soldiers have accidentally shot people.  A friend of our family, Mary Doherty from Strabane, was accidentally shot when a bullet was discharged by a soldier cleaning his rifle.  She was in the back seat of a car at the time.  At the same check-point a young boy was shot dead by accident.  It was a dreadful experience but I do not want this to go down as Brit-bashing because that is not my style in public life.  I made inquiries of people in Belfast and all round the Border and it appears that it is a common thing for soldiers to train rifles at people. I am bringing it to the attention of the House, the Government and the Secretariat to ensure that the British authorities cease this practice.</P>
    <P>The soldiers who man the posts along the Border are young boys who come there to be trained in urban guerilla warfare. The posts are being used by the British Government &mdash; as Northern Ireland is being used by them &mdash; to train soldiers.  Most of them are there for a term of duty and then sent home.  The young soldiers are inexperienced and I do not use this occasion to criticise them. They are doing the job they have been trained to do.  I take grave exception to a soldier pointing a rifle at me and, as someone in public life, if I did not take a stand on this and publicly protest I would be failing in my duty.</P>
    <P>For that reason, a Cheann Comhairle, I sought your advice on the matter.  I spoke to the leader of the party and I concluded that the right thing in the circumstances was to discuss it on the Adjournment.  I ask the Minister to bring it officially to the attention of the Government who, in turn, should bring it to the attention of the British Government so that soldiers operating in Northern Ireland will not use telescopic sights to identify people on the street, to read vehicle number plates at checkpoints or <Col N="1698" /> for any purpose whatever.  If identification is the reason they look through the telescopic lens of their rifles then they should be supplied with binoculars.  Rifles are for killing people and I am frightened of them.  If there is a minute left, Deputy McGinley would like to use it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support my colleague from Donegal, Deputy Harte, in what he has said.  I have experience of coming through that post very often, almost on a weekly basis.  While I did not have any experience such as Deputy Harte had yesterday morning, we are all aware of a number of serious and indeed fatal incidents that occurred at that place down through the years.  It was only last year or the year before that a young man who was going through that checkpoint on his way to a football match on the Monaghan side of the Border was one of the fatalities of the troubles in that part of our country.  We are told his death was accidental.  I would certainly feel very uneasy and uncomfortable if I was looking down the barrel of a rifle with a telescopic lens.  I support Deputy Harte in what he has said and I would ask the Minister to bring this to the attention of the authorities in the North and of the Secretariat to make sure that this practice will not continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Harte bringing to the attention of the House his experience of Aughnacloy yesterday. Having a weapon pointed in one's direction is clearly a most disconcerting experience and I fully understand the anxiety which it has caused the Deputy.  The reason he raised it here is perfectly understandable. The Government are obviously also deeply conscious that an innocent civilian was tragically killed at this same Border crossing some two years ago in circumstances which gave rise to deep and widespread disquiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are very concerned <Col N="1699" /> at the practice by members of the British Army of, as Deputy Harte said, on occasion using the telescope on their rifles as, in effect, binoculars.  Our concern on this matter has been expressed on a number of occasions to the British authorities in recent times.  We believe it is inappropriate to use telescopic sights in the manner complained of by the Deputy because of the obvious concerns for safety that arises and also because the practice is one which most people would understandably find very intimidating.</P>
    <P>If a member of a British Army patrol needs to be able to see at some distance, then the patrol should be issued with a set of binoculars for this purpose.  It is unacceptable that people should have soldiers pointing lethal weapons at them in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>On receiving the Deputy's report of this incident this afternoon, the matter was raised immediately in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and the Government's concern was conveyed in full terms to the British authorities.  The British authorities have responded to our representations on this matter this evening and have told us that their standing instruction is that telescopic sights are to be used for surveillance purposes as an absolute minimum, and that when weapons are used in this manner, they should not be ready for action.  We have made it clear that no matter how well intentioned such guidelines may be, they fail to adequately address the problem. We have also expressed the view <Col N="1700" /> that the use of telescopic sights at short range, as was experienced by Deputy Harte yesterday, is not easily reconciled with their use only as an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>The reality is that any reasonable person will naturally be very frightened when they see a soldier pointing a weapon at them and will rightly feel that they may be in a life-threatening situation. We have pressed the British authorities strongly on this point and have emphasised the possible potential for serious, if not fatal, accidents arising from this practice.  Where unnecessary risks to the public are identified &mdash; and we believe that the use of telescopic sights for surveillance at Border crossings could be one such risk &mdash; it is vital that they be examined in a most critical way and steps taken to remove them.  We have emphasised that we can see no reason why binoculars cannot be used in these circumstances and that such basic equipment should, if required, be available at Aughnacloy and other permanent Border posts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy bringing this matter to the attention of the House and I can assure him and Deputy McGinley that the views they have expressed here will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the matter pursued vigorously through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.</P>

      <P>The main potential for the development of our indigenous energy resources lies in the areas of peat and natural gas.</P>
      <P>The Kinsale Head gas field contributes up to 17 per cent of primary energy requirements.  BGE are laying emphasis on the supply to residential markets where the resource can be put to optimal use.

The recent decisions by the board on the restructuring and divisionalisation of the company are part of these developments.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that the Turf Development Bill, 1988, which has currently reached Report Stage in this House, will greatly increase the flexibility of Bord na Móna in the carrying out of their functions and will provide a suitable basis for the future development of our peat resources.</P>

The proposals were subsequently modified allowing for continued operations at Allenwood until the end of the decade.  The ESB now plan to keep the plant available until 31 March 1991.  The planned run-down and relocation of staff is in progress.  Unfortunately, the economics of any further delay in the planned closure date would be prohibitive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 75 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The existence of a problem of high radon levels in parts of Ireland was first brought to my Department's attention by the Nuclear Energy Board in 1988 following studies done by Dr. Jim McLaughlin of UCD.  Dr. McLaughlin's survey indicated that approximately 2 per cent of Irish homes may have excessive radon levels.</P>
      <P>It is only in recent years that the problem of high radon levels in homes has been identified, and research into the problem is at a very early stage.  In order to decide on the approach to the problem in the Irish context, representatives of the Departments of Energy, Health and the Environment met with the NEB and Dr. McLaughlin on a number of occasions in 1988-89.</P>
      <P>The first step in dealing with radon is the identification of the extent of the problem.  The Government allocated an extra £60,000 in 1990 to the NEB for this purpose.  The NEB in 1989 commenced surveys of 550 houses in Clare, Galway and Mayo.  The preliminary results of these surveys confirm Dr. McLaughlin's results.  Where houses are found to have higher than average radon levels, the NEB have recommended continued monitoring.  I am informed by the board that the accurate measurement of the accumulation of radon is a lengthy process, and can take up to a year because of seasonal variations.  The NEB now propose to extend surveys to other areas which may be affected and also to commence a survey of schools in consultation with the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board, having examined all of the evidence available to them, conveyed to my Department a recommendation of a reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre.  The <Col N="1481" /> Government accepted this recommendation on the basis that Ireland should adopt the highest possible radiation protection standards.  The Government are satisfied that this level is an achievable target which will minimise risks.</P>
    <P>In the small number of cases where levels of radon are confirmed to be in excess of 200 becquerels per cubic metre, remedial action will be recommended. The Minister for the Environment will be responsible for preparing and disseminating technical guidance to householders and builders regarding the treatment of radon problems in affected areas in existing and new dwellings. Other Government Departments, notably Health, Education and Labour are to consult with the NEB about buildings under their aegis and the drawing up of appropriate remedial measures.</P>

A number of other incentives to promote afforestation are currently under negotiation with the European Commission in the context of an operational programme for forestry under the National Development Plan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 77 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> The most recent figures available for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power stations relate to the end of 1988 in which 71,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 41,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxides were emitted.  In 1980, the corresponding figures were 99,000 tonnes and 28,000 tonnes respectively.</P>
    <P>Under an EC Environment Directive, the principal requirement for the ESB is that by 1993 and onwards overall emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides should be kept within ceilings of 124,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes, respectively.  The Government have decided, however, that in addition Ireland will accede to the Helsinki Protocol whereby national sulphur dioxide emissions, both from industry and power stations, will be cut by 30 per cent by 1993 based on 1980 levels.  It has also been decided to sign the Sofia Protocol in which Ireland's overall emissions of nitrogen oxides by 1994 will be stabilised at 1987 levels.</P>
    <P>No restrictions have been placed on the specification of the coal being burnt at Moneypoint but, arising from the Government's decision to accede to the Helsinki Protocol, certain steps will have to be taken by the ESB which will involve the use of low sulphur coal at Moneypoint. Other steps which will be taken separately or in combination with the above include the continued use of natural gas by the ESB and, if necessary, the installation of desulphurisation equipment at power stations.</P>

      <P>Detailed information about radon levels is a matter for the Nuclear Energy Board and the Deputy should, therefore, approach the board on this matter.  In general, the majority of houses in Ireland, including those in Mayo, do not have significant radon levels.  The board have informed me that in those counties in which the board have been carrying out surveys, Galway, Clare and Mayo, approximately 9.4 per cent of houses have been found to have radon levels in excess of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. These are not final results, because it is necessary to measure radon levels over a long period &mdash; up to a year &mdash; in order to get accurate figures.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Government recently decided on a reference level for radon in houses of 200 becquerels per cubic metre.  Householders whose homes, following full measurement, are found to have indoor radon levels in excess of 200 BCM will be advised to take steps to reduce the radon level as much as possible below the reference level.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has responsibility for publishing and disseminating information on appropriate remedial action.</P>

      <P>Managers within State and semi-State organisations have the primary responsibility to effect cost cutting measures including energy conservation measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a comprehensive review of my Department's energy conservation programme completed in 1989 new programmes earmarked for specific sectors were introduced.  This included a programme aimed specifically at the public <Col N="1487" /> sector.  Eolas, who administer much of my Department's conservation programme, had commenced energy audits of their own premises and those of my Department in 1989.  Recently Eolas have commenced a similar audit of the Government buildings complex, including the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The objective is to identify and rectify energy inefficiencies in the buildings concerned. It is intended to replicate the results whereby the managers of other State and semi-State bodies will be encouraged by the benefits demonstrated to introduce appropriate energy efficient manangement.</P>

      <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1988 allows ESB to set up and engage in subsidiary companies and embark on a wide range of new activities through wholly owned or joint venture companies. This enables the ESB to employ its extensive management and technological expertise in the development of profitable subsidiary companies to <Col N="1488" /> exploit commercial opportunities which arise outside of its core business of electricity generation.  The ESB is now active in consultancy services throughout the world, fish farming in Ireland and financial services at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>With regard to the performance of the subsidiary companies, the indications are that these activities are doing well, given that they are, in the main, start-up businesses and that 1989 was their first full year of operations.</P>

      <P>The question of tax harmonisation on oil products is, primarily, a fiscal matter which is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I understand that the most recent Commission proposals have only very recently been received by the Department of Finance and discussions on the whole question of tax harmonisation are progressing.  I understand that this subject was discussed but not resolved at a recent meeting of EC Finance Ministers.  The matter will be discussed again at future such meetings.  It is not possible to say at this stage whether and on what products there would be a change up or down in the prices, due to any tax rate change.  Different oil products have a different price elasticity.  I have not at this stage attempted anything more than a broad assessment of the possible form of EC harmonisation but my Department will keep in regular contact with the Department of Finance as the situation unfolds.</P>
      <P>I must stress, however, the very preliminary nature of EC deliberations at present and no definitive conclusions or assessments should be made on the basis of the initial proposals.</P>

      <P>Since the case first came to my attention I have been actively monitoring the situation with the assistance of the Irish Honorary Consul General at Manila.  The latter has, in turn, been in continuous contact with the accused man's attorney and the Columban Fathers in the area and has submitted a number of reports on developments as they occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding of the present position is that the prosecuting and <Col N="1495" /> defence attorneys have made written submissions to the Philippine Commission on Immigration and Deportation.  The Commission is currently studying these submissions but has made no decision yet on whether to proceed with the case or to drop the charges.</P>
    <P>I raised the case of this citizen with the Philippine Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of the EC-Asean meeting which took place in Kuching in February, 1990.  I stated that the Irish Government was very concerned regarding the matter.  My concern was noted by the Philippine Minister.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will continue to take personal interest in this case until it has been satisfactorily resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin-Belfast gas pipeline project was discontinued in 1984 following the withdrawal of the British Government from the project.  Subsequently, the EC Commission in December 1987 approved the Special Border Areas Programme 1986-1990 which was a special Community regional development measure to improve the economic and social situation of the Border areas.  The amount of ERDF aid made available under the programme was about £24.8 million.  Of this £11.7 million was to be devoted to the provision of a natural gas pipeline from Dublin to Dundalk, County Louth; a further £5 million aid was held in reserve to cover the extension of the gas supply westward if more detailed viability studies indicated that this was economically justified.  The remaining £8.1 million in aid was devoted to measures for tourism; these included promotional activities &mdash; £0.6 million &mdash; amenities and infrastructure £4.5 million <Col N="1497" /> and the improvement of minor roads giving direct access from primary routes to tourist centres, including signposting, £3 million.</P>
      <P>The programme provided that any part of the £5 million reserve for the western extension of the pipeline not used for that purpose would be re-allocated to finance measures under the tourism-based part of the programme.</P>
      <P>The viability of the western extension of the pipeline is still being considered by the steering committee for the programme and the responsible agencies, and a decision on whether to proceed with the western extention or to reallocate aid to measures under the tourism based part of the programme will be made in the light of that examination. A decision on this matter is expected to be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The development of the Irish beef exports to Japan is restricted by the lack of EC refunds and a complicated import quota system.  CBF promotional activities in Japan accordingly concentrates on increasing exports of pigmeat and they include provision of market information to Irish industry, production of a Japanese video and brochure and regular meetings with the Japanese trade.  CBF have launched a marketing campaign to attract a high level Japanese delegation to the 12 CBF International Meat Symposium in Killarney in May. These activities will assist direct promotion of Irish beef should trading conditions improve.</P>

    <P>Special signing arrangements exist for persons of no fixed abode throughout the country, all of whom are required to <Col N="1509" /> attend at their local office at the same time every week: Thursday mornings between 11.30 and 12.  This arrangement, which was established in 1981, applies to all persons of no fixed abode, who are mainly from the travelling community.  It is not normally applicable in the case of travellers who are known to have settled and have permanent addresses.</P>
    <P>There has been no change in these administrative arrangements.  However, following a recent meeting with the monitoring committee for travelling people, my Department has undertaken a review of travellers applicants who attend at the Gardiner St. and Werburgh St. employment exchanges to identify settled travellers with permanent addresses with a view to intergrating them into the normal signing arrangements generally applied to persons with fixed addresses.  Sixty-seven such cases have been identified and their signing arrangements are being changed from the beginning of April.</P>

      <P>It is the practice of Ministers for Justice not to make statements to the House in relation to specific Garda investigations unless there are circumstances which are deemed to be sufficiently exceptional to warrant a departure from this practice.  I do not consider that such a departure is warranted in the case in question.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of (a) the support services available to victims of crime from statutory agencies and from voluntary agencies in Dublin city and (b) the level of State funding devoted to these respective services; his views on whether these services are adequately funded at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I can answer the Deputy's question only in relation to agencies under the aegis of my Department or agencies in receipt of State funding through my Department. There are two such agencies which provide support services to victims of crime. These are the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal and the Irish Association for Victim Support.  The operations of these agencies are not confined to Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal which was set up under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted, may pay <i>ex <Col N="1518" /> gratia</i> compensation in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  Copies of the scheme are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The Irish Association for Victim Support is a voluntary organisation which is grant aided by my Department.  The main purpose of the association which was formally established in 1985, is to provide non-financial support and practical assistance to individuals and families who have experienced distress, loss or inconvenience as a result of crime.  The level of State funding provided in the 1990 Estimates in each case is as follows: £2 million &mdash; Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted; £8,000 &mdash; Irish Association for Victim Support.</P>
    <P>The amount to be provided for any service in the Estimates for any year is decided on the basis of the requirements of the particular services, the competing demands for other services and the overall budgetary position.</P>

There was no discussion of bilateral issues on either occasion.  Nuclear safety matters are, in any event, primarily a matter for the Minister of Energy and there are well established arrangements under which such matters are raised, as and when appropriate, by that Minister with the responsible UK authorites.  Without prejudice to these arrangements, it is, of course, appropriate that the Minister for the Environment should state Government policy on the Sellafield issue in any relevant international forum where he is representing Ireland.</P>

      <P>A publicity campaign to inform the general public of the provisions of the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Regulations, 1990, has already commenced. The campaign will inform the public of the restrictions and prohibition on smoking in designated areas and facilities and will also target the relevant authorities who control such places to ensure compliance with the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My announcement earlier this month <Col N="1525" /> of the effective date, May, of the restrictions and prohibition of smoking in public places generated widespread publicity and served as an introduction to the media campaign planned for April.  The media campaign involves the use of outdoor poster sites nationally and national newspaper coverage over a three week period.  The widespread distribution of an information pamphlet outlining the main provision of the regulations is already underway.  In addition, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department will be distributing information to the various health agencies, public bodies and to the relevant trade, educational, sporting and entertainment interests covered by the regulations to appraise them of the new requirements.</P>
    <P>The restriction on smoking in public places is an important part of my anti-smoking strategy and I am confident that the new provisions will be generally adhered to.</P>

      <P>The Food Hygiene (Amendment) Regulations, 1989, (S.I. No. 62 of 1989) introduced stringent controls on the transport of foods in food vehicles and several of the provisions relate specifically to the handling and transport of meat.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>Tenders for the proposed extension to the National School in Co. Wexford referred to have been forwarded by the school authorities to my Department and have been examined.  A number of points in relation to the project had to be clarified and these were fully discussed with the school authorities and their consultants at a meeting in my Department last week.  I am not in a position, at this stage, to say when building works will commence.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to disclose details of a VEC's allocation of teaching staff, as requested, as these matters are confidential between the VEC and my Department.</P>
      <P>The question of the utilisation of VEC's teacher allocation under the various subject headings is a matter for the Chief Executive Officer and the committee in consultation with the principal teachers in the different schools within the scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department has, in the past few days, received from County Kildare VEC an appeal against its teacher allocation for the current school session, 1989-90, and this appeal is currently under consideration by my Department.</P>
