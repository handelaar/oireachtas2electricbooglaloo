      <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon &mdash; the Arts Council &mdash; provide financial assistance to individuals and organisations involved in any of the art forms defined in the Arts Acts, 1951 and 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The percentage breakdown in 1989 of the council's arts grants expenditure was as follows: organisations and individuals based in Dublin and whose operations are almost exclusively confined to Dublin city and county &mdash; 41 per cent; organisations based in Dublin city and county and whose operations extend throughout the country as well as Dublin &mdash; 27 per cent; organisations based in Dublin and whose operations are almost entirely outside Dublin &mdash; 5 per cent; and organisations and individuals whose base and <Col N="2210" /> operations are outside Dublin &mdash; 27 per cent.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the Arts Council enjoy statutory independence in the disbursement of their funds.  I have facilitated the work of the council by increasing their level of funding from £5.9 million in 1986 to £8.1 million in 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for giving me that information.  Would the Taoiseach accept that, in terms of arts funding, we now have a first world and a third world, the first being in Dublin where they get the lion's share of funding and the third world being the provinces where they get only a pittance?  In Cork, for instance, the Opera House has had no subvention from the Arts Council for three years in a row.  The Irish National Ballet was killed off by the Arts Council, and I am told in my investigations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told, in terms of statistics that the county of Carlow got no funding from the Arts Council.  Does the Taoiseach in his capacity as Taoiseach and Minister for the Arts accept there is no spark of cultural or artistic life in the county of Carlow that is worthy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember recently going down to Carlow to open the Éigse, which is a very lively poetic function in Carlow.  The Deputy understands that the Arts Council have statutory independence in these matters.  If the Deputy studies the figures I have given she will not find them all that disproportionate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2211" /> Admittedly, in relation to organisations and individuals based in Dublin and whose operations are almost exclusively confined to Dublin city and county, the allocation is 41 per cent but thereafter the grants could be regarded as benefiting the whole country.  In relation to Cork, I am informed that the Arts Council have been pursuing a policy of partnership with local authorities to varying degrees over the years, and that they are particularly anxious to develop the relationship with Cork Corporation to ensure a planned development of the arts in Cork. They have, in conjunction with Cork Corporation, established a working party for the preparation of an arts development plan.  I can only suggest that I will convey the Deputy's comments to the Arts Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept, having told me that 27 per cent of arts council funding goes to touring groups based in Dublin, that these whistle-stop tours of the country have done little to revitalise the arts in the provinces and are little more than an expression of cultural imperialism from Dublin, and that they are not the best way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On 21 June next a stamp commemorating the centenary of the birth of General Michael Collins will be issued as part of the Statesmen of Ireland series.</P>
      <P>There are no plans for a specific ceremony to commemorate the centenary of the birth of General Collins.  Following the recommendations of the all-party Oireachtas committee which was set up to consider the question of holding a single National Day of Commemoration, the Government decided in 1986 that a National Day of Commemoration would be held on the Sunday nearest 11 July each year to honour all those Irishmen and Irishwomen who died in past wars or on service with the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Tá sé i gceist agam Ceisteanna 3 agus 5 a ghlacadh le chéile.</P>
      <P>As I said in my statement last Friday I have, following agreement in principle to my proposal, now invited my colleagues, the heads of State or Government of the other member states of the European Community, to an informal summit meeting in Dublin in April.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the meeting will be to enable EC leaders to take a collective view of the evolving situation in central and Eastern Europe and its implications for the European Community, with particular reference to the progress towards German unification.  In preparation for this, I have accepted an invitation from Chancellor Kohl for discussions with him in Bonn on 28 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was obviously tabled before the Taoiseach made an announcement last Friday.  Nevertheless I thank him for his reply.  This is an extremely important meeting for this country &mdash; indeed for the whole European Community &mdash; and the Taoiseach should put aside any sense of resentment he might feel about people upstaging him in the Community.  He should consider the European Community as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of that.  In so far as there was any little <Col N="2214" /> frisson, it was a question of the respective competence of the Presidency and the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach intends to visit Chancellor Kohl and in view of the critical importance that East Germany will have in relation to the rest of Europe, will he indicate whether he has any plans to consult Prime Minister Modrow on a bilateral basis in advance of the April Summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any such plans at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to intrude on what clearly must be handled diplomatically. However, will the Taoiseach agree that, in his capacity as President of the European Community and because of the need to maintain objectivity and balance, some form of consultation on a bilateral basis between the Presidency and the East German authorities could only improve the outcome of the summit in April?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep that in mind but the Deputy will be aware of the fact that there will be an election in Germany on 18 March and it would be as well to wait until after that to take any further decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>After the meeting in April will it be possible to have a debate in this House on the question of German reunification and the effect on the European Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not thought about that but it is very likely, following the usual precedent, that I will be reporting to the House after the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point before that that procedure does not allow most of us to participate as only three or four Members are allowed to make statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the contrast between what the European Community is undertaking in relation to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and &mdash; one hopes &mdash; Romania on the one hand and East Germany on the other?  Does the Taoiseach think that there is any danger for the European Community in the situation which has now come about where the Federal Republic of Germany is now assisting East Germany whereas the European Community is assisting the other countries?  Does the Taoiseach think there is any danger in that for the future cohesion of the Community?  How will the action of the Community in Eastern Europe be regarded by the other countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not use the word &ldquo;danger&rdquo; but the Deputy must be aware, like everybody else, that the whole question of German unification has major implications of all kinds for the Community and that it has to be very carefully handled, as I am sure it will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <P>In respect of Question No. 6, owing to a printing error I have to advise the House of the following.  The question by Deputy Peter Barry addressed to the Taoiseach should have appeared as Question No. 6 on today's Order Paper: &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach when it is proposed to set up a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.&rdquo;  Question No. 6 on the Order Paper, in the name of Deputy Deasy, <Col N="2216" /> should not have appeared on the Order Paper as it was transferred by the Taoiseach to the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Deasy was informed of the transfer.  This is essentially a printer's error.</P>

Does the Taoiseach not think it is ridiculous that this House is not in a position to debate these issues at a committee and to give guidance to the House and opinions to the Government on these matters?  Will the Taoiseach agree that it is nonsensical for him to say exactly the same thing today that he said in April 1987 and at regular intervals since?

      <P>The Taoiseach does not even have the gumption to check his statement because he knows he is acting the barrack room lawyer in saying that. Will the Taoiseach accept that this House is alone among the parliaments of the European Community in not having a foreign affairs committee and in not having a framework within which issues of foreign policy can be debated in this House?  Does the Taoiseach not think it ridiculous that the Government should give in to the hegemony of officials in this <Col N="2218" /> affair and leave all of this completely outside the scope of this House?  Can the Taoiseach not take his courage in his hands for once and make a simple decision to come forward with the terms of reference for a committee on foreign affairs?

      <P>I agree with the comments made by Deputy Dukes that the answer given by the Taoiseach was given on at least 15 occasions since May 1987.  Is it a fact that the Taoiseach will not appoint a foreign affairs committee of the House and that he does not want opinions from other Members in relation to foreign policy?  If that is the position, why is it that the Taoiseach does not have the courage to stand up and say so?</P>

      <P>I am not being churlish when I say that what the Taoiseach has said sounds generous but it is not.  Statements by Members are not the same as a full debate in the House and the procedure of a debate in the House is not the same as having a committee on foreign affairs.  The latter would discuss in detail specific topics like those referred to by Deputies Dukes and Spring.  A whole range of areas needs to be teased out so that the Minister of the day can have the view of a representative body of the House about matters of foreign policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on that occasion <Col N="2225" /> and on a number of other occasions since that it will be difficult to negotiate another programme.  In autumn 1987 there were many difficulties &mdash; financial and employment difficulties &mdash; and there was a willingness on the part of social partners to try to come to an agreement to get the country out of the economic difficulties.  Now the position is different. There is good growth in the economy; employment, though slowly, is increasing and unemployment is decreasing.  Investment is quite high and there are many opportunities from which many people wish to reap the benefits.  The aspirations of our people are far higher than they were in the autumn of 1987.  In relation to the question posed by the Deputy I believe that any new programme for national recovery should cover far more than the 1987-90 agreement covered.</P>
      <P>It should cover macro-economic policy far more than the other agreement. Greater social equity and social progress were not dealt with to any great extent in the last programme, though what was provided for in that programme was delivered.  Employment and tax reform were dealt with but employment would have to be dealt with to a greater extent now. Perhaps in different ways and to different degrees than its predecessor, it should also extend to some other areas of social and economic policy.  Probably, the discussions will not start for some months yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would agree with the Deputy.  The National Economic and Social Council have already been requested to start working on the basis of further studies.  The original <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was based on the 1986 NESC report and on the jobs crisis Congress of Trade Unions' document. <Col N="2226" /> Further NESC studies on how they see the 1991-94 period would be extremely helpful and will form the basis for a further programme for national recovery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the period 1991-94 that NESC are examining?  In that context are they looking at the projections for income tax, social insurance and how pay inter-relates with social welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They have already started work on the papers and they are bringing forward papers covering more or less the areas I have mentioned.  These areas will form the basis for a further programme for national recovery.  Taxation, social welfare policy, unemployment policy and social aspects are the key areas of study for the programme.</P>

    <P>In his address to the CII North Dublin regional conference last week, the direc-tor-general of the CII estimated that net <Col N="2227" /> job creation in the private business sector was 34,000 during the two years to April 1989.  This figure corresponds very closely to official estimates, derived from the 1989 Labour Force Survey results, showing an increase of 35,000 in non-farm private sector employment over the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is something wrong with the arithmetic because, despite all the claims about job creation &mdash; whether they come from the employers' organisations or from members of the Government &mdash; the Central Statistics Office report shows that there were 1,000 fewer people at work in 1989 than there were in 1988?  We know also from the Central Statistics Office that 46,000 people emigrated in the year to April 1989 and that there is a need for some sort of reconciliation of the figures, claims and coun-ter-claims in order to find out what is really happening on the employment front in the knowledge that not enough is happening?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Force Survey provided the official estimate available on net job creation in the private sector during 1989.  The Labour Force Survey showed a net increase of 10,000 jobs in total employment between April 1987 and April 1989.  On those figures &mdash; and this has been generally agreed &mdash; one has to make allowances for a decline of 20,000 jobs in public sector employment over the same period.  There was a progressive decline in the numbers working in agriculture and a lower intake from schemes.  Net job creation in non-farm private sector employment seems to be of the order of 35,000 based on the Labour Force Survey.  That has been agreed by a number of bodies.  One could also look at other official figures which show that long-term unemployment up to April 1989 fell by 6,500, a fairly small number.  I have not taken into account in any of the estimates or discussions unofficial surveys because, quite frankly, it depends on who is surveyed and I do not think they could be taken as reliable. <Col N="2228" /> On the official survey the facts have to be taken into account, that is there has been an increase of 60,000 jobs in the last two years and the unemployment register has declined by about 25,000 and the long-term unemployment figure fell by 6,500.</P>

Would he not also admit that he was wrong in the figures he claimed for the reduction in the unemployment register when he said it was reduced by 25,000 in the past two years when the unemployment register is down by 11,000, only one-quarter of the number who emigrated in the past two years?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provide an annual grant to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions towards the cost of running their education, training and advisory service. A provision of £701,000 has been included in my Department's Estimates for 1990.  The ICTU and individual trade unions also receive financial support from the trade union training support scheme administered by FÁS for particular training courses which they organise.  In addition my Department subvent the National College of Industrial Relations in respect of their industrial relations courses, which are availed of by many trade union officials.

Given the very peaceful state of industrial relations at present, which we cannot assume will continue forever, would he not accept that it should be a priority of industrial relations policy to ensure that there is proper training in education for trade union officials, shop stewards, etc, so that they can understand the economic context in which they are negotiating and the implications of those negotiations?</P>

      <P>I could not disagree with anything the Deputy has said.  It is for that reason I have sought in the last three budgets and in the Estimates to increase the amount of money available in that area even though the amount available for other areas was being cut back quite substantially.  There is always a need for more improvements and I would not be against trying to do this. Apart from the £700,000 provided directly by the Department, a number of schemes, including the technical assistance grants administered by FAS are designed to promote efficiency in manufacturing industry and distribution and grants are paid towards the cost of training trade union officials and representatives, particularly in the area of productivity, technique and procedures.  The amount of money allocated this year for the trade union support scheme is £390,000, which is in addition to the £700,000.  I agree this is an area that should be looked at each year because under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act passed last year we look to the trade union movement for their help and co-operation in making that Act effective.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if he will extend the remit of DÍON to include the provision of funding for hostel accommodation in view of the alarming number of homeless Irish in London according to recent surveys.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Homelessness is a major problem in London, both among the unemployed and, in some cases, those in low paid employment.  I should stress, however, that the vast majority in those categories are not Irish people.</P>
      <P>The problem of homelessness among Irish emigrants to Britain is of particular concern to me.  For that reason, I went and saw for myself, at first hand, what the situation was like in London.  On the basis of that experience, my advice to any young person contemplating going to London is clear and simple, as it has been over the last three years: if you do not have accommodation and a job fixed up in advance, do not go.  This is a central element in the FÁS pre-emigration service.</P>
      <P>DÍON funding was increased from £250,000 in 1988 to £500,000 in 1989 and has been maintained at that level in 1990. It is used to assist voluntary organisations helping Irish people with accommodation and/or employment difficulties.  The additional funding allocated to DION has enabled assistance to be given to organisations dealing specifically with the homeless such as: Acton Homeless Concern, Cricklewood Homeless Concern, King's Cross Homelessness Project, Irish Families Project, South London Family Services Unit, Irish Women's Housing Action Group, Cara-Irish Homeless Project and An Teach.  Many other organisations funded by DÍON, as part of their range of services for Irish emigrants, offer information on accommodation.  I am particularly hopeful that the Cara project will give us a statistical base on which to plan future action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the question relates to the provision of funding for the construction and running costs of hostel accommodation. As I intimated in reply to a similar question on 29 November 1989, DÍON received several applications for projects involving a capital element <Col N="2232" /> which it was clearly not possible to fund from the DÍON allocation.  I also indicated on that occasion that many voluntary emigrant welfare groups were of the view that funding of the capital costs of hostel accommodation should properly be the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>For these and other reasons I am not in favour of extending the remit of DÍON to the funding of hostel accommodation. Apart from anything else, the cost would be prohibitive and would only reduce the amount available for other urgently needed front line services which rely heavily on DÍON grants.  My information is that DÍON itself would not favour such a proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand fully the Minister's point of view on the provision of accommodation but a recent survey carried out in the Soho area showed that 15 per cent of the homeless there were Irish.  It is estimated that 5,000 Irish people are living in what is called &ldquo;cardboard city&rdquo;, and this does not take into account the number of Irish people who are squatting or sleeping on floors in friends' accommodation.  Surely the Government should have a direct input into the provision of accommodation?  A number of Irish groups, for example, The Kerrymen's Association and The Mayomen's Association, who are trying to provide hostel accommodation for these people should be aided in some way.  I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The county associations are doing an excellent job.  I know Deputy Deenihan and other Members have visited them and we have been supporting them in whatever way we can. The Government have been moving, particularly with the provision of additional money last year, to help those organisations, rather than some of the more traditional organisations, who are out on the street providing front line services. However, with the provision of extra money last year we were able to help both types of organisations.</P>
      <P>Some Irish apprentices from FÁS have worked on projects in Camden Town and other locations.  Our aim is to work with organisations like Cara who, because they receive backing from the Irish Government for their social workers scheme, have been able to get substantial grants from the local boroughs and authorities thus enabling them to provide extremely good services.  As the Deputies know, they have set up excellent housing projects.  We are working closely with Cara in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>At the conference on low pay referred to by the Deputy I indicated that I would study closely the findings of the research which had been carried out in this area. This research emphasises the complexity of the low pay issue and makes it clear that measures to tackle the problem of low pay must cover a wide range of areas. These include education, training, welfare benefits, taxation and industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the industrial relations aspects are concerned I feel that progress on low pay can best be achieved through collective bargaining operating in conjunction with joint labour committees.  In this regard I would point out that the agreements on pay associated with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are structured in favour of the lower paid. This, together with changes in the taxation system, increased welfare benefits and low levels of inflation in the past <Col N="2236" /> few years, will result in a substantial real increase in pay during the life of the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition the Industrial Relations Bill which I published last December provides for improvements in the functioning of the joint labour committees.</P>
    <P>The question of low pay has been the subject of much research and debate and as I have outlined a wide range of measures are being taken to tackle the problem.  In the circumstances I do not consider that the establishment of a council to investigate the issues is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister would agree, since 200,000 people are on less than £120 per week, that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> does not constitute any attack on low pay, providing as it does for increases of 2.5 per cent?  Such an in-built advantage for the low paid is infinitesimal.  Is the Minister concerned that Ireland and Britain are the only two EC member countries which do not have some legally enforceable minimum wage and that this may mean that we will become the poor relations of Europe and, specifically, the main source of cheap labour?  Is it not now appropriate to consider the question of a legal minimum wage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision was made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for a 4 per cent increase for workers on low pay.  That is not to say that that solves the problem.  In recent months I, as well as Deputies opposite, have been involved in many discussions on the topic of low pay.  The measures to tackle the problem of low pay must cover education, training, welfare benefits and taxation.  Some moves were made in that direction in the budget.  The family income supplement, which is only being availed of by 6,000 people at present, is geared towards assisting those on low pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have to identify the areas where workers in receipt of low pay are to be found.  Predominantly they are to be found in unskilled and part-time work for which low educational qualifications are required, where there is a quick turnover, <Col N="2237" /> little or no prospect of promotion and no occupational pension schemes.  None of these areas can be taken in isolation.  It is for that reason that I believe if you set a minimum wage too low, which is what I think you would end up doing, it would be meaningless and, on the other hand, if we set it too high we would create grave difficulties for the industries concerned. Since Christmas a number of problems have arisen in the clothing sector where traditionally people have been in receipt of low pay, not because employers like to pay people low wages but rather because they do not make the necessary profits. We need a strong system of joint labour committees, with independent chairpersons, where the employers and worker representatives can agree on what the level of pay should be for the sector concerned.  To help solve the problem the areas of taxation, education, training and welfare benefits should be dealt with on a statutory basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that many of the problems facing people on low pay are being created by the State because of the way it intervenes in so many ways in the lives of those on low pay or in receipt of social welfare and that this constitutes welfare apartheid?  A person on low pay is assessed on their gross income, not their take home pay, when they apply for a medical card or family income supplement or when it comes to differential rent.  Furthermore, they need not go to the community welfare officer for assistance in times of difficulty as they are prohibited from doing so under social welfare legislation.  Would the Minister not consider, in an effort to help those on low pay, giving an instruction that all applicants for State benefits should be assessed on take-home pay, not gross pay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the attack on low pay must be a multi-faceted one.  However, would he not agree that it is alarming that, after three decades when there were periods of high economic growth as well as periods of recession, there is no relative improvement in the position of 200,000 full-time workers who are living today on a gross wage of £120 a week or less, and that there must be more urgency in tackling this matter which is an attack on poverty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason a great number of people fell behind, and this is one of the points made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, is that in the negotiations during many of the previous wage rounds the strong received the increases while the weak were left out.  That is only part of the answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxation and welfare benefits form two major parts.  If we only <Col N="2240" /> take the pay end we will force jobs out of existence.  That is my experience and I think people would agree with that. It was announced in the budget that an interdepartmental committee was going to be set up to examine the points being made by Deputies Rabbitte and Mitchell. We should look at the extent to which we can exempt people from various taxes to try to get them out of that net.  That is the second way of tackling it.  The third way is joint labour committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I have carefully studied the case mentioned by the Deputies.  The case was considered by the Labour Court following an appeal against the finding of an equality officer.  On the basis of the facts the court found against the appellant.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the criticism to which the Deputy refers is not a reflection on the legislation and that the legislation as drafted is satisfactory.  The question of the interpretation of the legislation is a matter for the agencies concerned and the law courts if appealed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree he has the primary role to give guidance to both the Labour Court and the Employment Equality Agency in relation to how statutory rights for women are interpreted and that the interpretation in this case was an outrageous breach of a woman's statutory rights in relation to employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, not to avoid answering the question, that there is a possibility that this case will be appealed further so I do not want to get into all the details of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not in danger of breaking his own leg, is he?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  When I read the case, as the Deputy did, it seemed at first hand very simple and straightforward and hard fact on the individual concerned but it is not so straightforward when one examines the facts in detail.  The legislation and the various sections of the legislation would cover this and similar cases of either direct discrimination or indirect discrimination.  When the full facts are looked at, the reference to the breaking of the leg is not perhaps as crude as it sounded initially.  I have to say that in fairness to the very experienced people involved in the equality section who deal <Col N="2242" /> with very complex cases every day.  Following investigations by both the equality officer and the Labour Court, the issue is not a question of comparison between a healthy female worker and a sick male but a matter of an employee temporarily unable to take up employment on the date offered.  That was the issue in the final analysis.  It was not a question of direct discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if the principle which in this case came down against the woman in question was to be applied to the female workforce in general we could have an outrageous situation in relation to statutory rights, and that he must, in anticipation of any legal action, issue very clear guidelines on the Government's policy on this?  What is the Minister's policy in relation to this?  Must every female applicant for a job indicate the likelihood of her pregnancy in the first year of employment?  Is that the conclusion for female applicants for jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Let me say again to the Deputy that I would like to give all the details but if I gave all the details it would not be helpful to some parties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I would not want to give all the details.  It is not straightforward.  There is a conflict of evidence both by the employer's side and the employee's side on the position.  Having said that, let me say the equality officer came down on the side of the employee on the issue of the conflicting information. Maybe the analogy of the broken leg was somewhat unfortunate but that came into it because of a similar case which happened recently and the decision was if in those circumstances it had been a pregnant woman and a person with a broken leg the same thing would have happened.  The person was not available for work on a certain date.  That was a decision by the equality officer and the <Col N="2243" /> Labour Court.  It was a judgment they made on the case in front of them.  It was not against a pregnant woman.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy on what I read, but I spent a considerable time on it because I felt that I should, as the Deputy said at the outset, look at it in detail.  It is not a straightforward case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have read the findings.  Let me ask the Minister, without prejudice to any appeal being contemplated, is it not preposterous that language should be used to describe an application from a pregnant woman that somehow makes her equivalent to a male with a broken leg, that that preposterous description manifests that the old male chauvinist attitudes have not died in the Labour Court and that it ought to be the subject of an inquiry by the Minister's Department because of the implications it has for thousands of women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely why I inquired into it.  I have to defend my people in the Labour Court.  I know the full case.  That is the way it came across in public but it is not what happened at the hearing.  The issue was a matter of employees who are temporarily unable to take up employment on the day offered.  That is what the issue came down to.  It was unfortunate the analogy was ever introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is an argument where it is an employer taking over a business that had run into difficulties as to whether the EC instrument of transfer of ownership should apply and that in those circumstances the woman concerned, and the workers concerned, ought to have rights under the unfair dismissals legislation in matters like this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a slightly separate point but, when the case is read, and examined and the information is given, it will be seen that the equality officer, a very experienced person, did not make a straight, blatant decision as it seemed.  It was based on people not being available to take up work on a certain date, not of discrimination against a pregnant woman.  That was not the intention of the equality officer in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 28, 30, 58 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated on a number of occasions, I am determined during Ireland's Presidency to advance to the greatest degree possible the proposals of the Commission to implement the Social Charter and the action progremme.  To that end, I have engaged in a series of consultations with various interests, including the social partners, both at European and national levels.  I have arranged a meeting later today under the Troika arrangements with the Social Affairs Ministers of Italy and Luxembourg &mdash; my immediate successors as Presidents-in-Office of the Social Affairs Council &mdash; and the Social Affairs Commissioner with a view to establishing a timetable designed, as a first step, to ensure that all proposals of the Commission under the action programme are examined and decided before the end of 1992.  I considered that such an initiative was necessary on my part as a means of ensuring progress in the light of the volume and complexity of the proposals for legislation in the action programme which will have to be dealt with over a period of less than three years.  The initiative has been widely welcomed.</P>
      <P>I have kept the social partners informed, both at national and Community levels, about my Presidency programme and my intentions regarding the implementation of the action programme. I have assured them that I am doing everything possible to ensure that progress is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the particular question posed by Deputy De Rossa about the use of qualified majority voting, I should explain that the statements made by me to journalists in Brussels on 25 January were in the context of the use, as a legal base for implementation of individual proposals under the action programme, of Article 118A of the Rome Treaty as inserted by the Single European Act. That article provides for the adoption <Col N="2246" /> by the Council, by qualified majority, of directives concerned with measures designed to improve the working environment as regards the health and safety of workers.  It is a question of how broadly the provisions of Article 118A should be interpreted.  On 25 January I expressed the hope that Article 118A would be interpreted reasonably broadly. However, it is a legal question which would have to be assessed on the basis of the contents of individual proposals which will be brought forward by the Commission.  Any disputes in that regard would, therefore, rest for eventual determination by the European Court of Justice. In anticipation of the submission of the Commission proposals, it is not feasible to indicate the extent to which Article 118A can be used.  I have expressed the hope, however, that arguments about the legal base should not hold up progress in examination of the substance of individual proposals.</P>
    <P>Concerning Deputy Bell's question, the position is that the first proposals of the Commission under the action programme have not yet been submitted to the Council.  In anticipation of submission to the Council, it is not possible to predict the extent of progress which is likely to be made by the end of this year.  The procedure is that, following submission by the Commission, each proposal will have to be considered by the Council and some of the proposals will have to be the subject of consultation with the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.  In these circumstances, and though I shall continue to do all I can to expedite matters at all stages, I am not optimistic about any of the proposals being adopted by the Council in time to be enshrined into national law by the end of the present year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.

We want an agreed programme dealing with the whole charter and the 47 initiatives.  Tomorrow I will debate the draft timetable with the Social Employment Action Group and then meet the employers and the trade union representatives.  Some further discussions may be necessary with the Italians next Friday in Rome and, we would hope, at the informal Council meeting in Dublin on Thursday and Friday of next week to have the programme agreed.</P>

The adaptation of working time, part-time work, information for employees and worker participation generally are all issues which the Irish Presidency have made it clear are in our action programme.  The Deputy appeared to be asking whether we would interpret those to be part of Article 118 (a) or Article 110 (a).  We would support them but whether they would qualify is a different question.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the demand for trainees has outstripped the number of people in training?

      <P>The budget for 1990 at <Col N="2249" /> £7.5 million is 21 per cent higher than in 1989.  Due to the increase in tourism in the Rosslare area, it appears that the Rosslare Hotel will be open all year rather than on a seasonal basis.  It is the policy of CERT to use hotels which close on a seasonal basis, so they will move to a hotel which closes for the winter months.</P>

This company have been known publicly through the newspapers to have been in severe trouble for the past three years at least.  The IDA have sought to give them every assistance.  It is impossible to guarantee the viability of every individual company.  Naturally I regret very much that a number approaching 80 people possibly stand to lose their employment.  It is a matter for the receiver to seek to dispose of the company and I hope he will be successful in doing so.  He will certainly have every assistance from me in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House learned with deep regret last Saturday of the death of Brendan Corish.  May he rest in peace.  His long and active career in national politics began in 1945 when he was first elected to the Dáil, retaining the seat which his father, Richard, had held since 1921.  By the time he retired in 1982, the Corish family had represented the Wexford constituency for 61 years, an achievement for which both father and son were rewarded with the Freedom of Wexford town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brendan Corish served in three Administrations.  He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and to the Minister for Defence from 1948 to 1951.  He was Minister for Social Welfare between 1954 and 1957, but he will be perhaps best <Col N="2433" /> remembered for his term of office as Tánaiste, Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare from 1973 to 1977.  At a time of international economic recession, from which we here in Ireland were not immune, he undertook a number of improvements in the health and social welfare services.  Assisted by his Junior Minister, the late Frank Cluskey, he introduced a number of reforms to help the disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>He was Leader of the Labour Party for 17 years, having previously held the positions of Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Party Whip.  In 1969 he led the party to its largest ever percentage vote.</P>
    <P>Brendan Corish will have a place of central importance in the history of his party, which he led with skill and dedication through an important period of its development.  He was a man of great courtesy and his personal qualities of integrity and sincerity allied to a quiet sense of humour earned for him the affection and respect of Members on all sides of the House.  Whether as a backbencher or as a holder of high office, he was a credit to the profession of politics and brought honour to our country.</P>
    <P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government, I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Phyllis, and to his three sons, Philip, Dick and John.</P>
    <P>Ar dheis Dé go raibh an anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the honour of serving in this House with the late Brendan Corish but I had occasion to meet him in a number of different contexts during the time he was Tánaiste and found him always to be attentive, courteous and firm in his views.  Like a great many other people, I admired his dedication and commitment which led to the adoption of very significant social reforming legislation during the period from 1973-77.  I think it is for that, more than many other things, that he will be remembered by people outside of his own party and indeed within it.  The example he set during that period has indeed served this country well since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2434" /> Brendan Corish will go down as one of the most significant political figures of the past 30 years.  I would ask you, Sir, to convey to his wife and family my condolences and those of my party and I offer those same condolences to the party which he served and led so well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a sad occasion when statements of this kind have to be made in this House and it is particularly the case when the person whose death we are mourning was such a distinguished Member.  I would like to begin by extending, on behalf of the Labour Party, our deepest sympathy to Phyllis Corish and to all the other members of the Corish family.</P>
      <P>Brendan Corish will always be remembered within these walls as one who devoted nearly 40 years of his life to his work in the Dáil.  He will be remembered, too, as one whose grace and courtesy distinguished every contribution he made and as a man who left this House with many friends and not a single enemy.  For us in the Labour Party there is a special sadness because, above all things, Brendan Corish was the central unifying figure in the Labour Party.  From the moment he became leader of the party in 1960 until the day he retired as leader in 1977 he was the unchallenged leader of the Labour Party.  Indeed, even on the day he retired it was clear he still retained the full confidence of his party from top to bottom.  Brendan inspired that confidence because in many ways he did more than just represent the Labour Party.  In many ways he was the very embodiment of the values and principles which had bound that party together throughout its long and turbulent history. It was possible to look at Brendan Corish and to see the principles of equality and justice in action every day of his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said of Brendan Corish that he was a man without personal ambition and that is true.  He was a man with absolutely no interest in the trappings of office but he had a fierce and burning ambition to end injustice in our society, to win the freedom of working people from exploitation, and perhaps above all <Col N="2435" /> to bring people in from the margins of society.  Brendan Corish believed there was room in Ireland for every one of its sons and daughters, and more than room. He believed in the inalienable right of every citizen to shelter, education, health and human dignity.  Because he believed in these things, he knew that the Labour Party he inherited had to be built into a radical and cohesive force for change. Therefore, he set about the task of building that party into the most exciting political force of the Ireland of the sixties, a party with the will to fight for change and the capacity to appeal across a broad spectrum of opinion.  The extent to which he succeeded can be seen in many ways in the Ireland of today.  The values for which Brendan Corish stood in the 1960s and 1970s were by no means universally accepted throughout the political system but those values are the ones which politicians ignore at their peril today.</P>
    <P>The health system to which Brendan Corish dedicated himself in the seventies is the same health system which the people of Ireland as a whole came out to defend in the last general election.</P>
    <P>In other ways, too, the legacy of Brendan Corish continues to exert major influence.  Under his leadership the Labour Party led the way in ending any ambiguity about violence on our island. The only way to progress, in Brendan Corish's view, was through dialogue and he led by example in this area, building up contracts and friendships on all sides of the political and sectarian divide in efforts to find ways towards peace in our island.  Those efforts paved the way in many respects for the Sunningdale Agreement and Brendan Corish's role in securing that agreement has never been adequately recognised or praised.  I know he considered it to be one of the most important achievements of a long career and I know the pain he suffered when he watched the violence continue and the hatred remain entrenched.</P>
    <P>There were things that Brendan Corish hated as well.  He hated hypocrisy, selfishness and injustice but he loved people.  He saw the best expression for <Col N="2436" /> his socialism in a passion for people, for their rights, their dignity and their freedom. Above all, perhaps, he loved the people of Wexford.  He was never happier than when he was serving them or even just moving among them.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of sadness and yet yesterday in Wexford there was an air almost of celebration.  It was caused, I feel, by the feeling that Brendan Corish was free of pain at last.  More than that, it was caused by the feeling that Brendan Corish will continue to walk among us for many years to come.  For as long as we value justice and equality, for as long as we struggle for peace on our island, for as long as we seek the new Republic that Brendan Corish spoke of 20 years ago, the name and the spirit of Brendan Corish will continue to move us.

      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Brendan Corish, and indeed to the Labour Party on the death of their former leader and Tánaiste.  Although I did not know Brendan Corish personally as he had retired from the Dáil by the time I was elected, I had watched his political and parliamentary career with great interest. For more than 20 years he was a major figure in Irish political life and indeed the decisions taken by him and by his party under his leadership often determined what political form our Governments took during the sixties and seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Health and Social Welfare between 1973 and 1977, he was responsible for the introduction of many welcome reforms, particularly in the social welfare area.  He was clearly a man of considerable political courage.  For instance, during the 1969 election he refused to be intimidated and stood by his political principles despite the attempts by his political opponents at a Red smear against him.  His aspiration that the seventies would be socialist was one shared by many people outside the Labour Party as well as within it.  Perhaps the best tribute we can pay to his memory is for <Col N="2437" /> all of us on the left to work to ensure that future decades will indeed be socialist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned on the last day, I had dealt with the Minister's <Col N="2448" /> general approach to the definition of rape and aggravated sexual assault.  I have had the opportunity to consider the matter further in the interim and I hold firmly to my original view.</P>
      <P>I fundamentally agreed with the Government's approach to this problem but there is one aspect of the definition of aggravated sexual assault to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. The Law Reform Commission in their report defined aggravated sexual assault in a general manner in section 3 (1) as follows:</P>
      <P>aggravated sexual assault means a sexual assault that involves serious violence, or the threat of serious violence or is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission suggested a definition which was markedly different from the statutory definition.  Their suggested definition included the subject matter of section 3 (1) to which I have just referred but it also included a case where a sexual assault is &ldquo;committed while the accused has with him a weapon of offence or by a person in a relationship of authority over the victim&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That extension of the definition of aggravated sexual assault is not included in the statutory definition in section 3.  I read the Minister's speech on Second Stage and I do not see any reason for its omission.  I would imagine that the wording used by the Law Reform Commission in this context is not of itself sufficient to achieve the objective which they obviously want to achieve.  For instance, there is a marked difference between a person who commits a sexual assault while in possession of a concealed weapon which the victim does not know he has and a person who commits a sexual assault by intimidating the victim with a weapon.  The wording will have to make it clear that the possession of the weapon was an ingredient in the offence, that the weapon was used by the alleged perpetrator of the offence to aid or help him in some way to carry out the offence.  The same thing applies to the other aspect of <Col N="2449" /> the extended definition suggested by the Law Reform Commission.  The wording will have to make it clear, although in this case a presumption could be implied, that the possession of the authority over the victim was in some way connected with or aided the commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains in section 4 a radical departure in that it makes it clear for the first time in Irish criminal law that marital rape is now an offence.  The Law Reform Commission expressed the opinion that this was already probably a crime.  That opinion seems to me to be contradicted to some extent by some of the case law. However, the confusion is now swept away in section 4.  Various arguments have been used against including a provision in Irish statute law to make marital rape an offence.  Those arguments were dealt with, and to my way of thinking effectively demolished, in the report of the Law Reform Commission.  Despite that, objections are still being raised.  It is suggested, for example, that the creation of an offence of marital rape will lead to an unwarranted intrusion into the marital relationship.  The question is being posed, &ldquo;is it right or proper that the criminal law should be available as a weapon in family rows?&rdquo;  The spectre of late night calls to police stations and so on has been conjured up.</P>
    <P>The reality is that criminal law already interferes in the marital relationship.  For instance, as the law stands a person can commit buggery against his wife, he can commit ordinary assault against his wife and he can commit indecent assault against his wife.  In view of that it would be illogical and perverse if he could not also commit rape against his wife.  Whatever about the confusion that existed in the common law I welcome the fact that the Minister has availed of this opportunity to put this matter beyond any doubt.  There is no reason why the distinction should exist in this case.</P>
    <P>To those who are worried about the extension of the law in this direction I should like to point out that some years ago the offence of marital rape was created in statute law in Australia.  We must <Col N="2450" /> presume that people in Australia are subject to the same pressures, problems and emotions as people in Ireland and to date the creation of an offence of marital rape has caused no great difficulties in that jurisdiction.  The Minister was aware of the possibility that frivolous or vexatious complaints could be made.  In order to eliminate that in advance the Minister has provided that proceedings for marital rape can only be initiated with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. To some extent, when one considers this, there is an inconsistency there.  To me it shows that the Minister is virtually bending over backwards to meet all possible points of view.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The present common law is that boys under the age of 14 are treated as being legally incapable of committing rape.  The basis for that is an English case, the Crown v. Waite, 1892.  However, in 1893 in a case before the then English Court of Criminal Appeal, the Crown v. Williams, it was held that a boy under 14, even though he is presumed to be legally incapable of committing rape, is legally capable of committing indecent assault. I must point out that that decision has been heavily criticised but in so far as I can conclude from my research on the subject it has never been specifically overruled by a court either here or in the United Kingdom.  However, any difficulties or confusion that might arise have now been eliminated by section 5. It is made clear in that section that it is no longer to be presumed that just because a boy is under the age of 14 he is incapable of committing rape or aggravated sexual assault.  Some Opposition speakers went on from that to discuss the age of criminal responsibility.  There is no doubt in my mind that in so far as the age of criminal responsibility is concerned 14 years is too high.  I do not know, and I do not pretend to know what the correct age should be but it is my view that seven years is certainly too low.  The answer lies somewhere in between.  That is a subject for another debate and I will not deal with it today.</P>
    <P>Another initiative proposed in the Bill <Col N="2451" /> is that trials for rape or aggravated sexual assault be held before the Central Criminal Court.  Various arguments were advanced against that proposition.  They were effectively demolished by the Law Reform Commission in paragraph 19 of their report.  I do not propose to go over those answers again.  However, I should like to make a point in this connection. The Law Reform Commission saw a need to extend the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court.  That is the intellectual underpinning of their reasoning for making rape an aggravated sexual assault triable exclusively by the Central Criminal Court.  I disagree with that approach. There are good and adequate reasons for making those crimes triable in Dublin by the Central Criminal Court apart from arguing that the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court should be extended in some way.</P>
    <P>In 1981 all serious crimes, with the exception of treason, piracy, genocide and murder-related offences, were transferred to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Criminal Court.  One has to ask oneself &mdash; the answer will invariably be in the negative &mdash; if this has given rise to any difficulty in practice, if it has given rise to obvious cases of injustice or if it has given rise to administrative difficulties? The answer to those questions is in the negative.  If that be so, why should we begin the whole process of reversing what we did out of necessity in 1981?  The reasons, it would seem to me, would have to be good and compelling. The reasons advanced by the Law Reform Commission in what otherwise was an excellent report are, to say the least of it, inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated on Second Stage, as reported at column 930, volume 393, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>...the Bill provides that in future all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases will be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  I would like to make it clear that this decision is intended to be seen as an expression of the seriousness with which the Government view the crime <Col N="2452" /> of rape and, indeed, the crime of aggravated sexual assault.  It should not in any way be taken as a criticism of the Circuit Court or the judges in that court who have dealt with rape cases. I might also emphasise that the Government's decision was taken solely with reference to the particular crimes in question and should not be seen as supporting the Law Reform Commission's view that the transfer of rape and aggravated sexual assault trials to the Central Criminal Court should be the beginning of a process of returning a wider criminal jurisdiction to the High Court.  That is a separate matter to be considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>I was delighted that the Minister said that and, for the most profound and fundamental reasons, I agree with his approach.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has experience of the criminal law will know that frequently requests are made to have rape cases which occur outside Dublin transferred to Dublin anyway.  Looking at it generally it could be said to be more appropriate for both the complainant and the accused that rape cases be held in Dublin.  There is only one matter to which I would advert here.  While I agree with the section of the Bill which provides that the Central Criminal Court is the appropriate court, I would be most concerned if this change of jurisdiction gave rise in any way to delays in relation to this type of crime.  I do not have to emphasise to the House the patent injustice of delays in criminal trials.  Even though I do not want to put one particular category of crime above or below another, as the case may be, I would point out to the House that, in so far as the victim is concerned, long delays in relation to trials for offences of this nature give rise to particular injustice. I was very glad to hear the Minister's assurance in his Second Stage speech that such delays will not occur.  I would like, if at all possible, that that assurance be underpinned by another assurance that if, in practice, delays occur the necessary administrative arrangements will be put in place to eliminate them immediately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2453" /> In their report the Law Reform Commission dealt with the question of consent. The crime of rape and the crime of aggravated sexual assault is a crime, which of course, takes place without the consent of the victim.  If consent can be proved, then the crime is not committed; the <i>mens rea</i>, the guilty intent, is absent. That is why anybody who has experience of a rape trial will find that invariably the defence counsel's line will be to try to demonstrate that in some way consent was given whether expressly or implied by the victim.  The Law Reform Commission felt that the absence of a definition of consent has helped some guilty people to go free.  The Law Reform Commission report states:</P>
    <P>While no cases have been drawn to out attention in which the present law created serious difficulty, it was represented to us that it was certainly capable of doing so.  The Irish Association for Victims Support was strongly of the opinion that the absence of a definition had influenced verdicts.  It would be accordingly advantageous if the legislature were to clarify the law so as to put it beyond doubt that consent obtained by force or fraud was not consent.  It was urged that there was a real danger of juries equating a failure to offer physical resistance with consent.</P>
    <P>Having thus concluded, the Law Reform Commission went on to give us their definition of consent as follows:</P>
    <P>1 &ldquo;Consent&rdquo; means a consent freely and voluntarily given and, without in any way affecting or limiting the meaning otherwise attributable to those words, a consent is not freely and volutarily given if it is obtained by force, threat, intimidation, deception or fraudulent means and</P>
    <P>2  A failure to offer physical resistance to a sexual assault does not of itself constitute consent to a sexual assault.</P>
    <P>I think I might be permitted to disagree with that approach by the Law Reform Commission.  Anybody who will look at <Col N="2454" /> the textbooks, particularly the older textbooks in criminal law, in relation to sexual offences will see that there is a whole line of cases such as the case of the Crown v. Captain, the Crown v. Hallett, the Crown v. Fletcher, all venerable cases more than 150 years old, which make it clear that consent obtained by force, by threat, by intimidation, by duress, by fraud or deceit is not real consent.  One does not have to go back that far; there are more modern cases if one wants to regard 1937 as modern.  The Scottish case of the Crown v. Logan in 1937 makes that clear beyond any doubt.  I had thought the reason this issue was not argued more recently than the 1930s was that the matter was so clear and so much beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's approach.  It is entirely unnecessary to define consent statutorily.  I would be concerned that any attempt to define consent in this way would allow exactly what the Law Reform Commission fear, namely, that the guilty would go free.  The Minister went some of the way with the Law Reform Commission.  Section 8 provides that a failure to offer resistance does not of itself constitute consent.  This is similar to part 2 of the Law Reform definition but the Law Reform Commission definition simply stated that a failure to offer physical resistance would not constitute consent. The Minister is going further and is saying that a failure to offer any resistance does not necessarily constitute consent. The reason the parliamentary draftsman may have taken that option is to compensate in some way for the fact that part 1 of the Law Reform Commission definition is not included in the term &ldquo;consent&rdquo;.  Section 8 of the Bill implies that a person could possibly be guilty of rape or aggravated sexual assault if there is no fear, fraud, duress etc., if no physical resistance, verbal resistance or verbal protest of any kind is offered and if at the same time the victim is fully sane, conscious etc.  It is very difficult to see how that can arise in practice.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that will have to be teased out on Committee Stage to see if that inclusion by the Minister, in response <Col N="2455" /> to the arguments used by the Law Reform Commission and others, opens the door.  Also in relation to section 8, I wonder if the wording is wide enough to encompass criminal offences other than the offences dealt with in the Bill?  That is a matter we can deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The present offence of indecent assault carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment. Under the proposals in the Bill aggravated sexual assault and rape will carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The lesser offence created in the Bill of sexual assault will carry a maximum of five years imprisonment. The effect of this is that there are certain types of assault for which an accused could now get up to ten years but after the passing of this Bill he can get only five years.  I would regard that as not being too significant as it was only the more heinous types of indecent assault, which are now dealt with under the heading of aggravated sexual assault, that drew sentences of more than five years in practice.  The maximum penalty for those crimes is increased to life imprisonment. That is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>On the question of sentencing policy generally, the argument will be advanced &mdash; and there is no doubt it has some validity &mdash; that having maximum sentences does not imply that the accused will necessarily draw any sentence.  Perhaps the Minister could consider a proposal that there be a mandatory sentence for rape or aggravated sexual assault. I am aware of all the arguments about rehabilitation, etc., and I subscribe fully to them in case anybody thinks otherwise. I do not have time to dwell on them now because of the time constraint.  In relation to sentencing, the Minister should look at the possibility of a mandatory sentence even if it is only 12 months for rape or aggravated sexual assault.  The same argument cannot be used in murder because all sorts of justifications can be used as to why some person kills another with malice aforethought.  No such moral justification can be used in the case of a person who is convicted of rape or <Col N="2456" /> aggravated sexual assault as defined in this legislation.  The whole concept of mandatory penalties is not something new.  There is a very obvious precedent in road traffic legislation where if somebody is caught driving while over the permitted limit of alcohol it is mandatory for the District Court to disqualify him for driving for 12 months.  The question of mandatory sentencing in this area should now be looked at.</P>
    <P>Another proposal in the Bill related to the question of bail for a person who is on remand for the offence of rape or aggravated sexual assault.  At present a person on remand for an offence of this nature could apply to the District Court for bail.  It is proposed in section 18 of this Bill that such an accused will now have to apply to the High Court for bail. Presumably the reasoning behind that change is to bring uniformity into the legislation as these trials are now being transferred to the criminal division of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed some reservations about this change and gave voice to his willingness to reconsider this matter during his introductory contribution. I was very glad to hear him do that because it is a change with which I disagree.  The facts are that the procedures for granting bail in the District Court in serious sexual assault cases are well established.  There is a clear body of law on this subject which should not be disturbed except for good and compelling reasons.  Most important of all, the preliminary examination of the charges will be by the District Court and, therefore, the District Justice will be in the best position to judge whether bail should be granted in the individual case and what the terms of that bail should be.  Therefore, I propose to the Minister that in line with his own reservations that proposal in section 18 of the Bill should be dropped.</P>
    <P>The question of legal representation for the complainant has given rise to a good deal of debate.  This issue was dealt with at length in page 17 of the Law Reform Commission report in which they stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2457" /> Apart from the doubts ... as to the constitutional propriety of such a proposal, there must also be serious uncertainty as to the effect it would have on the trial of such cases.  In some cases, far from assisting the conviction of guilty rapists, it might so complicate the hearing and alienate the jury as to result in unjustifiable acquittals.... we are satisfied that the complaints to which we have referred can and should be adequately redressed within the confines of the present system.</P>
    <P>I agree heartily with that approach.  In dealing with this issue, the Minister, in agreeing with the Law Reform Commission approach, in his Second Stage speech said:</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Director of Public Prosecutions agrees generally with the commission's approach.  He is in the course of taking certain steps which when fully implemented will be of practical benefit to complainants in sexual offence cases.  In particular these arrangements will ensure that a complainant in a sexual case will be furnished without delay with a copy of her statement and be afforded access to the solicitor and counsel acting for the prosecution before the hearing of the case in court.  In addition he also proposes that a familiarisation course be made available to complainants on request in which the layout and procedure of the court will be explained to the complainant and in which she will be advised in very general terms of the type of questions which she might be asked.</P>
    <P>I agree with that approach but I want to pose a number of questions to the Minister.  First, will those rules be written down?  I suggest that those rules should be enshrined in written form because if we have to depend on verbal practice of verbal directives, these will invariably differ from counsel to counsel, solicitor to solicitor and area to area, and will give rise to cases of injustice.  If it is not the intention of the Director of Public Prosecutions to put these rules in written form <Col N="2458" /> I suggest that the Minister should incorporate a section in this Bill which would give him the power to make regulations to contain those rules.</P>
    <P>I want to advert to paragraph 51 of the Law Reform Commission report which refers to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935.  Section 4 of that Act refers to a mentally handicapped girl or women as an &ldquo;idiot&rdquo;, &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeble-minded&rdquo;.  The Law Reform Commission suggested that that sort of terminology should be taken off our Statute Book, and I could not agree more. In paragraph 51 of their report the Law Reform Commission stated:</P>
    <P>We have provisionally recommended that the offensive wording of section 4 ... should be amended by the substitution of words such as &ldquo;mental incapacity&rdquo; or &ldquo;mental handicap&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling insult to handicapped people to have words such as &ldquo;idiot&rdquo;, &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo;, or &ldquo;feeble-minded&rdquo; on our Statute Book in this day and age and unless there is some very good legal reason for it, this opportunity should be availed of to remove it.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt in general with the Government's approach to the definition of aggravated sexual assault.  I agree with the fundamental approach contained in section 3.  This is a timely Bill which is being introduced to rectify particular problems.  The question of whether we got it right or wrong in 1981 is now irrelevant. If we got it wrong in 1981 the reasons are irrelevant; the question now is: will we get it right this time?  This is a difficult balance to strike.  The Bill contains a number of radical initiatives and the Minister has just about got the balance right.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>For the second time I want to welcome the introduction of this Bill into the House and look forward to its completion on this occasion.  We are all aware of the urgent need for the amendments proposed in the Bill and the change in attitude it exemplifies.  Deputy <Col N="2459" /> O'Dea said it was irrelevant that the 1981 Criminal Law (Rape) Act did not fulfil what I hope this Bill will fulfil. However, it is very important that we put on record why the 1981 Act fell so short of the expectations of women and reforming legislators of that time.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to say that the Bill fell short of expectations for positive reasons.  I was involved with interest groups who lobbied at that time for the amendments contained in this Bill.  I want to put it on the record of this House that attitudes had not changed sufficiently in 1981 to allow the inclusion in that Bill of the concept of marital rape, any extension of the definition of rape itself or aggravated sexual assault.  We were not allowed at that stage to include in that Bill or in any Bill a provision relating to the emerging problem of child sexual abuse.  It is good to be able to record that attitudes have changed over the years and awareness and consciousness have been raised to such an extent that we can go a long way, both in this Bill and in the Child Care Bill, towards protecting the rights of two of the most violently assaulted and least protected sections of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until the emergence of the women's movement and their research and writings, there was a common concept, unfortunately this concept still permeates some of this Bill, and I will refer to this later &mdash; that women were property and there was a very large onus on a vulnerable rape victim to prove her innocence and not be totally blackened and discredited by taking legal proceedings. Indeed, it is a matter of concern to all of us to realise that even today &mdash; this is one of the reasons this Bill is needed so urgently &mdash; only a minority of the rape cases reported to the rape crisis centres are ever processed legally.  This is not an accident: it is because women know and have learnt to their cost that when having their cases processed through the courts the legal procedures dismantle their humanity and integrity, blacken their characters and, as has been said so often, they are raped all over again by the legal <Col N="2460" /> procedures in the courts.  Women are very reluctant to go through that process.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that the people who are victims of the most violent crime, outside of murder, which causes the greatest violation of the integrity of a person, are afraid of how they will be treated if they take their case to court.  I should like to think that in monitoring this Bill and by the success of amendments we will be able to stand up in this House in ten years' time and record a much higher level of legally processed cases.</P>
    <P>We need to do two things.  First, we should always bear in mind that this is a serious and heinous crime and what it does emotionally to the victim and, second get across to society the appalling violence which still pervades society where women are at risk.  The research which has been undertaken on this Bill highlights two very basic points.  The first is that up until recently there was a perception not just within the legal profession but also within society that in some way or another the rape victim invited such an assault.  It was also alleged for far too long, until women proved otherwise &mdash; the negative product of this is still being felt &mdash; that this had to do with sexual titilliation or satisfaction.  We now know, and let this be said again, that it has to do with violence, hatred and violation and nothing to do with sexual relationships between men and women. It has everything to do with domination, control and power.</P>
    <P>I would like to think in speaking about the need to reduce the incidence of recorded sexual assault that women will be accepted as equal partners and independent in their own right and not at risk. I would also like to think that during the next 10 years we can create a society where women will be given equal opportunity, the right to walk the streets, to work and move independently at certain times and if a woman happens to be attacked, that we will not say to her that she should have known better.</P>
    <P>I welcome the participation of male Members of the House in this debate. Some of the comments made so far I <Col N="2461" /> do not agree with but one thing I do welcome, as I know will the female Members of this House and women outside, the fact that men are being seen to take responsibility.  For far too long this was seen as a campaign being fought only by women on behalf of women with the perpetrators of this crime believing that they were free of responsibility and could nitpick it within the judicial system.  We have a long way to go before we change that perception and attitude.  Only then will we have a society where women will be allowed to reclaim the night, walk where they want to and have the independence that men have to carry out their social and other engagements without being in constant fear of being violated and raped.</P>
    <P>When I speak about rape I talk about the violation of women.  The Law Reform Commission listened to and heeded what the victims of rape, their supporters and the counsellers of rape victims had to say. They were told what they needed, not what the legal profession believed was or was not acceptable to them.  I compliment them for the wisdom they showed.  They recommended that the definition of rape, which at present is very narrow, penile penetration of the vagina, should be extended to cover penetration of bodily orifices which causes as much pain and appalling injury.  I cannot begin to express my disappointment or that of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, women's groups or the members and staff of the Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country that the Law Reform Commission's recommendations were totally ignored by the Department of Justice and by two Ministers for Justice.  This does not make sense, in particular to women. On page 6 of their report in relation to the extension of the definition of rape, the Law Reform Commission said:</P>
    <P>It must, however, attach due weight to the large number of submissions which have suggested that current usage in Ireland is broader than the legal definition.  Of the 28 submissions in writing received by the Commission <Col N="2462" /> at least 19 were in favour of extending the definition of rape.</P>
    <P>They went on to state that these included submissions from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, representatives of leading women's associations, such as the Irish Countrywomen's Association, representatives of professional associations, such as the Irish Medical Association, trade unions, such as the IDATU and, more important, the Rape Crisis Centres.  They also stated that the general consensus which emerged at the seminar they held to obtain the views of those dealing on a daily basis with the problems and trauma associated with rape was in favour of an extension of the definition.  On page 7 of the report, they state:</P>
    <P>We attach considerable significance to the fact that these views are held by persons who are in daily contact with the victims of assaults and who are in a position to observe their use of language.  We were also told by them that appropriate labelling of offences contributes to the victim's sense of being vindicated and protected by the State and that any description which seems to understate the gravity of the offence or put it into a lesser category will be resented by the victim.</P>
    <P>That is clear, simple, powerful language which reflects clear, simple and powerful demands from the victims of rape and those who counsel and support them and who, as the Law Reform Commission have said, deal on a daily basis with them. I ask why is such a consensus or a majority view being rejected and ignored by the Minister.  It is a perfect example of a paternalistic, patriarchal male view that, regardless of the personal, human and very pertinent experiences of the victims and the supporters themselves, men know best.  It is indescribably depressing in 1990 to stand in this forum and have the reflected views which the Law Reform Commission went to the trouble of eliciting overturned, overthrown and devalued by the Department of Justice in <Col N="2463" /> their drafting of this Bill and by Ministers for Justice who have come in and attempted to justify it.  There is no real justification for it.  However this Bill justifies a judicial system, a paternalistic system, that does not allow for real needs and experience and for the legislation long delayed and long called for to be brought properly into this House.  I hope this Bill does not go beyond Committee Stage without Members making sure that we extend that definition of rape.  The majority of people I am talking about here would desire that.  That is what democracy is all about regardless of &mdash; or should I say even in line with &mdash; the fact that we would be also acceding to the call of the rape victims if and when we extend that definition.</P>
    <P>Out of the detailed and very wide representative views the Law Reform Commission gathered they said that any description of rape &mdash; as they and all the other groups including the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights recommended &mdash; which seemed to understate the gravity of an offence and put it into a lesser category would be resented by the victim.</P>
    <P>What is this Bill supposed to be about? It is supposed to be about the support, protection and the legal process that will ensure some kind of justice for the victims of rape, yet in the words of the Law Reform Commission in 1990, nine years after a very badly amended Bill in 1981, we are ignoring all that and attempting once again to bring into this House a Bill with a section which the Law Reform Commission can rightly say will be resented by the victim.  For whom are we bringing it in?  For whom is this Bill supposed to be?  This is our judicial system again.</P>
    <P>I have heard Members of this House in Opposition say that because there was a Law Reform Commission minority report on the recommendation to extend the definition of rape, that is the definition that should stand, it was the one that had the gravitas, the experience and the expertise.  Where does that leave the majority of the Law Reform Commission <Col N="2464" /> and the women as supporters and women as counsellors?  It is not even democratic. Unless we extend that definition I regard this Bill as seriously flawed and an insult to women.</P>
    <P>I am glad to record that the first Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights recommended an extended definition of rape.  The strong chairwoman, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, now Minister of State, has always held that the definition should be extended. Under my chairmanship the second Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights upheld that view and it was endorsed by the newly established Joint Committee on Women's Rights whose vice-chairwoman, Deputy Wallace, is about to speak.  All those Members of those committees, Members of all parties, have endorsed and totally supported the Law Reform Commission and their recommendation to extend the definition of rape.  Where do we go from here if that does not carry enough weight to have this definition changed on Committee Stage?  It is believed, for whatever esoteric reason, by the Minister and his drafting team that it is not necessary or even desirable.  The Ministers even suggested that there was no real consensus on or demand for this.</P>
    <P>The obsession with defining the crime of rape and insisting that it relates only to penile penetration of the vagina is a long outdated, redundant, patriarchal view of women as property.  Many women writers, historians and researchers have pointed out that the law pertaining to rape began as a protection and a compensation to her guardian, father or husband, for the loss of a woman's virginity.  Unfortunately, by not allowing the definition to be extended and by confining it to this rigid, long outdated concept, we are merely perpetuating that concept.  In the past the risk of pregnancy would have been great, but that does not obtain today, fortunately. Today the risk of damage and even disease to women is through anal sex or oral sex which this Bill does not accept as rape.  Forced oral and anal sex can lead not alone to the violation of <Col N="2465" /> the integrity of the person and damage, physical, emotional and psychological, to a horrific degree, it can leave victims wide open to venereal disease and AIDS.  That has not been taken into consideration in the definition we are asking to have extended.  Considering the societal stigma of rape, it goes beyond belief that this extension has not been included in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in this Bill of the concept of marital rape is welcome even at this late stage.  I would like to stitch into the record a rebuttal of some of the fears many men have raised, that frivolously, vexatiously or because she had a slight disagreement with her husband, a woman, forever deceptive and deceiving, will rush out and allege rape against him. The Law Reform Commission recommendation was framed to ensure that that could not happen, but inherent in that is the suspicion that women find it easy, frivolous and vexatious to allege they have been raped.  One has only to talk to a woman victim about the enormity of being raped and what has happened to her confidence, her integrity, her life on a day to day level, to understand that women do not lightly allege rape and with regard to a relationship such as marriage, they are very loath to allege such a strong and stigmatising action by their husbands.</P>
    <P>Some research has proved, unfortunately, that there is a very high prevalence of marital rape, and that is why the inclusion of this measure is to be welcomed.  Let me refer to research done in 1980 in the US by Diana Russell whose findings showed that sexual assaults by husbands were the most common sexual assaults, occurring more than twice as frequently as sexual assault by strangers. Further research into rape in marriage also showed that women and wives who had been raped were most loath to face up to the reality of what their husbands had done to them.  It showed also that many people fail to become alarmed about the problem of marital rape because they think it is rather less traumatic than rape by a stranger.  Some of the research in this area has shown that <Col N="2466" /> women raped by husbands are often traumatised at an even more basic level in their ability to trust anyone.  It touches a woman's basic confidence in forming relationships and in trusting intimacy.  It leaves a woman feeling much more powerless and isolated than if she were raped by a stranger.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we have recognised the reality of the legal protection we should give to a wife who is raped by her husband. It may have been something swept under the carpet or seen as one of the side effects of marriage for a woman, but at the psychological and emotional level it can be more traumatising and result in long lasting feelings of lack of trust, lack of intimacy and a total inability to form relationships on a human level.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will deal with two other areas which are not covered by the Bill.  One is the treatment of sex offenders.  Even during the past week we have seen the record of a woman brutally raped by a man who had already been sentenced and allowed out from prison where he was serving a sentence for an earlier rape.  The psychiatrist said that because the man had not been diagnosed as mentally unbalanced there was no psychiatric reason for containing him or extending his sentence.  One of the most vital protections which must be built into this Bill is that rapists who are tried and sentenced, especially if they have committed a series of violent rapes, are kept in custodial security until such time as they are safe to be allowed out and are not a danger to others.  That will only come about by an investment of resources in the treatment of sex offenders while they are in prison and later when they are outside in the community on a long term basis.  Unless we provide for this, this Bill will be merely a stop-gap.  There will be horrific rapes and murders which result from our inability within the judicial system to contain sex offenders whom we know to be dangerous.</P>
    <P>Section 35 states that the Bill has no financial or staffing implications.  It has staffing and financial implications with regard to giving the necessary staff and <Col N="2467" /> proper resources to Rape Crisis Centres to support, counsel and encourage women to go through a judicial process that will get them some kind of justice and compensation for what has been done to them.  If we are serious about protecting women in this situation we must ensure proper investment in counselling and supporting women victims. What has been happening up to now is a disgrace and a denial of women's rights.</P>
    <P>The judges need to get their act together or we as legislators must do it for them to ensure that proper guidelines are established with regard to sentencing for the kind of serious crime we are dealing with here.  I would refer to the British Weekly Law Reports of 28 March 1966 where discussion along these lines led to the creation of the necessary guidelines. The statistics show that sentences were so trite, so ridiculous and so confounding in certain stages, that public pressure brought about the introduction of guidelines for the sentencing for serious crimes.  It is a reflection on women in our society that no such approach has been seriously thought of yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss Wallace Miss Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important legislation. Deputy Barnes referred to the changing of attitudes.  This is a relevant element in the amendments included in the Bill.  They incorporate the many changes in the attitude of the general public in this area.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes vital elements to improve the position for victims, an area about which we are all concerned.  Additional important measures to deal with the offenders are also included.  It is a seriously disturbing feature of our times that the number of rapes continues to increase and the severity of the attacks is getting worse.  There are grounds for concern in this whole area.  To examine the reason for such developments which degrade persons and reveal a sickness in society would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problem is the major difficulty regarding statistics.  Many people fail to report the crime.  Figures indicate <Col N="2468" /> an average of two reported cases of rape per week and three reported cases of indecent assault.  These are just the reported cases.  I would share the concern of other speakers about the reluctance among women to report the crime and to take the case to court.  I am confident that the improvements in the Bill will bring about an improvement in the whole area and that we will have greater reporting of the crime and more cases being brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The deliberations of the Law Reform Commission have yielded a comprehensive treatment in this whole area. The major recommendations have been included in the Bill, with the exception of the definition of rape.  Great concern has been expressed by many people as to whether the definition of rape should be extended.  It was stated earlier that the Law Reform Commission divided on this matter whereas they made clear recommendations in other areas.  I gave much consideration to this matter, and indeed many speakers have referred to this also, because the question as to whether rape should be redefined is important.  I am concerned about this whole area because we are dealing with a very reprehensible crime and all possible measures should be taken to ensure that the strongest and most specific legislation is in place to cover this whole area.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was discussed last May there was much concern about the definition of rape and whether it should be redefined.  The Minister at the time said that he and the Government would have no hesitation in extending the definition if they thought it was the correct approach.  He went on to say that the Government were endeavouring to take into consideration the victim of rape, the victim of indecent assault and the general public.  There is varying information and varying opinions on this.  People are concerned that if the definition is extended it may remove the stigma which is attached to the crime at present.  Apparently in other jurisdictions where this definition has been extended, problems have arisen where perhaps minor assaults were included under the term of rape.  I <Col N="2469" /> do not think you could seriously describe any sexual assault as being a minor assault but there are definitely varying degrees of assault and this must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We have to be careful not to enact legislation that would cause technical problems in the courts.  While we can see the benefits of extending the definition of rape, we have to balance this against the problems that may arise if this extended definition is made.  There is no doubt in my mind &mdash; and indeed it is the view of the general public &mdash; that the concept of rape is crystal-clear and has been so for generations.  Practitioners say that because the present definition is so clear, no difficulties are created in prosecuting cases in court.  Again, this is an important element to be borne in mind with regard to this whole area.</P>
    <P>The main concern in criminal law is to apprehend, convict and punish the guilty. If changes were made that would perhaps cause difficulties.  There is no doubt we would be concerned.  Appalling attacks take place which would not be termed as rape at present because they do not involve sexual intercourse but they are just as traumatic for the victim as rape would be.  This term in the Bill called aggravated sexual assault should, I hope, cover those areas, particularly in view of the fact that aggravated sexual assault will carry the same penalty as rape.  This is a welcome development in itself.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the 1981 Act there has been an average of 150 reported cases of indecent assault on females every year.  I hope the imposition of harsher sentences will, as Deputy Barnes said earlier, provide an adequate deterrent in this whole area.  Aggravated sexual assault will also carry the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  Heretofore, similar cases tried under indecent assault have carried a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.  When dealing with despicable and appalling crimes, the courts will now be able to impose life sentences.  It will also be possible to try such cases in the Central Criminal Court as distinct from the Circuit Court and that is a good idea.  It is particularly <Col N="2470" /> important to me as a rural Deputy and to people in rural Ireland that such cases would not be heard in the locality of either the man or the woman involved.  I am encouraged by the provisions in the Bill which show care for the victim.  To relive the event in court is a traumatic experience for the victim.  No amount of legislation will erase that anguish but at least the reforms included in the Bill display somewhat more humanity than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the public from court cases, as provided in section 10 of the Bill, will relieve the terrible trauma experienced by the victim.  Despite the provision in the 1981 Act that people's identities be protected, this still caused concern for people bringing cases to court.  The exclusion of the public from the court will, hopefully, protect the identity of the unfortunate victim.  It is harrowing enough for a woman to have all the intimate details of her private life discussed without the entire proceedings being conducted before an audience which unfortunately, has been the case in the past.</P>
    <P>The extension of particular measures which currently apply to rape trials to cover all victims of sexual assault is welcome. Since the 1981 Act the name of the rape victim cannot be made public and under this Bill the names of the victims of sexual assault will also be protected. There are additional restrictions in regard to sexual assault cases in that the prohibition on the introduction of evidence, by cross-examination or otherwise, on the sexual history of the victim, which currently applies to rape cases, will also be extended to sexual assault cases.</P>
    <P>Very significant also is the decision to provide for the abolition of mandatory warnings about the dangers of convicting a person on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant in offences of a sexual nature.  Again, there is no doubt that this type of warning would raise unnecessary confusion and uncertainty in the minds of jurors, particularly in cases of rape and aggravated sexual assault where, it must be borne in mind, it is rare to have witnesses. The person perpetrating the <Col N="2471" /> crime will have carefully chosen the venue and, therefore, the possibility of having witnesses would be remote. Allowing the trial judge to decide whether to give a warning is a practical move and is in appreciation of the realities of litigation.</P>
    <P>Given the violence used in many instances, I am glad the failure to offer resistance to an act that would constitute an offence does not, under the Bill, constitute consent to the act in question.  It is appropriate that the failure to resist shall no longer be used against the complainant in court.  Frequently the victim leaves herself open to further injury by putting up physical opposition.  This is terrible but it is a reality.</P>
    <P>Finally, no contribution to the Bill would be complete without reference to the proposed removal of any rule by virtue of which a husband may not be guilty of raping his wife.  Again, this is a particularly good reform.  It represents an emphatic declaration by the State that a wife cannot be treated as the chattel of her husband, to be used and abused with impunity.  I recognise the vulnerable position of many women who endure lives of fear and trauma.  For such spouses married life is a complete negation of what marriage is intended to be and of what it is hoped to be.  We all accept that there is a tiny minority of husbands who would abuse their wives in this way, but unfortunately they do.  If it has not been possible to stop them up to now, we hope that these sections in the Bill will have an effect in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces welcome reforms. The appropriate balance between what is possible and what is practicable has been struck in the Bill.  It will never be possible for women to feel safe alone at night or on occasions during the day.  It is a terrible fear that every woman carries, regardless of her background or circumstances.  There is a constant fear of being attacked and this creates a fundamental difference between how men and women approach their daily routine. For many women travel and connections have to be planned with exact detail so <Col N="2472" /> as to ensure that they are not alone or left in circumstances which could lead to danger for them.  It is an ever-present feature in the minds of women although sometimes it is subconscious.  Legislation will not remove the fear but I hope that what is contained in the legislation will protect women who have been the unfortunate victims of this terrible crime.  To all women it is the worst, the lowest, the most despicable crime of all.  I hope that what is contained in the Bill will help to improve the situation of the unfortunate victims of this terrible crime.</P>

      <P>I already welcomed this Bill in the Seanad as Opposition spokesperson, on 15 December 1988, so my general reaction and comments on it are already on record in that House.  The time span between December 1988 and today is lamentable because it indicates the slow pace of legislative procedures in this Parliament but it should have enabled us to have reflected fully on the proposals in the Bill and on public reaction to some sections of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed early in January over a specific rape case in our courts dealing with an 11 year old girl who was raped by a man, a boyfriend of her mother.  Although the man went through the courts and pleaded guilty he was given a suspended sentence by the judge.  The public outcry and general unease caused by this case was understandable.  The fact that a grown man knowingly sexually assaulted a vulnerable little girl in this way and then got off virtually scot-free is a very sad reflection on how the crime of rape can be treated here.  It can be said that this was an isolated case and that the public reaction to it sent a powerful message to the courts, and that such a case will not happen again, but our legislation should be framed in a way that will not allow such a situation to happen again.  Periodic outbursts of anger and frustration by politicians and others are no substitute for proper legislation and a legal framework that ensure justice and equity in our courts.  I do not go in for Judge or district justice bashing but when a very incorrect decision is given, as in <Col N="2473" /> this case, the public have an obligation to speak out and voice their reservations and objections to such a decision.</P>
    <P>In the light of this case we should reexamine this Bill further to see if it can be strengthened.  I propose that for those crimes drunkenness should not be a defence.  I feel strongly about this matter, because again and again this is the defence that is put forward with pleas for leniency on the basis that a person is not fully aware of what he was doing.  Such a defence should draw an even harsher penalty in order to uphold the principle that a person is responsible for his actions whether or not he drinks.  A drunken state should not be a defence.  This case also shows a need for sentencing guidelines, a matter to which I will come back later.</P>
    <P>A further question posed by the case is the right of both sides to appeal.  As far as I am aware, at present in the Circuit Criminal Court the defendent can appeal the sentence but the prosecution cannot appeal on the basis that a sentence was too lenient.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the history of the Bill. No greater consultation, analysis and examination could have been given to legislation in preparation and the Bill is all the better for that.  It is interesting to note that only in this month have the suggested changes in the law, in line with what is in our legislation here, surfaced in the UK.  For once we are ahead of them in initiating in this Bill a section dealing with rape within marriage.  I hope we will get the Bill through ahead of the British Parliament which tends to be much more efficient in these things in terms of drafting and passing legislation.</P>
    <P>The initiation of the original campaign for change came from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre seven years ago which at that time was headed by the very dynamic Anne O'Donnell.  There was no great political acceptance then of the need for reform, as the last amendment to this legislation had only been in 1981. However, the people at the Rape Crisis Centre continued to lobby and plead their case.  Eventually the need for reform was accepted and the Attorney General <Col N="2474" /> referred the issue of rape legislation reform to the Law Reform Commission for their attention.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission under the presidency of the Honourable Mr. Justice Ronan Keane did splendid work and I commend them for their commitment and efficiency in this matter. The Law Reform Commission consultative paper was published on 1 December 1987.  This was followed on 30 January 1988 with a one-day seminar, the objective of which was, within a small group, to discuss the proposals of the consultative paper and listen to counter argument and consolidate views on reform.  The final report of the Law Reform Commission was published on 3 May 1988 and it in effect became a blueprint for this Bill.  I am also aware of the very important role played by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, as they in January 1987 published a very broad and honest report which reflected in large part the proposals of the Law Reform Commission.  Given that degree of consultation and expert reflection this Bill should satisfy the needs not only of our time but of the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in general and specifically many of the proposals, for instance the abolition of the exemption for marital rape, the acceptance that a male under 14 can be capable of rape and of hearings <i>in camera,</i> as well as the change of venue to the Central Criminal Court.  However, I have reservations which have been voiced by other speakers in this debate and which I voiced in the Seanad.  These are related to the fact that there is no independent legal representation for the victim and that the definition of rape does not include non-consentual sexual penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth by the penis or an inanimate object.  As I said, this has already been stressed.</P>
    <P>The issue of this Bill was never a party matter.  All Members in the House appreciate the heinous nature of the crime of rape and sexual assault.  There is a will and commitment to seeing the legislation enacted as effectively as possible. However, Members on this side of <Col N="2475" /> the House will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to be open-minded and receptive to those changes because the Bill must be as good as possible and our changes must be seen in this light.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen an increase in the number of rape and sexual assault offences.  According to the Garda Síochána the number of reported cases in 1978 was 47; in 1986 that had gone up to 74, in 1987 there was 75 rapes and 158 indecent assaults and in 1988 there were 61 rapes and 226 indecent assaults. However, these figures do not reflect the true number of instances of rape and sexual assault as statistics supplied by any of the Rape Crisis Centres and the number of assaults reported to them can be ten times the number of rape offences reported to the police.</P>
    <P>Nobody involved with rape victims is surprised that there is such a divergence between the number of cases reported to the Garda and the number of rape cases known to the Rape Crisis Centres.  Anybody who has worked with the victims of rape know the reasons for this imbalance in the figures.  Most women are reluctant to pursue the matter through the courts because the perception is that it is an ordeal of great trauma and stress and that the court is a place where they will be harried and bullied.  They feel that they are on trial rather than merely a witness in a trial.  It is not surprising that such workers say that many rape victims refuse to testify.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out on page 2 of the consultative paper of the Law Reform Commission, a change in public attitudes towards rape is one of the most important influences in reporting trends.  However, in this Bill we are dealing with a crime that is mainly perpetrated by men against women.  I do not think that any man could understand the legacy of distress, fear and scarring that sexual assault and rape leave, because men do not feel this horror as women do.  I am not saying that they are uncaring or unsupportive.  Of course not &mdash; many men care very deeply about this violence to women and will be able <Col N="2476" /> to speak freely about it, but this is not the general case.  Most men are embarrassed and uneasy about the subject of rape and do not went to give their opinions on it. Indeed, some men think it is a bit of a joke and regard it as something to snigger about.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that if women were responsible for such violent acts against the opposite sex they would not take a serious critical approach to it.  They would want to know more about the motives for it, to seek some way to deal with its perpetrators and want to make amends to the victim.  The way men deal with this problem probably says a lot about the reactions of men and women to specific problems related to sex.  I do not know of any men's organisations addressing the matter of male sexual violence or rape.  It has been left to women, through their organisations, to cope with the trauma of the victims.  Without the work and dedication of those in the Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country we would have a very serious problem indeed.  It is sad in this context that the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre has been in such a depressed state financially and are still uncertain about their future.  We have heard fine words and there have been worthy statements about them, but too often the money to secure their work has not been forthcoming.  I am very happy that an allocation was made to this group in the recent budget.</P>
    <P>The work in this House passing the Bill is very important but it is equally important to ensure adequate financial support for the Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country.  These centres are not a luxury, they are doing extremely important work which is not done by any other Government agency.</P>
    <P>I regret that the definition of rape has not been extended to cover the kinds of offences called &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; in the Bill.  I also regret that the Minister did not accept the recommendations of the final report of the Law Reform Commission. I am aware that there was a minority report and that two members of the Commission &mdash; the President, Mr. Justice <Col N="2477" /> Ronan Keane and Mr. Simon O'Leary &mdash; dissented from the report.  These two men, for their own reasons, set themselves against the tide of opinion which ranged from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, the major women's organisations and the other law reform commissioners, to the participants in the one-day seminar and many others.  I should like to know why the Minister was swayed by the minority report rather than the majority viewpoint. What was the thinking behind the decision of the minority members at page 24, paragraph 61, of the report.  I quote:</P>
    <P>While it may be that such benefits will result from a change in the law, we think it is impossible to say that this has been satisfactorily established.  It is undoubtedly the case that the overwhelming body of submissions to the Commission and of the views expressed at the seminar took the view that they would extend the definition of rape.  But we do not think that it necessarily follows that this reflects the view of the community as a whole on the meaning of rape.  We think it at least possible that precisely because of their close involvement in the subject that the views of some of those who made submissions to us in this matter may not be the same as those of the community at large.  It would in any event be presumptuous in our view to reject the possibility that the community's view as to what constitutes rape is more acurately reflected by the existing definition, i.e., that it is a violent abuse of the sexual act which can provide the most complete expression of love between men and women and normally enables conception to take place.</P>
    <P>They further say that in the same section all the criticisms now being made about the present definition were advanced as recently as 1981.  There is a shade of arrogance in believing that such a strong force of majority view of an issue should be interpreted by them as not reflecting the views of the community as a whole. What is the view of the community as a <Col N="2478" /> whole?  How do they have access to that view if not through the representatives in that community?  I regret that the thinking in this minority report appears to be so conservative and backward-looking and unable or unwilling to see the need to take a broader, more embracing legal view, of all crimes of rape and violent sexual assault.</P>
    <P>I should also like to put on record my reservations about the reluctance to give independent legal representation to the victim.  This has been a very fundamental proposal by all those involved in rape reporting and it is worth putting on record the views of the Rape Crisis Centres in their report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  They said:</P>
    <P>Most complainants of rape with whom we have worked found the experience of a criminal hearing to be horrific, degrading and humiliating. Many of our clients experienced the court case as being worse than the actual rape, describing it as like being raped again in public in a hostile and frightening environment.  In no other criminal case would the complainant be subjected to the type of cross-examination and humiliation prevalent in rape cases during the defendant's efforts to prove her consent to the alleged rape.  It is futile to argue, as do many members of the legal profession, that the role of the victim of rape is identical to that of the victim of other crimes such as robbery, common assault, larceny, etc.  As a witness in court she is clearly placed in quite a different and really more taxing and upsetting role as a witness and, therefore, deserves to be prepared for the experience ahead of her.  Even from the State's point of view it is surely desirable that their first witness should be as confident and relaxed a witness as is possible under the circumstances. Lack of preparation can and often does result in the prosecution not being successful.</P>
    <P>On this matter there seems to be great divergence of opinion between the Minister and those of us who are seeking <Col N="2479" /> change.  I hope we can meet and decide to resolve the problem.  If we do not go as far as the radical departure of having a counsel in court for the witness, then we must come up with another suggestion to met the perceived needs in this case. The submission from the Rape Crisis Centres seeks that the complainant would have her own legal representation to protect her interests and more actively fight the case on her behalf.  The Rape Crisis Centres submission speaks for itself and should be given more serious consideration. It certainly puts in context the suggestions that a rape trial is different from any other criminal trial.  The woman as a witness plays a different role from that of any other witness.  That is a very fundamental area and will need more examination and response.</P>
    <P>If we are to see changes and make it easier for witnesses to testify, we must change the present procedure.  I know, and women complainants know, that a defence counsel is only doing his job well when he succeeds in undermining her, portraying her as unreliable and that counsel will bully her and provoke her to that end.  Indeed, very often counsel will suggest that the woman looked for rape and this was her just desert.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 6, I suggest that the evidence as to the past sexual history of a woman is still admissible in certain circumstances, although this area certainly has been tightened up.  I am pleased that the marital rape concept has been accepted and this will end the extraordinary situation in which it is presumed that sexual violence within marriage is less serious than rape committed by strangers and others.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to show that a victim of forced rape by a husband suffers less pain and degradation than any other rape victim.  This change is needed particularly where husband and wife are living apart with or without a separation agreement. The change to accepting that males under 14 can commit rape is welcome.  I know of cases of such assault and I realise that a boy of this age cannot be given the same sentence as a man.  He will certainly <Col N="2480" /> need custodial care and intensive psychological therapy.</P>
    <P>My reservations regarding the Bill are clear.  I regret that the opportunity was not taken to extend the definition of rape instead of introducing new offences.  I regret that no concession has been made in the area of legal representation for the complainant but it is my wish that on Committee Stage we will go into this in more detail and reach a consensus in regard to it.  I have to say also that I have severe reservations about the sentencing policy and I would like to see guidelines laid down.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights had the following to say in their report on the question of sentencing:</P>
    <P>The perceived disparity in sentencing in rape and other sexual assault cases has been a matter of concern for many citizens in this country in recent years.  Members of the Joint Committee acknowledge that the demands from the general public for a more consistent level of sentencing in all criminal cases must be listened to and action taken to allay their fears.  The Members respect and support the independence of the judiciary, an independence enshrined in the Constitution.  It is their opinion that the members of the judiciary themselves should examine the situation to see how a more uniform system of sentencing could be established.  The committee are convinced that in the interests of having a consistent level of sentencing by all judges a set of guidelines for sentencing should be laid down for sexual offences and all other serious crime.  Such action would not only allay the fears of the general public but would help to maintain a high level of respect for the law.  It is worth nothing that in Britain where the maximum sentence for rape is life imprisonment the Lord Chief Justice in an appeal case last year referred to the need for adequate sentencing and suggested guidelines a judge might follow in cases involving rape.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2481" /> I should like to ask the Minister to set out for us the procedures under which a set of guidelines for sentencing could be laid down and give us his reservations, if he has them, about this matter.  He should do that when replying to Second Stage.  It is one more of the central areas of concern for the public and on which they feel very helpless.  In this debate we must go some way towards satisfying that concern.</P>
    <P>Further issues arise such as the problems of treatment or therapy for offenders.  Research has shown that unless the behaviour pattern of sexual criminals is altered they will continue to commit crimes.  We also know that a great number of sexual abusers, sexually violent men, have been the victims of sexual abuse as children.  That is something that must be addressed in a special and concentrated way.  The Bill must aim to give maximum protection to women and this can only be done if there is a provision that a rapist takes treatment both during his prison term and after release.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what I consider to be a certain ambivalence to sexual crimes committed by men.  There is a tendency to classify rape or sexual violence under the heading of male violence. The attitude appears to be that such crimes will always be with us.  We have always had rape.  We have had rape during and after wars, and the rewards for war and so on.  We should not get too upset at the thought of getting rid of the crime of rape.  Why should we have to accept that rape as a violent crime by men against women is a crime that will continue and will be dealt with in our courts?  We know that male behaviour is more violent than female behaviour. Certainly, males respond under stress by wounding, beating or killing.  That is perhaps due to conditioning.  It may be due to societal expectations of men's behaviour.</P>
    <P>One can get a clear example of that if one looks at the number of prisoners, male to female, in any country.  We have in the region of 13,000 male prisoners but never more than 50 female prisoners. Many of the men are in prison for violent crimes.  We have to challenge the notion <Col N="2482" /> that it is almost all right for men to be violent, that it is part of their psyche, part of their make up and that rape is part of that.  I am baffled by some of the instances of rape.  In many instances the houses of old women are broken into.  They are harmless and vulnerable old women and the criminal breaks in with a view to stealing.  That may be understandable but I cannot understand why allied to that he must sexually attack and abuse such a woman.  That should raise anger in the hearts of every man.  It is such deplorable and extraordinary freakish behaviour that it should be questioned by everybody.</P>
    <P>When will men begin to question why they resort to or indulge in this type of sexual violence?  Men are guilty of violent behaviour.  We have wife beating, child beating and men engaged in violent sports such as coursing and hunting.  Men are the people who go to war and who shoot other men and women in Northern Ireland.  If women were responsible for such a grave crime as rape or sexual assault they would have confronted it, examined the motives of those involved and challenged the traditional notion of such violence.  Women in the past 20 years would not have sailed on without doing something about such crimes.  They would have formed groups and prepared reports on such crimes.  They would have tried to change the tradition in regard to them.  I do not think women would have tolerated such violence in our society. I appeal to men to take these crimes seriously.  They are the people who are perpetrating those crimes.  They have to take some collective responsibility for what is happening in society in order that different role models, new standards of value can be handed down to their sons and daughters.</P>

      <P>In all the catalogue of crimes committed against the person the crime of rape is certainly the most horrible, the most horrendous and at its very ugliest when the victim happens to be a child.  One of the sad and sickening features of modern life is that in recent times there have been so many indecent <Col N="2483" /> sexual assaults committed against children as well as against women.  Any society that treats such crimes lightly can hardly claim to be a humane and civilised society.  However, in the past ten years major advances have been made in this country in relation to our attitude to rape. These fundamental changes are mainly due to the enlightened efforts of bodies like the Law Reform Commission and the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. At this stage I would like to pay a tribute to Deputy Barnes who has battled bravely and long to change the attitudes I have just referred to.  She deserves to be commended for taking on a battle when it was less popular and less supported that it now is.  I am glad to be here this evening to pay her that tribute. These fundamental changes in attitudes are due to people like Deputy Barnes and the great and enlightened work that has been carried out by the Law Reform Commission and also to the ongoing struggle and battle that has been carried out by the dedicated workers and spokespersons of the Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>It is altogether fit and proper then that we as legislators should respond to these changes in attitudes and that our laws should reflect the concerns expressed so consistently by the people whom I have mentioned and that our laws should be well informed by the recommendations of people like those who make up the membership of the Law Reform Commission and the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and the other bodies I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is crucial.  It seeks to remedy serious inadequacies in the 1981 Act.  That Act was so inherently flawed that only a small percentage of actual rape cases could be and were criminalised.  Indeed, the law was so administered that a large number of victims have, in the past, elected not to report the crimes.  This surely is one of the saddest commentaries on the law as it was administered when a number of women elected to suffer the crimes in <Col N="2484" /> silence rather than subject themselves to the kind of probing that very often took place in courtrooms where, in many cases, more time was spent in probing a woman's previous sexual history than in probing the circumstances of the actual crime under consideration.  This, I hope, will cease when this new Bill becomes law.  The overriding principle in all legislation must be to strike a just balance between the victim and the accused.  In many rape cases in the past the victim was very often treated almost as badly as the accused.  I hope that will cease from here on in.  When this Bill becomes law I think that will happen and that a fairer balance will be struck.  I also believe that the new cultural values that are emerging, and which have been referred to by the previous speaker, will force us to confront fully and for the first time the fact that rape is a gross attack on the human dignity and the bodily integrity of a woman and that in all too many cases it leaves deep and permanent psychological and psychiatric scars and that only the severest legal sanctions can offer women, in particular, and society in general the protection it needs from crimes of this kind.  I hope that nobody will assume, from the preponderance of women speakers here this evening, that rape is a woman's issue.  It certainly is not.  It is an issue that concerns all civilised people and deeply concerns men as much as women.  I would not in any way wish from the preponderance of women speakers that it would be adjudged to be a primary concern of women; it must also become a concern of all civilised men.</P>
    <P>I welcome the widening of the definition of rape.  It is high time to acknowledge that rape can and does take place within marriage.  Indeed, many unfortunate women in this country are locked into marriages where sexual abuse, assault and rape are common occurrences. I commend the Minister for his proposal that the marital rape exemption be abolished within the terms of this Bill. I also maintain that the institution of marriage and the privacy of marriage is well safeguarded within the terms of the amendment, since prosecution in the case <Col N="2485" /> of marital rape can only be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  With that in-built precaution it is hardly likely that flimsy or frivolous cases will reach the courts.</P>
    <P>Lenient sentencing and the lack of a uniform sentencing policy is a matter that has caused grave concern in recent years. One is sometimes forced to conclude that in this respect we in Ireland have made little change in attitudes since the days when Venetian judges once listed rape as a crime against the property of husbands and fathers.  I hope that when this Bill becomes law we will finally walk away from any remnants of that attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I am confident of a major improvement as a result of the manner in which sentencing is addressed in this Bill.  Sentences are being increased for certain redefined offences.  If the law is to act as a deterrent to crime it is of fundamental importance that the punishment must fit the crime in all cases. Some of the Rape Crisis Centres have kept a record of sentences handed out in rape and sexual assault cases over a period of years.  The inconsistencies shown up in that record are nothing short of extraordinary.  If this amending legislation is to achieve its stated aims the Minister for Justice will have to address himself to this problem.  I am not quite sure how it could be done.  Perhaps he could call on the assistance of the Attorney General but one way or another how it is to be done is a matter for him but what needs to be done is this: a clear set of guidelines must be set down for our judges and they must then be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would probably be cheeky of me to say that in-service courses might not go amiss in some cases even when it applies to people who are in extremely high positions in this land.  If civil servants, teachers, typists and many other people have to undergo in-service courses to bring their skills and their attitudes into line with modern practice and modern thinking, perhaps it is time that some <Col N="2486" /> gentlemen &mdash; and they are mainly gentlemen &mdash; would take time off to bring themselves and to keep themselves abreast of current thinking in relation to the policies of sentencing for hideous crimes such as that of rape.  I have no doubt that the Minister could usefully address himself, out of the House, to this matter because what we are putting in place this evening is not something for the Statute Book, it is something we want to see enacted in all its provisions and enacted meticulously within our courts and within our judicial system.</P>
    <P>There are two matters in this Bill which I want to address particularly.  One refers to the creation of new categories of sexual offences as opposed to the widening of the definition of rape, and the second is the hearing of all cases of sexual assault in the Central Criminal Court.  With regard to the creation of new categories of offences, this Bill proposes to replace the offence of indecent assault, which has a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment, with two new offences: (a) one of sexual assault with a maximum penalty of five years and (b) aggravated sexual assault with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  Further provisions, including the practices in these cases and the places of trial, mean that for all practical purposes these offences are being treated as rape in everything but in name. The word &ldquo;but&rdquo; is crucial in this context.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report on rape recommend that rape should be defined, and I quote &ldquo;so as to include non-consensual penetration of the major orifices of the body by an inanimate object held or manipulated by any other person&rdquo;.  In refusing to accept this recommendation the Bill proposes a new offence which has become accepted as rape.  There is a strong case to be made that those who have suffered such non-penile penetration feel raped and invaded, and not just sexually assaulted. The exclusion of non-penile penetration from the definition of rape also highlights the sexual aspect of the rape crime when, in fact, rape is a crime of violence more than a crime of sex.  Therefore, this is a very important point which needs to be <Col N="2487" /> looked at again by the Minister and I suspect it may well be the subject of an amendment on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to have a look at this issue again and the redefinition as contained in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The transfer of cases to the Central Criminal Court is a step in the right direction but the speed with which cases are heard is of utmost importance in cases of rape.  Women who have undergone the trauma of rape will not undergo the healing process from that experience unless and until such time as their case has been heard in court.  The healing process of any woman who has to relive, describe and re-enact that experience months or maybe years later in a courtroom will be delayed to the detriment of that woman. It is wrong to allow too much of delay in bringing these cases to justice.  That is the only fear I have in regard to the transfer of all cases to the Central Criminal Court. On the one hand, I fully support this move but, on the other, I would caution against the effects of any undue delay.  I am sure it is not beyond the capacity of the Minister to put matters right in that respect.  The trauma of the crime is enormous. Obviously the recovery of a woman is affected by the time which elapses before the case is brought to court and the shorter that time the sooner the healing process will take place. if it is to take place at all.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It strikes a fair balance between all the different elements involved.  It is a Bill to which I can give my support.  I am certain there will be amendments on Committee Stage but in general terms there is before the House a Bill which has the support of all parties.  It is an enlightened and well-informed Bill and I am glad steps have been taken to ensure that Second Stage will be completed tonight so that it can have a speedy passage through this House.  The sooner the provisions of this Bill become law the better for everybody involved and the better for the credibility of all of us here.  This House has acted very responsibly in the manner in which it has brought in this amending Bill so <Col N="2488" /> soon after the 1981 Act.  This is one of the times when legislators have listened and in that respect we can claim the credit we seldom get from the general public.  I am very glad that all steps have been taken to ensure that this Bill goes through the House without any undue delay.</P>
    <P>As somebody once said &mdash; I am not sure who said it and perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be able to tell me &mdash;&ldquo;Let me write a nation's song and let he who will write its law&rdquo;.  Laws are very important &mdash; we should make no mistake about this &mdash; and the discussion on this Bill gives us an opportunity to say that we cannot confront fully the horrors which stem from rape and child sexual abuse. The law is not the only weapon which can and must be used to confront this problem.  There is a need for more consistent and sustained education in this area so as to shape and change people's attitudes.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be regarded as old-fashioned nowadays to refer to a time when men and women were protected within society.  Very often the protection women were afforded took on a false and phoney kindly complexion which a modern women would not welcome. That is not what I am advocating; I am advocating a restatement of those values in modern times where a society will protect and value its women and children. We could try to promote this concept within our educational system with benefits to society in general.  It is in nobody's interest that crime, petty crime and crimes against an individual have increased in modern society.  It is a contradiction of the strides we believe we are making in certain fields.  We are making enormous strides in the fields of science and technology but in many cases we seem to be going backwards in the field of human relations.  It is time that our educational system and other agencies which shape human thought confronted this area with a view to bringing back into our society some kind of more civilsed approach and attitude to young people in particular and women also.</P>
    <P>There is broad agreement in this House on the provisions of the Bill.  Everyone <Col N="2489" /> who has spoken to date has spoken with a great degree of seriousness, sincerity and goodwill.  I hope that goodwill will be reflected in the practical assistance we give and continue to give the Rape Crisis Centres throughout the country.  These centres have done an enormous amount of good work over the years, very often on a shoestring budget.  I welcome the provision of additional moneys made available for these centres in this year's budget but the system of funding of the Rape Crisis Centres is such that from year to year those who run the centres do not know whether they will have any income the following year.  It is about time we decided on some system of ongoing funding for the Rape Crisis Centres and that this would be taken on board and made as important as mainstream funding in the health services.  It is important to say this in the context of the issue we are discussing this evening.</P>
    <P>As well as doing our best to promote this Bill and enable it to have a speedy passage through this House, we as legislators must also dedicate ourselves to tackling the wider problems of crime and lawlessness which are becoming endemic in our society and of which an increased incidence of rape is only one manifestation. I welcome the Bill and pledge my party's support for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill which is a reasonable and necessary response to the climate in which we live. None of us would be in favour of frivolous charges being brought against anyone, male or female, and it is important that we recognise that there is always that possibility.  We should examine very carefully this scenario from the point of view of the victim, be they male or female.  It is not unusual &mdash; it is quite regular in fact &mdash; for young boys to be the victims of such assaults to the shame of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first concern would have to be for the victim.  Let us take the case of a young boy who is suddenly set upon and then goes home to his parents.  The question then arises as to how the matter should be dealt with and should charges be proferred. This is followed by the question <Col N="2490" /> of how the matter should be taken from there.  The legal profession are much maligned but, unfortunately, in relation to this matter, the legal system is a labyrinth given the technical arguments which may take place.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of a woman who is raped.  Again, the first question which must be considered is whether charges should be preferred.  Only last night I spoke to a lady who has served on a jury on a couple of occasions.  Her response was that if it happened to her or a member of her family she would not proceed with the charges for the simple reason that it was her experience in court that rigorous and intimidatory cross questioning took place to prove the innocence of the attacker or perpetrator with the result that the purpose behind bringing the case to court was lost and far from the issue being whether the attack took place, the whole case centred around the history of the victim and the manner in which the victim may have encouraged the attack.</P>
    <P>That is all very fine, but we can equate this with the case of a person who is mugged as he walks down the street and someone in court tries to argue that he was mugged because he had a wallet in his pocket.  To my mind, that is irrelevant. The question should be whether the attack took place and what were the circumstances surrounding it.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people who have served on juries.  Again, there have been cases where the jurors conversed about the case and were convinced of the guilt of the attacker but following the presentation of evidence and the vigorous cross questioning of the victim, the victim changed her story.  The reason she changed her story was the degree of cross questioning to which she was subjected. A mature woman would probably be in a better position to handle cross questioning, but what about a juvenile who in all cases, would still be suffering the effects of the attack?  How is that unfortunate person going to face the trauma of a trial which probably will mark her first time in court facing cross-questioning from a solicitor or counsel in the knowledge that the assailant or attacker <Col N="2491" /> is obviously going to go to the ends of the earth to ensure that he is found innocent.</P>
    <P>The one question which seems to arise again and again is not so much whether the attack took place but rather whether the unfortunate victim encouraged it, or as a previous speaker said, was looking for it.  I am amazed at the attitude which has been adopted in some quarters and that so much emphasis is placed on the history and character of the victim that they become the major issues in the trial.</P>
    <P>We also need to consider the feelings of parents who sit in on a trial, at which medical evidence is presented and where members of the Garda Síochána are called upon to give evidence.  In certain circumstances, parents may be called but they do not have a major role to play. The person with the major role to play is the victim.  There have been trials where the assailant or the attacker has sat through the proceedings with a smug smirk on his face and walked out afterwards not so much because of the evidence but rather because of the grilling the victim had to go through.  This is wrong and is a serious indictment on our society and legal system.</P>
    <P>The fact that an attack took place can be proved on the presentation of medical evidence and other circumstantial evidence. I cannot understand, the reticence to spend time grilling the assailant as well as the victim.  I want to emphasise that point.  I am not in any way involved with the legal profession and have no experience of standing in a courtroom, and I hope I never will but jurors have informed us time and again that a great deal of importance is placed on the validity of the charge &mdash; obviously it is very important that the charge be valid and this is the job of the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; but it should not take precedence to the exclusion of other important matters which are of equal importance.  In every case someone should be able to put the attacker in the witness box and subject him to the same level of cross questioning and the same rigorous interrogation most victims have to go through.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2492" /> I would now like to refer to the pleas put forward which could be anything from drunkenness to temporary insanity, to loss of memory and a whole host of doubtful pleas, with the individual claiming that he was of diminished capacity at the time of the attack.  There can be a dramatic recovery later with the assailant having no difficulty going into court, sitting with calm composure right through the proceedings and in some cases walking away.  I am not saying this happens in all cases, but it does in some.  Some of them have received, rightly, continued comment in the media.  They are possibly the exceptions and it does not happen in all cases, nor should it.  However, these cases occurred and there are instances where people who have been guilty without a doubt &mdash; and people who have sat on juries will say they were guilty without shadow of doubt &mdash; managed to walk away free.  If you ask a juror for further information &mdash; I know they are not supposed to talk but unfortunately human life is what it is, and perhaps afterwards they are entitled to talk &mdash; that juror will invariably say that the witness broke down under interrogation.  In these cases the chief witness is the victim, and if the victim is broken down in interrogation that leaves much to be desired from the point of view of the manner in which the cross-examination or interrogation takes place.  I am not so sure that within the context of the Bill ample consideration or protection is given to the victim.</P>
    <P>Obviously the sentence should be of a nature that will ensure, first of all, that the person involved is unlikely to commit that type of offence for quite a considerable time, whether for five years, ten years, life or whatever the case may be.  Equally essential is that during the period of custodial care or incarceration imposed on the assailant, there should be rehabilitation of some kind or another.  I do not want to go back over cases that are now past history, but I can recall without great difficulty a case which received considerable attention a few years ago where a person who had been convicted and served a long prison sentence on foot of such a crime was <Col N="2493" /> released, went outside the jurisdiction and was involved in a similar crime again. There is an obvious flaw in the system. Such a person should not have been released immediately into society unless somebody somewhere had an opportunity to give that person a fairly vigorous medical and psychiatric examination. Surely somebody should be able to say to society that this person has served his sentence and has been rehabilitated to some extent.  After all, society is entitled to be protected.</P>
    <P>If the individual concerned, who has been convicted of a serious and violent crime, such as rape, and having served a sentence of five, seven or ten years or whatever the case may be is then released into society on no recommendation other than that he is free, that individual can quite easily commit the same crime again or even a more serious one, and this has also happened.  There should be some relationship between the length of sentence, the seriousness of the crime and the possible threat to society afterwards unless rehabilitation of some kind has taken place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill, Deputy Fennell and others referred to education.  The obvious place for education to start is in the schools and possibly in the home, but as a society we require a considerable degree of education to get the message across to young people at an early stage that this kind of crime simply is not on, that it is a serious crime against the human being and should not be tolerated in any circumstances.  Some films, books and tabloids in their anxiety to report in graphic detail everything that takes place in such an attack may lend themselves in some way to glorifying the whole unfortunate business.  Some young people of an impressionable age may be influenced by something they read or see on film. We have another Bill to deal with the violence protrayed on the screen.  The tendency to amuse the general public with graphic descriptions and graphic details in print and on film of such issues has a certain attraction for young people, and that is unfortunate.  A countering influence is needed and it should come, <Col N="2494" /> first of all, in the schools with good sex education which would clearly leave no doubt in anybody's mind about the morality or the right or wrong in those cases.</P>
    <P>What deterrent have we?  Are sufficient deterrents available through the Statute Book and will they be available after the passing of this Bill?  There will be more deterrents after that.  I do not wish to go through them in great detail because other speakers have done so, but I have a slight doubt about attacks being pre-planned or premeditated.  Some recent cases that have received notice in the media would suggest that premediation is the order of the day.  If that is so, we must look again at the deterrent. Does the person intending to carry out the attack recognise or realise that there is sufficient deterrent to dissuade him from his intention?  I doubt that.  I believe there are reasonable grounds for suggesting, in some cases, that the individual has come to the conclusion that with a good lawyer with good legal advice on the day the case comes up in court there is a good possibility that he can be aquitted, particularly if the past history of the woman concerned can be brought into question.  We have all agreed that that should not be fundamental to the case, but in premediated rape I have the impression that if the assailant knew the intended victim and if there were suggestions as to the previous character of that person, then there could be premeditation and very serious advantage could be taken of that situation.  It boils down to the issue of whether the history of the victim is of one kind or another.  The question to be asked is whether the attack took place and under what circumstances, and diminishing emphasis should be placed on whether the victim had what is commonly referred to in some of these cases as a colourful history.</P>
    <P>There are cases where there is no premeditation but they are probably a minority. In those circumstances one must again ask how the victim is treated.  I have never served on a jury in my life.  I have spoken to several people who have done so, both men and women, in relation to <Col N="2495" /> this Bill before us.  Without exception they have said that only in very clear-cut circumstances where there was strong evidence, say from a supportive eye witness, would they consent to charges being brought either on their own behalf or on behalf of a member of their own family. If that is the case, the next question is whether this Bill will remove the pressure on the victim.  It will remove a certain amount of it, but it will not entirely remove the great onus on the victim.</P>
    <P>The victim in all cases may not necessarily be a female; it may be a young male. In the case of either the male or the female, one has to consider the trauma and the almost total disintegration of that young person's life.  One must try to imagine the huge psychological impact it is likely to have on that young person. We must also consider the attitude of the parents to the manner in which the legal argument takes place in court, which in some cases results in allowing the assailant to go free.  If one were to consult the parents about that one would get a short, sharp reminder of what they think of those proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Bill will do something to improve the position by guaranteeing the victim somewhat more protection than has been given heretofore.  The victim will not be subjected to the long, horrendous, rigorous grilling which is now the order of the day when such cases go to court.  I hope the Bill will go some way towards dismissing the attitude among women that under no circumstances would they or any member of their family proceed in court unless there was very strong supportive evidence, such as could be provided by eye witnesses.  I hope the introduction of this Bill will remove the pressures on the victim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party believe that together with the control and appropriation of women's power, the definition, distortion and appropriation and control of women's sexuality are symptomatic of our society in which male values dominate.  It would appear that in societies where there is little or no gender <Col N="2496" /> division in regard to labour, that is, in the native American cultures, rape does not exist.  However, in Ireland, as in virtually every other country, it is not an exaggeration to say that rape and the fear of rape affect all women in diverse and terrifying ways.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to legislate against rape.  We cannot pass an abolition of rape law.  Neither can we make women continue to bear the responsibility for rape by blaming women's behaviour, their dress, their walk, etc.  This is frequently used in court cases and it is deplorable.  In order to stop rape occurring we need to create a society in which women are perceived to be fully equal with men.  This includes recognising women's rights to bodily and sexual integrity and self-determination, the control of all materials and situations in which women are portrayed as lesser beings, objects, toys, possessions or second-class citizens, and the condemnation of the portrayal of women as anything other than full human beings, independent and having the right to independence from men in all intellectual, mental, physical and spiritual areas of life.  We would, therefore, propose the expansion of the definition of rape and the legal procedures involved in the trial of rapists.</P>
      <P>We welcome this Bill as a means of clarifying and updating the rape laws.  As regards the definition of rape, we would have serious reservations regarding the apparent downgrading of rape to aggravated sexual assault.  This minimises the serious nature of the offence which we believe to be as serious as murder and should be treated accordingly.  Nor does the Bill cover adequately all areas of rape and sexual assault.  We would prefer the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; to be used throughout the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe the maximum sentences and fines provided for in the Bill to be too low in view of the serious nature of the offence.  Section 12, amending section 3 of the Principal Act, regarding the admission of the sexual experience of the claimant, states that except with the leave of the judge no evidence shall be adduced which would insist that the complainant's <Col N="2497" /> past sexual experience is relevant to the case in hand and should be admissible. Many Deputies have referred to this very important matter.</P>
    <P>We welcome section 3 (2) which states that a person guilty of aggravated sexual assault &mdash; we would prefer to call it rape with violence &mdash; shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.  This is certainly suitable under our present system of law and justice in view of the seriousness of the offence. Similarly, we welcome the abolition of the exemption of an under-age person as being physically incapable of an offence of a sexual nature.  We would also welcome as a positive step the abolition of the exemption whereby a husband cannot be guilty of rape and also the provision that the juries should be comprised to the extent of 50 per cent of women.</P>
    <P>In the special and unique circumstances which apply in the cases of rape, aggravated assault and sexual assault, the claimant should be entitled to her own counsel as well as that of the State.  This would ensure that the complainant is well versed in court procedures and would feel personally protected and represented by the law.  It would help to alleviate the trauma experienced by many complainants in reliving the details of their rape.</P>
    <P>A number of points not raised in this Bill need to be addressed.  Counselling services for those who have been subjected to rape need to be widely and freely available and staffed by persons with similar experience.  Members of the legal profession need to be as up-to-date as possible in regard to information and research findings which clearly present rape as an act of violence.  The victim's anonymity should be safeguarded under all circumstances and should not be revealed even at the discretion of the judge.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation has not yet been addressed.  Provision for the compensation of rape victims for the trauma, emotional damage, counselling costs and loss of earnings should be provided for within the Bill.  Compensation should be paid to the victim of rape only and not as <Col N="2498" /> in the recent case in the US where it was paid to the husband of the victim.  This treats the raped woman as soiled goods.</P>
    <P>The relationship between rape and pornography has become well established and stringent control of the latter has been seen as a prerequisite for the control of rape in society.  The work of the Rape Crisis Centres is urgent and essential and I am pleased that more funding was made available in the budget.</P>
    <P>Finally, although the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988, goes some way towards amending and expanding the rape laws in Ireland, I feel that until people who have been subjected to rape are allowed their own counsel in addition to that of the State, until the severity of the crime is taken into consideration when imposing the sentence and until the anonymity of the complainant is safeguarded under all circumstances, the law of rape in Ireland &mdash; the Act of 1981 and the amendment Bill of 1988 &mdash; falls short of the full justice required.</P>

      <P>However, time is limited and it may not be possible to deal with all the points raised before this debate ends.  As Deputies Dempsey and O'Dea <Col N="2499" /> quite rightly pointed out, this is one of the most important Bills to come before this House for some time.  One of the most radical measures included in the Bill is the proposal to make marital rape a crime.  Deputy O'Keeffe has suggested that marital rape is not a widespread problem while Deputy McCartan argued that it is.  There are no reliable statistics on this matter but the information available from the Garda authorities and other sources suggests that a real problem exists.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies O'Keeffe, Kavanagh, McCartan, Barnes and Fennell, have raised the question of an extension of the definition of rape.  The reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and the Law Reform Commission drew attention to defects in the existing law on sexual offences.  It was quite rightly pointed out that there are certain types of sexual assaults which could be equally as serious as rape but are not recognised as such by the existing criminal law.  To remedy this defect, the Government, in the Bill, are proposing to create the new offence of aggravated sexual assault.  It will have the same maximum penalty as rape, that is life imprisonment, and the same procedures will apply to it as apply to rape.  In particular, the complainant will be afforded the same protection regarding cross-examination and anonymity as is afforded to rape victims.  In this way the defects identified in the existing law will be fully remedied.  In addition, the psychological reassurance which, Deputies have argued, women need to help them over the trauma of such sexual assaults will be supplied by the obvious seriousness with which the law will treat aggravated sexual assaults.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make the point that the issue of extending the definition of rape is not as simple or as clear-cut as made out by some of the Opposition Deputies.  Neither is it a straight choice between the existing definition of rape <Col N="2500" /> and the extended definition recommended by the Law Reform Commission. There are numerous other approaches which could be taken.  For example, in Canada when the laws were reviewed it was decided to remove completely the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; from their criminal law.  This was done partly at the instigation of women's groups who felt that the victim as well as the perpetrator was tainted by the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  The approach to be taken depends very much on the perception of the crime.  Deputies McCartan, Flanagan and Barnes argued that rape is a crime of violence, not of sexual passion and that it should be distinguished from other forms of serious sexual assault.  This is an over-simplification. The Deputies are quite correct to try to dispel the myth that the motive for all rapes is sexual lust but in doing so they are creating a new myth, that it is purely a crime of violence.</P>
      <P>It is true that research suggests that in many cases the motive for rape is not sexual gratification but rather a desire to humiliate women.  It is the use of sex to act out agression against the female sex. Rape is committed for a variety of reasons.  In some cases violence is not present either as a motive or in the actual commission of the act.  In other cases, indeed in the most violent rapes, the motivation of the rapist is that he obtains a sexual gratification from inflicting violence. It is a serious error to concentrate on the violent aspects of rape and ignore the sexual implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, in advocating a general neutral offence, have, it could be argued, fallen into this trap.  A general neutral offence ignores the fact that men, in general, are the perpetrators and women are the victims. It is interesting to note that in North America, where general neutral solutions are being introduced to reform this area of the law, they have been found to be imperfect and have fallen into some disrepute. Even within Ireland there has been at least one article written from the feminist point of view arguing against the general neutral approach suggested in the <Col N="2501" /> final report of the Law Reform Commission. The existing definition of rape places the emphasis on consent, not on assault.  This ensures the maximum protection for women as a man can be convicted of rape even when there is no evidence, for example, where there is fraud or where the woman is asleep.  To change the emphasis to assault would undermine the level of protection currently afforded to women.</P>
    <P>The Government's position is as follows. The Bill remedies all the existing practical defects in the law by making all serious sexual assaults subject to the same penalty and procedures as rape. What is left at issue is a sense of philosophical or semantic argument as to what various offences should be called. Deputy McCartan wanted all serious sexual assaults to be termed rape so as to attract the stigma attached to the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  However, as Deputy Wallace has said, the reverse could happen and by broadening the definition of rape we might actually reduce the stigma attached to rape.  The effect of bringing a number of offences within the definition of rape might well be to change the public perception of rape.  The public would no longer know when a rape, as at present defined, has been committed and as a result the odium which the public attach to rape could be reduced, thus bringing about the opposite result to that desired.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised by a number of Deputies is the proposal to have rape and aggravated sexual assault cases heard in the Central Criminal Court.  Some Deputies, including Deputies O'Keeffe and Kavanagh, argued against the proposal while others, including Deputy McCartan, were in favour of it.  The Government agreed with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that rape trials should be heard in the Central Criminal Court and have so provided in the Bill.  This, let me repeat, was not intended to be a reflection on the Circuit Court but rather an indication of the seriousness with which the Government view these crimes.  There are no appreciable delays in the hearing of cases in the Central Criminal Court and I have <Col N="2502" /> no reason to believe that the transfer of rape trials to that court will change that position.  Some Deputies referred to the number of trials in the Circuit Court in the pre-Christmas law term.  During that term there were three trials outside Dublin, lasting two days altogether, and six trials in Dublin, lasting 13 days.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern about sentencing.  We must be wary of over-reacting to isolated cases &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;isolated&rdquo;.  Over 80 per cent of the rapists in our prisons are serving sentences of five years or more and over half of those are serving sentences of ten years or more.  I would remind Deputies that sentencing policy is one of a number of issues in the criminal areas that has been referred to the Law Reform Commission for examination as part of their current programme.  Deputies McCartan, Flanagan and Fennell proposed that there should be legislation to enable the prosecution to appeal against too lenient sentences.  Any such fundamental change in our law would require detailed consideration but it is a matter that the Minister may feel should be looked at.  I am sure he will take note of the Deputy's comments on the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the question of the corroboration warning dealt with under section 6 of the Bill.  This provision abolishes the requirement for a mandatory warning regarding evidence given by a complainant in cases involving a sexual offence.  He suggested that to leave it to the discretion of the judge to give a warning would interfere with the role of the jury.  I would have thought that the existing mandatory requirement represents a greater interference with the role of the jury than the provision in section 6.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised the question of separate legal representation for complainants. This was examined by the Law Reform Commission and was strongly rejected.  The Government agree fully with the views expressed by the commission against any statutory provision dealing with separate legal representation. However, as Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan have suggested <Col N="2503" /> in the alternative, the prosecution procedures are being examined and improved by the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to assisting the victim.  These new arrangements will ensure that the complainant in the sexual case will be furnished without delay with a copy of her statement and will be afforded access to the solicitor and counsel acting for the prosecution before the hearing of the case in court.  In addition, a familiarisation course will be made available to complainants on request, in which the lay-out and procedure of the court will be explained to the complainant and in which she will be advised in very general terms of the type of question which she might be asked.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kavanagh and Fennell suggested that a complainant's sexual history should never be allowed to be used in a rape case.  The recommendation that a complainant's previous sexual history should never be raised in rape trials was opposed by the Law Reform Commission and the Government strongly supported their views on the matter.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to provide adequate resources to enable the civil legal aid scheme to be properly developed and expanded.  Nothing with concern the present crisis which has led to a virtual collapse of the service, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide an additional allocation to enable all existing centres to deal with their backlog of work and to ensure for <Col N="2504" /> the future the provision of a comprehensive range of services, and furthermore calls on the Government to enact the relevant legislation to place the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis, based on the principle that all those in need of civil legal aid but who cannot afford it will have access to it.</P>
    <P>In December 1974, a committee under Mr. Justice Pringle was established to examine the question of access to law for the underprivileged and to make recommendations as to the type of scheme which would be most appropriate to tackle this problem.  The committee reported three years later.</P>
    <P>They advocated the introduction by statute of a comprehensive scheme of legal advice and aid to be administered by an independent board appointed by the Government.  In addition to administering the scheme, the board would have responsibility for educating the public as to their legal rights and for evaluating the results of their work.  Legal services would be provided by lawyers employed in community law centres, supplemented by lawyers in private practice, and the service would be means tested.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive scheme was never implemented.  Eleven months after its publication the Government were before the European Court of Human Rights defending a claim by Mrs. Josey Airey that the State's failure to provide a scheme of civil legal aid amounted to a violation of her rights under the European Convention.  The Court ultimately ruled in favour of Mrs. Airey, holding that the State had:</P>
    <P>an obligation to take such positive action as might be necessary in order to secure an effective right of access to the Courts.</P>
    <P>It is important to note here that what was established in the European Court was a right, a right of every citizen irrespective of income.  In December 1979, the Minister for Justice laid before the Oireachtas a scheme of civil legal aid and advice and the first Legal Aid Board was appointed.  State funded services were first provided in August 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2505" /> In 1980, seven law centres in all were opened, two in Dublin and one centre in Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Sligo and Galway.  In early 1981 there were 24 solicitors in all working in the seven law centres.  By 1983 there were two extra law centres, one in Dublin and one in Cork and there were 33 solicitors employed altogether.  At present there are 12 law centres, four in Dublin, two in Cork, one in Limerick, one in Waterford, one in Sligo, one in Galway, one in Tralee and one in Athlone and there are 28 solicitors altogether employed.</P>
    <P>There are well over 3,000 solicitors in the country altogether which means that these 28 solicitors comprise less than 1 per cent of the solicitors in the country. It is a scandalous and ludicrous situation to have about one-third of the population dependent on one per cent of the solicitors in the country.  This is even more ludicrous when one appreciates that the 28 Legal Aid Board solicitors spend a lot of their time travelling enormous distances to part-time clinics and courthouses, wasting valuable time which could be more productively used, and wasting money in travelling and subsistence expenses.</P>
    <P>The following example will highlight how ridiculous and ludicrous the present scheme is, particularly for people living outside the major cities and it will also highlight how public expenditure is being wasted.  A husband and a wife living in Buncrana, County Donegal, have a matrimonial case which is pending in the District Court in Buncrana.  Both are dependent on social welfare and both are financially eligible for legal aid.  If the wife makes inquiries about legal aid she will be told that she can go along to the law centre in Sligo or, alternatively, go along to the part-time clinic in Letterkenny which operates once a month and which is run by the law centre in Sligo.  The wife will, therefore, have to travel to Sligo or to Letterkenny.  If the wife is seen in Letterkenny the solicitor in Sligo will have to travel up to see her, thus wasting the best part of the day travelling when he or she could be more productively at work back in the law <Col N="2506" /> centre in Sligo and thus also clocking up mileage expenses and subsistence expenses to be paid by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Assuming the wife consults the Sligo law centre, or its part-time clinic in Letterkenny, the husband cannot do likewise because of a conflict of interest.  If he wants legal aid he will have to apply to the law centre in Galway and the solicitor in Galway will travel to the law centre in Sligo to see him, once again wasting valuable time and incurring enormous expense to the taxpayer.  When the case comes for hearing, or even if it has to be adjourned, the solicitor for the wife in Sligo and the solicitor for the husband in Galway will have to travel up from their respective law centres to Buncrana, once again wasting time and incurring enormous expenses to the taxpayer.  What is happening in these situations &mdash; and they are by no means unusual &mdash; is that those who are entitled to apply and obtain legal aid are not doing so because of the hassle involved.</P>
    <P>At present the law centres in Dublin and many other law centres around the country are only taking on cases of a very urgent nature and urgent cases generally mean situations of serious physical domestic violence, child abuse and kidnapping. If, therefore, one's case is not of an extremely urgent nature it will not be taken on, though the applicant will usually be offered an appointment some three weeks to two months later.  Quite understandably, if somebody is offered an appointment weeks or months in advance he or she more often than not will not turn up.</P>
    <P>The people who are being seriously affected by the present crisis can be divided into two categories: those who never get to see a legal aid solicitor, and those who do manage to get to see a legal aid solicitor.  Those who never get to see a legal aid solicitor are those whose cases are not urgent and who are not prepared to wait several weeks or months for an appointment; those who do not pass the very stringent means test; and those who are put off by the stigma and bureaucracy attached to the means test.  There are those who do not bother to apply for legal <Col N="2507" /> aid because the nearest law centre is 60 or 70 miles away or more such as in the Buncrana case I already referred to, and there are those whose type of case does not come within the scope of the scheme for example defamation, social welfare or labour law cases.</P>
    <P>Those who do manage to get to see a legal aid solicitor are applicants whose case is of an extremely urgent nature in accordance with the Legal Aid Board's criteria.  They will generally get to see a legal aid solicitor without too much delay and will generally be provided with a good service by a competent solicitor though, or course, such an applicant could encounter other difficulties associated with the scheme such as the law centre being 60 or 70 miles away from his home, the stigma attached to the means test, etc.</P>
    <P>Then there are those whose cases are not urgent and who are prepared to wait many weeks or months for an appointment. A typical example of such a person would be somebody with a matrimonial problem.  Even though such a person could be living in an intolerable situation, that person's case will not be treated as an urgent case if there is no serious violence, child abuse, or threat of kidnapping.</P>
    <P>If such a person sees a solicitor and the solicitor endeavours to sort things out by way of a separation agreement but fails, the solicitor cannot do any more, that is to say, the solicitor cannot apply for legal aid, which means getting a legal aid certificate for a court case because the case is not of an urgent nature.  The Legal Aid Board are only processing legal aid certificates in urgent cases.  The solicitor who takes on such a case, which is a very typical case has his hands tied.  If he cannot conclude an amicable settlement by way of a separation agreement or otherwise, then there is nothing more he can do because he cannot institute court proceedings.  Solicitors in private practice acting on the opposite side of such a case are in a position to do much better for their client because they know that the legal aid solicitor on the other side has his or her hands tied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2508" /> Overall control of policy remains vested in the Government rather than the board.  The power of amending the scheme is vested in the Minister for Justice and expansion in terms of staff numbers or law centres can take place only with the consent of the Government. There is a heavy representation of civil servants on the board.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the functions of the board the Pringle report had attached considerable importance to the requirement that the board should publicise the legal aid scheme.  They said that research abroad had shown that, even where a legal aid scheme had been in existence for many years, a high proportion of people in poor financial circumstances were either unaware of its existence or did not understand what it involved. Accordingly, one of the specific functions given to the board was the arrangement of suitable publicity concerning this scheme.  However, in their first year the board reported that they felt it would be wrong to invite the public to avail themselves of a service which was already overstretched and which was not being provided with the resources to meet the extra demand which would be generated by the publicity.  No publicity campaign has been engaged in since 1980.</P>
    <P>FLAC, the voluntary free legal aid centres, have stated that the vast majority of callers to their 'phone-in service were unaware of the existence of the State scheme.  The board have been described as providing one of the State's secret services.  The failure adequately to publicise the existence of the scheme may of itself amount to a breach of the European Convention obligation to take any necessary positive action in order to secure an effective right of access to the courts.</P>
    <P>The board are, and have been from the outset, seriously under-funded.  The crisis now facing the civil legal aid service was an entirely predictable one &mdash; it was predicted by the Legal Aid Board in each of their annual reports since the establishment of the scheme in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice seek to place this in the context of overall public expenditure control.  In an article on &ldquo;The <Col N="2509" /> Civil Legal Aid Scheme &mdash; Scope and Operation&rdquo;, published in the Gazette of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, 4 April 1989, Timothy Dalton, formerly deputy chief executive of the Legal Aid Board and now Assistant Secretary of the Department of Justice, wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>There is a general awareness that the main difficulty faced by the Chief Legal Aid Scheme is the lack of resources necessary to provide a nationwide service. The Board has been delivering this message in its annual reports over the years and the matter has also been the subject of comment in the media and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Limited funds for public services are of course nothing new at the present time &mdash; it is part of the process of putting public finances generally in shape and the Board fully recognises this.  The Board has also recognised that, despite the restrictions on Exchequer funding generally in recent years, it was fortunate to be in the position of actually expanding the service during 1985 and 1986.</P>
    <P>The board's statement on which the above passage seems to have been based was made in their annual report for 1986, the last report to be published and dated March 1988.  Under the heading &ldquo;Failure to Meet Demand&rdquo; what the board actually said, at paragraph 3.4 was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>But of course, the primary reason for the inability of the legal aid service to meet, the demands made on it is that the financial resources necessary to respond to the demand have not been made available.  The Board appreciates that an inadequacy of funds to run essential public services is nothing new at the present time and that many would see it as part of the price that has to be paid for putting the public finances in better shape.</P>
    <P>However, it has always made the case &mdash; and continues to do so &mdash; that the situation of the Civil Legal Aid service differs from others in that it came into being just at the time when pressures on public funds became <Col N="2510" /> acute.  It has not, therefore, been a case of cutting back on an existing provision which was deemed over-generous, but of having a completely undeveloped service caught up in a general policy of public expenditure containment.</P>
    <P>In reality, there never was a national legal aid service from which cutbacks could be expected; the service was strangled at birth.  As I said earlier, there are now 28 solicitors employed by the board, fewer than some firms in Dublin.  Remember, to keep this in perspective, there are 3,500 solicitors in private practice in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are 12 full-time centres; the board estimate that at least 33 are required.  There are six centres outside Dublin and Cork.  In June 1987, the board chairman, Niall Fennelly, SC, told a seminar on legal services that the Government's undertaking to introduce a legal aid scheme had not been even remotely honoured and that one could not depend on Government acting consistently in delivering funds to their legal services.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the recommendations of the Pringle report no community officers are employed under the scheme, there is no education or research role and, although there is provision for the establishment of local consultative committees, no such committee have yet been appointed.</P>
    <P>In their first annual report the board pointed out:</P>
    <P>if the aims of the scheme are to be realised, it is essential that in the early years the provision of funds necessary for development should be given priority... The Board has at all times recognised that its obligation is to make the new social service available on a nationwide basis for those in need... However, the history of events since the first centre opened has been a matter of considerable disappointment to the Board.  In a nutshell, the Board has not been provided with the funds necessary for expansion although it did and still does stress that it cannot discharge its obligation to provide a proper legal aid service unless speedy <Col N="2511" /> approval is given for expansion of the service.</P>
    <P>In the first report in 1980 the board noted that they had been informed by the Department of Justice that the scheme would be put in statute form at the first suitable opportunity.  They also noted with some disappointment that they had hoped to expand from its initial seven centres to 33 in 1981; in the event the amount provided in grant-in-aid was less than half the amount which the board had considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Based on those restricted funds they submitted proposals and received approval for the opening of four new centres in 1981.  After having advertised for staff they were then informed that any recruitment would contravene the public service embargo introduced in July 1981 and expansion plans were abandoned.</P>
    <P>The public service recruitment embargo has had a disastrous effect on the operation of the scheme, preventing the board at times from maintaining even the limited level of service which they initially achieved.  As might be expected, young solicitors tend to move in and out of the legal aid service more quickly than the general run of public servants, especially when there are no opportunities for development or promotion within the scheme.</P>
    <P>The first report also identified some problems which have remained with the service ever since and which have contributed greatly to the present crisis. First, in order to ensure that both parties to a dispute were not obliged to attend the same law centre, arrangements were introduced whereby one of the parties in that situation would be represented by a solicitor from another centre.</P>
    <P>The annual report in 1980 commented on this arrangement as follows:</P>
    <P>This arrangement is costly to operate and it disrupts the running of law centres. From an Exchequer point of view the expenditure involved in sending a solicitor from, say, Galway to Sligo to defend a maintenance summons in the <Col N="2512" /> District Court can hardly be said to represent value for money.</P>
    <P>The whole reason for this waste is the prohibition on availing of the services of solicitors in private practice, even where those services would be vastly cheaper.</P>
    <P>Second, in their first year the board established part-time clinic services in some towns which had no law centre. These clinics are served by staff in existing centres whose manpower is reduced &mdash; often halved &mdash; as a result.  The board concluded that &ldquo;there is a very definite limit therefore to the improvement of services which can reasonably be expected by opening clinics&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In areas serviced by part-time clinics there is no provision at all for such urgent cases as, for example, barring order applications.  Again, litigation stemming from a clinic has to be conducted in the local court so that service in the nearest centre is halved, not only on the day a solicitor from that centre travels to conduct a clinic but also on the day he travels to appear in court on a case arising from that clinic.</P>
    <P>The Pringle report had recommended that legal services should be provided by a combination of legal aid centres and private practitioners.  They said that &ldquo;the provision of a comprehensive nationwide legal aid and advice service must involve private practitioners... we consider that a service provided exclusively by legal aid centres would be impracticable outside a few of the larger centres of population&rdquo;. This recommendation was ignored.</P>
    <P>The experience of the 12 law centres, together with 18 part-time clinics which open one or two days a month, has borne out the prediction of the Pringle report that it would be impossible for them to provide a comprehensive nationwide service. Rural Ireland is largely unaffected by the civil legal aid and advice scheme.</P>
    <P>Even in the larger urban areas the centres cannot cope with the demands imposed upon them.  At any given time it is not unusual to find some or all of the four Dublin centres closed to all but emergency cases, so that arrears of work may be cleared.  The first such temporary <Col N="2513" /> closures took place in 1981 and have been an annual feature ever since.  The scheme has collapsed to become an emergency family law service only.  Given that 97 per cent of all casework consists of family law matters, it is clear that access to the law is virtually non-existent for many people.</P>
    <P>Every annual report of the board has adverted, in increasingly desperate terms, to the same four issues: lack of resources, which prevent it from expanding to provide a comprehensive, nationwide service; the restricted means test; the public service recruitment embargo; and the need to put the scheme on an independent and statutory basis.  As the board pointed out in their 1985 report, &ldquo;one of the consequences of having an inadequate, underfunded legal aid scheme is that it effectively renders progress in the field of law reform virtually irrelevant to a great many people&rdquo;. Recent reforms in family law, for example, are of no practical benefit to those in need unless they also have effective access to legal services through legal aid.</P>
    <P>In his foreword to the 1986 report, the last to be published before his resignation together with that of two other board menbers, Mr. Niall Fennelly, SC, wrote:</P>
    <P>In December 1977, a distinguished committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Pringle, reported on the introduction at an early date of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in civil matters.  The scheme established by the Minister in December of 1979 was the offspring of that report.  It was poor tribute to the work of the Pringle committee that its tenth anniversary had to be marked by Mr. Justice Pringle's own comments on the limitations and deficiencies of the scheme and his disappointment, which I deeply share, that ten years after the publication of (the) report, so few of the recommendations in that report have, in fact, been implemented by the State.</P>
    <P>After eight years, 12 law centres represent the &ldquo;comprehensive scheme&rdquo; which was apparently desired by the <Col N="2514" /> State in the mid-1970's.  In 18 counties there are no law centres although, in some of these, the Board tries to provide a part-time service by attendance on one or two days a month. Obviously, there are large areas of the country where there is no civil legal aid service at all for those who are unable to afford legal services from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Even in Dublin, where there are four law centres, the need for services so outstrips resources that applicants for legal aid have to wait for weeks, or even months, for an appointment with a solicitor.  The well known adage is that justice delayed is justice denied.  I can only regret that justice has to be denied in so many cases.</P>
    <P>Whether a legal aid scheme depends for the provision of services on community or State controlled law centres, special provision has to be made for legal aid in remote areas.  The Pringle report, the Legal Aid Board and many other commentators have recognised that a comprehensive nationwide service cannot be provided in remote areas without recourse to the services of private practitioners who would be remunerated for this type of work from a central fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice in 1980 described the civil legal aid scheme by saying &ldquo;The scheme... puts the poor person into a position of a person of modest means&rdquo;.  But it is not enough simply to provide a poor man with the services of a rich man's solicitor.  A scheme of legal aid and advice must be seen as part of an overall policy to combat poverty.  One of the ways in which the problem of poverty can be tackled is through the use of the law on behalf of the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>At a basic level an individual needs access to the law in order to vindicate income-generating rights, for example, his right to redundancy pay or to compensation for injuries suffered in a road traffic accident.  An award of money following on legal intervention can alleviate poverty.</P>
    <P>But the law is also capable of tackling <Col N="2515" /> the problem of poverty at a more profound level by redressing the balance of power through the creation of substantial rights for the underprivileged.  An aspect of poverty is the powerlessness of its victims and their lack of control over their destinies.  An effective legal aid scheme would allow such people to vindicate such rights as they already have under the law and would also identify those areas where reform is needed to build up a corpus of rights inhering in the underprivileged. The function of legal aid should be to provide the poor with access to the law and the courts for two purposes: to enforce laws enacted to protect and benefit the poor and to influence the development of law to provide a fairer share of justice for the poor.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, one of the essential characteristics of an effective legal aid scheme that it be community based and controlled.  The reason why the State rejected the concept of community law centres is readily apparent.  In his article in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> already referred to, the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Justice wrote:</P>
    <P>No doubt, one of the aims of any review which will take place in the context of introducing a statutory measure will be to simplify the scheme. The degree to which simplicity can be achieved, however, is limited.  One of the main reasons for this is that civil legal aid is not just a matter of providing persons of limited means with access to justice &mdash; though this is its principal aim &mdash; it also means that a very powerful weapon is put in the hands of individuals who happen to qualify whereby they can, with the backing of State resources, take others who do not qualify literally to any court in the land.  The potential for abuse in that situation is clear and the need for effective control mechanisms is equally clear.</P>
    <P>The law does not have an innate tendency to occupy a position of equilibrium between the various sections of society; it reflects the relative political strength of <Col N="2516" /> various interest groups.  If the law is to have a role in combating poverty and the powerlessness born out of hardship and deprivation, control of the legal aid scheme must be vested in those for whom it is established.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because it is such a &ldquo;very powerful weapon&rdquo; that legal aid should be controlled by those whom it is intended to benefit.  This requires the establishment of neighbourhood law centres based in and identifying with local communities and run by committees representing those communities. Another obstacle to law is the fact that many people are unaware of the legal dimension to their problems and do not think of consulting a solicitor.  This illustrates the need for a programme of public legal education conducted through schools, residents associations, youth groups, etc., such as is undertaken at present by the State's only community law centre at Coolock and which was advocated in the Pringle report.  Such a programme would require the appointment of a community officer at the law centre responsible for liaison with the local interest groups.  Apart from his educational function, he would have the function of ensuring that the centre took an active role in identifying the legal issues and the areas of law reform of most concern to his community.  The law centre should not simply be a State-funded equivalent to a private practice; its strength, as shown in Coolock and in Belfast, lies in the fact that it is locally based and responsible to local needs.</P>
    <P>The scheme for civil legal aid and advice has collapsed to become an emergency family law service only, in those limited areas of the country where it is established.  There is no access to the law for the bulk of those who cannot afford to pay for their own lawyers.</P>
    <P>The principal problems impeding access to law include both lack of finance and ignorance of one's rights.  As introduced, the scheme never attempted to deal with the latter problem.</P>
    <P>The scheme as established, even if adequately funded, could not cope with the un-met legal need.  It is essential that <Col N="2517" /> community law centres, based in the areas they serve, be established.  Such centres would be managed by committees controlled by representatives of the local communities, run within the guidelines set down by legislation and supervised by an independent statutory legal aid board. The staff would include community officers responsible for education courses for local groups, liaison with the community, research into the legal needs of the area and proposals for law reform.</P>
    <P>Such law centres should be established in large urban areas and in large and small towns throughout the State.  The centres should be able to provide representation not only before courts but also before tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal, social welfare appeals, etc., which are at present excluded from the scheme.  In practice, these tribunals form the arena in which the rights of the poor are adjudicated.  In rural areas legal aid should be available through a panel of private solicitors.</P>
    <P>The details of the scheme must be comprehensively advertised.  Failure to inform the public defeats the whole purpose of the scheme, which is to improve access to the law.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion, we do not seek to pretend that any party has had a monopoly of wisdom in relation to this scheme.  It is clear that the Government of which I was a member did try, through the Funds of Suitors legislation, to expand the service, and to protect it from the financial cutbacks of that time.  When we come to reply to this debate, we shall show that the Government have not lived up to the responsibilities imposed by the right of access to legal aid, and have ignored the opportunities for greater economic growth.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I will conclude by asking simply for the maximum support possible for this motion.  There is no party in this House which has not at one time or another paid lip-service to the principles inherent in access to the law.  Now is the time to translate that lip-service into action, by supporting this motion.  I want to share some of my time with Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading the speech on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, who is out of the country at present and is unable to be here for this motion.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes with approval that, for the first time since the establishment of the Scheme of Civil Legal and Advice, the Grant-in-Aid to the Legal Aid Board has been increased by a significant amount; recognises that the increase in Exchequer funding of £425,000 over the Grant for 1989 will enable the Board to continue in operation four Law Centres which otherwise would have had to close and will also enable the Board to recruit a substantial number of staff to fill the vacancies at Solicitor and administrative levels; and acknowledges that in the context of present financial circumstances and the need to curb expenditure which is paramount in the Government's strategy, the increased resources made available to the Board is a reflection of the Government's commitment to the Civil Legal Aid Scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to make the point at the outset of this debate that, despite the continuing and pressing need to contain public expenditure, this Government in fixing the Estimates for 1990 took into account the particular difficulties of the Legal Aid Board and made provision to increase the grant-in-aid to the board.  It is the first time since the setting up of the scheme that its grant-in-aid has been increased by a significant amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2519" /> The grant for 1990 represents an increase of Exchequer funding of £425,000 over the grant for 1989.  That is a substantial increase of Exchequer money of some 25 per cent and will enable the board to continue in operation four law centres, previously opened with Funds of Suitors moneys, which would otherwise have had to close.  Needless to say the Minister is pleased to be in a position to provide an increase in Exchequer funding of some 25 per cent this year.  It will also enable the board to recruit a substantial number of staff to fill most of their vacancies &mdash; in all the board will be enabled to recruit 20 additional staff including seven solicitors and some 13 administrative staff.  Arrangements are well in hand with regard to the placing of this staff.  I understand the board is in the process of recruiting these solicitors and the administrative staff should be in place shortly.  I intend to see that any further staff shortages in the board will be treated as sympathetically as possible.</P>
    <P>Despite that provision of extra resources at a time when public finances are under strain and when no area of the public service has been exempt from necessary restraint, there have been resignations from the board on the grounds that the provision made is not all that is required.  I regret that.  What has been provided by the increase made in the grant-in-aid for 1990 will alleviate the board's problems to some extent.  I am taking steps to have the vacancies on the board filled.</P>
    <P>I may say that subsequent to his resignation I was happy to receive a letter from the former Chairman generously acknowledging the Government decision made at my instance and acknowledging that this was the first significant attempt to address the problems of the scheme for several years past although he did not, of course, find it possible to agree that enough had been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to dwell on a <Col N="2520" /> point here for a moment and I may come back to it again throughout my contribution to the debate on this motion. The point is that when the opening of four law centres in the period 1985 to 1987 is left out of the reckoning, as it should be, because the moneys used to pay for them were not from the Exchequer, what did the parties on the other side do for the scheme when they were in Government for five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the answer the Minister has for the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Could they not find it in their hearts to act on the plea from the chairman in the board's 1983-84 annual report regarding the problems of the scheme at that time?  It is quite clear that a separate measure was taken just to fill a hole for a time but no guarantee of Exchequer funding was given to the mechanism of the Fund of Suitors moneys.  However, the Minister is now making real money available in a significant way for the first time.  I will quote from the foreword to the report which states:</P>
      <P>It is, however, a matter of very considerable regret to the Board and to myself, as Chairman, that it is not possible to present this report without adverting to some very serious problems which continue to stand in the way of providing a proper legal aid service on a truly nationwide basis.</P>
      <P>The Board has been the subject of severe criticism from a wide variety of individuals and bodies, on the basis of the inadequacy of the service provided. This criticism is unfair in that it fails to recognise that the central problem is inadequate funding, a matter outside the Board's own control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We acknowledge, of course, that the constraints on public finances are a serious problem for Government at any time.  Nevertheless, we are strongly of the view that a higher priority should be given to the provision of civil legal aid services, the <Col N="2521" /> need for which is felt by the poorest section of the community.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, what the Board has to acknowledge above all else, after five years of operation, is that the Legal Aid Scheme is still very far from providing the type of comprehensive national service that was envisaged at its introduction.</P>
    <P>That is what the chairman said during the period of office of the Members from the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>As if that was not enough, what about the chairman's foreword in the 1982 annual report which was considered by the Government in November 1984? Again I quote:</P>
    <P>The Board has been disappointed to find the scheme virtually frozen at a very early stage in its development.  In his introduction to the 1980 Annual Report, my predecessor recorded that it had been hoped that by the end of 1981 the number of Law Centres would have at least trebled.  Unfortunately, this is still far from realisation &mdash; the only progress made in the meantime has been the opening of one additional Centre in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Matters were made worse by the impact of the embargo on recruitment in the public sector which has, at times, prevented the Board from even maintaining the level of service that was then achieved, due to its inability to replace solicitors leaving its service.  It is only right, however, that I should record the Board's appreciation of the assistance received from the Minister for Justice and the Minister for the Public Service in achieving a recent modest alleviation of this impact.  But we are still faced with a situation where a number of our Centres are forced quite frequently to close their doors to any cases other than emergencies.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it ill becomes members of the main Opposition parties to criticise this Government especially when, as I have said, the biggest ever injection of cash in the board's history is being made available to them by this Government.  If we <Col N="2522" /> check the records for the years 1982 to 1986, the annual increases in the board's grant-in-aid were £90,000, £40,000. £172,000 and £245,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate for me in the context of this debate to say something about the history of the legal aid scheme.  The civil legal aid scheme has been in existence for some ten years.  It was established following the report in 1977 of the Pringle Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice and the main features of the scheme had been approved by the Government in May 1979, that is, before the decision in the Airey case was delivered by the European Court of Justice.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of putting the record straight with regard to the judgment of the European Court in the Airey case.  It has been said, and may be repeated in this debate, that the introduction of the civil legal aid scheme was a response by the Government of the day to that judgment and was forced on the Government by the judgment.  The facts of the matter are that, following the earlier commitment which resulted in the establishment of the Pringle Committee on Legal Aid in 1974, the Government announced in May 1979 that they had approved of the main features of a scheme of civil legal aid and advice and undertook to introduce a detailed scheme by the end of that year.  The decision of the European Court was delivered in October 1979.  The detailed scheme was published as promised in December 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its judgment the European Court did not decide that Ireland was in contravention of the European Convention <Col N="2523" /> on Human Rights simply because a civil legal aid scheme was not in existence. What the Court decided was that violation of certain Articles of the convention had occurred because the applicant in the case did not have an effective right of access to justice.  Legal aid as such was not the issue and, in fact, the court had already ruled that there is no direct right to legal aid under or by virtue of the provisions of the convention.  The court did indicate that a civil legal aid system is one way to facilitate access to justice, but it is clearly not the only way.  Simplification of court procedures and increased jurisdiction for the lower courts are other ways.  Since then the Courts Act, 1981, which greatly increased the jurisdiction of the lower courts, especially in family law matters, has contributed to making justice more accessible.</P>
    <P>The legal aid scheme was established in 1980 because it was justified in its own right and as being something in respect of which there was already a strong commitment. The purpose of the scheme is to enable persons of limited means to avail themselves of legal services.  The scheme was introduced and has so far remained on an administrative basis.  I will come back to this aspect later.  It is administered by an independent board and services under the scheme are provided by salaried lawyers working in law centres around the country.  While eligibility for legal aid and advice under the scheme is means tested, the eligibility limits are modelled on the framework recommended by the Pringle Committee and are quite generous.  That was because it was intended that the new service should not be restricted to applicants in the weakest economic class, for example, social welfare recipients, who could afford to pay little or nothing for the cost of legal aid and advice but should apply also to people who were better off and who could afford to contribute a reasonable proportion of that cost from their own resources.  A means-test based on disposable rather than gross income was <Col N="2524" /> recommended by the committee in order to achieve more equity.</P>
    <P>Disposable income is the income which remains when various deductions are made from gross income, gross income being defined as total income received from all sources.  The deductions to be made from gross income &mdash; referred to as &ldquo;allowances&rdquo;&mdash; include, for example, income tax, mortgage repayments, rent, social insurance, VHI contributions, expenses in travelling to and from work together with various allowances in respect of the applicant's spouse and dependent children.  Following a third revision of the means test provisions in May 1986, a person will qualify for services under the scheme if his annual disposable income does not exceed £5,500 per annum.  Obviously, with the various allowances that can be made, an individual with the usual family commitments could qualify for legal service on a gross annual income considerably in excess of £5,500.  The board's annual report for 1985 contained various examples, one of which showed that a married man with three children and fairly typical commitments will still qualify for legal aid on a gross income of almost £14,000 per annum, though there have been a few cases where a gross income of £18,000 was involved.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides also for a merits test.  The essential question for the purpose of assessing the merits of any application for legal services is whether, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...a reasonably prudent person whose means were outside (those specified in the Scheme) would be likely to seek such service at his own expense, if his means were such that the cost involved, while representing a financial obstacle to him, would not be such as to impose undue financial hardship...</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>a competent lawyer would be likely to advise him to obtain such services.  The purpose of the scheme, in other words, is not to put the person of limited <Col N="2525" /> means in the position of a person for whom money is no object, but in the position of the person whose means, while not over-abundant, are sufficient to cover essential legal services.</P>
    <P>The scheme enables legal aid and assistance to be given in a wide range of proceedings with limited exceptions.  It is mainly availed of, as Deputies will be aware, in family law proceedings. Incidentally, I have heard criticisms in some quarters about the preponderance of family law cases in the board's caseload. I do not know what the basis for that criticism is.  The board have no say as regards the types of cases that they deal with under the scheme.  They simply reflect the demands which are made on them.  Unfortunately the board's experience shows that the extent of marital breakdown in our society, as in other countries, is on the increase.  The board have to deal with the legal fall-out of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government must in turn deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If that means that there is greater pressure on the civil legal aid scheme in this area of the law rather than, say, in tort actions or personal injury cases, then that is simply a reflection of where the pressure in our society is.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the scheme reflect generally the recommendations of the Pringle Committee who I have referred to and in some respects the scheme as introduced was more ambitious in scope than the committee anticipated in their report.  The committee had felt that it might be necessary to introduce a more limited, interim scheme first, but in the event the scheme that was adopted was based on the committee's blue print for a comprehensive scheme, though subject to specific exceptions.  These exceptions may be found in legal aid schemes in other countries also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme commenced in 1980 with seven law centres, two in Dublin and one each at Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Sligo and in 1982 another centre was opened in Dublin at Ormond <Col N="2526" /> Quay.  There were plans at that time for further expansion of the scheme by opening a number of additional law centres but these plans had to be shelved because of difficulties with the public finances.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, was enacted and this allowed unclaimed funds of suitors in court to be used for a number of purposes one of which was civil legal aid.  By use of these non-Exchequer funds it was possible to open four new law centres at Tallaght, Tralee, Cork &mdash; a second centre &mdash; and Athlone.  At one stage it was hoped that further additional centres &mdash; four in all &mdash; could be opened if sufficient moneys remained in the dormant accounts after various other specified commitments which arose under the Act had been met. In the event there were not sufficient suitors funds remaining to enable those centres to be financed in addition to the four already opened and it was not possible to allocate Exchequer funds for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters to reiterate the point I made at the start of my contribution to this debate, namely, that the difficulties of the Legal Aid Board are not new.  Almost from the beginning there has been criticism about inadequate funding but the continuing financial climate was such that successive Governments &mdash; not just this Government &mdash; found themselves in the position of not being able, because of other pressing demands, to increase significantly the amount of taxpayers' money going to the provision of legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the legal aid service has not been the only area which has complained of lack of funding. There has hardly been a branch of the public service which has not had to suffer, necessarily, the effects of the basic need to curtail public expenditure in an effort to get this country on its feet again.  What I am saying is that the problems of the legal aid service are not unique, and I would repeat again that the recent Government decision and the additional allocation to the scheme which I have mentioned is the most significant effort made yet to improve the situation of the <Col N="2527" /> service, and that was done despite the continuing need to exercise restraint in regard to public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Since coming to the Department of Justice and following a meeting I had with the former chairman of the Legal Aid Board and the chief executive I decided that my first priority in relation to the civil legal aid scheme must be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since coming to the Department of Justice and following a meeting I had with the former chairman of the Legal Aid Board and the chief executive I decided that my first priority in relation to the civil legal aid scheme must be to halt the decline in the legal aid service which had occurred.  My intention was, in other words, to get the existing scheme operating as smoothly as possible and to secure the necessary funds to <Col N="2528" /> enable that to be done, before considering what further expansion of the service should or could be authorised. I think that is a logical and reasonable approach and one which I am only too happy to defend.</P>
      <P>The first problem was that four centres had been operating by use of non-Exchequer funds which were exhausted. Unless specific provision of extra Exchequer moneys was made available, those centres would have had to close.  I regard it as a matter of some personal satisfaction that I was able to get Government approval for Exchequer funding for these centres.  The uncertainty over their future has been removed once and for all and those centres may be regarded as a permanent part of the board's network of 12 law centres.  It has been said that as the extra money made available for these centres merely replaced other funds previously available, there was no overall extra provision.  The fact is that there is a real and substantial increase of taxpayers' money involved and nothing can take from that.</P>
      <P>The second immediate problem was that because of the effect of the embargo on the filling of vacancies which applied generally throughout the public service, there was a large number of unfilled posts both at solicitor and administrative level which was creating severe problems for the board in coping with the volume of work.  Of course many other areas of the public service had to contend with the same problems.  I was able to secure the approval of the Government for the filling of all solicitor vacancies and most of the administrative vacancies.  When all the staff are in place I expect to see a gradual improvement in the overall situation with regard to the provision of services under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on this motion I expect to hear calls for fundamental changes in the scheme, calls to expand the service to cover appearances before tribunals, test cases, education as to legal rights, social welfare matters and community involvement.  I also anticipate that there will be demands to use the <Col N="2529" /> services of private practitioners, as indeed suggested by Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about these matters.  In relation to appearances before tribunals, the main reason these cases are excluded under the scheme is simply because it was felt that this was necessary to discourage a growing trend towards legalism in what were originally and deliberately designed to be informal and non-legal for settling disputes.  The tribunals in question would mainly be in the areas of labour, planning and social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>I realise there is an argument now for representation before such tribunals and the principal reason is that these areas of the law have become so complex that legal representation might be considered necessary.  I have no difficulty with that but the problem is that to extend the scheme to tribunals would be costly. There is no way the scheme could cope without a considerable increase in resources.  That is just not possible at this stage so the development of the scheme on these lines will just have to wait.</P>
    <P>The present scheme does not extend to providing representation in test cases and this has been criticised.  As a question of policy, I do not think the scheme should be involved in so called test cases. These would be expensive and would eat up the available resources to the detriment of more deserving cases.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that we should broaden our view of the scheme in order to make each law centre a means of access to education in relation to law and rights and a focus for community activity in these areas and a means of access to power in the community &mdash; in the context of knowledge being power. The function of our civil legal aid system is to provide people who would otherwise be unable to afford it with a means of vindicating their rights under the Constitution and the law, and the scheme was drawn up with that in mind.</P>
    <P>To give law centres an unrestricted function in relation to education on legal rights and in &ldquo;identifying hidden need&rdquo; would in all probability lead to constant pressure on the Government of the day <Col N="2530" /> for more and more State funds.  Education on legal rights could cover an extremely wide field and &ldquo;hidden need&rdquo;&mdash; in the context of civil disputes &mdash; is a very elastic concept, the scope of which would depend as much on the sociological view of the lawyers and others involved as it would on some more objective criterion. While there may be a case to be made for work of this nature, it is not in my view appropriate to the legal aid scheme, the purpose of which is simply to provide people of limited means with an opportunity of having their problems determined by a court.</P>
    <P>The fact that the present scheme precludes the use of private solicitors is another criticism that has been made.  Again, the reason for their exclusion is on grounds of cost.  A comparison should be made with the situation in England and Wales.  Control over the legal aid system in that jurisdiction was originally in the hands of the law society and was an &ldquo;off the street&rdquo; system.  By that I mean a person with a grievance could walk into a private solicitor's office and obtain advice or legal representation.  It proved to be extremely costly, so costly in fact that the control of the system was recently taken out of the hands of the private practitioners and given to an independent board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I am not totally opposed to the use of private practitioners and there are situations in which it may be possible to make use of private practitioners in the operation of the scheme.  I am thinking, in particular, of cases involving adjournments of legal aid cases and the more efficient use of money and staff resources in servicing the Legal Aid Board's 19 part-time law centres. I would be against an &ldquo;off-the-street&rdquo; system but that is not to say that the private practitioner could not have a part to play in the development of the scheme. That is something I intend to look at. In fact, I have asked the board for any <Col N="2531" /> proposals they might have in that regard. Any proposals they may make will be considered carefully by me and if I think there are benefits I will have the matter further examined in conjunction with the law society.  My intention is that anything done on these lines should be done by better use of existing resources and without extra cost.</P>
      <P>With regard to community involvement the scheme already in paragraph 6.3.2 it provides for consultative committees. One such committee already operate in the case of the Tallaght Law Centre.  It is open to the board to encourage the development of such committees in other locations serviced by their law centres.</P>
      <P>The motion before us calls for the enactment of legislation to put the legal aid scheme, which at the moment is an administrative scheme, on a statutory basis.  It was always the intention that legislation would be brought forward for that purpose.  In the beginning it was realised that a period of a few years should be allowed to pass in order to see how the scheme as established was working and whether problems were arising on the ground because of the structure and form of the scheme which would have to be corrected before the scheme was set in statutory form.  Here again I note that the Chairman's calls for a statutory scheme were ignored by the earlier Coalition Government.  In the board's 1985 annual report which was considered by the then Government in December 1986 the board referred to the confirmation by the then Minister for Justice that legislation to put the scheme on a statutory basis was then being put in hand.  What happened?  Consider the 1983-84 report considered by the Government in February 1986 where the Chairman said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter of considerable concern to the Board &mdash; and one which has been repeatedly voiced by my predecessors and myself &mdash; is the need to put the scheme on a proper statutory basis.  It was certainly not the intention that it would still be a non-statutory <Col N="2532" /> administrative measure five years after its inception.  The Board strongly urges the Government to give priority to the long promised legislation.</P>
    <P>What happened? &mdash; nothing.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the 1982 report considered by the Government in November 1984.  The Chairman said:</P>
    <P>...the Board is also of the view that it is desirable to place the Legal Aid scheme on a proper statutory basis and hopes the Government will see its way to preparing the necessary legislation in the near future.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that other Governments, besides the present and previous Governments, have failed to bring forward legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable amount of drafting work has in fact been done towards the preparation of the legislation and a number of useful suggestions as to changes needed, arising from the working of the scheme over the years, have been received from the Legal Aid Board. However, I regret that it has not been possible up to this point to introduce a Legal Aid Bill.  I know that in recent years this has been due to pressure of other demands for legislation on my Department and the fact that the Department, like the Legal Aid Board, have had to put up with staff reductions due to the embargo on the filling of vacancies in the public service.  I intend that the work already done on preparing the legislation will be brought to completion so that a Bill can be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the point, however, that the absence of legislation is not an impediment to the provision of legal aid services to the public and that the enactment of legislation, of itself, would not solve the basic problems that the board have encountered.  Even if the Legal Aid Board had by this time been placed on a statutory basis, they would still depend for their resources on Exchequer moneys and accordingly would still be subject <Col N="2533" /> to the same constraints to which other bodies in the public sevice are subjected.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, my first concern was to get the present scheme operating as smoothly as possible and I have taken steps to achieve that.  What has been done is the most we can afford at this stage.  I am of course conscious of the fact that the scheme has not been developed to the extent originally envisaged and I accept that the present network of 12 centres is less than the nationwide service intended.  It was unfortunate that specific plans for further expansion drawn up some years ago had to be abandoned. The board have put forward proposals for expansion but these would cost a substantial amount of money, far in excess of current expenditure on civil and criminal legal aid combined.  In 1990 the total cost of both systems of legal aid will be close on £5 million.  In line with my predecessors I am anxious to see the service expanded as soon as we can afford it but this obviously can only be done on a phased basis, depending on the availability of resources and other demands.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the recent enactment of the judicial separation legislation may put additional strain on the Borad's ability to cope.  That Act extended radically the grounds on which a judicial separation can be obtained and gives power to the courts to make various orders in relation to income and property which courts up to this have not had.  That is expected to result in the making of many more applications for judicial separation, many of which will be the subject of application for legal aid.  I intend to look at that aspect in the context of the 1991 Estimates by which time we should have a clearer picture of the effects of that legislation, which has only been in force since October 1989.</P>
    <P>The question of further expansion of the scheme depends entirely on the availability of public financial resources.  The extremely tight constraints on those resources now and in the foreseeable future have important implications for policy in relation to the further development of the scheme over the short to medium term.  It imposes on us the clear <Col N="2534" /> obligation to use the limited resource that are available in the most cost-effective way to optimise the benefits to the community.  My approach is entirely in keeping with that objective.  I want to see the existing service working smoothly before I give any further consideration to the expansion of the scheme by opening additional law centres.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again that the decision of the Government to increase the grant-in-aid to its highest level ever in 1990, especially at a time of very limited public resources, is a mark of the Government's commitment to the scheme and underscores the importance which the Government attach to it.  It also demonstrates that further expansion of the scheme on the model I have outlined &mdash; through the opening of additional law centres on a phased basis &mdash; will be authorised when the prevailing financial circumstances permit it.</P>
    <P>I would not like to let this occasion go by without paying tribute to the staff of the board who experience considerable pressure in their work.  As the board pointed out in their 1986 annual report, the solicitor staff in particular are working in a stressful area at the best of times due mainly to the nature of the cases they have to deal with.  Added to that pressure is the difficulty of coping with staff shortages which of course imposes even greater burdens on the staff.  Whatever difficulties may have arisen with the scheme I have never heard anything but the height of praise for the dedicated professionalism that has come to be associated with the staff who are providing this important social service, and they will shortly have an additional 20 members.</P>

      <P>I would like to record a note of appreciation to the Labour Party on behalf of Fine Gael for the placing of this motion in their Private Members' Time, and to inform Deputy Kavanagh and other Members that we will be supporting the motion tomorrow night.</P>
      <P>It is now four weeks since the resignation of the two prominent members of the Legal Aid Board.  Obviously, if it were not for that resignation we would not be discussing the present crisis in the civil legal aid scheme.  It is extraordinary that the resignations attracted absolutely no positive response from the Minister for Justice or his Minister of State here this evening.  The Government's failure to provide a proper system of civil legal aid denies access to the courts to those in need and thus ensures in our society inequality before the law.  It is a nonsense to suggest that there is any such thing as equality before the law while hundreds of thousands of people, the vast majority of social welfare recipients, are denied access to the courts and to the law because of the shambles into which the civil legal aid scheme has fallen in the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, in this debate and in an Adjournment debate on this matter which was held in November last, as well as in Justice debates generally, has treated the House very shabby.  Earlier in the day we had a Justice debate, later on we will have a Justice debate and I see the Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture, who was busily deputising for the Minister for Agriculture, now wearing the cap of the Minister for Justice. How much of this can the House tolerate?  The failure of the House to <Col N="2536" /> debate the civil legal aid crisis either by way of Private Notice Question or an Adjournment Debate since the resignations highlights the inadequacy of the manner in which urgent matters may be brought to the attention of the national legislature.</P>
    <P>The funding of the legal aid centres has figured prominently in a number of past debates and is a topic which has been referred to during the debate on every Estimate for the Department of Justice in the past three years or longer.  There would appear to be general agreement on all sides of the House that the fundamental weakness is one of money. When the board were set up 11 years ago it was stated that they would have the money, the personnel and the resources to help people to obtain legal advice who did not have the means otherwise to do so.  As a way of helping these people to secure the protection of the law it was welcomed by all at that time.  Since then we have seen the system deteriorate almost to a farce.  The operation of civil legal aid over the past decade shows that the service provided is more imaginery than real.  It is not unusual to see a six month waiting list for an appointment to discuss a legal matter.  Some people must travel over 50 miles to queue at a law centre.</P>
    <P>The resignation of members of the Legal Aid Board was by no means a surprise.  The chairman had on a number of occasions informed the Government of his frustration as chairman of the board. That sense of frustration is manifest in the 1986 annual report, paragraph 3.1, page 10.  The problem would appear to be money.  The centres cannot give the aid and advice necessary to meet public demand because of the lack of basic resources.  The present annual budget to operate the entire scheme amounts to £2.1 million, which sum can be placed in context by noting that it is marginally higher than the funds allocated from the national lottery to sporting endeavours in the west in 1989.  The Minister must between now and tomorrow night, if the Minister for Social Welfare can contact him, give a firm commitment that he will <Col N="2537" /> increase the funding of the centres with a view to shortening the waiting lists for clients at the 12 centres around the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that new applications for civil legal aid by people who cannot afford a solicitor are being refused on a daily basis because of staff shortages.  One has to have an extreme emergency, such as child abuse or serious violence against a spouse, in order to obtain immediate legal aid.  I am sure the Ministers and members of the Government party have noted at their constituency clinics problems of people not being able to obtain legal aid from the local law centre, if there is such a centre in their constituency.</P>
    <P>The full-time law centre in Athlone can be cited as an example of the system breaking down.  A document obtained from that centre states that from time to time the centre is unable to take on new clients due to pressure of work and unless additional funding is provided many people who are entitled to legal aid will be left without access to their rights.  Despite the inadequacy of the service and the increasing demand for legal aid, the law centre will have to close unless additional funding is provided by the Government. That is just one of a number of similar complaints from law centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Much publicity was given 18 months ago to the setting up of a part-time centre in my constituency at Portlaoise but to state that there is Mickey Mouse service available from that office constitutes a gross offence to Mickey Mouse and certainly no disrespect to the hard working staff at that centre, who had to suspend operations because they could not cope with the basic demand and the right of people to have access to the courts.  Statistics clearly show that approximately 75 per cent of legal aid cases relate to family law matters, concerning mainly domestic violence, barring orders, custody orders, orders related to the sexual abuse of children and nullity decrees.  The law centres have such a demand on their service from a family point of view that the legal aid service deals almost exclusively with <Col N="2538" /> family law.  This is not surprising when one considers the programme of law reform which has been completed since the board were set up in late 1979.  Legislation such as the Status of Children Act, the Family Law Act, the Adoption Act, the widening by the courts of the nullity laws and the change in jurisdiction of the civil courts, have all led to an increased demand for services.  More than anything else, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act of 1989 which came into effect on 19 October last will be meaningless unless accompanied by increased Government resources to the civil legal aid scheme.  The Minister must be aware that without a significant expansion of the scheme this Act will in practice be available only to people who can afford to discharge the hefty legal costs involved.  At every law centre throughout the country there were people anxiously awaiting 19 October, most of whom have got little or no remedy since that legislation was enacted.</P>
    <P>This ensures a certain inequality before the law which is undesirable in a western democracy.  It is surely wrong that the rights under law passed by this House to benefit all the citizens of the community can only be enjoyed and exercised by those who can afford to dig deep into their pockets to gain access to the courts. That is access, not redress, which is what the court system is all about.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread agreement in the House on the need to establish the scheme on a statutory basis.  This argument has been lost over the years because of the need to highlight funding as being the main problem.  There has been no real attempt at having the legal aid scheme recognised on a statutory basis, although it was stated by successive Ministers for Justice that the Department had already prepared the groundwork in this regard.  In the foreword to the 1986 report the chairman quoted from the previous report when he expressed the hope that the scheme would be put on a statutory basis within the coming year.</P>
    <P>During the Dáil debate on the introduction of the scheme in 1980 the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, who <Col N="2539" /> has since on a number of occasions sat in the same seat at Cabinet, indicated that it was his intention to place the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory basis as soon as that could be done.  The idea was to have the scheme up and running initially on a non-statutory administrative basis.  In the first annual report of the Legal Aid Board the question is referred to and it is stated that the present scheme of civil legal aid and advice is non-statutory.  It was introduced on an administrative basis in order to get the scheme into operation with the least possible delay.  The chairman's comment in the foreword to the 1983 report has been quoted by the Minister.  I will not repeat the continuing clamour from successive chairmen on the need to establish the board on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>In 1986 when addressing the Seanad on a civil legal aid motion the then Minister for Justice, now Leader of my party, said he was glad that recently he was able to inform the chairman of the board that work had commenced in his Department on preparing the necessary legislation and he expected that progress would be made on that front fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, a general election followed some weeks later and it was not possible for that expectation to become a reality.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister for Justice to put a time scale on the placing of this legislation before the House.  The heads of a Bill have been lying around the Department at least since 1986.  The plight of the law centres and the legal aid scheme is not one which can be addressed in the long term just by increasing the allocation of funding. Admittedly, there is need for an emergency, fire brigade action in this regard but nevertheless it is time we looked at the broader aspect of legal aid.  It is a sad fact of life that the poor and, indeed, the not so poor, are unable to gain access to justice.  We should now be looking at the concept of a small claims court which would deal with cases more quickly and less expensively.  The court, in the form of a consumer claims court, would deal with defective goods and services and small claims of a civil nature.  This would allow people who have a grievance to have it adjudicated upon without the need to spend vast sums of money.</P>
      <P>There is frequent criticism of the small claims court structure in England due to a preponderance of claims by financial institutions using the small claims court to obtain a judgment against the consumer and hence using that court as a stick with which to beat the consumer.  I believe this might be answered satisfactorily by a small claims court having jurisdiction to hear claims only at the suit of an individual and not of a limited liability or trading company.  It has been said that there has been some form of constitutional barrier to the setting up of such a court and I would ask the Minister to clarify matters in so much as he can in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of legal aid at present, in reality does not allow a consumer to bring an action for defective goods.  One of the most comprehensive pieces of consumer legislation introduced since the founding of the Civil Legal Aid Board was the Sale of Goods Act, 1981, under which people are unable to seek civil legal aid if they have a grievance.  Neither does the civil legal aid scheme cater for cases that regularly occur in contract, tort and property matters.  The massive over-burdening of <Col N="2541" /> the system by family law matters underlines the inadequacy of the entire scheme.  Any comprehensive reform of the scheme must be considered in tandem with the setting up of a small claims court to deal effectively, efficiently and economically with matters of a civil nature.</P>
    <P>There are many people who are in need of legal advice and legal aid but do not get it due to the constraints under the scheme on advice in areas dealing with the family.  For example, in the social welfare appeals area there is a whole body of law which is being far removed from the consumer.  Ideally, a system of civil legal aid should encompass social welfare tribunals, unfair dismissals and employment appeals tribunals, arbitrations, all matters with which our citizens have to deal from time to time.  It is a fact of life that the general public cannot avail of many of the statutory tribunals which this House, over the years, has established for the simple reason that the financial assistance which is necessary when facing such a tribunal is not available.</P>
    <P>The issues to be debated must include the future direction of civil legal aid and the model that would be most beneficial to the needs of our society.  The relevance of the original decision in the Airey case and the recommendations of the Pringle Committee must be fundamental to any discussion.  This debate is not going to answer the important question of the future of the scheme, nor is it meant to, but I would refer the Minister to a paper published by FLAC and the Coolock Community Law Centre entitled &ldquo;A Joint Discussion Paper on the Legal Aid Services&rdquo; wherein is discussed the concept of a legal services board to provide a national legal aid service through the setting up of community law centres, with a back-up of contracted private solicitors. I trust that some consideration might be given to that by the Minister in the overall approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The centres would provide such a service as legal aid, court appearances, research, law reform and educational projects.  Would the Minister consider setting up an all-party Dáil committee to <Col N="2542" /> examine the direction in which legal aid should go between now and the end of the century?  That committee could examine the report of the Pringle Committee, a comprehensive report worthy of scrutiny which has not, in my view, been fully examined by this House since it was first published in 1977.  The House, in the course of this debate, should be reminded of the principal recommendations of the Pringle Committee report.  Lest we forget the shameful lack of progress made in civil legal aid over the past 12 years, I would refer Members to a summary of recommendations.  If the Minister is not going to address himself to all the recommendations, he might read the summary of the recommendations on pages 149 and 150 of the report, quotations to which time will not allow me refer.</P>
    <P>There have been many references since the Pringle Committee report to the concept of phasing in that underlines the sham to which the service available has been reduced in recent times.  The Pringle Committee report recommends that civil legal aid and advice should be provided by means of a combination of private practitioners and legal advice centres.  It also recommends the concept of a panel of solicitors and that is something that we should seriously consider.  Thirteen years after the report was published the Government are not even admitting that the present scheme is an interim scheme and a measure along the way towards providing society with a comprehensive system of civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>In short, Pringle advocated the implementation of a legal aid and advice scheme to be administered by an independent legal aid board appointed by the Government.  That board would not only administer the scheme but would provide an educational element, informing the public on legal matters also.  At present one of the main difficulties is the lack of independence of the Legal Aid Board. Therefore the effective control of the scheme at present lies with the Department of Justice and not with the board, and that is something that needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2543" /> Any expansion of the scheme, recruitment of staff and amending of the scheme in any way, can only take place with the expressed consent of the Minister for Justice and the Government of the day. This is so inhibiting as to render the Legal Aid Board deficient.  Local communities, therefore, have no input into the scheme and centres are rarely charged with a task greater than court appearances.  The fact that the Legal Aid Board have no say in the expansion of the scheme or in the recruitment of staff is very much regrettable and has contributed to the present crisis.</P>
    <P>I make these points to underline my contention that funding alone is not the solution to the problem, although increased funds are very badly needed at present.  I would urge the Minister, as an interim measure, to make a decision on funding prior to the end of this debate. Indeed, the Minister has, by virtue of the Government amendment, referred to funding but this is exactly the same reference that was made last October, It is money that was allocated prior to the resignations.  If the House is going to note with approval the extra allocation of funding, what is all the fuss about in the Legal Aid Board?  Why have there been resignations?  Why is there a continuous clamour from people saying they are denied justice if we are going to note with approval what the Government have done?  In effect, the extra allocation of £425,000, about which the Minister has spoken in such laudable terms, will just about keep open the four centres opened in 1986 under the then Coalition Government. When the Minister says he is undertaking a positive service towards the expansion of civil legal aid by giving £425,000, he is forgetting to make a deduction for the drying up of the funds under the Funds of Suitors Act, which leaves a net increase of something considerably short of £200,000, an increase we in this House should not be proud of having regard to the system that is operating at present.</P>
    <P>If concepts of access and equality are to be taken seriously, we must consider a <Col N="2544" /> community-based model which identifies closely with the needs, demands and wishes of the under-privileged in our society.  The only example of that in this country is that which exists in Coolock. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I would like to pay sincere tribute to those who work in the law centre in Coolock under very difficult circumstances.  They do not get a penny from the Department of Justice. They got a few bob from the Minister for Social Welfare and also from the Combat Poverty Agency but I do not think that is a vehicle by which we should be providing legal aid to the consumers. The Coolock Law Centre have also taken a considerable amount of burden and pressure off the Legal Aid Board.  If it were not for them, the crisis that exists throughout the Dublin centres would be even greater.  The resignations by members of the Legal Aid Board over the past few weeks and the amount of time spent writing to the newspapers, even after the extra allocation by the Minister, is a reflection of the dire need to tackle the problem and I do not believe the Minister has even come near that.</P>
    <P>The only significant improvement was the decision in the mid-eighties by the then Government to expand the scheme by setting up centres in Tralee and Athlone and a second centre in Cork and Tallaght.  As the Minister said, funding was from the Funds of Suitors legislation. That is gone now and for that reason the amendment in the name of the Minister is nothing more than a fraud.  There is no real increase in cash at all, no matter what kind of gloss we might put on it in terms of amending motions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions that I had hoped might have been addressed in the debate but as the Minister for Social Welfare, who is sitting in for the Minister for Justice, is not even going to listen to the debate I will put the questions to the House for the record.  Does the Minister accept that an element of private involvement in the system is to be recommended having regard to the huge areas of rural Ireland in which there is no service and the constant strain on resources that appearing in far-flung <Col N="2545" /> courts imposes on solicitors operating under the scheme?  Eighteen counties have no service.  Does the Minister now accept the urgent need to keep each centre open and operational and will he commit himself to the provision of eight new law centres throughout the country?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that the legislation of recent years affecting the family has had an enormous effect on legal aid &mdash; for example, the legislation I have already mentioned &mdash; and that the Legal Aid Board resources will be further stretched when the 1989 legislation comes on stream?  Does the Minister accept that article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights is now being honoured and that there is real and practical access to the courts for the people, having regard to our present system of legal aid?  It is of vital importance that if a scheme of legal aid is to be offered to the people, the future of the system be at least debated in the House.  I would refer the House to paragraph 13.1, page 24, of the 1986 report which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Kavanagh asked that the penalty for the offence of public indecency set out in section 18 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, be updated.  The Minister will look at this matter between now <Col N="2546" /> and Committee Stage to see if this Bill would be the appropriate vehicle in which to consider making the suggested changes.</P>
      <P>I would not like the impression to be given that most persons accused of rape are acquitted.  For a start it must be remembered that if the prosecution has a very strong case it is unlikely that it will ever go to trial as the accused will probably plead guilty.  In the five year period 1983-1987 criminal proceedings for rape were initiated in 174 cases but during this period only 53 cases had to go to full trial.  Of those who went to full trial 43 per cent were convicted, 51 per cent were acquitted and the jury disagreed in the remainder of cases.  About 60 per cent to 70 per cent of cases do not ever go to a full trial because the accused pleads guilty and is sentenced or because the prosecution case is so weak that a trial is not warranted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dempsey raised the possibility of changing the burden of proof for rape cases from the existing criminal one of &ldquo;beyond all reasonable doubt&rdquo; to the civil one of &ldquo;on the balance of probabilities&rdquo;. He made this suggestion I suspect in the belief that the number of persons accused of rape who escaped conviction was extraordinarily high.  I hope that the figures I have quoted reassure him that this is not the case.  Even if it were true, while I could sympathise with his motives it would not be the appropriate response to the problem.  Changing the burden of proof in a criminal case to the balance of probabilities would raise a number of constitutional issues and in addition it would increase the risk of innocent people being convicted of crimes.</P>
      <P>At the outset of the Debate it was pointed out that the treatment of sexual offenders is a separate matter and outside the scope of this Bill.  Nevertheless, I am aware that Deputies including Deputies Kavanagh, McCartan, Flanagan, Barnes and Fennell are concerned with this issue and I will briefly outline the present position regarding the facilities which are available in the prisons to deal with those sentenced for sexual offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2547" /> First, it is accepted that whatever services can reasonably be made available to change the attitude and behaviour of those convicted of sexual offences should be provided.  It is also common cause that the successful achievement of this goal is notoriously difficult, given what is involved.  It is unfortunately the case that many offenders in this category have little interest in changing their attitudes or their behaviour towards women and many, in fact, persist in denying their guilt or seek to blame external factors, such as drugs or alcohol, for their offences.  In many cases experience has shown that a considerable time elapses before an offender is prepared to discuss his problem and its underlying factors.</P>
    <P>To try to improve the situation and reduce the risk of reoffending by offenders on release, various approaches are used by those dealing with the prisoners. Individual counselling has, up to recently, been the major approach.  This counselling is carried out by a welfare officer, psychiatrist or psychologist and, of course, chaplains have a particular role in this area.  Recently a group approach has been introduced at Arbour Hill Prison and the progress of this group will be carefully monitored to see what changes emerge.  This multi-disciplinary approach is appropriate and correct.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to a submission made by the Probation and Welfare Officers Branch of UPTCS about the treatment of sex offenders and went on to suggest that it was dishonest to suggest that developments undertaken by probation and welfare staff were departmentally contrived and established.  It is not helpful or accurate to suggest that these developments did not have the support of the Department.  The probation and welfare service is part of the Department and is responsible to the Minister for Justice of the day.  &ldquo;The people working in the field&rdquo; as Deputy McCartan describes them are actually officers of the Department, and it is nonsense to suggest that the work they are doing as part of their duty is something &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; on the Department, any more than the work <Col N="2548" /> of psychologists, chaplains and others is &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; on the Department.</P>
    <P>It is part and parcel of the work of both management and staff within the service to develop and implement &mdash; in conjunction with other agencies and the prison authorities &mdash; appropriate strategies for dealing with offenders.  This they have been doing and I am happy to place on the record of the House appreciation of the work they have been carrying out in this area over many years.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that the recent innovations introduced in dealing with sex offenders at Arbour Hill Prison offer grounds for hope.  It would be a pity if the difficulties inherent in such work were to be added to by groundless suggestions of a lack of support for such important developments when clearly what is important &mdash; and what is being achieved &mdash; is co-operation and understanding between the various agencies and diciplines in approaching this difficult area.</P>
    <P>As indicated at the opening of this debate, programmes which prove successful will be continued and, where appropriate, extended.  However, a point that must be emphasised is that there is no treatment process to which people can be subjected which will lead to a cure. The efforts of those professionals dealing in this area must be commended but their efforts cannot be guaranteed to lead to success in any individual case.  It is unreasonable to expect, or as some do, demand that this should be the case and it is simply not possible to change this unfortunate reality by legislation or to provide for mandatory treatment which realistically cannot take place in the absence of the consent and co-operation of the individual.</P>
    <P>I was quite surprised, as I am sure were others in this House, to hear Deputy McCartan suggest that the Prison Service should compel all sex offenders to undergo assessment and treatment. Apart from the human rights implications, what would be the value of a mandatory requirement that psychiatric treatment be provided in cases where the medical view was that the cause of an <Col N="2549" /> offence did not lie in any psychiatric disorder or where, for example, an offender simply refused to speak with a psychiatrist?</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that any and every approach to the question of providing appropriate treatment is considered carefully, but it is not clear how it would be either appropriate or useful in the context of the present legislation, or indeed other legislation, to include any reference to particular approaches to treatment.</P>
    <P>With regard to monitoring sex offences after their release from prison, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, the Minister for Justice can authorise the temporary release of an offender.  The release may be made subject to certain conditions such as the supervision of the probation and welfare service or attendance at a treatment centre.  If an offender breaches any of the conditions attached to the release he can be returned to custody to serve the balance of the sentence.  Existing legislative arrangements, therefore, allow for the supervision of an offender on release providing, of course, that the release takes place prior to the time the sentence of imprisonment has expired.</P>
    <P>In the case of an offender released on expiration of the sentence imposed by the courts no conditions can be attached to such a release.  Any change in this situation would raise complex legal and constitutional issues.  Traditionally it has been a matter for the Executive to administer the sentences imposed by the courts taking into account, among other things, any improvements in the attitude of an offender while in custody.  This, for example, enables conditional early release in certain cases.  I can assure the House, however, that given the grave nature of the offences involved the question of temporary release for sex offenders is approached with great caution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell raised the question of drunkenness being used as a defence in rape cases.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that under existing law self-induced intoxication is not a valid defence to rape. Deputy O'Dea spoke on the definition <Col N="2550" /> of aggravated sexual assault.  The Law Reform Commission, as Deputy O'Dea said, recommended the inclusion of &ldquo;or is committed while the accused has with him a weapon of offence or by a person in a relationship of authority over the victim&rdquo; in the definition of aggravated sexual assault.</P>
    <P>This matter was considered in detail when the legislation was being prepared and the view was taken that the carrying of a weapon, or the relationship of the parties, should not of themselves turn what might otherwise be a relatively minor offence into a very serious crime meriting a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  The definition of section 3 (1) of the Bill will cover the circumstances envisaged where the assault is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that the words &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo;, &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeble-minded&rdquo; in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, be replaced by the words &ldquo;mentally handicapped&rdquo;.  This matter is not free from difficulty because it is not simply a matter of replacing existing words with new words.  It would seem to be necessary to define any new phraseology that might be used and establishing such new definitions raises complex, legal, psychiatric and social issues.  This matter is being fully considered by the Law Reform Commission who have recently produced a consultation paper on offences involving the mentally handicapped.  We should await the commission's final recommendations before making any changes in the law in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions to this very important debate on the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988, which deals with a matter which is of great concern to us all.  The generally constructive, mature and responsible approach taken by Deputies during the debate reflects credit on this House.  One may not always have agreed with everything that was said but <Col N="2551" /> one must respect the viewpoints put forward and the sincerity with which they were expressed.</P>
    <P>In the short time available I regret I have not been able to reply to all the points made.  I have endeavoured to deal with as many as possible and I am sure that Committee Stage will afford Members an opportunity to deal with the more specific issues of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on bringing this Bill before the House.  The Government deserve credit for the considerable effort undertaken to raise public awareness of the effects of water pollution.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to strengthen the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and the updating of legislation to enable statutory sanctions to be relevant to present-day water pollution.  The Bill reflects the Government's concern about environmental issues and their resolve to act decisively to protect our waterways, by legislation where necessary. This Government's resolution to protect Ireland's envied status as an environmentally clean country is manifested by the presence of this Bill before the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed, nationally and internationally, about the <Col N="2552" /> rise in the level of nitrates in water, surface, coastal and ground water.  This increase poses two major environmental problems.  The first is in relation to the safety of drinking water suppled and the second is the eutrophication of inland and coastal waters.</P>
    <P>The Commission has set a level for nitrates of 50 mg per litre in drinking water.  If the level in supplies exceeds this level the water must be treated or blended with clean supplies so that the level is reduced below the Commission's maximum level.  This process of treatment and blending is expensive and does not always solve the problem; it is not easy to use this process on Community projects.</P>
    <P>The second problem caused by excess levels of nitrates is eutrophication. Nitrates are often responsible for eutrophication of marine waters and the subsequent appearance of algae blooms. These blooms cause great damage to the tourist value of the affected areas.</P>
    <P>There are two main sources of nitrates; the first is agriculture and the second is municipal waste water discharges.  EC proposed directives will ensure that action is taken between neighbouring EC countries.  This Bill will form the framework for the structures and guidelines for the protection of our environment.  We must be vigilant so that Ireland's special conditions are reflected in EC guidelines, our soil types and rainfall amounts must be taken into consideration.  In this regard research programmes are vital so that relevant tolerances are known for Irish conditions in relation to fertiliser applications, land spreading of livestock manures and the siting of domestic and municipal waste disposal infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Climate and soil type are two factors which have a big bearing on the behaviour of environmental pollutants. Because of the interaction between climate patterns and soil type, legislation guidelines must take into account Ireland's particular conditions.  For example, we record much higher rainfall values than most of neighbouring Europe.  Our soil structure is also different and these facts must be taken on <Col N="2553" /> board when the guidelines are being framed to satisfy recent EC proposed directives.</P>
    <P>With the air we breathe, water is the most important life-sustaining element of our environment.  It affects every facet of life, the food chain, the industrial process, leisure activities, etc.  As a country we have an international reputation as a land of clean, clear and relatively unpolluted waters, both coastal and inland.</P>
    <P>A well informed public is becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of our drinking water, the status of the water used in the food and drink processing industries, the water of our rivers and canals from a fishing and amenity perspective and the condition of our coastal and sea waters from a fishing and tourism point of view.  Although it may be outside the ambit of this Bill, it is surely necessary that local government authorities collaborate with the new environment monitoring agency to keep the threat of nuclear contamination of our seas &mdash; particularly the Irish Sea &mdash; under close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The quest for higher productivity, both industrial and agricultural and the increase in urbanisation, are putting enormous strains on our environment.  A proper balance must be achieved between the production of food and consumer goods and the safeguard of our eco-system.  A programme of education will ensure that most of our population will adhere to the guidelines laid down. We cannot allow a small number of careless, thoughtless people to pollute our waterways and sabotage the livelihoods of the thousands engaged in the agri-food sector and our expanding tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland's clean image abroad is funded by a belief that our air, soil and water are pollution free.  These natural elements form the essential components of our agri-food industry which is so vital to our economic development.  We must leave nothing undone to protect this country's envied status as a green and clean land. Ireland's expanding tourist industry is also capitalising on our reputation as an environmentally friendly destination for <Col N="2554" /> people.  Much depends on our ability to maintain our present status.</P>
    <P>To date, in developed and developing countries, the safeguard of the environment has been entrusted to the population largely on a voluntary basis.  With increasing industrialisation, urbanisation and the intensification of agriculture, it is obvious that some statutory control will have to be imposed.  It is important to recognise that the vast majority of farmers manage their farms properly and do not contribute to pollution.  Under the 1977 Act, provision is made for summary offences carrying fines of up to £250 and indictable offences with fines of up to £5,000.  The new Bill proposes to increase these limits to £1,000 and £25,000 respectively.  Initial concern surrounded the imposition of a £25,000 fine but it is important to recognise that this fine only applies to an indictable offence.  Indictable offences may not be prosecuted by local authorities or fishery boards but, instead, by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Non-polluted water is vital for the development of our tourism and food processing industries.  In Wexford, for example, economic developments depend to a large extent on the development of the above industries.  We welcome the Minister's announcement of £400,000 for the drainage scheme at Selskar, Redmond Road area of Wexford, but I would ask the Minister to consider giving the go-ahead to Wexford Corporation for the main drainage scheme. At present, sewage is going into Wexford harbour through 27 outfalls and is untreated.</P>
    <P>Modifications in certain food production techniques may well be a necessary development, particularly in environmentally sensitive regions.  A heightened awareness of the environmental impact of some intensive agri-production systems and a growing demand by consumer groups for food products of high nutritional value and quality are paving the way for a revival of interest in organically produced food. As I said, the country enjoys the image <Col N="2555" /> of having ideal conditions for the production of pure food.  Food exporting is of such importance to Ireland that we simply cannot afford to miss out on any changes or shift of emphasis at the top end of the quality food market.  The Government's appreciation of the possibilities in this sector was recognised in the budget when £450,000 was allocated to organic farming.  The board of Teagasc have instructed Johnstown Castle Research Centre in my constituency to make available resources for research into many aspects of organically produced food.  Any expansion in organic farming will be beneficial economically because their products attract premium prices at the marketplace and also such a food production system is environmentally friendly.</P>
    <P>The initiation of an organic farming research programme at Johnstown Castle complements fully the role that that world famous research centre plays with respect to environmental studies related to agriculture.  This is surely further compelling evidence that Johnstown Castle should be given some consideration for designation as a centre of excellence for agricultural research by the EC.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment the Minister on the measures he has already taken to prevent water pollution.  The Bill will help us to maintain our relatively pollution-free image.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for the speedy introduction of a water pollution Bill is accepted by everybody.  After all, pollution-free rivers, lakes and beaches are desirable from many points of view. Indeed, the real potential of our tourist industry will never be fully realised until we can boast of clean unpolluted rivers, lakes and beaches.  In fact, we have exceptional potential in Tipperary South Riding for fishing in the River Suir.  The passing of a water pollution Bill will enhance our attraction in the future as a fishing resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have serious reservations about certain aspects of the Bill.  It will impinge on and restrict modern farm practices.  The <Col N="2556" /> Bill is contradictory in the control it gives to local authorities to monitor the activities of other people and yet does not contain a provision for the monitoring of the activities of local authorities.  The Bill places the industrialist and the farmer in a position where they must be able to prove that they could not reasonably have foreseen a pollution problem looming and they must prove that to the satisfaction of the court.</P>
    <P>To allay people's fears on those serious issues I suggest that there is an urgent need for the re-establishment of the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  That body should advise the Minister on pollution legislation and ensure fair implementation of the provisions of the Bill.  Such a council should consist of experts in agriculture, industry, fisheries, tourism and local authorities.  They could advise the Minister on all aspects of pollution control legislation and ensure fair implementation.</P>
    <P>The pollution of our waters is caused by three major sources, farm effluent, especially silage; industrial pollution, and local authority pollution in the form of sewage.  In 1987 Foras Forbartha attributed 70 per cent of pollution to urban industrial sources and only 20 per cent to agriculture.  I recognise that silage effluent from farms is a most serious pollutant in itself.  However, to the credit of farmers, fish kills caused by farm effluent in 1988 had been reduced by 75 per cent over the 1987 level.  This major improvement is due to the educational programme launched by Teagasc and the co-operation received from farmers. Indeed, the increased number of planning applications received by local authorities from farmers and industrialists is a clear indication of the commitment by them to rectify the pollution problem. There will, of course, be the exceptional few who will not comply and will operate in definace of the law.  Those offenders must be penalised so that the good work of others is not neutralised.</P>
    <P>The cost of coping with and preventing a population problem is immense and we cannot expect farmers to be capable of raising the necessary finance unless <Col N="2557" /> adequate grants are provided and, more especially, that prompt payment of them is guaranteed.  I must remind the Minister that the costings for buildings, as operated by the farm development service, are out of date.  They should be increased by 20 per cent to bring the costings up to today's building costs.  Farmers will only respond positively to their responsibility in pollution control if the Government are consistent by providing adequate costings for buildings and prompt payment of grants.  Likewise, the cost to the industrialist and local authorities will be immense.  They must be provided with adequate inducements by the Government. It is pointless to introduce this Bill unless potential pollutants are given sufficient incentives to respond to the enormous demands that the provisions of the Bill impose on them.</P>
    <P>The Bill in its present form could be very restrictive on modern farming practices. It proposed strict and statutory liability on matters which impinge on the very fundamentals of farming and the right of a farmer to his livelihood by stock rearing, silage making, tillage and the use of fertilisers.  My deep concern is that farmers will not be allowed to spread effluent, dung, slurry or fertilisers in any area where there is a drain.  The key issue is that county councils, with good intent, will have power to make by-laws restricting or preventing the spreading of slurry. This could have disastrous consequences for farmers.  The regulations in this regard should be modified to meet with reasonable modern farm practices.  I also believe that local authorities and Teagasc should play a supportive role to farmers in pollution control by providing appropriate advice and information.</P>
    <P>From my study of the Bill it appears that sewers, which are largely the responsibility of local authorities, are excluded.  It appears they may pollute into the most important fish waters with complete impunity.  Some of the worst pollution has been from sewers according to an EC study of Irish beaches during the past year or so.  The exclusion undermines the real fight against pollution and makes local authorities judges in their <Col N="2558" /> own case, something that is legally repugnant and difficult to understand given the absolute liability imposed on others.  It is undesirable if local authorities, who are charged with the responsibility of implementing and overseeing the provisions of the Bill, are pollutants themselves.  The basic question then is, who monitors local authorities to see if they are complying with the regulations?  That is why there is a need for a water pollution advisory council.  Some pollution is caused by accident, be it torrential rain, flooding, etc. This may cause slurry pits to overflow which would mean pollution of rivers. The Bill must address such accidents.</P>
    <P>The Bill does use the term &ldquo;an act of God&rdquo; as a reason for not convicting polluters.  One might well ask what is an act of God?  For instance, with the recent flooding in Ardfinnan and Clonmel, houses were flooded and domestic sewers overflowed into the River Suir.  Who was responsible for this pollution &mdash; was it the householder, was it the county council or was it an act of God?  It certainly shows a weakness in the Bill and it would be unfair to convict the householders of this offence while at the same time they must foot the cost of repairing and refurnishing their houses, at a cost of thousands of pounds.  In this regard I would ask the Minister to place as a priority in her Department the drainage of the River Suir which, in the long-term, is the only solution to prevent pollution in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in cases where there is a clear pollution offence, cost must be decided &mdash; to replace fish stocks, restore spawning grounds, remove all polluting matters from waters, make alternative arrangements to supply water for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes.  In my view it is the local authority who should carry out restocking, etc., immediately and this would allow polluters reasonable time to pay for the offence.</P>
    <P>I believe also that the majority of offences should be dealt with in our District Courts.  The Bill, as now presented, would mean that far too many cases <Col N="2559" /> would go to the High Court.  This is undesirable and expensive.  The more cases that can be dealt with at District Court level the better.</P>
    <P>Finally, there must be a healthy balance between the right of the producer with the rights of the individual to clean, pollution-free rivers, lakes and beaches. This Bill, if modified in the areas addressed by me, will help to achieve relatively pollution-free water, where farmer, industrialist and the private individual can co-operate together to make this country a far better country to live in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to say I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  Indeed, I recognise the fact that the Minister responsible for bringing the Bill before us is present in this House and has thought it worth her while to listen to the contributions being made.  I would hope in that regard that she will take on board the proposals that will be made from this side of the House.  This Bill is called the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989 [<i>Seanad</i>] and while I welcome it and feel that we must all make a constructive approach to the legislation that will be enacted, it has a number of aspects that cause me concern.</P>
      <P>Before we get down to specific references it is no harm to remind ourselves that each and every individual has a part to play.  After all, we have inherited the properties that have been given to us, our environment is our heritage.  We are the trustees at present and we are duty bound to hand on, in an improved condition, what has been given to us.  Scaremongering will not bring about any improvements.  One would imagine from reading the national newspapers and listening to commentators on radio and on television that we had a major problem of pollution in this country.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Statistics in 1987 indicated that 74 per cent of our lakes and rivers are relatively free of pollution and that only 2 per cent are a very serious cause of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2560" /> After leaving the Dáil on Wednesday last and turning on Radio Éireann, to the environment programme, and listening to an introduction to an interview the leader of the IFA, Mr. Alan Gillis, I was annoyed.  Unfortunately, I do not have the name of the person who introduced the programme but he said he was going to spend his half hour talking about one of the biggest and dirtiest industries in the country &mdash; the agricultural industry. I was horrified and I call that person to task and I draw the Minister's attention to that kind of ill-founded statement.  He said he was going to debate with the leader of the IFA the biggest and dirtiest industry in the country.  Certainly it is the biggest industry and the most important industry but it is by no means the dirtiest industry.  If that is the attitude prevailing in Radio Éireann and among other commentators, untold damage will be done to the country.  People throughout the country will become very annoyed and the work which is in progress could easily come to a halt.  One will not drive people into making improvements, one will advise them and show by experiments what is to be done or by taking on board a particular farm, as was done in the early days of agricultural development when pilot schemes showed how agricultural development should take place.  Wonderful results were achieved in that way.</P>
    <P>Our clean image is very important to us and we have that clean image.  It is more important now, during our six months Presidency of the EC when the eyes of Europe are focused on Ireland. Generally we are considered to have a clean environment and we have an excellent reputation in Europe for producing top quality food products.  We should be proud of that and we should ensure that everything possible is done to protect that image.</P>
    <P>Before we get down to the details of the Bill it would not be inappropriate to refer to Sellafield and the recent announcement from British nuclear fuels that children born of workers there showed a high incidence of leukaemia. This is outside our control here but is of great concern to us.  If the workforce in <Col N="2561" /> that industry, with all its monitoring and wearing protective clothing, find that this is the end result it must be of great concern and it is something that the Government should not let go unnoticed.  I hope that appropriate action will be taken regarding disposal from that industry into the Irish Sea.  I have not read of any appropriate action being taken following that alarming and very serious statement &mdash; apparently it has not been denied and is accepted as fact &mdash; which has serious consequences for this country, but more importantly to the Bill before us and to the Government's action.  The Bill in itself is fine.</P>
    <P>There are many causes of pollution. Industrial pollution is a major cause for concern.  In the sixties we had industrial development and we welcomed it as it came, without really considering the consequences and probably through ignorance not being fully aware of the fall-out from many of those industries.  Recent studies and developments have shown that many of them, in their own way, are causing pollution.  It can be rectified but it will be at a considerable cost.  I do not think we can turn a blind eye for the sake of jobs to the pollution of an environment and a whole locality.  I do not think it is widespread but there are a number of incidents where immediate action is called for.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be specific in naming industries but there are industries sited in scenic localities on the banks of very important lakes and the water leaving the factory is cleaner than when it was taken from the lakes.  That must be commended. That is an indication of what can be achieved.  Against that, we have other industries where the waste water leaving those industries is not fit to be disposed of in our lakes or rivers.  If one industry, which one would consider would have a major problem in being able to operate in the location in which it was sited can do a job such as that, then that is the yardstick by which all other industries should be judged.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about agricultural pollution.  There is an urban-rural divide on this issue and many people <Col N="2562" /> believe farmers are polluters.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I am not saying that because I am a farmer &mdash; I do not condone pollution in any form &mdash; but I recognise the great work farmers have carried out over the past number of years in trying to bring about the necessary improvements.  They have managed to carry out this work despite all the odds, for example, the wet summers of 1985 and 1986.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will have to speak to her colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food about the grant aid available.  The delay in the payment of these grants is nothing short of outrageous. As I have said, when the boot is on the other foot a surcharge is added in the collection of overdue taxes.  I believe a surcharge should be paid by the Minister for the non-payment of overdue grants.  It will cost a 15-cow dairy farmer about £20,000 to bring about the improvements necessary.  This is a considerable amount of money for a small farmer, and grant aid of 50 to 55 per cent will only turn out to be grant aid of 25 per cent because, as the previous speaker, Deputy Ahern, said, the rates of grant aid have not been updated in line with inflation since 1984 or 1985.  A farmer who expects to get a 50 per cent grant on a £20,000 invesment will only get a grant of about 35 per cent.  This is not good enough.  These improvements are grant-aided by Brussels and the Minister only needs to update the rate of grant in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>The delay of three to four months in the payment of grants is not good enough and is not acceptable.  A farmer will enter into a commitment with a contractor who will carry out specific work for him on the understanding that the farmer will borrow so much money and pay the contractor as soon as he gets his grant.  At present some farmers spend three to five months avoiding the contractors who have supplied the concrete, sand and other materials for the work because they have not received their grants.  This puts farmers in a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>In the sixties and seventies it was believed that farmers should develop <Col N="2563" /> their farms by installing concrete yards or open feeders.  Many farmers who installed concrete yards found that the effluent from their farmyards flowed into drains and polluted important rivers and lakes.  Those farmers were advised by the committees of agriculture and ACOT that these were proper developments. Many of the farmers who carried out that work were considered to be ahead of their time and extremely lucky to be able to afford this kind of investment. However, they now find out ten years later that this development is the very cause of pollution.  I hope that the plans being drawn up by Teagasc at present will not be found to be outdated in another five to ten years time and that they will be sufficient to carry us through for the next 20 years or more.  Farmers cannot afford to make new investments year in, year out.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been calls on dairy farmers, in particular, to upgrade their static tanks, coolers and milking parlours at considerable cost to them. These farmers cannot afford to make another investment of £20,000 a few years after their last investment.  As a farmer I can assure the Minister that she will have the full co-operation of farmers. It must be put on the record of this House that farmers do not intentionally cause pollution.  There have been cases of accidents and overspills in the more intensive units and the wet summers in 1986 and 1987 caused many problems.</P>
    <P>When a river or lake becomes polluted people become hysterical and one would believe that the lake or river was wiped out for ever.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Nothing will redeem itself quicker than nature if it is given the chance.  I would refer to the case of one of the most famous lakes not only in Ireland but also in Europe, Lough Sheelin, which had a major problem with pollution because of the unusual development of major piggeries on its shores. Some of the biggest pig units in Europe are sited within a couple of hundred yards of Lough Sheelin.  The pollution in this lake has been rectified.  I recognise the <Col N="2564" /> role the previous Government played in bringing in measures to enable farmers to dispose of slurry outside of the catchment area.  As a result of the grant aid made available to those farmers as well as last year's hot summer, which helped to dry up the land and the drains flowing into Lough Sheelin, and the corrective measures taken by the people in the pig business at enormous cost and considerable investment, the fishing in Lough Sheelin is as good as it has been for the past 20 to 25 years.  This goes to show that when corrective measures are taken and nature takes its course these lakes and rivers can be restored.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problems of the sewerage systems in local authority areas. The Minister referred to a number of large towns where major schemes have been undertaken in recent years.  I accept that these schemes have been of benefit but there are problems in regard to the schemes which were developed by local authorities in small towns and villages for 20 to 30 households.  In some cases there are now 150 to 200 households in those towns and villages and even though the piping to the treatment plants was extended the treatment works were not extended to deal with the increased flow into them.  In many towns and villages raw sewage is flowing out from treatment works because they are not geared to deal with it.  Major investment will have to be undertaken in this respect.  I do not want to name towns and villages but I will be writing to the Minister about the matter. People in some of these towns and villages are very concerned and the local authority have submitted a plan to the Department on the upgrading of these treatment works but other than an acknowledgment that the plan was received as far back as ten years ago no sanction has been given to carry out improvements in the treatment works.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a number of provisions in the Bill.  Section 7 will enable a person to sue his neighbour if he believes he is causing pollution.  I do not think this is a good road to travel down.  Some people will seize the opportunity of dragging their neighbour to <Col N="2565" /> court irrespective of the cost involved. The local authority should have the power to deal with this matter.  The wrong way to go about it would be for the aggrieved person not to notify the local authority without first taking a civil action.</P>
    <P>I must commend the local authorities for the constructive approach they have adopted in relation to pollution.  I have yet to come across a case where it has been brought to their attention that pollution has been caused where they have not first gone to the industry or farm concerned to advise them on what action should be taken and to give them time to carry out such remedial action.  On the other hand, the fisheries boards appear to adopt a different approach &mdash; as they say in the Wild West &ldquo;shoot first and ask questions later&rdquo;.  They have brought to the courts a number of prosecutions which in themselves serve no purpose.  In my own area, a number of prosecutions have been brought by the fisheries board but the judge having listened to the arguments put forward by both the defence and prosecution imposed the minimum fine, that is £25, because he recognised that the farmer and industrialist were doing their best in trying to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The cost of bringing a case to the court can vary from between £500 to £1,000. Many people have come to me to ask if there was anything I could do to have the costs reduced.  It is possible for the fine to be reduced but there is no way that the costs can be reduced even if one asks to have the cost itemised.  The costs can be made up by travelling expenses, consultancy fees and so on but it has to be paid.  This may result in the farmer having to borrow the money in a bank or having to sell cattle or the industrialist having to go somewhere to find it and pay it.  No improvements have been made.  It would be much better if that money were to be spent at the source of the problem.  Under this Bill, the county councils will receive the finance raised by way of fines.  I hope this will not be used as a reason when they find themselves short of cash for <Col N="2566" /> going after polluters to raise much needed capital.</P>
    <P>Split sampling is vitally important.  If a sample is taken the farmer or industralist or some other person standing in for them should be present when it is being taken. I say this as I am concerned about some of the cases brought to my notice in the past, as I am about the qualifications and the approach adopted by the people who do the testing.  The approach we should adopt should be advice rather than penalties. I hope that that is the thinking that will be adopted.  If we look for the co-operation of everybody involved, I believe it will be forthcoming as this is in all our interests.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about tackling this problem he should immediately appoint the members of the water pollution advisory council.  The Government cannot claim to be serious if they fail to appoint them.  I understand it has been quite some time since this council has met.  How can we be taken seriously?  If the Minister appoints the members he will have taken a step in the right direction. Furthermore, if we look for the co-operation of all those involved, including the rural organisations, then we can succeed and our image abroad of a pollution-free country can be used to our benefit in promoting the country which is all-important. Many people are now reluctant to seek sun holidays because of various health risks and we can cash in on this.  For those seeking a quiet holiday in a pollution-free environment with beautiful scenery, this is an ideal location which offers such activities as fishing, cycling, mountaineering or long walks in scenic areas.  One of the excellent effects of this Bill will be, if we develop these, more employment, so that many of our young people who have gone abroad will come home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party welcome, in general, the attempt being made in this Bill to improve the condition of our inland waters.  We hope that the good intentions will be reflected in the actions of those obliged to enforce the legislation. I will refer later to some reasons <Col N="2567" /> for the lack of enforcement and the aspects of the law which still leave the door open for those wishing to avoid prosecution.  First, the good news; we welcome certain changes that the Bill makes in the 1977 Act.  It places more powers at the disposal of individuals so that omissions of enforcement agencies can be taken up by aggrieved persons or organisations.  They will be able to seek compensation which is a step towards the general &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  Of course we would like to see the incorporation of such a principle into all law on the environment.  Enforcement authorities are being granted extra powers to seek information from would-be polluters, and penalties for non-compliance are being increased.</P>
      <P>We are aware from our own experience of the difficulties in this area under existing legislation.  For example, Kerry Co-op were able to obtain a committal order against the Kerry County Manager for not producing documents even though the co-op itself throughout the events of the past 15 years have failed to supply the county council with the necessary information about its activities.  This Bill should improve the position somewhat. We would like to see the role of the individual recognised in this area as it is with enforcement.  We would also like the power to obtain information of a non-commercial kind to be extended to affected individuals and groups.  I suggest therefore, that section 17 requires amendment.  The increases in the penalties and the introduction of by-laws for certain activities, such as agriculture, are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the bad news: it is our experience that the role of An Bord Pleanála in these matters and planning is not effective. This Bill presents us with an opportunity to improve the position but that chance has been missed in the drafting.  Under the present law, An Bord Pleanála commission an inspector's report on the issue which may be the subject of an appeal, be it a water pollution licence or planning permission.  That report remains secret <Col N="2568" /> and the board can overturn it, as happened in the Tara mast case, without any reason being given.  That was a travesty of democracy.</P>
    <P>I also note that it is proposed to have different procedures for planning and water pollution appeals.  Section 6 should be amended to ensure that An Bord Pleanála inspectors' reports in water pollution appeals are made public with the reasons for the board's decisions being publicly stated.  It should also be possible to further appeal to the Minister a decision by An Bord Pleanála to deny an oral hearing on a water pollution licence appeal.</P>
    <P>Local and sanitary authorities perform a dual role as polluter and policer.  The long awaited introduction of the Minister of State Deputy Harney's environmental protection agency should change this by creating a separate enforcement authority. Our hope is that a minimal central agency will co-ordinate local enforcement authorities.  This Bill before us makee little distinction between the two roles of the local and sanitary authorities. When the new agency is created the legislation to change this Bill will be unwieldy and the Bill before us should be drafted with forthcoming changes in mind.</P>
    <P>Our experience with problems like the River Feale and the Kerry Co-operative have brought to our notice a problem with the enforcement of the Water Pollution Act.  The said company sought and were granted a judicial review in the High Court of the licence granted to them by Kerry County Council.  Such reviews are low on the priority list and may not come up for years.  In the meantime the licence is all but useless since any prosecution in the District and Circuit Courts may be quashed by the High Court due to the pending review.  Such a situation makes a mockery of our deliberations here today. Therefore, we recommend that such reviews be given a higher priority or that the courts be given extra resources to shorten the delays.  The Bill might as well be put in the bin if it is not to be effectively and swiftly enforced.</P>
    <P>Section 26 of the 1977 Act refers to quality standards.  EC Directives No. 659 <Col N="2569" /> of 1978 specified standards of salmonoid and cyprinoid waters.  Part of this directive was belatedly implemented by S.I. No. 293 of 1988, ten years later, and we assume these are the standards to be used for the purpose of the 1977 Act.  This Bill should clarify this matter.  The remainder of the standards in the directive should be added to the statutory instrument by amendment as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The confusion is highlighted when one considers prosecutions under the Bill where the defendant is a local or sanitary authority.  If compensation is awarded to the applicant it must be paid out of taxpayers' funds.  It is further possible that the applicants would themselves be another public body who would receive the compensation.  The only people who benefit from this Alice in Wonderland situation are the lawyers.  I argue for penalties to be applied to such offending public authorities, for instance, through the suspension or dismissal of officials by the courts.</P>
    <P>The central point that keeps reappearing in our deliberations is that of information.  I have already asked for greater powers to be granted to individuals for obtaining information.  An Bord Pleanála need to be more open.  The new agency will be all but useless unless they are obliged by law to open with information and it has been the policy of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, had for a very long time to demand a Freedom of Information Bill.  This Bill should start us down the road of glasnost by including information related amendments.  I propose &mdash; and I stress that this can be only just that &mdash; that that start is made before the Minister finds himself in the EC Courts.  We feel particularly that the BOD standards should be implemented properly, specifying that the limit is three milligrams per litre for salmonoid and six milligrams for cyprinoid.</P>
    <P>Ireland has managed to keep its environment much cleaner than any other EC country, despite some people's best efforts.  Article 8 of the directive specifies that the standards should not be used to allow an increase in pollution.  This article in particular should be incorporated <Col N="2570" /> immediately into Irish law before it is too late.  Such a statutory instrument combined with S.I. No. 293 of 1988 should be specifically referred to in this Bill, as the standards for the purpose of the 1977 Act.  Therefore, I suggest that section 18 requires amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) of the 1977 Act deals with the capacity of a river to cope with discharges.  It also requires to be amended to base its assimilative capacity on a seven day sustained low flow criterion. This is a recognised method of using the lowest, within reason, river levels because obviously it is at times of low river levels that the assimilative capacity of the river is at its worst.</P>
    <P>Clean water is a basic human right and it is time this was recognised.  We have a very important tourist industry that we want to expand.  This Bill goes nothing like far enough and I will be putting down a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  Any individual or political party would have to recognise that the 1977 legislation needed to be updated.  Possibly because of many highlighted incidents in 1987, particularly relating to the agricultural community, there was a need for the Department of the Environment to introduce new regulations, new by-laws and new powers to give a sense of balance and order to the regulation of environmental protection. Fine Gael recognised the need to update this legislation and to ensure we have that modern legal framework in order to prevent water pollution and to ensure that natural resources are protected in the interests of the entire community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, a number of features in the Bill as published originally would appear to isolate the agricultural community in particular for specific harsh treatment.  It showed clearly that officials in the Department of the Environment, and maybe the Minister for the Environment, were seeking to bring about a rather theoretical solution to a practical problem.  That is why our Fine Gael Party put down a number of amendments <Col N="2571" /> before the Second Stage debate and got a favourable response for many of them from the Minister, Deputy Flynn, during the term of the last Government.  I got the impression from the speech of the Minister of State before Christmas that the same amendments will be taken on board in the context of this Bill.  I welcome those amendments.</P>
    <P>Any new legislation must strike a proper balance and, while we must seek to eliminate the problem of water pollution and provide the legal system with the teeth to do so, we have to ensure that persons are not convicted wrongly or penalised wrongly for water pollution that occurs in circumstances for which they cannot be held responsible.  If this Bill was to go through in its published form without amendment, it would put the onus on the farmer to prove that he or she is innocent rather than the accepted legal norm of being innocent until proven guilty.  The Minister has accepted an amendment in that regard and it will bring about an essential change in the relevant section.</P>
    <P>More than anybody else, farmers, as the primary custodians of the countryside, have a vital interest in protecting the environment because they derive their livelihood from it.  As part of our farming tradition we have sought to hand on the family farm to the next generation in better condition than we found it.  The environmental dimension is an important element of that heritage concept, and against that background we have to consider this legislation.  The agricultural community have come in for a great deal of criticism, possibly unfairly, <i>vis-à-vis</i> other industrial and local authority sectors in the past few years for water pollution.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by An Foras Forbartha before they were abolished indicated that 69 per cent of pollution was from the urban industrial sector, 21 per cent from farm sources and 10 per cent from other sources.  That indicates the size of the problem in other sectors for <Col N="2572" /> which the Minister has direct responsibility. The problem of agricultural pollution was recognised by the various sectors of the agricultural industry, including the State agencies, long before the Government recognised it or long before the water pollution disasters in 1987.  In Kilkenny, before the county committees of agriculture were abolished, there was a sub-committee of that body which met frequently with leaders of the farming community, organised various educational seminars and took a very positive line about protecting the environment, educating the farming community as to how to come to grips with serious problems since it was in their interests to ensure the protection of their own environment.  That educational process met with considerable success.  The subsequent Government announcement bringing all areas of the country under the new pollution grants scheme funded by the European Community and the Department of the Environment brought about a huge investment in anti-pollution measures by many agricultural enterprises and farms which could have not been done without the assistance of the grant aid.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem over the years has been the definition of water pollution. In many court cases there was a difficulty, on the part of the farmer, convincing the fishery board or the local authority that the definition of &ldquo;run off&rdquo; did not constitute rain water flowing around from the farm yard to an undesirable source and into a water course.  We need to define clearly &ldquo;run off&rdquo; and &ldquo;water pollution&rdquo;. This is a great bone of contention. It will be difficult to get a clear definition which will give fairness and balance in a court case.</P>
    <P>No member of the agricultural community deliberately sets out to contaminate wells or water courses.  Some of the solutions suggested by local authorities and Department officials have involved such crazy ideas as roofing the entire farmyard, which would cost thousands and would still not contribute to the solution of the water pollution problem. I look forward on Committee Stage to <Col N="2573" /> amending the section dealing with water pollution.</P>
    <P>We are living in an era of agricultural quotas and many of the intensification measures that would have been the norm in farming practice, particularly in the dairy and beef industries, will not be as intensive as originally thought because of the introduction of these quotas.  Farmers will no longer be able to produce more and this will lessen the seriousness of environmental damage envisaged some years ago.  We must ensure that one section of the community is not singled out as a scapegoat for the pollution problem in its entirety.  The Minister went to great lengths, during her contribution before Christmas, to ease the worries of the farming community.  She knows there is unease among sectors of the agricultural community about some of the measures originally proposed in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Various speakers have mentioned the contribution of local authorities to the elimination of the problem or the contribution they might be making to water pollution.  There are many schemes with the Department which need sanction and need more money than is available from the Structural Funds to solve this problem. In my local authority area there are small towns and villages which have sent proposals to the Department of the Environment and have been awaiting sanction for ten years.  Their sewage treatment works are overflowing because of the inadequate resources of the local authority to deal with this appalling problem. The monitoring of sewage treatment plants and water pollution by local authorities is practically non-existent due to lack of resources.  There are only about 80 environmental officers monitoring pollution throughout the whole country. That number is far from adequate. Improvements could be made in controlling water pollution at local authority, agricultural and industrial levels if people were visited more often by officers of the authority who would help to draw up a programme to rid us of this problem.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a bigger part to play than they are being given under this legislation.  Many of the powers of local <Col N="2574" /> authorities will be superseded by those of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I should prefer to see more input at local level.  I am disappointed that the new agency will take away many of the existing powers of local authorities.  More resources at local level and a greater local input will get better results than an agency like Bord Pleanála or the new Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the new Bill will allow businesses to have their licences reviewed at any time.  This has not been the case.  It had to be done with the permission of the licence holder.  Section 17 allows the local authority to get more information at any time and that is a welcome development.  Section 20 imposes a civil liability for pollution in a variety of circumstances which will result in farmers and others being liable to damages. It excludes from civil liability under this section polluting matter that enters water from certain specified non-agricultural activity.  There is a bias against the agricultural community and this exclusion should be deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 21 lays down extensive provisions for local authorities to make by-laws which could impinge in a dramatic way on activities in the agricultural community. By-laws can become legally binding and render a person liable to criminal prosecution and conviction without any consultative process having been engaged in regarding the contents of the by-law. This brings me to the original point concerning the importance of an input at local authority level in the drafting and implementation of by-laws, so that we can bring people with us in protecting the environment rather than having to wave the big stick.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Water Pollution Advisory Council be retained.  Under section 30 the Minister is proposing to abolish that council and I disagree with that.  Various increases in fines are proposed in the Bill.  A fine not exceeding £25,000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years or both can only be brought on the instigation of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Local authorities will be able to prosecute summary proceedings <Col N="2575" /> only throught the District Court.  It has been suggested that convictions could result from inspections carried out by untrained personnel and that has been a concern to some people who have no knowledge of or background in agriculture. The Minister, during the course of her address, allayed that fear and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Finally, the importance of protecting the environment, particularly in regard to water pollution, can never be under-estimated. There is a major problem at present in relation to disease transmission via ground water.  Research in that area is far from complete.  There could be a possibility of disease transmission, whether to humans or animals, through the contamination of ground water.  Certain abstractions are exempt under section 9 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  Under this Bill we should provide for a compulsory register of abstractions and the boring of wells so that we will know where the problem arises in relation to water pollution and who the people involved are.  If there is a problem of tapping into an existing supply or ground water, for example, by a neighbour, we would be able to pinpoint the problem very quickly through this register.  At present a third party has no recourse in law if another person taps into an artesian spring or depletes the ground water.</P>
    <P>The provision in the 1977 Act whereby the onus is on the polluter to notify authorities of pollution should be included in this Bill.  There can be accidental discharges through no fault of the individual. If this provision, under section 14 of the 1977 Act, is included in this Bill, it would give a more positive protection of the environment and would help to seek a proper balance in the implementation of the legislation.  Accidents do happen whether we like it or not.  If the Bill goes through as it stands at present, people will be proved guilty irrespective of whether the pollution was accidental or not.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  A number <Col N="2576" /> of amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage by the Fine Gael Party but the main thrust of the Minister's speech will certainly appease the fears of many people in relation to various sections of the Bill.  I hope this legislation is brought into law as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House for too long.  This Bill is welcome in so far as a new attempt is being made to tackle the problem of water pollution which has been growing over the last number of years.  There is a need to highlight the extravagance of people and particularly institutions such as local authorities and Government agencies. Under this Bill the Minister is taking on new powers to ensure that there is proper policing of the legislation as it applies to the problems that have arisen.  There is a danger, as other speakers have highlighted, that the farmer may feel he will be zoned in on because of the nature of his work and particularly because of the waste factors involved in his enterprise. I hope the Minister and the Government will try to mollify these fears by having meetings with members of the farming organisations.  Meetings should also be organised between the local authorities and the farmers.</P>
      <P>Previous efforts to control pollution have brought fear to the agricultural community and some officers have been rather difficult in their handling of farmers.  While there is goodwill on both sides, that problem should be noted. There was a communication difficulty and I hope the Minister, in ensuring that this legislation is fully enacted, will utilise the modern amenities to improve communication. People should have an opportunity to put their house in order and the State, when it promises assistance, should provide it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present under schemes drawn up with the farm development services there are long delays in coming out to see the farmer about his plans or proposals, in approving his proposals and afterwards when the work has been finalised and this leads to a great deal of frustration.  There should be co-ordination between the <Col N="2577" /> Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of the Environment but there does not seem to be much evidence of that.  Both Departments have suffered considerably due to cutbacks and there has been a distinct lack of resources, particularly in the area of elimination of pollution.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate on VAT rebates the Taoiseach took me to task about the complaint I made on behalf of farmers who applied for VAT returns.  A number of my constituents involved in work of this nature have experienced long delays.  This causes quite a lot of frustration and brings the anti-pollution schemes into disrepute.  I would envisage some difficulty with regard to the policing of the legislation on water pollution, irrespective of the terms of the Bill.  For instance, in the case of Lough Derg there are huge movements of turf and turf byproducts down the lake and this is suffocating the natural life of this broad expanse of water, one of the great features of Ireland.  This waterway is gradually being choked up by pollution which comes from areas further up the waterway. Many meetings have taken place about this matter.  It would require the combined will of all the local authorities all along the Shannon to combat the great extinction of natural life that is taking place.  With Structural Funds, if possible, the State should take steps to alleviate the difficulties that have been experienced here.</P>
    <P>What has been highlighted in recent times about the Shannon has been the serious flooding.  It is an ill wind that does not do someone some good.  Perhaps the increase in flood waters &mdash; I understand the level of the Shannon has increased by one third &mdash; will clear the Shannon and Lough Derg of many of the pollutants. In order to deal with waterways like the Shannon we must enormously increase the amount of funds to be used.  Local authorities will have to get substantial financial assistance in order to monitor these waterways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2578" /> In recent times there have been problems at Ringaskiddy in relation to industrial pollution and people objected to the establishment of new industry because of air and water pollution risks.  Some of the chemical industries have the proper controls.  The major chemical industry in my village, Semtex (Ireland) Ltd. have gone a long way towards meeting conditions for the elimination of pollution. There had been water and air pollution there but with co-operation between the IIRS, the local authority and the company, good decisions were taken.  This was an example of where mutual confidence led to the control of pollution.</P>
    <P>In implementing this Bill I ask the Minister to take cognisance of the fact that there is a need to improve communications between various bodies and to encourage partnership between private enterprises and the public, between the farmers and the Department and particularly between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill.  Deputies' interest in the Bill and the variety and quality of the contributions which have been made to this debate reaffirm my belief that the protection of our environment has become a matter of the highest priority for the general public and their representatives. This is most gratifying as the development of public awareness is absolutely essential if we are to ensure that our national water pollution control measures are effective.</P>
      <P>A multiplicity of issues have been raised by the Deputies and it would be impractical for me to deal with all of them at this juncture.  Some of the more specific points raised can be discussed further on Committee Stage.  There were, however, a number of points raised which necessitate a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was encouraged, at first, by Deputy Lowry's general welcome for the Bill as indicated in his introductory remarks. However, his subsequent contribution <Col N="2579" /> made me wonder if Fine Gael are really serious about supporting comprehensive measures designed to tackle water pollution from all sources.  Deputy Lowry seemed to have placed the interests of one section of the community above any other consideration and to be prepared to cast aside any commitment to protect the environment in favour of short-term popularity with the farming sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry spoke about each individual's responsibility to prevent pollution and the importance of getting our own house in order if we are to command respect when commenting on international issues.  He also claimed to be concerned to ensure that the Bill strikes the right balance in the obligations it seeks to impose to prevent pollution. However, it is clear from Deputy Lowry's speech that Fine Gael have adopted the position of the IFA on those aspects of the Bill which are particularly relevant to farmers.  The amendments suggested by Deputy Lowry would, in general, have the effect of leaving us with the <i>status quo</i> in terms of our legislation dealing with diffuse agricultural sources of pollution, and in some cases they would even weaken the provisions in this regard contained in the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>I went to great lengths in my speech on Second Stage to explain that farmers who act responsibly will have no need to fear this legislation.  We must, however, take account of changes in farming practices and also of the considerable volumes of wastes generated by the agricultural sector &mdash; 91 per cent of the total load from all sectors.  The potential of these wastes to cause serious pollution cannot be ignored.  The Bill seeks to put in place a mechanism which will allow local authorities to act to control particular agricultural activities in any area where they are responsible for water pollution.</P>
    <P>The debate needs to take on a broader dimension than simply attempting to apportion blame between the various sectors for fish kills.  The farming sector has indeed made considerable efforts since 1987 to reduce the pollution risk from its activities and has succeeded in achieving <Col N="2580" /> a significant reduction in the number of fish kills.  Even with these efforts, the farming sector was responsible for more fish kills than any other in the past year. Other Deputies have rightly drawn attention to the increasing incidence of slight and moderate pollution levels in our rivers &mdash; now affecting 24 per cent of channel length.  Analysis of trends and causes by the Department of the Environment shows that agriculture is a significant contributor to this situation and that because of the diffuse nature of the pollution sources involved, such as silage effluent and slurry spread on land, additional controls will have to be provided if this disturbing trend in water quality is to be reversed.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Water Pollution Act focused on fixed point pollution sources from industry, but only provided for a piecemeal approach of limited effectiveness in the case of agriculture.  The Bill will tighten the controls on industry, where experience has shown this to be necessary, and will ensure that pollution arising from the agricultural sector can also be tackled effectively.  For this reason, Deputy Creed's concern about what he regards as the Bill's apparent overemphasis on the farming sector is unfounded.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to allocate signficant capital resources to installing and upgrading sewerage treatment works at locations where there are pollution problems.  The action programme for the Environment, published recently provides for further investment of some £230 million in the coming decade so as to eliminate all pollution of inland waters by sewage discharges.  This commitment is clear evidence of our determination to implement a comprehensive and balanced approach to tackling pollution from all sources.</P>
    <P>To a significant extent, the comments made by Deputy Lowry were identical to those contained in a submission on the Bill which was made to my Department by the IFA.  The least I would have expected is that Fine Gael would have considered the points made by the IFA and selected some of them which they <Col N="2581" /> could pursue.  However, the Deputy gave me the impression that his party have simply taken on board the IFA submission and are using it to criticise the Bill.  This blatant lobbying for one sectoral interest must call into question Fine Gael's future credibility in the area of protecting our environment in all its forms.</P>
    <P>I would take issue with Deputy Gilmore's contention that the delay in pressing on with the Bill is an indication of a lack of commitment to tackle the problem and that there have been no effective measures to combat pollution in the two years since 1987.  The fact is that this Bill is only one element of an integrated programme of measures adopted in 1987. Deputy Gilmore said that no amount of legislation will solve the problem and that enforcement and implementation are necessary.  I agree entirely with this and it is for that reason that the programme of measures adopted involved farm surveys, reviews of licences, education and awareness campaigns and stricter enforcement by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore also alleged that the Bill is to be weakened by putting forward amendments already discussed with the IFA.  I am glad, however, that he then went on to say that he would wait to see the amendments I will be proposing.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the amendments in question can in no way be held to involve a cave-in on the part of the Government.  For example, the proposed amendment to the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; provision will, as I said already, expand it to include a requirement to provide, use and maintain suitable facilities to prevent pollution &mdash; along the lines of the concept of &ldquo;best practicable means&rdquo; contained in the more modern Air Pollution Act.  When the Deputy sees the amendments proposed to this and other provisions, I am confident that his fears will be allayed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea, who incidentally had the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill when it was before the Seanad, and did so, raised a number of specific points which will no doubt be pursued on Committee Stage.  He also <Col N="2582" /> commented on the need to update guidelines and standards for water quality since a report was produced in 1978 by a technical committee established by my Department.  There has been significant progress in this regard in the past two years, including regulations establishing national standards for bathing water, for the protection of fresh water fish life and for drinking water supplies and sources. The work of the technical committes is ongoing in my Department and I understand it will be producing a further report shortly on control strategies to avoid sewage fungus in rivers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter attempted to put a more acceptable face on his party's decision to play the farmer's card in this debate.  He claimed credit for the wide-ranging consultations conducted by his party and for the drafting of amendments earlier this year.  It is strange that the outcome of this effort has resulted in a party position which portrays a total lack of balance.  Incidentally, I and my Department have yet to see the amendments which, we are told, were drafted before the election.</P>
    <P>As regards the Water Pollution Advisory Council, I want to state that there is no underhand effort to abolish the council. The intention to do so is stated clearly in the detailed explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill, and the matter has already been debated at some length by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I have announced the intention to establish an advisory council in the context of my proposals for the environmental protection agency.  I believe that such a council should have a broad remit in relation to air, water and waste matters and, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to have another advisory body dealing only with one aspect of our environment.</P>
    <P>The awareness promotion activities of the former Water Pollution Advisory Council have been catered for by a variety of other agencies, including my own Department and the new farm environmental advisory service operated by Teagasc.  Recent initiatives by my Department, taken in conjunction with <Col N="2583" /> the Department of Agriculture and Food, involved the distribution of a booklet on farm pollution and control strategies to 200,000 farmers.  My Department have continued to commission and publish national reports on water quality, the most recent being that prepared by An Foras Forbartha and published in 1987.  The environmental research unit are currently engaged on compiling data with a view to producing an updated national review of water quality in 1991 and results for 1988 will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have the opportunity for a full debate on the Environmental Protection Agency and their interaction with local authorities and other agencies when the Bill comes before the House in the coming months.  I want to assure the House, however, that local authorities will continue to have extensive functions in the water pollution control area and will, I am sure, benefit directly from the expertise available from the new agency.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and Creed queried the financial implications of the Bill for local authorities.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the powers available to authorities to prevent pollution, with limited provision for new powers.  Accordingly, I do not anticipate that the Bill will give rise to significant additional expenditure by local authorities. There are a number of provisions which should benefit local authorities financially, including those providing for licence application fees in respect of effluent discharges to waters or to sewers, and for recovery of costs in the event of successful prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Pollution control work will continue to be financed extensively from authorities' own resources, augmented by rate support grants paid by the Department of the Environment in respect of local authority functions generally.  Deputies can be assured that payment of fines to authorities will not represent a financial bonanza for them or provide a solution for their financial difficulties.  Under the provisions of the Bill, authorities would <Col N="2584" /> receive only fines from successful prosecutions taken through the District Courts, which may impose fines up to a maximum of £1,000.  Authorities will not receive fines imposed on indictment which may be as high as £25,000; these will continue to go to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan emphasised the dependence of local authorities on the Department of the Environment for the capital funding necessary to provide and upgrade sewage treatment plants.  Since 1980, almost £300 million has been made available for these purposes, with special attention being given to the elimination of water pollution blackspots.  Such considerations will continue to receive high priority in the implementation of the water and sewage programme to which we are committed.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed about the provisions of section 7 which will allow any person to seek a court order requiring measures to mitigate or remedy the effects of pollution.  This provision, and that contained in section 20 on civil liability for pollution damage, are not confined in their application to the farming sector.  Other sources which breach the standards or licence conditions applicable to them and cause environmental damage or losses will also be subject to these provisions.</P>
    <P>Concern in relation to action by individuals under section 7 appears to ignore the role of the courts in the procedure. Before making an order requiring any party to mitigate or remedy the effects of pollution, the court must be satisfied that there have been adverse effects and that the party to be named in the order is in fact responsible for the pollution.  Claims that the procedure will be abused where neighbours are in dispute ignore these factors.  The section will only operate where damage has been shown to have occurred.  In such situations, it is only right that the party responsible should make good the loss or damage sustained.  The provision is a significant deterrent to irresponsible action by any person engaged in activities which could cause pollution.  Removal of this <Col N="2585" /> provision would seriously weaken the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey asked me to confirm that it is not the intention of the Bill to deprive a person of his livelihood where he has inadvertently caused pollution.  I would point out that the purpose of the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; which is contained in the 1977 Act - and which I propose to retain in this Bill in a modified form is to ensure just that, that a person who provides and uses proper facilities to prevent pollution cannot be convicted on a pollution charge.</P>
    <P>Use of the by-law provision contained in section 21 will primarily be a matter for the local authority concerned.  At present, I would not see its use being very widespread, but it is important that the power is available to local authorities to control agricultural activities in areas where these are posing particular problems; the clean and pollution free image of the country to which the Deputies referred must be maintained for the sake of our agriculture as much as for any other reason.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised his concerns about water quality in Dublin Bay and the effects of sewage discharge on the bay.  In this regard, I am delighted to have the opportunity to put on record here the Government's proposals in relation to marine sewage discharges generally and those for the Dublin area in particular which are included in the action programme for the environment. It has been decided to eliminate untreated discharges of sewage from major coastal towns by the year 2000. This new programme will involve investment of up to £400 million between now and the end of the century and provision for this will be built into future economic and social planning.</P>
    <P>Planning and design work on priority schemes will be put in hand without delay.  In particular, Dublin Corporation are being directed to prepare plans for secondary treatment at their Ringsend sewage treatment works at a cost of up to £40 million.  Other works necessary to clean up the River Liffey and Dublin Bay will also be undertaken, including a new <Col N="2586" /> sewer at Patrick Street-Nicholas Street to eliminate pollution carried down by the river Poddle.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the relatively small number of schemes on which planning is advanced, and the long lead times, expenditure on the new programme will not build up fully until 1993.  Provision is being made, however, for additional spending of £5 million this year and £15 million in 1991.  The Government will seek support for this new programme from the European Community, including the new ENVIREG regulation which has been proposed by the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provisions about inland and marine sewage discharges to which I have already referred, the Government's Environmental Action Programme contains several other measures which are relevant to the debate on this Bill.  These include a renewal of farm surveys by local authorities in areas such as the Lee valley which require special attention and a provision of £27 million in the 1990 Estimate to meet grant payments to farmers for pollution control works.</P>
    <P>Pollution risks and possible threats to public health arising from the siting and operation of fish farms are also being addressed.  Improved monitoring arrangements and mandatory codes of practice are being put in place and all existing fish breeding and rearing operations located in rivers, lakes and reservoirs upstream of drinking water intakes will be closed down where there is a potential risk to the water supply.</P>
    <P>The action programme places particular emphasis on active public participation in the efforts to protect all aspects of our environment.  Environmental awareness, information programmes and promotional campaigns are, therefore, being intensified so that all will know how individually they can play their part in these efforts.  The Government have accordingly allocated £600,000 to enable a major new environmental information service &mdash; ENFO &mdash; to be established within the next few <Col N="2587" /> months, with headquarters in a high street premises in Dublin city centre.</P>
    <P>The new service will provide an extensive data base and library on the environment. It will act as a one-stop shop, providing facilities for school children as well as research facilities for more in-depth studies.  ENFO will be a source of easily accessible, appealing and authoritative information which will bring home to adults and shoolchildren the concept of individual responsibility for protection of the environment.  It will establish a national network for the distribution of educational and awareness material on the environment, with special stands in libraries, public offices, etc. for the display and dissemination of leaflets and brochures.  There will also be links with public libaries throughout the country capable of computer-based communications.</P>
    <P>These initiatives, together with the provisions of this Bill, which will strengthen existing powers of local authorities to prevent water pollution and provide for increased penalties for offences, represent the most comprehensive approach ever undertaken to tackle all sources which contibute to the pollution of our waters.</P>
    <P>Tonight Deputy Ahearn stated that the Bill will cause many more prosecutions to be brought to the High Court.  She said she would prefer if all cases were dealt with in the District Court.  Since the 1977 Act came into operation only one case has been brought before a higher court than the District Court and since there is no provision in the Bill to amend that aspect of the Act there is no reason to believe that major changes in this situation will result from the amending Bill.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed this evening that local authorities, charged with monitoring others, are not being monitored themselves.  It is important to remember that local authorities can be and are prosecuted by the fisheries boards if they are guilty of causing pollution but such prosecutions have been necessary in a comparatively small number of cases. The capital investment necessary to <Col N="2588" /> remedy deficiencies in existing sewerage systems is being undertaken.  The action plan published by the Government provides that by the year 2000 there will be no further pollution of our inland waters by sewerage discharges.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been issued with guidelines and advice on the key areas of sewerage treatment which should be carefully controlled to avoid water pollution. Deputy Carey mentioned the problems of peat siltation in Lough Derg. It should be remembered that the Bill contains a provision empowering the Minister to make regulations restricting or repealing the exemptions currently available to Bord na Móna under the Water Pollution Act.  The need to make such regulations will be reviewed when the provision becomes law.  With regard to Lough Derg I have recently written to the managers of all the local authorities concerned to encourage a co-ordinated action to improve the water quality of this important lake.  I am encouraged by the responses I have received to date.  I should like to thank Members for their general support for the Bill and I look forward to it being enacted into law as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2589" /> In September 1987 the people of Ballymun came together with the statutory organisations, local community organisations and the TDs for the area, to establish a task force.  The purpose of the task force was not to produce another report about Ballymun, of which there were more than enough, telling us what was wrong.  The idea was to draw together the wisdom of those reports and the experience of the people of the area to produce an action programme for the Ballymun area which would lead to a renewal of the area.  They worked so well and so hard together that within six months they had an interim report and proposals to present to the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister duly endorsed them and promised to provide funds to the tune of £4.5 million.  Subsequently that sum of money was reduced for the year 1989 to £0.345 million.  We did not make too much of a fuss about that because we knew that the £4.5 million could not be spent in one year.</P>
    <P>We were pleased with the Minister's commitment within six months of the report of the task force, indeed, the people of the area were pleased with the Minister's commitment.  The Minister visited the area and the assistant city manager for Dublin Corporation declared that this was a new dawn for Ballymun.  We were delighted with the decision and the people of the area waited each day for the work to start but as we approach the end of February 1990 work has not started.</P>
    <P>The task force have followed the conditions laid down by the Minister with regard to consultation and the involvement of local people and local organisations. They followed their requirements in regard to trying to get in place a local maintenance structure for the area.  They are at a loss to know why this necessary work to revive the Ballymun estate has not yet started.  We were told that the first phase would start by July 1988.  That was deferred to the autumn of 1988 and then we were told it would start in early 1989.  That was deferred to the middle of 1989 and then to the end of 1989.  Finally, tenders were <Col N="2590" /> sought for the work and although the officials of Dublin Corporation have a negotiated tendering procedure, the Department insisted on public tendering. Apparently that failed.  The two companies which applied were told that they were uncompetitive.  The whole business has now gone back into the melting pot.</P>
    <P>On 29 January the corporation were informed that within a matter of days permission would be granted by the Department for the corporation to retender the work.  Three weeks later the corporation still did not have sanction from the Department for the tendering of the work.  I might well be forgiven for saying, what more can one expect because bureaucracy tends to work in a certain way and it is very hard to force it to work any faster than it is accustomed to working, but more than two years is too long for the people of Ballymun.  They were led to believe from the start that once they got together this work would get under way.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister to give permission tonight or tomorrow morning to the corporation to issue the tender documents for the contracts.  There are two sections to the contract and this seems to be creating a problem for the Department.  There is surplus remedial work to be done as well as restructuring work to be done and apparently the Department have insisted that the two must be brought together in order to have some illusory savings.  As far as we can gather there are no savings involved.  If the Department continue to insist on these two items being kept together it will be October at least before work starts in Ballymun.  There is considerable annoyance and frustration in Ballymun at the way this matter has been delayed, not by the people in the area, not by the corporation, but by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I am tonight pleading with the Minister to give permission for these contracts to be put out to tender so that the people of Ballymun can see something actually happening and some result for all the hard work they have put into producing <Col N="2591" /> a plan for Ballymun over the past two and a half years.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy De Rossa for allowing me and my colleague from the area to share his time.  The development of the task force in Ballymun was a unique experience.  It was a unique joining together of State bodies, community bodies, public representatives, the health board and the local authority in a way I had never experienced in any other project in the city in my ten years in local politics.  It led to great hope for Ballymun and that tremendous expectation built up confidence.</P>
      <P>The extent of the delay outlined by Deputy De Rossa has left a constituency of people who need a great deal of support very frustrated, very angry and very confused.  They can understand on paper some of the technical explanations but are really fearful that the commitments entered into will not be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into history, what is required of the Minister to renew this faith is some action &mdash; some earthmoving equipment in Ballymun before <Col N="2592" /> the end of May.  The community met and said they would give the Minister six more months from the beginning of January to prove to them that there is some substance to all the promises that have been made.</P>

      <P>It is extremely important that that time scale should be met by the Minister.  What is needed from him is an instruction to his Department that the maximum flexibility in the handling of the tenders be given to Dublin Corporation. If, as Deputy De Rossa has said, the two tenders are rolled in together the relatively minor contract that could realistically get under way by May would be tied up with the other which cannot realistically get under way until the end of the year and this would, again, lead to frustration.  The danger is that the wonderful co-ordination that has been built up and the network of local involvement will break up, will dissipate, and it will be extremely difficult to build up again because they will not believe the promises that have been made and dishonoured so often.  It is extremely important that we see something on the ground very soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy De Rossa for offering me some of his time and, indeed, the Minister for giving me a few minutes of his time.  I will be very brief.  I would like to say, like the other Deputies, that I am disappointed this work has not started before now.  I am just as disappointed as the other people but, perhaps, I understand the situation more than the other Deputies. I want to say again that at all times I have stood up to defend the Minister not alone in this House but in other places and I <Col N="2593" /> compliment him for his response at the outset to the Ballymun task force.  He met them on three occasions.  On the third occasion he went to Ballymun to the final meeting.  He came at my request to do a tour of Ballymun.  I do not think there is any other Minister in this or in any other Government who has done anything like that before and I compliment him for that at the start.</P>
      <P>There were two sections of work to be done &mdash; external works and refurbishment. I understand that the main reason for the delay is the fact that an inflationary tender was sent to the Department of the Environment.  The officials there estimated that it was more than double the cost of what the estimate should be.  Should we say the officials in the Department of the Environment were wrong not to accept that tender? Had they accepted it no money would be left for the remainder of the work.  I am anxious that all the work be done, both the external works and the refurbishment work.  The officials in the Department of the Environment went back to Dublin Corporation officials and told them they wanted a tender.  I understand they wanted a tender for both works where the main contractor would sub-contract out the external works in a tender that would be far less than what had been tendered previously.  That is the situation. I hope that very shortly the matter will be resolved for all of us.  I know many people are disappointed that the work has not started before now.  People have not helped by going to the press and the television and making statements.</P>

      <P>It is a different matter. The Deputy quite rightly asked to have it raised on the Adjournment.  As late as last week there was another programme on Ballymun refurbishment.  As I said at <Col N="2594" /> a meeting of the Dublin Corporation, there are other refurbishment schemes throughout the city which did not have all this publicity.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be able to explain to us in a few minutes whether I am right or wrong but that is what I have understood. I have been told by senior officials in the housing department of Dublin Corporation that the officials in the Department of the Environment could not accept the tender because it was far in excess of what it should be.  I thank the Minister for giving me some of his time to say a few words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank those who contributed. I would like to make it clear that the management and, of course, the maintenance of housing estates is the responsibility of Dublin Corporation. The planning and implementation of the refurbishment programme for the Ballymun flats complex are also matters for the corporation.  The programme was drawn up in close co-operation with the tenants of the estate and it has the full backing of the local community.  No one could be more anxious then myself to see it go ahead.  I have a firm commitment to the refurbishment of Ballymun and I want the job done.  It is a matter of considerable disappointment to me personally that the work has not yet started. The money is available to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October last the corporation sought my approval to the acceptance of a tender for phase 1A of the project.  At this stage I think it is only right to say that the quotations obtained by means of the limited tendering procedure used by the corporation for the carrying out of this relatively small initial phase were a cause of serious concern to me.  Indeed, despite reductions negotiated by the corporation, who also considered the quotation as being very high, the sum involved was some 75 per cent greater than the corporation's earlier estimate of the cost of the work.  This development has grave implications for the cost of the overall refurbishment programme for Ballymun <Col N="2595" /> which, at the outset, was estimated at over £50 million.</P>
    <P>Following correspondence and discussions with the corporation I informed them on 20 December that because of the unacceptably high cost I was unable to approve the proposal to accept the tender.  At the same time, and in order to avoid further delays, I approved the completion of the contract documentation for the entire phase &mdash; that is phase 1 &mdash; at an estimated cost of some £6 million, including the works included in phase 1A.  The documentation has not yet been received from the corporation.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the corporation have again sought to reactivate phase 1A while the tender documentation for the entire phase 1 is being prepared.  The money is available to pay for the total phase 1A once the documentation is received from the corporation.  Their proposal to seek open competitive tendering based on a performance specification for the work is being examined and I will be in a position to notify them of my decision in the matter within the next few days.  I am disappointed that the documentation for the entire phase 1 is not yet available but I can assure all the Deputies who have contributed and those members of the local community who have put so much work into the project that this documentation will be dealt with as quickly as possible as soon as it is received from the corporation.</P>
    <P>I have previously made it clear that as an integral part of the remedial scheme the corporation will have to put in place the management and maintenance procedures which will ensure that expenditure under schemes will produce worth-while and lasting improvements to conditions in the estate.  On 13 November last I received from the corporation an outline of their proposals in this regard but I am still awaiting the final details. This matter has been raised here on a number of occasions; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Tunney, has been in touch with me on a number of occasions and Deputy Michael Barrett waylays me every week about this project.  I want to <Col N="2596" /> say to the Deputy and to his colleagues that no delay is being put in place by me or my Department to keep this project from going ahead.  I want the phase 1 documentation to be ldoged in my office as early as possible.  I will consider phase 1A in the next few days.</P>
    <P>I have to emphasise that responsibility for maintenance and improvement of their dwelling rests with the housing authorities. In no way should the remedial works scheme be seen as a substitute for a properly planned and implemented housing maintenance and management programme.  It is designed to assist authorities to tackle designated major housing refurbishment projects and as part of their initiatives to secure improvements in this area.  I will shortly be notifying the corporation of their 1990 allocation under the remedial works scheme.  So far the corporation have received some £8 million under the scheme to apportion to their various approved projects.  The expectations of Ballymun will be satisfied and the Minister's promise in this matter will be honoured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you most sincerely, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to highlight this problem.  I will, of course, be in a position to supply the Minister with the name of the child in question, but I would rather not mention any names in the House.</P>
      <P>This problem was brought to my attention when the mother of the child involved visited me.  This woman's daughter, who is seven years old and has spina bifida, attends the Dalkey school project national school in Glenageary.  I have to say at the outset that this is an excellent school which provides excellent educational facilities both from the point of view of the teaching staff and the board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This child is in second class and the problem is that the second year classroom is located on the second floor.  This child uses crutches to move around and her parents have been told by the school <Col N="2597" /> authorities that they cannot accept responsibility for the child when she is moving around the building.  This means the child has to stay in the classroom during normal break time.  During a fire drill a caretaker-gardener had to take the child from the classroom because no teacher was available to help the child down the stairs and out of the building. God only knows what would have happened if there had been a real fire in the building.</P>
    <P>The mother of this child has to attend the school approximately six times a day to bring her child down the stairs during normal breaks.  If the mother is unable to attend the child has to sit in the classroom and cannot attend such things as art exhibitions, dancing and other normal activities which go on in the school.  Obviously this child feels isolated from the other children.  Last week when her mother was ill the child could not attend school for two days.</P>
    <P>If we adopt the policy, which I support, of integrating handicapped children into primary schools then we should have the facilities to see that those children not alone receive a proper education but become part and parcel of the school activities and are not made to feel unusual in the normal school context.  As a society we should be ashamed that I had to come into the House this evening and outline this sort of problem.  I do not know where the blame rests but there are suggestions I can make to the Minister and teachers.</P>
    <P>At times all of us need to put certain things aside and think of the child involved.  Obviously I accept that there is some sort of dispute in this case and that the teachers are concerned about the question of liability should something happen to the child.  All these matters should be ironed out so that these unfortunate children do not suffer.  If we pride ourselves on being a Christian society, and even if we have to pay a little extra in taxes and do without in some areas, I believe &mdash; I say this quite sincerely &mdash; those less fortunate than ourselves through illness or physical or mental handicap should be looked after properly and we should provide the necessary <Col N="2598" /> back-up services, particularly in the educational field.</P>
    <P>I went through the normal channels making inquiries about this case before I raised it in the House.  The official line was that as the child is attending a normal primary school rather than a special school there are no facilities provided or staff available for children to be looked after and, in fact, while at one time all special schools used to have child care assistance, there is an embargo on that now, although apparently in some cases help is recruited by the schools through the FÁS scheme.  It is diabolical that young handicapped children are left without proper care and attention in our schools.  Thanks to the Minister and her predecessor there is a special unit known as St. Angela's language and learning unit attached to a normal primary school in Baggot Street.  I have seen the benefits one child attending this unit has gained from being part and parcel of a normal school and mixing with &mdash; I do not like to use this word &mdash; normal children.  The struggle we had to persuade the officials in the Department of Education to set up this unit was unbelievable.  Had it not been for the continuous fighting on the part of the parents the child I am talking about would still be in a home for the mentally handicapped.  This child, who is not mentally handicapped, suffers from what is called a language disorder.  This is a recognised illness throughout the United States and Britain where fantastic facilities are provided for such children. When I was in Government and that child visited my office she ran to the other side of the room and hid behind a chair because she was so frustrated at having been in a school for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>That child is now playing football with Broadford Rovers in Dundrum, bowls on Saturday mornings at the Stillorgan Bowl and is leading a normal life again.  The locking up of that child in a mental institution would be a scandal and should not be tolerated in any civilised society.  Not only does the mother, who has two other young children, one attending the same school and the other in secondary school, <Col N="2599" /> have to put up with the burden of having a physically handicapped child but also has to attend the school daily.  Yesterday she had to attend the school from 10.45 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.  If the child wishes to go downstairs she has to physically bring her down.  If the child wishes to take part in any activity then she has to be there to help because, for some reason or other, which I hope the Minister will explain to me tonight, the teaching staff are not in a position to look after the child.  As I said, this is a scandal which should not be tolerated in any civilised society.</P>
    <P>I hope as a result of having raised this matter in the House we can ensure that handicapped children who wish to be integrated in primary or post-primary schools are allowed to do so without feeling that they are the odd person out, that teachers will have the necessary training and skills to teach them and if back-up services are needed that they will be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett, with whom I have had a number of extensive conversations on this issue, for raising it on the floor of the House.  First, let me say by way of an introductory remark, that the milk of human kindness is a great aid in circumstances such as these.  I wish to correct one thing that Deputy Barrett said and that is that child care assistance in special schools is the responsibility of the health boards, not the Department of Education.  We supply the plant, teachers and school transport and, rightly or wrongly, that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy dealt briefly with the policy of integration on which his case was based.  We, in Ireland, have been to the forefront in seeking the integration of handicapped children.  Parents, the Department and others feel that it is better to integrate young children and adults in normal schools if they are able to do so.  There will always be a need for special schools &mdash; this is unfortunate but true &mdash; to cater for those children who cannot cope or who would not benefit, <Col N="2600" /> either socially or educationally, from integration in schools.  This is a separate issue but the road that children with disability should take is that of integration if they are able to do so.  Their parents want them to do so.</P>
    <P>This is a beautiful two-storey school which I visited some years ago.  A number of years ago, the Department of Education stopped building two-storey schools. This decision arose out of a desire to integrate handicapped children, in particular physically handicapped children, including those with spina bifida, who find it so much easier to manage if everything is provided on the one level.  If any adaptations are necessary it is also much easier to make them if it is a one-storey school.</P>
    <P>The child is attending classes on the second floor of the school.  As the Deputy said, the mother of the child has to attend the school to bring the child both upstairs and downstairs.  I find the facts of this case extraordinary.  It is obvious that the health board will not provide one care worker to look after one child and therefore I intend asking an inspector from my Department who deals with special children in ordinary schools to visit the school within the next few days to speak to the principal, board of management and teachers to get an idea of the activities the child is engaged in and to see if any physical adaptations are required. Like the Deputy, I do not like using words such as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or &ldquo;not normal&rdquo; but where ordinary schools have expressed a desire to integrate handicapped children the Department have given the go-ahead for any physical adaptations necessary to the school to allow the child go about his or her daily life in as normal a way as possible.  That is the role parents want their child to play when they opt to have the child attend ordinary school.</P>
    <P>I will ask somebody with a thorough knowledge of the needs of handicapped children, in particular those with spina bifida, to visit the school within the next few days.  Within the past two days, officials of my Department, met with the <Col N="2601" /> executive of the Spina Bifida Association, not about this child, but about the association in general.  They had a very encouraging meeting with them.  The association was pleased to know that we would be in a position to provide services such as this.  I will send this person out to talk to the board of management, the principal, the teachers, the mother of the child and the child to see if it is necessary to adapt the school as it obviously is to suit the child.  This is the best road to take and I will give this matter my personal attention tomorrow and the day after to see if adaptations are necessary or if the rules of the school need to be rearranged so as to ensure that the child can be <Col N="2602" /> facilitated.  That is another option.  In that way, we will chart a course for the child.</P>
    <P>We all hope that the child is brave enough to want to live as full a life as possible.  After all, we live our lives to the full, are in full health and have full mobility.  We should thank God for that. It is up to us to ensure that any child who has the determination and grit who wants to go to school to better themselves and move about with their peers gets every opportunity to do so.  I will arrange for such a visit to take place and will be in communication with the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 February 1990.</P>

      <P>I announced a range of employment creation measures on 27 September last. These included a number of measures aimed at the long-term unemployed.  In particular, the employment incentive scheme has been redirected to provide employment premiums only for long-term unemployed people over 25 years of age, early school leavers and the handicapped. Premiums will also be payable to employers for 39 weeks, instead of 24 weeks, as at present.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the improvements in this scheme and the general improvement in the economy will lead to more of the long-term unemployed getting jobs in the private sector.  The most recent figure for long-term unemployment relates to April 1989 and this shows a heartening decline of 6,500 in the numbers of long-term unemployed compared with April 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, FÁS provide the building on experience programme and the social employment scheme which are targeted mainly on the long-term unemployed.  The social employment scheme will have 5,000 extra <Col N="2252" /> places in 1990.  The long-term unemployed also participate in other FÁS training programmes.  By participating in these measures the long-term unemployed reactivate existing skills and learn new ones, thus becoming more employable.</P>
    <P>Finally, I intend to take action to assist the long-term unemployed, the major item on the agenda of the Social Affairs Council during the Irish Presidency of the EC.  Action by employers will be one of the issues to be considered under this heading.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, an employer is obliged to notify me of proposed redundancies and to defer implementation until 30 days have elapsed.  The Act ensures that employees' representatives receive prior notification and are consulted by the employer before the redundancies take place.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 and 1988 provide for board and sub-board level representation in a range of State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-board arrangements must include the giving in good time by management to employees of information, including financial information, about <Col N="2253" /> decisions which are liable to have a significant effect on employees' interests.  I have no plans at present to extend the provisions of the Acts.</P>
    <P>A number of proposals which include worker participation provisions are under discussion at EC level.  These are the European Company Statute and the 5th Council Directive on Company Law.  In addition, arising from the EC Social Charter a draft instrument on information, consultation and participation of workers will be introduced by the Commission later this year.  These proposals, when passed into Community law, will apply to Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 and 1944, regulate working time for industrial workers.  Under these Acts, shift work is unlawful unless on continuous process work or under licence. The Acts also stipulate that overtime must be compensated by a provision of not less than 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1938 and 1942, regulate working hours for most retail employments and also provide for an overtime premium of at least 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Night Work (Bakeries) Acts, 1936 and 1981, prohibit baking at night save under the licence.  These Acts are being reviewed at present, in consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977, which sets limits to the working hours of young people aged under 18, provides for an overtime premium of at least 25 per cent and imposes a general prohibition on night work by young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements, <Col N="2254" /> which are established under the terms of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 and which apply to specific categories of workers or specific sectors, generally provide for overtime compensation.  The Employment Regulation Orders for the hotel and catering sectors also prescribe compensation for night work; and the Registered Employment Agreement for the security industry provides for payment in respect of unsocial hours and night shifts.  The terms of these orders and agreements are reviewed at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the foregoing, there is no general statutory regulation of employment during irregular or antisocial hours.  This is by and large a matter for negotiation between employers and employees or their trade unions.  The role of the State in this area is primarily that of helping those who cannot resolve their problems through negotiation, by providing machinery, to assist in settling disputes. Accordingly, it is not my intention to consider the introduction of further regulation in this area.</P>

      <P>I have indicated in the past my concern that any person thinking of emigrating would have access to advisory and counselling services before taking such a step and in June 1989 I issued a direction to FÁS to ensure that comprehensive predeparture services are provided through that organisation to persons thinking of emigrating.</P>
      <P>These services are now being implemented by FÁS and cover:</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Advice and Counselling</i>&mdash; aimed at discouraging emigration, especially among vulnerable groups such as early school-leavers.  A counselling interview conducted by placement staff emphasises the dangers of unplanned emigration;</P>
      <P>(b)  <i>Information on Living and Working Conditions</i>&mdash; in EC member states as well as Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada.  Worker information is made available in conjunction with the counselling interview;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  <i>Circulation of EC vacancies through the SEDOC system</i>&mdash; under this system, details of unfilled vacancies are circulated among employment <Col N="2257" /> services of member states.  Approximately 8,700 permanent vacancies were notified to November last, of which 4,800 were circulated among FÁS offices.  An estimated minimum of 1,800 permanent positions to the end of November have been filled.  A further 600 temporary positions were also filled through SEDOC.</P>
    <P>Government assistance to emigrants in Britain is allocated on the recommendation of DÍON, the Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare.  The DÍON allocation was increased from £250,000 in 1988 to £500,000 in 1989.  The same amount has been allocated this year.  The increased funding has enabled a wider range and larger number of organisations to be funded than heretofore.</P>

      <P>There is only one commercial State enterprise under my control viz.  Great Southern Hotels.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to an earlier parliamentary question of 6 December, the board of GSH is of the view &mdash; which I share &mdash; that if the group is to further improve its performance and make the greatest possible contribution to the development of tourism it must obtain additional capital beyond what it could expect to generate from its own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the non-commercial State bodies under my control, the budgets of FÁS <Col N="2258" /> and CERT are by far the largest.  Both these organisations charge fees for the provision of some of their services, including services provided domestically and overseas.  The amount of income generated in this way is relatively small compared to the total national budgets of the two organisations.  The possibility of expanding this revenue-generating capacity is of course under review, within these organisations.  The possibility of other agencies under my control raising income through the provision of services has not been ruled out.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, provided the legal basis for a new system of occupational safety and health and for the establishment of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  The principal function of the authority is to ensure the safety and health of persons, whether employers, employees or self-employed, at a place of work as well as the safety and health of others who may be affected by the work activity.  The basic approach is a preventive one, with identification of hazards and assessment of the risks arising being key elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farming and related activities are among a significant number of new entrant sectors being brought within the scope of occupational safety and health law for the first time.  In its Programme of Work, 1990-1992, which was formally launched on 24 January 1990, the Authority identified agriculture as a priority area for attention.  The Authority intend to undertake a comprehensive review of occupational safety and health issues in the industry, including the feasibility and <Col N="2259" /> costs of collecting statistics.  To assist it in its task, the Authority intend to set up an advisory committee under section 17 of the Act which will include representatives of various farming interests and the Department of Agriculture and Food. Through the committee, the farming interests can be involved and can make a valuable contribution to the decision-making process of safety and health issues in their industry.</P>
    <P>Existing statistics available from the Central Statistics Office relate only to fatal farm accidents and are as follows: 1984, 32; 1985, 35; 1986, 23; 1987, 48; 1988, 21 (provisional).</P>

      <P>Our system of industrial relations in this country is based on free collective bargaining. Statute law and European Community instruments have superimposed on this system certain enforceable rights in regard to equal pay, maternity leave, holidays, unfair dismissal and so on. Usually, the enactment or adoption of legislation in areas such as this follows thorough consultation with the social partners.</P>
      <P>In the social action programme relating to the implementation of the community charter of basic social rights for workers, further mandatory legislation is proposed on health and safety, contracts of employment, working time, atypical work and information and consultation of employees.</P>
      <P>As regards a minimum wage, the Commission's view is that wage-setting is a matter for member states and the two-sides of industry alone.  The Commission considers that in matters of employment and remuneration responsibility and therefore initiative lie mainly with the member states and the two sides of industry, according to national practices, legislation and agreements.  It has stated that it is not the task of the Community to fix a decent reference wage.  The Commission, however, considers that in this field it does have a responsibility to assert its views by delivering an opinion, in close contact with the member states.  An opinion from the Commission can, therefore, be expected in due course.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the framework agreement on hours of work concluded early <Col N="2263" /> last year negotiations are taking place at local level on arrangements for the implementation of a one hour per week reduction in working hours in cases where the normal working week is at or above 40 hours.

      <P>Pay is an important element in the price of labour and will obviously be affected by demand and supply factors.  Unemployment levels, therefore, undoubtedly affect pay but it is difficult to establish the exact relationship as many other factors are involved such as skill levels and the type of labour in demand.  Low pay tends to be associated mainly with <Col N="2264" /> certain occupational categories, particular sectors of industry and services and certain characteristics of the individuals concerned rather than with overall employment levels.</P>
      <P>Recent studies of low pay suggest that the bulk of low paid full-time workers are in the categories of unskilled and semiskilled manual workers, the lower grades in clerical and office employment and general indoor sales staff.  Age, length of service and work experience have a major influence on the level of earnings and the sectors referred to are normally associated with high levels of labour turnover. The studies also suggest that there is a link between low pay and employment patterns, particularly part-time working, and that this in turn affects mainly women, school leavers and older workers.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for management development rests with business.  The State assists in a number of ways including the Exchequer subvention to the IMI and IPA and increasingly, to the third level education system.</P>
      <P>In their report to me, the advisory committee on management training which I appointed in July, 1987, recommended that the existing system of State support for management development be restructured and targeted at small businesses which draw up proper management development programmes.  The committee also recommended that State financial support should be redirected from providers of management training services to users of the services.</P>
      <P>I have had extensive consultations with relevant interests concerning the committee's report and I expect to submit proposals on State supports for management development to the Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The current position in relation to the granting of leave of absence to employees elected to the Oireachtas varies depending on where one is employed.  In general, public service employees are granted leave of absence on election to the Oireachtas either on a statutory basis or on the basis of custom and practice.  The situation in relation to private sector employees is not covered by any legislative provision and is normally dealt with in negotiation between the employer and the employee concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question requests that I should amend existing labour law to require employers to grant unpaid leave of absence to employees elected to the Oireachtas.  I am aware that a case related to this issue is scheduled to come before the Employment Appeals Tribunal shortly and I do not wish to comment on it.  However, the general position is that in the vast majority of cases employers and employees negotiate suitable arrangements to cover this situation.  In the history of the State, Members of the Oireachtas have been drawn from a great variety of employments and there is no evidence that a general problem exists.</P>

      <P>The number of new businesses started since the inception of the enterprise scheme in December 1983 up to the end of 1989 was 23,000 approx.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An ESRI report published in October, <Col N="2267" /> 1988, estimated that some 60 per cent of enterprises are still in existence after two years.  It was found that business survival under this scheme was most likely where the participant was aged 25-44 and had previous relevant experience and training.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the enterprise scheme serves a useful purpose and has contributed to increases in employment and reductions in unemployment at an acceptable cost to the State.</P>
    <P>It is my policy to keep the operation of all employment schemes under review with a view to making improvements where necessary.  For example, last September, I announced that the allowance payable under the scheme would be increased and paid over a shorter period of time in order to provide greater support at the start-up phase of the enterprise. I also indicated that £100,000 was being allocated to FÁS for the provision of expert advice and guidance to scheme participants where such advice was not readily available in FÁS.</P>

      <P>My first priority as President-in-Office of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers will be to promote measures to combat unemployment, especially long-term unemployment for which I am bringing forward a special initiative.  I am giving priority also to measures concerning vocational training and the occupational safety and health of workers.  I am confident that a number of such items will be ready for adoption at the Social Affairs Council on 29 May 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated in reply to other questions to-day, I am doing everything I can to ensure that the individual proposals in the social action programme following the adoption of the Community <Col N="2268" /> charter on fundamental social rights are brought forward by the Commission as soon as possible and that a firm timetable is set out for their consideration by the Social Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>As part of the major programme of Community aid to central and eastern Europe, I will be progressing Community initiatives in the vocational training area, notably the establishment of a European training foundation.</P>
    <P>I am promoting a Presidency resolution which I hope to have adopted on the protection of the dignity of workers at the workplace, which deals with the question of sexual harassment.  I am hopeful that a Council resolution on racism and xenophobia can also be adopted at the May Social Affairs Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Department of Justice that the employment arrangements involved here arise from the nature of the work involved.  The work is mainly undertaken in the evenings, weekends or specific days during the week and is spread over a wide number of locations. In view of this it was felt that the best arrangement was to engage supervisors from the FÁS Register to give employment to unemployed people who have had their job-skills assessed and who are <Col N="2269" /> seeking employment.  They are engaged from between five to 14 hours per week to fit in with the work involved.  The tax arrangements have been agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Department of Justice that employment on a full-time basis will be kept under review should that prove to be an efficient manner to carry out the work concerned.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, there is no contravention of labour law.  I do intend, however, to introduce legislation later this year to bring regular part-time workers within the scope of all labour legislation.</P>

      <P>The following schedule sets out the information requested by the Deputy in respect of each commission committee, working group or other similar body set up since 1 January 1986 to advise on the policy or functions of my Department.</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Temporary Advisory Committee on the proposed National Gallery-Museum of Modern Art:</i></P>
      <P>This Committee was established in January 1988 to advise on the arrangements for the establishment and running of the proposed Gallery-Museum.  The committee prepared a report (26 April 1988) on the administrative structure, funding and staffing of the Gallery which has been used as a basis for the establishment of the new Irish Museum of Modern Art.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>Irish Museum of Modern Art Management Group:</i></P>
      <P>A Management Group which will establish the Irish Museum of Modern Art and oversee necessary adaptation works there was appointed in November 1989.  This group will shortly be incorporated in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham Company on the completion by the existing Board of its term of office.</P>
      <P>3.  <i>The National Archives Advisory Council:</i></P>
      <P>The National Archives Advisory Council is established under Section 20 of the National Archives Act, 1986, and was constituted in February 1987.  Its function is to advise the Taoiseach in the exercise of his powers under the Act and on all matters affecting archives and their use by the public.</P>
      <P>The Annual Report of the Council is due shortly.</P>
      <P>4.  <i>The National Statistics Board:</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>Status</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Board was established in February 1986 as an interim non-statutory board pending legislation to establish it on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" />
      <i>Functions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The functions of the Board are to:</P>
    <P>(a)  establish priorities for the compilation and development of official statistics;</P>
    <P>(b)  assess the resources of staff, equipment and finance which should be made available for the compilation of official statistics; and</P>
    <P>(c)  arbitrate on any conflicts which may arise between the CSO and any other public authority relating to the extraction of statistics from the records of the public authority.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Reports</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Board has issued two reports to date.</P>
    <P>(1)  Report of the National Statistics Board Strategy for Statistics 1988-1992 (published in May 1988).</P>
    <P>(2)  1989 Annual Report of the National Statistics Board Implementation of Strategy for Statistics 1988-1992 (published in June 1988).</P>
    <P>Both of these reports have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendations</i>
    </P>
    <P>The recommendations made by the Board in its first report as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  The CSO should carry out the following large-scale periodical inquiries during 1988-1992:</P>
    <P>&mdash; an EC labour costs survey</P>
    <P>&mdash; a census of agriculture</P>
    <P>&mdash; a census of population;</P>
    <P>(2)  A significant improvement of statistics for the service sectors;</P>
    <P>(3)  A strengthening of the balance of payments statistics;</P>
    <P>(4)  The introduction of a mainly postalbased agricultural statistics enumeration system;</P>
    <P>(5)  Improvement of the annual national accounts; and</P>
    <P>(6)  Development of a combined trade-industrial production classification to maximise the usefulness of trade and production statistics.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Action taken on these recommendations</i>
    </P>
    <P>The action taken to date on these recommendations is fully outlined in Chapter 2 of the Board's 1989 Annual Report which is in <Col N="2272" /> the Oireachtas Library.  A brief summary of the action is as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Government has given approval for the carrying out of censuses of population and agriculture in 1991.</P>
    <P>&mdash; An EC labour cost survey was undertaken in 1988 and summary results will issue by mid-1990</P>
    <P>&mdash; A new quarterly employment in earnings inquiry for the financial services sector was released in January 1990.</P>
    <P>(2)  A census of services was carried out as planned and results will issue later this year.</P>
    <P>(3)  Negotiation is currently under way with the EC Commission to secure financing for the development of specific aspects of Balance of Payments statistics methodology.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is planned to stage a census of agriculture in conjunction with the census of population in 1991 at a saving of £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>(5)  A consultant is currently engaged in compiling an input-output table.  This development will provide for the application of the input-output approach to the compilation of the national accounts.</P>
    <P>(6)  It is planned to complete this project jointly with the conversion to the new NACE (EC Nomenclature of Economic Activities) which is being developed in parallel with the UN classification ISIC (International Standard Industrial Classification). A draft regulation on the NACE is currently under discussion at Working Party level. When passed this will make the adoption of national nomenclatures based on the revised NACE mandatory with effect from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>National Heritage</i></P>
    <P>(a)  A temporary Committee was established in April 1988 to advise on the establishment of a National Heritage Council.  This Committee reported in June 1988 and its report was the basis for the National Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>National Heritage Council</i></P>
    <P>(i)  <i>Terms of reference:</i> The National Heritage Council is a non statutory body, established by the Taoiseach in 1988 to formulate policies and priorities for the preservation and enhancement of Ireland's heritage.  The Council's specific areas of responsibility are archaeology, architecture, flora and fauna, landscape, heritage gardens and certain inland waterways.</P>
    <P>The Council is responsible to the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department <Col N="2273" /> of Finance has general responsibility for its affairs.  The Council is responsible for allocating funds which were set aside from the national lottery for heritage purposes.</P>
    <P>In addition to its general mandate the Council has the following particular functions:</P>
    <P>1.  to formulate policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of Ireland's cultural and natural heritage;</P>
    <P>2.  to actively promote among the general public and interest and pride in our heritage and to facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of it;</P>
    <P>3.  to work closely with and to make recommendations to Government Departments, planning authorities, public bodies and State companies in relation to all matters coming within the Council's general area of responsibility and to ensure the co-ordination of all activities in the heritage field.</P>
    <P>4.  to decide on the distribution of moneys allocated for heritage work subject to the approval of the Taoiseach and to decide on priorities for such expenditure.</P>
    <P>5.  to advise the Government on the drafting of the legislation for the establishment of the National Heritage Council on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Nature:</i> the council is a non-statutory body and the intention is to place it on a statutory basis as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Details are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Defence Review</i></P>
      <P>(a)  A defence review committee was established in August 1987 as an <i>ad hoc</i> body.</P>
      <P>(b) The review involved a comprehensive examination of the defence area including civil defence with the objective of developing the most relevant and realistic cost effective defence arrangements.</P>
      <P>(c)  The review has brought to light certain issues in a number of areas which require detailed examination.  I have arranged to have the necessary analysis carried out.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>Interdepartmental Committee on</i><i>Defence Forces Pay, Allowances and Conditions</i></P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Terms of Reference:</i></P>
      <P>&ldquo;To examine and report on the pay, allowances and conditions of officers, non-commissioned ranks and privates in the Defence Forces &mdash; the examination to give special attention to problems caused by an outflow of personnel with special training or skills&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(b)  Established June 1988, lapsed July 1989.</P>
      <P>(c)  A report by the committee was considered by the Government in December 1988 and details of the outcome were set out in replies to Dáil Questions Nos. 250 and 251 on 25 January 1989 (Dáil Report No. 1 vol. 386 columns 174 to 186).</P>
      <P>(d)  All increases in allowances have been fully implemented.  Payment of increases in basic pay is being phased in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Pay Agreement and the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> 40 per cent of the increases was paid with effect from 1 July 1989 and the balance is payable as follows:</P>
      <P>30 per cent with effect from 1 April 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2279" /> 30 per cent with effect from 1 October 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 78, 79, 81, 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the status of each of the Conventions referred to is as follows: the European Convention on Consular Functions was opened for signature on 11 December 1967 and has been ratified by Greece, Norway, Portugal and Spain.  It has not entered into force since it has not been ratified by the required number of countries.</P>
      <P>The European Convention on the Abolition of Legalisation of Documents Executed by Diplomatic Agents or Consular Officers was opened for signature on 7 June 1968 and has been ratified by Austria, Cyprus, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK.</P>
      <P>The European Convention on the Repatriation of Minors was opened for signature on 28 May 1970 and has been ratified by Turkey.  It has not entered into force since it has not been ratified by the required number of countries.</P>
      <P>The European Convention on State Immunity was opened for signature on 16 May 1972 and has been ratified by Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK.  It may not be appropriate to take a decision regarding this Convention pending the completion by the United Nations International Law Commission of the work on State immunity from jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The European Convention on the Service Abroad of Documents relating to Administrative Matters was opened for signature on 24 November 1977 and has been ratified by Austria, Belgium, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Convention on the <Col N="2282" /> Recognition of the Legal Personality of International Non-Governmental Organisations was opened for signature on 24 April 1986 and has been ratified by Greece and the UK.  It has not yet entered into force as it has not been ratified by the required number of countries.</P>
    <P>In the case of each of the many Council of Europe Conventions drawn up over the years the question of possible signature and ratification by Ireland has to be considered carefully with a view to establishing the legal, constitutional and possible legislative and cost implications. In the case of the Conventions referred to in the Deputy's present questions, as in all other cases, the matter has received preliminary consideration.  Much further detailed work and consultation would, however, be necessary; and to date priority has been given in this work to a number of other conventions where it appeared more clearly in Ireland's interest to become a party.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Council of Europe Agreement relating to Application of the Euopean Convention on International Commercial Arbitration, which was opened for signature on 17 December 1962.</P>
      <P>The Convention was adopted under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations at Geneva on 21 April 1961 and is not a Council of Europe Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agreement is of interest only to the States which are parties to the European Convention on International <Col N="2283" /> Commercial Arbitration and has been ratified by the following States &mdash; Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain.  Ireland is not a party to this Convention and the question of signature or ratification does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe Agreement on Au Pair Placement was opened for signature on 24 November 1969 and has been ratified by the following countries &mdash; Denmark, France, Italy, Norway and Spain.</P>
      <P>Ireland's signature of the Agreement would not increase the protection of Irish <i>au pairs</i> abroad.  The Agreement is not based on reciprocity and, therefore, those States which are parties to it are bound to extend its protection to all <i>au pairs</i> regardless of their nationality.</P>
      <P>The Departments concerned with the welfare of foreign <i>au pairs</i> in Ireland are satisfied that present provision for their welfare is adequate and do not favour the further legislative and administrative machinery which ratification of the Agreement would necessitate.  For these reasons it is not proposed to sign the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish <i>au pairs</i> going abroad who consult my Department are advised to insist on a written agreement with their host families before leaving the country.  While they are abroad they have, of course, available to them the protection and care of the local Irish diplomatic mission. <Col N="2284" /> Similarly foreign <i>au pairs</i> coming to this country have the protection of their own diplomatic missions here should the occasion arise.</P>

      <P>Ireland signed the Convention relating to Stops on Bearer Securities in International Circulation on 23 April 1974.  It is not proposed to ratify the Convention at this time.  There are few bearer securities in circulation in Ireland and there are none listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.  In the circumstances, the administrative machinery necessitated by the implementation of the Convention and the costs it would involve would be disproportionate to the benefits to be derived from its application.  In addition, the number of countries which are parties is so small that ratification by us would not confer significant advantage.</P>
      <P>The Convention was opened for signature on 28 May 1970 and entered into force on 11 February 1979 when it had been ratified by four countries &mdash; Austria, Belgium, France and Luxembourg.  No other countries have ratified it since and Austria denounced it with effect from 6 January 1989.  In an assessment exercise carried out in 1987 on behalf of the Parliamentary Assembly most of the member states declared that they were not interested in the Convention on account of its complicated nature and the scale of the administrative machinery involved.</P>

      <P>I informed the Dáil in a reply I gave on 23 November last [Official Report vol. 393, cols. 1578-1585] of the position in international law governing the operation of submarines and I set out the action the Government have taken, having regard to international law, to convey their views in the matter of the operation of submarines in areas where fishing vessels are known to be present, especially in comparatively narrow sea lanes such as those in the Irish Sea.  I am satisfied that the British authorities are fully aware of our views and concerns which we have also brought to the attention of the international community through, for example, the International Maritime Organisation and the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where it has been possible to identify a submarine which was involved in an incident with an Irish fishing vessel, the Government have undertaken bilateral contact with the State concerned.  British submarines have been identified as being involved in a number of incidents affecting Irish fishing vessles.  With regard to the most recent incident involving the <i>Contestor P,</i> I told the Dáil in another reply given on 23 November last [Official Report vol. 393, cols. 1591-1592 that the British Ambassador was told of the Government's serious concern about the incident, which had to be seen against a background of a number of incidents in <Col N="2286" /> the past involving Irish and other vessels. The Ambassador was asked to convey to his authorities the Government's concern that measures be taken to prevent a recurrence of this incident and that compensation should be paid.</P>

Its function is to advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs on issues arising in the resettlement of refugees admitted to Ireland in accordance with Government decisions.

      <P>I propose to take these questions together.  The Deputy will appreciate that these Conventions were negotiated some considerable years ago and that in the time available it was not possible to assemble the information on which to provide a complete reply.  This will require consultation with other Departments.  I expect to have this done shortly and I will communicate with the Deputy directly.</P>

      <P>The OECD/Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Assistance was opened for signature on 25 January 1988.  The basic purpose of the Convention which covers both the European and the non-European members of the OECD, as well as Council of Europe States, is to allow ratifying states to develop administrative co-operation covering all compulsory taxes, with the exception of customs duty.  As of 8 January last Norway was the only country to have ratified the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decision has been taken on the question of signature and ratification of <Col N="2290" /> this Convention by Ireland.  This country has a network of double taxation agreements and these arrangements work adequately for our purposes of administrative assistance so that there is no urgency about considering the question of adherence to the Convention.  Any consideration of ratifying the Convention will of course have regard to the legal, cost and other implications for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 6 January 1990, and submitted a claim for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment to the inspector of taxes on 12 January 1990.  The inspector is not yet in a position to deal with the claim as he is experiencing difficulty in obtaining verification of details of pay and tax deducted from one of the taxpayer's former employers.  The inspector wrote to the taxpayer in the matter on 2 February <Col N="2291" /> 1990.  The inspector recently contacted the employer and has been advised that the relevant vertification is now being submitted.  On receipt of same the taxpayers claim will receive immediate attention.</P>

      <P>I assume that this question refers to the Milltown feeder which enters the Grand Canal near Lowtown. A recent inspection of the banks of the feeder by the Office of Public Works did not reveal any evidence of instability. However, if the Deputy wishes to furnish me with more specific details, the matter will be further investigated.</P>

      <P>The Government, by a decision of 27 March 1987, relaunched the programme to decentralise the Civil Service.  The programme adheres to those centres, including Waterford, that were originally chosen for decentralised offices in October 1980.</P>
      <P>Under the original 1980 programme, sections from the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs had been designated for decentralising to Waterford. The establishment since then of two State-sponsored bodies, An Post and Telecom Éireann, whose activities previously had formed part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, has necessitated a reassessment of the situation.</P>
      <P>This matter is being actively pursued at present.  A suitable site for the decentralised offices in Waterford is available.</P>

      <P>The Convention for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage was opened for signature on 6 May 1969. It has not been signed by Ireland as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention was designed to protect as far as possible archaeological <Col N="2301" /> objects, by forbidding clandestine excavations and to control the illicit circulation of archaeological objects.  It was also designed to give archaeological excavations their full significance by means of education.</P>
    <P>As it stands the existing convention does unfortunately give rise to problems, not least of which is the particular article which could serve to pre-empt the National Museum from acquiring archaeological objects suspected of having originated from clandestine excavations.</P>
    <P>The inter-governmental programme of activities of the Council of Europe for 1990 provides for a revision of the existing convention.  At this juncture it may be more practicable to await the outcome of the revision deliberations, before further consideration is given to signature of the convention.</P>
    <P>The following countries have ratified the convention to date: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the Holy See.</P>

      <P>Between the time of the publication of the report of the Planning Review Group and the setting up of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board discussions were held relating to the recommendation to set up a board.

      <P>The terms of reference of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board which I announced in a press release dated 2 January 1990, are as follows: The primary function of the board will be to assist the Minister in all aspects of harbour management and development.  In pursuing its function the board will (a) have particular reference to the recommendations of the Planning Review Group; (b) take note of the views of harbour users and other interested parties; (c) advise on the best management policy for the harbour to ensure the greatest benefit to harbour users; (d) seek proposals from private investors and others for developments in the harbour area; (e) advise the Minister on the establishment of marina facilities at the Harbour; and (f) evaluate development proposals and place them on public display.</P>
      <P>The board will not be working towards a single report or set of recommendations but they will advise me from time to time as is necessary.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I have stated to the House on a number of occasions my determination that aquaculture should proceed in a manner which is safe and which is consistent with the highest environmental standards and, in particular, the safeguarding of wild fish stocks.</P>
      <P>Expressed concerns about wild fish stocks relate to risks of disease and the possible impact of farmed fish escapees. As regards disease there is no evidence to suggest that there is a danger of the spread of disease from farmed salmon and trout to wild fish.  In fact all the evidence suggests that the opposite is the case.  Some diseases have been introduced into farmed fish by wild fish whilst other diseases which are peculiar to farmed salmon and trout are never found in wild fish.</P>
      <P>In relation to escapes, I expect to receive shortly the report of the Review Group on mandatory codes of practice for the aquaculture industry which I commissioned last year.  The Review Group will address in its report procedures to minimise escapes in the first place and remedial measures to be taken in the event of escapes occurring.</P>
      <P>I am staying closely in touch with research in this area both in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the sea trout issue which is of particular concern to some groups, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a <Col N="2305" /> question on this subject to the House on 13 February 1990.</P>
    <P>There is no scientific evidence to indicate any linkage between the 1989 decline in numbers in the west and the prevalence of fish farming activities in that region. Indeed such information as exists on this subject suggests otherwise.</P>

When the <Col N="2309" /> Government obtained the report of the Inter-departmental Committee it became clear that the deployment of search and rescue helicopter could not be considered in isolation from the overall strategy for dealing with distress incidents within the Irish search and rescue region and should take account of facilities provided by the various search and rescue agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government considered that an in-depth review of Irish search and rescue arrangements was required and it established the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services to carry this out.</P>

Setting of standards for feedingstuffs by the Department of Agriculture and Food.<br />3.  Permission by the Veterinary Services of the Department of Agriculture and Food to allow in, initially on a trial basis, Corona negative hysterectomised bonhams.<br />4.  Introduction on an industry-wide basis of incentives for expanding pig production.<br />5.  The setting out of clearly stated guidelines on neat slurry production to assist local authorities in considering planning applications.<br />6.  Mandatory application of lean meat grading standards and the implementation by the industry of payment for pigs on the basis of lean meat/weight.<br />7.

            <entry>In January 1990 three reports were submitted.<br />The main conclusions and recommendations are:<br />1.  Listeria: The report outlines the main foods which can transmit listeria to man and calls for high standards of safety and hygiene in food production and preparation and recommends that groups in society most at risk be made aware of the hazard of listeriosis and preventative measures.
<Col N="2327" /><Col N="2328" />2.  Food irradiation: The report underlines the potential of food irradiation in combination with good basic standards of hygiene practice as a means of preserving food and reducing the threat of food borne diseases and recommends acceptance of current EC proposals in relation to controls on food irradiation.<br />3.  Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE): The report concludes that there is no evidence to suggest that BSE or scrapie is transmissible to humans.</entry>
            <entry>The recommendations and conclusions contained in each report are currently being examined in so far as each Department is concerned.</entry>

      <P>The rate of EC ewe premium applicable in Ireland for any particular marketing year is fixed by the EC on the basis of the loss of income suffered by producers in this country by reference to the difference between the average market price for sheepmeat here and the EC basis price during the marketing year in question and to certain stabilizing mechanisms.  I have no function therefore, in regard to fixing the level of the EC ewe premium.  I would point out, however that the 50 per cent advance of 1989 ewe premium at £9.50 seems to forecast a 1989 ewe premium of around £19 as compared to the 1988 ewe premium of £17.40.  Furthermore I was pleased to note the EC Commission's proposal in the current price negotiations to increase the ewe premium payable to sheep farmers in disadvantaged areas from 1991 by about £3.50 per ewe and I intend to do everything in my power to have this proposal adopted.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing sheep headage payment rates in our disadvantaged areas is one that will be considered in the overall context of the headage schemes generally when the extension-reclassification of our disadvantaged areas is agreed by the EC.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the director of ERAD that in County Limerick in 1989 there were 12 herds comprising 693 animals depopulated for bovine TB and 17 herds comprising 816 animals depopulated for brucellosis. There were 520 herd restrictions for TB and 56 for brucellosis which resulted in the removal of 1,435 TB reactors and 329 brucellosis reactors.</P>
      <P>Amounts paid for compensation relate to actual payments made in the course of each calendar year.  It is not possible to relate these amounts to the actual numbers of herds depopulated or of animals removed in that year.  Reactor, depopulation and income supplement grant payments which herdowners in County Limerick received in addition to the factory prices for slaughtered animals amounted to £744,475 in 1989.</P>

      <P>The European Convention on Insider Trading is designed to co-ordinate endeavours among the member states of the Council of Europe to tackle the problem of insider trading. The Convention was opened for signature on 20 April 1989, but as it has not, so far, been ratified by any member state, it has not yet come into force.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of Ireland's ratification, the problem of insider trading is being tackled in Part V of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which as the Deputy is aware, is at present under consideration by a Special Committee of the House.  The problem of insider trading is also being tackled at EC level and the Special Committee recently agreed amendments which I tabled to this Part of the Companies (No. 2) Bill to implement the EC Directive of 13 November 1989 Co-ordinating Regulations on Insider Dealing.</P>
      <P>When this Bill is enacted, the necessity to pursue the question of ratification of the Convention will be considered.  In this connection, it is of interest to note that a Protocol to the Convention was adopted in July 1989 at the request of the EC, which provides that, in their mutual relations, members of the EC shall apply Community Rules except in so far as there is no Community rule governing the particular subject concerned.</P>

      <P>In December 1985, the EC Council authorised the EC Commission to conduct negotiations to enable the Community to become a contracting party to the European Agreement limiting the use of certain detergents in washing and cleaning products and the Protocol amending that Agreement. Shortly afterwards, the Commission examined with the Secretariat of the Council of Europe what procedures would allow the Community to accede to these instruments.</P>
      <P>As a result of these consultations, the Commission reached the conclusion that it was not advisable to continue these negotiations inasmuch as the member states of the Council of Europe which are not Community member states had not, with the exception of Switzerland, shown any interest in the Agreement or the Protocol.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the EC Council, on receipt of a recommendation from the Commission, agreed that (a) the negotiations should not be continued; (b) those member states which had not already signed the Council of Europe instruments would refrain from doing so; and (c) those member states which had signed the instruments would not deposit the ratification or approval instruments.</P>
      <P>The Convention would appear to have been opened for signature around 1966. In view of the EC Council's aforementioned conclusions, there would appear to be little compelling reason to proceed to ratification at this stage.</P>

      <P>As the European Convention on Products Liability in regard to Personal Injury and Death has not been ratified by any member state of the Council of Europe, it has not yet come into force.  The Convention provides that it shall only come into force when it has been ratified by three member states of the Council.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of Ireland's ratification, the position is that when the Convention was opened for signature on 27 January 1977 discussions had already begun on a draft EC Directive on liability for defective products.  Because of this the question of Ireland's ratifying the Convention was left in abeyance.</P>
      <P>The EC Directive on Liability for Defective Products was adopted in July 1985.  I have already indicated, in reply to Question No. 8 on 15 February 1990 that I hope to be in a position to introduce in the current session legislation to give effect to the directive.  This will introduce in Ireland a regime of strict liability which was also the objective of the Convention. In these circumstances, I do not now propose to pursue the question of ratification.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe Convention on the Establishment of Companies is designed to provide common rules for the treatment to be accorded to companies and other bodies of each ratifying State in the territories of the other ratifying States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Convention was opened for <Col N="2336" /> signature in 1986, only Luxembourg has ratified it.  The Convention has not entered into force because to do so requires the ratification of five countries.</P>
    <P>While the adoption of a unified code for the treatment to be accorded to companies as proposed in the Convention might have certain advantages, a substantial revision of Irish law would clearly be involved.  In a sense, the EC Programme aimed at harmonising the laws of member states governing the formation and operation of limited liability companies which also addresses this area supersedes the Convention, and we have concentrated our resources and negotiating and implementing the relevant EC Directives and Regulations.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to pursue the question of signing and ratifying the Convention.</P>

      <P>Irish Life will take a minority shareholding in the new company which will manage the Irish business of ICI.  AGF and Irish Life have agreed to consider together the prospects for future development which arise from the purchase of ICI, which enhance the respective positions of both companies in the market whilst at the same time further strengthening the insurance industry in Ireland.  One of the potential future developments could be a closer relationship in some form or other between ICI and Church and General, but consideration of this possibility will not take place for some time.</P>

    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Title:</i></P>
    <P>The Inter-Departmental Committee on the Problems of Early School-Leavers.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Date Established:</i></P>
    <P>September 1987.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Terms of Reference:</i></P>
    <P>In brief, these were to make recommendations to the Ministers for Labour and Education on how the resources of the Education and Manpower network could be directed more efficiently towards those leaving school without formal educational qualifications and whose employment prospects were severely constrained as a result.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Principal Recommendations:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;Action in respect of this cohort should be targeted on known blackspots.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Resources should be redeployed within FÁS to aid this group.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Second-level schools should be given additional resources to</P>
    <P>(i)  improve early identification of pupils at risk of early leaving,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to provide a variety of programme options ranging from alternative programmes in school, out of school programmes and/or improved teaching ratios and small group tuition,</P>
    <P>(iii)  to provide augmented remedial and guidance</P>
    <P>&mdash;A foundation programme of two years duration to provide training and linked work experience for people who leave the educational system without formal eduational qualifications.  This programme would consist of</P>
    <P>&mdash;a foundation year of training and experimental learning;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a progression year for those who fail to find employment at the end of year one which, according to need, will be made up of further <Col N="2342" /> specific training work on community projects or subsidised employment in the private sector.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Action Taken:</i></P>
    <P>On foot of this report, the following policy measures were implemented:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the existing six month programme targeted at Early School Leavers was replaced by one of up to two years duration, with the features described above.  This programme, which is a joint operation between FÁS and Education, is entitled Youthreach;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in accordance with the Programme for National Recovery commitment, an additional 600 places, making 1,000 in all, will be provided for early school-leavers without qualifications.  This will rise to 2,000 by 1991;</P>
    <P>&mdash;each trainee will be registered and an appropriate mix of courses identified for him/her;</P>
    <P>&mdash;foundation programmes were re-designed and extended in an integrated manner;</P>
    <P>&mdash;relevant programmes were targeted on areas which were identified as having significant problems.</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Title:</i></P>
    <P>Inter-Departmental Committee on Long-Term Unemployment.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Date Established:</i></P>
    <P>May 1988.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Principal Terms of Reference:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;to assess the impact of current programmes to help the long-term unemployed;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to recommend an action plan for the next few years.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Principal Findings/Conclusions:</i></P>
    <P>The Committee concluded that the causes of long-term unemployment are closely linked to the factors underlying rising unemployment overall.  These are, principally, to do with the stagnation in the economy, and the decline in the level of employment experienced by Ireland during the early 1980's.  However, there are specific reasons for the relative growth of long-term joblessness within the unemployment total. These relate to:</P>
    <P>(i)  major structural shifts in the industrial and occupational pattern of labour demand,</P>
    <P>(ii)  related upgrading of the level of education and skills required for many individual jobs,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2343" /> (iii)  relative lack of education and training among a significant minority of the workforce, together with an abundant supply of younger more educated workers.</P>
    <P>The level of long-term unemployment has stabilised in the recent past.  However, it will not decline significantly even if, as seems likely, unemployment falls over the next few years.</P>
    <P>As a result of this analysis, it recommended that</P>
    <P>&mdash;existing labour market training and employment subsidy schemes should be shifted towards the long term unemployed,</P>
    <P>&mdash;temporary work schemes such as the SES should be expanded and targetted on the older long term unemployed to maintain their links with the labour market.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Action Taken</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;Participation is being increased on the Social Employment Scheme in 1990.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Employment Incentive Scheme has been revamped and redirected, <i>inter alia,</i> towards the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Title:</i></P>
    <P>Interim Board for Occupational Safety and Health.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Date Established:</i></P>
    <P>April 1986.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Terms of Reference:</i></P>
    <P>To consider and report on</P>
    <P>(i)  the rationalisation of the existing system of occupational safety and health and the transitional arrangements which may be necessary for change-over to the new system proposed by the Commission;</P>
    <P>(ii)  appropriate follow-up action on the Commission's recommendations relating to information, education and training on occupational safety and health;</P>
    <P>(iii)  the establishment of links with organisations concerned with safety at work with a view to developing mechanisms for liaison under the new statutory system proposed by the Commission;</P>
    <P>(iv)  the transition from the Department of Labour's current safety advisory council to new arrangements under the proposed National Authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2344" /> 4.  <i>Outcome of Deliberations:</i></P>
    <P>The Interim Board carried out its work through the creation of a number of working groups to examine and report on various aspects of the proposed new occupational safety and health system.  The reports of the working groups were presented to the Minister by the Interim Board as they became available for his consideration in the period leading up to and during the passage through the Oireachtas of the Bill on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work.  The work of the Interim Board was complete with the passing of the Bill into legislation in April, 1989, and the Interim Board was then disbanded.</P>
    <P>1.  <i>Title:</i></P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee on Management Training.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Date Established:</i></P>
    <P>23 July 1987.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Terms of Reference:</i></P>
    <P>In brief, they are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to make recommendations to the Minister for Labour on how management training can contribute more effectively to economic development, to examine the effectiveness of management training, the funding of training programmes, and to advise on the longer-term co-ordination and rationalisation of management training.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Recommendations:</i></P>
    <P>The main recommendations are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the need to increase the level of commitment to management development be adopted as urgent national priority;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Guidelines for Management Development drawn up by the Committee should be promoted to Irish management as a code of good practice;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the management and training activities of the IMI and IPA should be integrated;</P>
    <P>&mdash;providers of business education should offer a broadly common curriculum, a business education module should be included in other educational areas (e.g. science, engineering, etc);</P>
    <P>&mdash;State funding of management training should be switched from &ldquo;providers&rdquo; to &ldquo;users&rdquo; and towards activities that will ensure the more effective realisation of national objectives;</P>
    <P>&mdash;State assistance for management development should be targeted at small businesses; incentives should be provided to implement their programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2345" /> 5.  <i>Action Taken:</i></P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Report, there have been detailed consultations with all interested parties about the correct action which the Government should take in light of the Committee's recommendations.  I expect to submit proposals to the Government in the very near future.</P>

    <P>In 1986, forestry functions were the responsibility of the Forestry and Wildlife Division of the then Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry.  In 1987 that Department was renamed the Department of the Marine and discarded its tourism and forestry-wildlife functions. The wildlife functions of the Forestry and Wildlife Division went to the Office of Public Works and my Department was given responsibility for the forestry functions. In 1989, the main functions relating to State forestry were transferred from my Department to the newly established State sponsored body, Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>These changes resulted in large transfers of staff including the appointment of staff who were providing common services for the various divisions.  In the circumstances, it would not be possible to give the breakdown requested in respect of 1986 for the forestry functions left with my Department.</P>

The Irish Government will press to ensure that this principle is applied to the THORP discharges.  The policy of the Irish Government is that it is opposed to the existence of any risk from discharges from Sellafield, and for that reason have sought and will continue to seek its closure.

      <P>Part of the work of my Department consists of ongoing review of entitlements under all social welfare schemes.  Some of these reviews are at the request of claimants who feel that they may be entitled to a higher level of payment, while other reviews form part of the Department's ordinary control functions ensuring by way of spot-checks that claimants continue to fulfil the various statutory conditions governing their payments.  It is estimated that since 1987, well over £100 million has been saved by various measures to combat fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming.  This year it is estimated that a further £30 million will be saved by measures which help to control abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1987, I considered that there was a need for a special effort to combat to a greater extent fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming of social welfare. There are three special investigation units operating within the Department charged with the task of investigating social welfare fraud in the unemployment <Col N="2355" /> payments area.  These are the External Control Unit (ECU), the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) and the Joint Investigation Unit (JIU).  The latter comprise officers of the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners and investigate both social welfare and Revenue fraud.  The SIU and JIU have been amalgamated, with effect from 15 January 1990.</P>
    <P>There are, in addition, special officers whose investigative work relates only to the sickness schemes.</P>
    <P>The special investigative staff in the unemployment payments and sickness benefit areas in the years 1987 to 1989 was as follows: 97 officers in 1987, 108 officers in 1988 and 104 officers in 1989. Figures are not available on a comparative basis for 1986.  Following the amalgamation of the SIU and JIU last month, the number of staff serving in the SIU/JIU was increased, bringing to 119 the number of officers who are involved in special investigation duties during 1990.</P>

      <P>The European Convention on Social Security was opened for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe on 14 December 1972, and was signed by Ireland on 23 February 1979. To date eight of the member states of the Council of Europe viz. Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Turkey have ratified the Convention.</P>
      <P>The Convention is designed to ensure in each ratifying country equality of treatment in social security for nationals of other ratifying countries and for refugees and stateless persons and also to ensure that entitlement to social security benefits is maintained despite changes of residence within such countries.</P>
      <P>Of the eight countries which have ratified the Convention to date, six are members of the European Community and the social security entitlements of persons moving between Ireland and those countries are already protected by the EC Regulations.  The other two countries which have ratified the convention are Austria and Turkey.  Ireland now has a bilateral agreement with Austria which came into effect in December 1989 following negotiations which I recently completed with my counterpart in Austria.  This protects the social security entitlements of migrant workers who move between Ireland and Austria.  The provisions in these Regulations and agreements are broadly similar to those provided for in the Convention and ratification of the Convention by Ireland would not confer any additional advantages on Irish workers in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at present pursuing a programme of bilateral agreements on social security with countries with which Ireland has a significant interchange of migratory workers.  Of the member states the Council of Europe, excluding the member states of the European Community and <Col N="2357" /> Austria, negotiations are in progress with Switzerland and it is intended that discussions with Sweden will commence in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Council of Europe Convention on the Social Protection of Farmers was opened for signature on 6 May 1974.  The Convention requires contracting states to provide a range of social security schemes for farmers at the same level as other protected categories.

For instance, as announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement, an inter-departmental study is to be undertaken this year into the operation of the PRSI system.  Apart from these, committees or working groups are formally established from time to time to report on particular issues.  In May 1989 the review group on the treatment of households in the social welfare system was established to examine the social welfare code in so far as it affects households with particular regard to the equal treatment provisions.  The review group is expected to complete its deliberations within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will then consider what action may be necessary in the light of the review group's report.  In February 1989 a supervisory committee for the loan guarantee fund, set up as part of the Government's action plan on money-lending, was established.  The supervisory committee made recommendations in November 1989 regarding the operation of the fund.  These have been implemented.  In November 1987, a joint working group comprising officials of the Department and the Irish Dental Association was established to examine all aspects of the social insurance dental benefit scheme.  The working group reported in July 1988.  It was unable to reach agreed recommendations.  The views expressed in the report have been taken into consideration in the context of the <Col N="2360" /> development of the dental benefit scheme.</P>

      <P>Under Social Welfare legislation, a whole-time share-fisherman, who is unable to put to sea owing to adverse weather conditions, is entitled to unemployment benefit for any day on which he is not engaged in any work associated with fishing such as the maintenance of a ship or of gear.  Entitlement to benefit is subject to satisfaction of the normal contribution conditions.  Where the contribution or other conditions are not satisfied, a whole-time share-fisherman may apply instead for unemployment assistance.  Part-time fishermen, who are unemployed, may also apply for unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Following investigation, a deciding officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £70.72 per week from 11 October 1989.  The means are derived from the net yearly value of his holding and from capital.  This assessment leaves him entitled to payment of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £5.20.</P>
      <P>He appealed against this decision.  Following an examination of the papers an appeals officer decided to hold an oral hearing of the appeal to afford the claimant an opportunity of presenting his case personally.  However, due to the volume of appeals cases on hands at present it has not yet been possible to fix a date for the hearing of his case.  A date will be set as soon as possible and the claimant will then be informed of the arrangements for the hearing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189, 190, 191, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 201, 202, 208, 209, 210, and 211 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought concerning the dates when the Conventions were opened for signature and the countries which have ratified them is contained in the material on Council of Europe Conventions which the Minister for Foreign Affairs undertook (in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 76 of 6 February 1990) to make available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I am unable to agree that it would be a function of mine to state, in reply to a parliamentary question, the implications of these Conventions for the State, unless I were asking the Dáil to take some action on them which in fact I am not at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, with regard to Question No. 196, I can say that the Convention on the Registration of Wills was designed with formal wills declared to a notary chiefly in mind and is not of value to countries such as Ireland which do not have that form of will.  In the circumstances it is not proposed that this Convention be ratified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to Question No. 211 it is not proposed to ratify the Convention on a Uniform Arbitration Law.  The Convention was opened for signature in 16 January 1966.  It has not entered into force due to the fact that one State only (Belgium) has, so far, ratified it.  It is clear that the Convention has not found favour with the member states and is unlikely ever to come into force.  In the circumstances there would <Col N="2367" /> be no advantage to this country in ratification.</P>
    <P>In so far as the other Conventions are concerned, it is my intention to have the question of their ratification considered according as other priorities in my Department so permit.  Any proposals which I may have, as a result, in relation to any of these Conventions will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>

      <P>The object of the Agreement is to provide procedural machinery to enable residents of Contracting States of the Council of Europe who wish to apply for legal aid in civil, commercial or administrative matters in another Contracting State, to do so via a transmitting authority in the State in which they are resident.  The Legal Aid Board, 47 Upper Mount Street, Dublin 2 is the designated transmitting authority for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The European Agreement on Transmission of Applications for Legal Aid will facilitate people in Ireland who wish to pursue their entitlements to legal aid in other countries that are parties to the Agreement.  The other countries where the Agreement is in force are, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Finland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practical terms this will represent a considerable improvement for people in Ireland who want to apply for legal <Col N="2369" /> aid in those countries.  Such people are at a considerable disadvantage at present.  They are faced with problems of getting accurate information on legal aid facilities in foreign countries, with establishing lines of communication, and this is often compounded by language difficulties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 204 together.  The Convention was opened for signature in March 1983 and was signed by Ireland in August 1986.</P>
      <P>The Convention makes it possible for a person sentenced to imprisonment in a foreign country to serve that sentence in a country of which he is a national, where both countries involved are parties to the Convention.</P>
      <P>The practical and legislative measures which may be necessary to enable ratification to proceed are still under consideration in my Department and any legislative proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way.</P>
      <P>The Convention has been ratified by Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, Finland, United States and Canada.</P>

      <P>The Convention in question was opened for signature on 5 May 1989. Although it has been signed so far by 14 States it has only, given the relatively short period of time elapsed, been ratified by one of them.</P>
      <P>The question of the Convention being signed on behalf of Ireland is currently under consideration as is the question of whether fresh legislation will be needed to enable it to be ratified.  These issues are tied in with an examination of the mechanisms for implementing a recently adopted EC Directive on Broadcasting Activities which mirrors the Convention in all its substantive provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major advantage of the Convention is that it constitutes an agreed international framework for the transmission of television services &mdash; whether satellite or terrestrial based &mdash; on a transfrontier basis.  From Ireland's point <Col N="2389" /> of view it gives an assurance that television services, originating in participating countries and receivable here, will meet an agreed set of standards in certain critical areas of broadcasting.  It also provides a forum of recourse in the event of the standards allegedly being breached.</P>
    <P>The Convention has no cost implications for the Exchequer and in general there are no particular reservations relating to it.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to make compulsory the wearing of reflectorised armbands by pedestrians at night time.  Such a requirement would be extremely difficult to enforce.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council, through its publicity and education programme promotes the wearing of reflectorised armbands by pedestrians and pedal cyclists on an on-going basis.  They have the active support of local authorities and other bodies for this work and I consider this approach to be the most appropriate way to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>The rate support grant replaces in part the income from rates formerly applicable to domestic dwellings and agricultural land. This income varies from local authority to local authority, because of differences in valuation levels and in rate poundages applied by councils over the years.  These variations together with variations arising from other changes in local finances in recent years, including the abolition of certain levies and the termination of liability for certain local loans fund repayments, are reflected in differences in the rate support grant allocations for individual local authorities.</P>

      <P>At present, compulsory road-worthiness testing applies to about 45,000 heavy goods vehicles, buses, ambulances and taxis.  Testing is carried out by 103 testers &mdash; 95 private garages and eight CIE garages &mdash; which must have suitable premises and equipment.  Testers are appointed and supervised, at local level, <Col N="2400" /> by vehicle licensing authorities.  My Department have overall responsibility for supervising the vehicle testing scheme, at national level.</P>
      <P>The Government favour a step by step approach to the extension of compulsory testing to other categories of vehicles. Compulsory testing of light goods vehicles will be introduced in Ireland by 1 January 1995, in accordance with an EC Directive.  An estimated 35,000 vehicles over four year old will then be liable to be tested every two years.</P>
      <P>A draft EC Directive on compulsory car testing, provides that cars over five years old (467,000 in Ireland) be tested every two years.  The question of introducing compulsory car testing in Ireland will be kept under review in the light of developments at EC level.</P>

      <P>At present, it is an offence for the driver of a vehicle to have a level of alcohol in the blood in excess of 1 milligram per millilitre of blood.</P>
      <P>Recently, I announced that I intend to introduce amending legislation during 1990 providing for a reduction in this limit to 0.8 milligrames of alcohol per millilitre of blood.  This change will bring the Irish limit into line with the limit in most EC member states.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the Irish limit is a matter for the gardaí.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that there has not been effective enforcement of the law in this regard as it stands; nor do I consider that the reduced limit will create any undue difficulties for enforcement purposes.</P>

      <P>The Agreement concerns the provision of emergency medical services to temporary visitors under the same conditions which apply to persons normally resident here.  All Irish residents making temporary visits to other EC member states, and EC residents making temporary visits to Ireland, are already covered for emergency services under EC legislation. The extension of similar cover in Ireland to visitors from other countries could be accommodated within existing legislation. However, given both the extent of cover for visitors under the EC arrangements, and the financial constraints on the health services throughout the period since the Agreement was opened for signature in 1980, signature has not been considered a priority.</P>

      <P>1 Rule 14 of the Rules for National Schools states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Trustees of a vested school or recognised school committee constituted in accordance with the regulations set out in Schedule I or other <Col N="2415" /> suitable person may be recognised as patron.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister for Education for the time being is patron of the Model Schools.</P>
    <P>(3)  The patron may manage the school himself or may nominate a suitable person to act as manager.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subject to the approval of the Minister, the patron may, at any time, resume the direct management of the school, or may nominate another manager.</P>
    <P>(5)  In the event of a vacancy in the patronship by death, the successor of a clerical patron may be recognised as patron.</P>
    <P>(6)  The patron of a national school on residing out of Ireland for a continuous period of twelve calendar months is regarded as having ceased to hold office.</P>
    <P>2.  The Bishop of the Diocese in which a particular school is situated is usually the Patron of a Roman Catholic or Church of Ireland school.</P>
    <P>3.  In the case of Presbytarian schools, the local Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland acts as Patron.</P>
    <P>4.  The Chairman of the relevant District of the Methodist Church in Ireland acts as Patron for Medhodist Schools.</P>
    <P>5.  The Trustees of a Jewish school are recognised as Patron.</P>
    <P>6.  In some cases where there are two or more religious denominations represented in the composition of a school joint patrons may be recognised.</P>
    <P>7.  In the case of special schools, the Bishop of the Diocese or a limited company or a voluntary organisation may be recognised as Patron.</P>
    <P>8.  Patron Bodies (Private Companies without limited liability) are set <Col N="2416" /> up to act as Patrons of Multi-Denominational Schools.</P>

The Department would not be in a position to obtain details of the extent to which these suggestions are adopted by individual schools, but the Inspectorate report that many of the practices mentioned are widespread:&mdash; the larger schools have separate rooms for library use and many smaller schools have libraries too, perhaps on a class-by-class basis; as part of their environmental studies work, many teachers organise a nature table on which small objects of local historical or environmental interests are displayed; the awarding of prizes or other rewards for good behaviour or performance by pupils has been a practice followed by teachers for many years and it continues today.</P>

The State's role has been to aid and assist the provision of national schools in response to such local initiatives and the Constitution refers to this.

      <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of St. Laurence O'Toole senior girls' national school there were 119 pupils enrolled on 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus three assistants.  The school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher and a concessionary teacher under my Department's special scheme of teaching <Col N="2423" /> assistance for schools serving disadvantaged areas.  On current enrolments (112 pupils) the pupil-teacher ratio in the school is 22.4:1 (excluding the remedial teacher); including the remedial teacher the pupil teacher ratio is 18.7:1.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the special scheme, a school of this size is entitled to one concessionary post.</P>

            <entry>The Committee's First Report of May 1989 recommended a priority programme for improving access to rail services.  The necessary adaptation works have already been completed at Mallow Station by Iarnród Éireann.  Those at Tara Street Station involving access via lifts and escalators to both platforms, as recommended by the Committee to allow wheelchair access, are nearly completion.  Other recommendations (including provision of portable ramps, etc.) are being acted on as resources permit.</entry>

            <entry>The Committee's Second Report of December 1989 addressed in a preliminary way the very complex issue of imporving access to road transport.  Inspired by the Committee, Bus Atha Cliath has decided that replacement buses will be more accessible.  The Minister for the Environment is examining the Committee's recommendations that a wheelchair-accessible standard should be prescribed for all taxis.</entry>
