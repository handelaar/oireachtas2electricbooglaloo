      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 20 and 21.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that, (1) No. 7 shall be taken without debate; (2) the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 20 shall be brought to a conclusion if not previously concluded at 12 noon today and the Minister for the Environment shall be called on to conclude the debate not later than 11.45 a.m.; (3) the proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages of No. 20, and the Report and Final Stages of No. 21, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. and 3.45 p.m. respectively, by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the member of the Government in charge of the Bill in each case and (4) at the conclusion of business today the Dáil shall adjourn until 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 18 December 1990.</P>

      <P>I want to dispose of items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and then I shall call the Deputy.  In respect of No. 7 to be taken without debate, is that agreed? <Col N="2722" /> Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 20 and 21 agreed?  Agreed.  On No. 4, Deputy Spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposal that the Dáil resume at 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday next and sit until 9.30 p.m. on that day, I suggest that because of the very dangerous road conditions around the country that are expected to persist for a number of days, it would be more sensible if the Dáil was to resume at 12 noon on Tuesday and sit until 11 p.m. that night.  We would have the same amount of time and we could get our business done without having people on the roads very late on Monday night or early on Tuesday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said but nobody could argue that 10.30 a.m. is too early.  If we get sunshine as we did this morning all the ice and snow will have melted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is not taking this matter seriously.  If we are to start at 10.30 a.m. many Members who have a four hours drive would have to be on the road at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m., and in these conditions that would be very stupid.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that we are treating this matter lightly.  I am simply stating that there is a lot of business to be dealt with and the decision has been taken to start work at 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday.  There is no lack of sensitivity to the difficulties of Deputies who have to travel long journeys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Tánaiste would reflect a moment on this matter.  It is not a problem that particularly concerns me but I appreciate the concerns of other Deputies.  On the basis of what has been proposed, no time would be lost to the House in terms of its business.  If we were to start at midday and finish at 11 p.m., which has not been an unusual hour for us to sit in recent times, I do not think that would cause difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have organised the business on the basis of what I have read to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we are not going to have agreement and I shall have to put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the Tánaiste might be reluctant to concede a point as far as organising the business of the House is concerned, but quite frankly there will be no time lost.  There will be no difficulty in rescheduling the business. The only difficulty would be to move Private Members' time to a later slot.  We are all going to be here anyway, and it is silly to put lives at risk by asking Deputies to take to the roads at 5 a.m. or 5.30 a.m. The Tánaiste should agree to have the matter reconsidered by the Whips during the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are being perfectly reasonable in the proposal before us.  It would be rather foolish for Deputies who have to travel a long distance to leave the trip to Dublin until Tuesday morning.  In those circumstances it would be wise to make the trip the day before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter, given that it involves practical considerations, that ought to have been raised at the Whips' meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there is clearly manifest disagreement on the <Col N="2724" /> matter it might be appropriate if the Tánaiste would agree that the Whips meet again to discuss this precise issue and see if agreement can be reached.  If a new order has to be made as to the precise time we sit on Tuesday, it can be made during the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion would be a perfectly reasonable one if the matter had not been already discussed and agreed by the Whips.  I understand it was discussed by the Whips and agreed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be good for the House to divide on a matter of this kind.  It would be better if the Tánaiste could agree to a further discussion between the Whips without prejudice to whether it had been discussed.  I was not present so I cannot make any claims in that regard and we certainly should not have a dispute about a matter of that kind.  I suggest that the Tánaiste should agree to a Whips' meeting without prejudice to the existing order so that a new order can be made if agreement can be reached on different times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat the request which I made for genuine reasons.  I am not aware of any reason for the House rising at 9.30 p.m. on Tuesday.  The Whips should discuss the matter further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I live in a rural constituency and it is a problem travelling home at 11 p.m. on frosty roads.  It is no joke to be driving home at that hour.  I sympathise with the point but there have been a number of late nights recently. Late nights are not suitable for Deputies <Col N="2725" /> who have to travel home late on frosty nights.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach promised legislation to deal with the position of Romanian adoptions.  The Minister for Health, in column 673 of the Official Report of 29 November, a few days previously, indicated that he had said nothing which would amount to promised legislation in this area.  What happened between 29 November and yesterday in regard to this legislation?  How has it advanced?  Have the Cabinet considered the matter?</P>

There appears to be difficulties with the Bill in the context of our Constitution. Will the Tánaiste provide me with information, when available, in regard to when the patents Bill will be circulated or whether there are problems which would make it impossible to do so without a constitutional amendment?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Are the Government aware of the concern in the stock market that yesterday's inflation figures were leaked around midday when the official release was at 5 o'clock?  The earlier leaking was to the advantage of some investment managers but strongly to the disadvantage of others.  Will the Tánaiste say whether the Government intend to have an investigation to establish from where the leak came.  Was it from the Central Statistics Office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Yesterday the Taoiseach indicated to the House that the Government would bring forward legislation in relation to the recognition of foreign adoptions, but when Deputy Bruton asked the Tánaiste this morning what the position was he replied that legislation is in the course of preparation. By accident, matters have not been clear in relation to this.  I do not see this as being deliberate.

      <P>I pointed out last night that as a representative from the Longford/Roscommon area, I have a deep interest in proposals for this area. Stories were put about that at some stage either this commission or the last commission took an area from Mayo to Meath as a unit to be looked at, starting in County Mayo.  If there is any logic in this that is the only conclusion I can come to as to how this unreasonable decision has emerged in this Bill.  The terms of reference included natural boundaries. This is a complete turn around.  Health board, Euro constituencies and province boundaries have all been breached in this proposal.  There is grave disappointment in our county that Longford has been pitched into the situation to preserve an extra seat in the rest of Ireland, in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>This is not an electoral reforming Bill. With respect to the members of the commission the problems seem to have arisen from the 1988 commission and this is a hang-over from that.  The decision in relation to Longford/Roscommon is one of the most outrageous decisions that have emerged from any proposed legislation.</P>

      <P>This Bill requires us to vote on certain changes in our constituencies. These changes have been recommended by an independent commission set up by the Government.  The outcome of the deliberations of that commission are more than a little bit lopsided.  On four occasions county boundaries have been breached.  That is acceptable, but for the first time ever provincial boundaries have been breached and not only provincial boundaries but boundaries for Euro elections and health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1640s when an eminent person visited this country, one Oliver J. Cromwell, even he recognised provincial boundaries when he instructed the people in this part of the island to go to Hell or to Connacht.  Unfortunately the commission which was asked to review the constituencies did not bear in mind the same boundaries.  While I compliment the commission on many of their findings, looking at the province of Connacht we find some rather unusual recommendations. As regards Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Longford and Westmeath, there did not appear to be any problems. The only problem which arose was in County Mayo where, because of a dwindling population, the two constituencies of Mayo East and Mayo West, were not able to sustain six Deputies.  The simple solution would have been to reduce Mayo from two three-seat constituencies to one five-seat constituency and to leave the other constituencies as they were.  The Commission decided, for one reason or another, to lop off a portion of Galway with 4,400 inhabitants and put it into the Mayo East constituency to prop up that constituency.  When they looked at Mayo West they said we must do the same and lopped off another portion of Galway to prop up Mayo West with a population of 3,868.  Mayo East and Mayo West with two portions of Galway appear to be OK for two three-seat constituencies. <Col N="2734" /> Galway, albeit, have lost 7,500 of their population to the Mayo constituencies.</P>
    <P>Moving east we have the constituency of Roscommon whose inhabitants are nice, quiet, peace loving people who were happy as they were.  In this case Roscommon was put in with Longford, the most unnatural union anyone could have dreamed up.  It was the first time ever that a provincial boundary was crossed.</P>

      <P>The only two connecting points between Longford and Roscommon are two artificial bridges, one in Lanesboro and the other in Tarmonbarry. Apart from those artificial connecting points, there is no geographical connection between the two counties.  We have on the other hand the longest river in these islands separating Roscommon and Longford and extending in width from 50 yards to four and a half miles.  Either the bridges in Tarmonbarry and Lanesboro will be very busy in some months or years time or Bord Fáilte may provide boats for crossing the river.  It is one industry which the Minister for Industry and Commerce might contemplate.</P>

      <P>The revision of constituencies is never an easy job for whatever Minister or Government is in power <Col N="2735" /> at the time.  Article 16.2 of the Constitution obliges us to have a review of the constituencies every 12 years.  I have been looking through the debates on previous occasions and was struck by how offensive and bitter some of the exchanges in the Dáil have been in the past.  Even today the reality is that individual Deputies have their own views on the revisions and it is probably the case that no matter what way the constituencies were changed some people would be unhappy in their own situations. However, on this occasion it is a reality &mdash; and one that cannot be over-emphasised &mdash; that today's Bill incorporates the recommendations of an independent commission and as such the general welfare of the country is put first and the constitutional obligations placed on the Oireachtas by Article 16.2 of the Constitution can be fulfilled in a fair and equitable manner.  In this connection I want to join with the Minister when last night he paid tribute to the members of the commission.  Through their report and recommendations each of the commission members has given outstanding public service to the Oireachtas.  Article 16 also states that each Deputy should represent a minimum of 20,000 and a maximum of 30,000 of the population.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us reflects an average representation of 21,329 ranging from the minimum in North Tipperary of 19,841 and to 22,953 in County Louth.  This contrasts with an old range where Deputies in Dublin Central represented 18,346 people and in Dublin South West as high as 26,702.</P>
      <P>In my own case in County Meath we are affected by the over-spill from Dublin into a development county.  Again, we had been representing well above the average number.  The commission have now moved a part of Westmeath which we represented back into Westmeath, which leaves us with a figure of 20,776. This deals with our difficulty where we have a continuing increase in population, and the average representation is more even as a result of the revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of these representation <Col N="2736" /> levels is that the number of Deputies remains the same at 166, a figure first put forward in 1980.  In my view there is nothing wrong with this figure if only because it ensures the best possible representation. During the debate on the report on the 1983 Commission the former Deputy, John Kelly, said there is also the point that a smaller number of TDs might very well be a destabilising factor.  To reduce the number from 166 would result in representation levels nearer to the 30,000 mark.  This may not be too bad in an urban constituency but in rural constituencies, similar to the one I represent, the geographical expanse causes grave difficulties.  While I am on the subject of representation there has been much talk about multi-seat constituencies, especially five seaters.  The Bill proposes the reduction in the number of five seaters from 15 to 14. However, many of the five-seat constituencies are either urban constituencies or self-contained administrative units, such as County Meath and also many urban constituencies in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Galway.</P>
    <P>Like many people I have mixed feelings about five seat constituencies but the fact is that they suit some areas more than others.  The single seat system which was suggested here last night by some Deputies would be much too restrictive and even parochial.  As it is I believe I work well, as do my colleagues, on behalf of the people of County Meath, and while there may be occasional differences between us I do not think the people of County Meath are any worse off by the fact that they have multiple representation. If anything, the competition in a multiple seat constituency leads to more intense representation of our constituents, and I do not think that is any harm.</P>

      <P>The Chair hesitates to interrupt the Deputy, especially in respect of the length of speeches, which is not a matter for the Chair strictly speaking, but having regard to the many demands made upon the Chair this morning and the short duration of the Second <Col N="2737" /> Reading of this Bill &mdash; I am obliged to call the Minister at 11.45 p.m. &mdash; I would appeal for brevity so that as many as possible of the Members indicating would be facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss Wallace Miss Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing that in mind, I will refer briefly to some improvements I should like to see introduced, one of which relates to the register of electors. I will refer first to the supplementary register for the disabled.  At present a disabled person who wants to register on the supplementary register has to produce a medical certificate.  There is nothing wrong with this requirement but every year afterwards that person has to produce a certificate of competence.  I do not think there is any need for this requirement and I ask for it to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to main registers and the timing of them.  The draft register is issued on 1 December and has to be concluded by 15 January.  It is difficult for people to ensure that they are on the register at Christmas and the new year which is a very busy time of the year for them.  The political parties who play a major role in this are not as active at this time of the year.  The draft register should be issued earlier in the year, perhaps in September or October.  Serious consideration should be given to the introduction of a supplementary register which could remain in existence up until the date of election is called.  This would cover the many complaints we receive from people who voted at every election for 50 years but do not have a vote when an election is called because their name was inadvertently omitted from the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Deputy Seán Power referred to the recent Supreme Court case brought by the students of Waterford Regional Technical College.  The decision of 28 November last held that while there was a constitutional ban on double voting there was no such ban on double registration.  That was an important decision and aside from its implications for students it has implications for a range of other people.  I am not <Col N="2738" /> suggesting that those who register twice would vote twice but the position is far from satisfactory.  By allowing cross-registration the usefulness and status of the register could be brought into question. The terms in the Bill governing residence should be clarified and, perhaps, include named residence as distinct from the ordinary residence.  This would enable students, or anyone else affected by this, to name where their residence is.</P>
    <P>The whole question of electoral reform has never been an easy one.  However, as I said earlier, it has been made easier by the fact that we can now work on the recommendations of the commission, who are independent of this House and of the Government of the day.  The idea of an independent commission originated in the Fianna Fáil Party in the mid-seventies. Having regard to the bitterness of the debates in 1973 I do not think it is any harm that we have an independent commission.  However, this also needs a commitment by the Government and the Minister of the day.  This commitment has been a feature of the Government and, in particular, of the Minister.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to the Bill is different from that of some of the speakers who spoke last night, in particular that of Deputy Stagg and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who intervened in the debate.  They suggested that we should not criticise the commission because they were set up by the Dáil to establish constituency boundaries. I do not accept that argument.  Deputies have the right to criticise the findings of the commission during the course of this debate.  We should remember that the commission were appointed by the Government with agreed terms of reference laid down by the Dáil.  Therefore, the recommendations of the commission have to be examined by the Dáil.  If we have reason to criticise the recommendations of the commission then we have the right to do so in the Dáil during the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the commission do not regard <Col N="2739" /> themselves as above criticism.  If I contracted a firm of builders to build a house for me and presented them with an agreed specification and terms of reference but was not happy with the completed work nine months later I would, of course, take the builder aside and inform him of my dissatisfaction.  I would have the right to demand that he correct the mistakes and could even take legal actions against him.  If I was not happy with the completed work, when I was asked for a cheque to pay for it &mdash; this debate is the final check on this Bill &mdash; I would examine the terms of reference I gave to the builder and base my dissatisfaction or otherwise on them.</P>
    <P>Five rules were laid down in the terms of reference given to the commission on this occasion.  I will refer to the non-contentious ones first.  The first was that the number of Dáil Deputies had to be between 164 and 168 and there was no breach of that rule.  Another was the retention of traditional patterns of three-seat, four-seat and five-seat constituencies and we have no argument with that.  However, there was a serious breach of the other three terms of reference, (b) geographical considerations; (c) other well established characteristics in the form of constituencies and (e) the desirability of effecting minimum change.  They were clearly breached by the commission.  In other words, 40 per cent of the rules laid down were adhered to while 60 per cent of them were not strictly adhered to.  We must question why this happened.  As in the case of the builder, we should take those who strayed from the terms of reference aside and chastise them.</P>
    <P>I do not know why they did not adhere to those three rules but I will deal later with this point.  I was in the House last night for the duration of the debate on the Bill and I could not but notice the smile of satisfaction on the face of the Minister for the Environment.  He was like the cat who was after stealing the cream.  I could not but notice his jocose remarks to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy <Col N="2740" /> Seán Calleary, who was sitting behind him and who is also from County Mayo. This may not have had anything to do with the Bill we are debating and, perhaps, they were talking about something else.</P>

      <P>In his speech the Minister thanked the commission for the wonderful work they had done.  I agree that they did good work but I am not satisfied that they adhered to their terms of reference.  He said a deep debt of gratitude was owed to them for carrying out a job for which they received no recompense whatsoever.  I acknowledge that point but, perhaps, it would be easier to criticise people in future if they were paid for their work.  People are reluctant to criticise them because they were not paid for this job but I am not.  Guidelines were laid down for them but they did not adhere to them.</P>

    <P>The Minister referred to the commission's report at length but he did not tell us anything we do not know. However, towards the end of his speech he departed from his script and gave us some new information.  He said at the start of his speech that the Supreme Court had stated that the commission could reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors such as the desirability, as far as possible, to adhere to well known boundaries such as those of counties and so on.  However, we did <Col N="2741" /> not end up with that product.  Oireachtas Members have a duty to comment on that.  Members should say what they believe.  I feel free to comment on the commission's recommendations and, if necessary, I will vote against the Second Reading of the Bill to show that we are not satisfied that the commission adhered to their terms of reference.  Despite what some people may think, Deputies are quite free to come into the House to comment on the changes which have been made to their constituencies.  After all, who would have more knowledge of those constituencies than the representatives concerned?  The electorate in those areas expect their Deputies to speak on their behalf and fight the case against making those changes.</P>
    <P>I am very proud to have this opportunity to speak on behalf of the 3,868 people in Galway West whose votes are being forcibly transferred to Mayo West. Indeed I have not come across one person from that group who has expressed a view in favour of the recommendations.  I am only too glad to argue against making the changes and will vote against the Bill when the vote is taken later today.  I have been present for all of the debate so far and, unfortunately, none of the other representatives for a constituency which will be badly affected by the changes has come into the House to take part in this debate today.  If any of them is listening to this debate in other parts of the House I call on them to vote against the inclusion of Galway West in the Mayo West constituency. In particular, I call on the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, to vote against the changes on behalf of his many supporters in the Headford area.</P>
    <P>Six polling booths in Galway West are to be included in the Mayo West constituency: Headford 1, Headford 2, Claran, Cloughanover, Caherlistrane 1 and Caherlistrane 2, formerly known as Beaghamore.  The people of this area, which stretches from near Corrandulla to Belclare do not wish to be represented by the Deputies for Mayo West.  Similar changes will be made in Galway East.</P>
    <P>I have seen a document which assesses the effect of this review from Mayo to <Col N="2742" /> Meath and it is clear that paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of the terms of reference were breached.  As a result eight constituencies have been affected.  That did not represent minimum change and for this reason I will have no qualms about voting against the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Galway County Council rural area will be included in Mayo West.  I have had the privilege to represent this area at Galway County Council since 1974 and if this Bill goes through with the support of the Progressive Democrats the Minister for the Environment will have the privilege to represent the Galway County Council electoral area.  We will keep the question of whether this is to the advantage of this area under close review but it is unnatural to take the Galway rural area which extends from Moycullen in west Galway to Headford in east Galway and include it in the Mayo West constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies have suggested ways by which we could ensure the eight constituencies involved would not be affected and which would enable <Col N="2743" /> us to comply with paragraph (e) of the terms of reference &mdash; the desirability of effecting the minimum changes.  I should point out that county council areas would be considered to be natural boundaries. Instead of making changes to eight constituencies from Mayo to Meath &mdash; before the Minister stretches for his pen &mdash; Mayo, as some people have suggested, could have been turned into a five seat constituency.  Each time this was mentioned the Minister stretched for his pen. According to the 1986 Census, the population of County Mayo is 115,000 and using a tolerance, as the Minister suggested, of 7.9 it would just be possible to turn Mayo into a five seat constituency, slightly under 23,000 per Dáil seat which is just under the maximum tolerance required.</P>
      <P>If we did not want to make changes to eight constituencies we could have chosen to alter the boundaries of one constituency.  I am suggesting this as one alternative &mdash; other Deputies can propose all the alternatives they like. According to the 1986 Census Roscommon and Mayo should have eight seats. That would leave us with the alternative of having four seats in Mayo with the remainder of Mayo and Roscommon also having four seats.  This would be in line with the tolerance laid down.  Therefore there were several ways of doing the job without taking two parts of County Galway and joining them with Mayo East and Mayo West to ensure that they maintained three seats each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make one last appeal to the Minister as time is limited.  I will conclude to allow other speakers contribute to the debate as they are entitled to have their say.  It is a pity that it is not possible to have a much longer debate on this Bill but we are happy to have this opportunity to speak to it.  Let me conclude by saying that not only will I not be ashamed or afraid to vote against the Bill but will be proud to do so because of the harm it will do to County Galway.  I call on the representatives for the Galway West constituency who, unfortunately, seem to have no desire to contribute to the <Col N="2744" /> debate, to vote against the Bill.  Apart from myself, one of those is also a county councillor for the area, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy.  He seems to be determined to remain on the council as a representative for the areas of Headford, Caherlistrane, Claran and Cloughanover despite my enthusiastic attempts to get him off it.</P>

      <P>I want to use this opportunity to endorse what Deputy Stagg, who pre-empted much of what I was going to say, said last night.  I want to express my enthusiastic support for replacing the existing multi-seat system under proportional representation with a <Col N="2745" /> single seat electoral system with PR.  I honestly believe that a multi-seat constituency with PR has a detrimental impact on the performance of Dáil Éireann in the interests of the people and affect in a very detrimental way the legislative performance of Deputies.  This is wasteful and leads to tremendous duplication in all areas of the State.</P>
      <P>It is recognised by political scientists, indeed, it is generally recognised and accepted, that multi-seat constituencies with PR give rise to a very strong degree of clientelism in any political system throughout the world, and Ireland is no exception.  We term it parish pump politics. It is an extremely wasteful form of political activity which relates directly to our type of electoral system.  This is particularly evident in five-seat constituencies. When Deputies leave the Dáil at the end of the week they head to community meetings in their constituencies, at which up to five Deputies could be in attendance, all dealing with a single issue.  The Deputies return to their offices to draft letters and make representations to city and county managers and to Ministers.  The recipient will have to reply five times on the same matter.  We have a bureaucratic monstrosity which arises from our electoral system, involving an incredible amount of paperwork and duplication.  People call to Deputies with queries relating to medical cards, free travel, housing and social welfare problems.  If Deputies do not perform this constituency work they will not be re-elected, due to the competition which is part of the multi-seat system.  Not only is there cross-party competition but internal competition within parties.  That is common to all large parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed at the knee-jerk reaction of Deputy Gilmore to this proposal. It is the typical reaction of a number of people in left-wing parties who seem to think it would have a very detrimental impact on their electoral performances. That is why I was particularly delighted that it was Deputy Emmet Stagg from the Labour Party who put forward the idea last night.  When a new <Col N="2746" /> commission is appointed following the next census we in this House should give serious consideration to the idea of single-seat constituencies with the PR system built in, which would be an important safeguard for the smaller minority groupings.  I do not accept that it would necessarily harm the left-wing parties.  I agree with Deputy Stagg that it could lead to the growth of left-wing parties in the long term.  We have an increasingly volatile electorate, as has been demonstrated in recent elections.  The degree of partisan loyalty is declining steadily and there is no reason a single-seat constituency system with PR would have a detrimental impact on minority groupings or left-wing parties.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this suggestion.</P>
    <P>Because Deputies are constantly taken up with so much constituency work they do not have time to absorb the huge mass of material from Departments.  How do we research properly?  Do we have the time to research issues, policies and legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill.  As a party who welcomed the new terms of reference of the boundaries commission obviously we would accept their findings. I regret any allegations to the effect that in some way their findings were not fair. Deputy McCormack built up quite a case as to why politicians should be divorced from any revision of constituencies.  I fully support that sentiment.  In truly representative democracies all adults, with the exception of certain criminals, are entitled to vote and should be afforded that opportunity.  It is within the context of electoral democracy I assess the merits or otherwise of this Bill dealing solely with the matter of boundaries revision.</P>
      <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister informed us that there must be such revisions undertaken whenever a completed census shows substantial changes in population distribution. Successive Governments have failed to respond to the needs of our people currently disenfranchised who are outside the democratic system.  For example, I would ask the Minister to examine the voting rights of the disabled within our society.  Are we doing sufficient to ensure that these citizens are afforded an opportunity to participate fully in our electoral process?  I do not think we are.</P>
      <P>I might refer now to part of our submission to the boundaries commission <i>vis-á-vis</i> emigrants.  It is my belief that all Irish people, including those outside the country, should be allowed participate in the democratic governing of this country. Therefore, it follows that voting rights should be returned to Irish citizens over 18 years of age who lost their right to vote by not being resident here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have decided to take a fresh, positive approach in regard to our emigrants.  In the new year we propose introducing a voting rights Bill for Irish emigrants the provisions of which would enable them to vote in future elections. <Col N="2750" /> This would bring us into line with the majority of our EC partners who have, quite correctly, afforded their emigrants voting rights in some or all of their national elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, and it is important that that be the case.  Basically, what I am saying is that the provisions of this Bill have failed to address the voting needs of our emigrants.  Within the EC alone I might add that France, Portugal, Germany, Holland and Spain have afforded their citizens that opportunity.  It would be my hope that in electioneering in the future we would be going to places like Manchester, London, New York or wherever seeking votes from our emigrants there.  It would be my hope that we could look positively at the position of people who have been discriminated against, who have not been afforded the opportunity of participating fully in our electoral process to date.</P>
      <P>In supporting this Bill it would be the hope of my party that the Minister would examine the legitimate points raised in regard to citizens' access to the electoral system and that a new Bill will be introduced, thereby affording all Irish people the opportunity of fulfilling a meaningful role in our society.</P>
      <P>I compliment the members of the commission on their work.</P>

      <P>Like other Members, I support electoral reform. However, within the terms of this Bill we are dealing with the recommendations of the boundaries commission and their terms of reference with which I agree. I support Deputy Gilmore's suggestion yesterday that there should be an appeals system built-in and that the whole exercise should be undertaken on a statutory basis.  I totally agree with that idea and contend that the matter of a built-in <Col N="2751" /> appeals system should be carefully examined.</P>
      <P>I simply want to make the point that the terms of reference of this latest boundaries commission were not adhered to, as many speakers have said.  Certainly, from the point of view of the Dublin area, the maintenance of five-seater constituencies, which the terms of reference had suggested should apply to larger urban areas, were not adhered to in that eight of the five-seaters are rural and six are urban, defeating that argument completely.  Also eight of the four-seaters are urban and seven are rural. Dublin loses one seat which is absolutely outrageous also.</P>
      <P>I want to make the point clearly that three new towns have been built up in the west of Dublin.  Tallaght has remained intact; Clondalkin had been split already by the previous boundaries commission recommendations.  Now the findings of this latest commission split up the new town of Blanchardstown, at present building its town centre, with large chunks of its 10,000 population going into Dublin North constituency.</P>
      <P>The worst feature of all is the splitting of the town of Ballyfermot.  The issue here is that many people, even within the media, do not see Ballyfermot as a town. It is a distinct town with clearly outlined borders, a town in its own right with a town centre comprised of shops and so on.  Under the terms of any boundaries commission no other town in the country has been split.  Whatever about the matter of natural boundaries, the splitting of the town of Ballyfermot is absolutely outrageous.</P>

      <P>It is customary at the conclusion of a Second Stage debate to thank the House for the manner in which it received the Bill and compliment Deputies on the value of their contributions.  I do so on this occasion with all sincerity.  We have had some fine speeches, thought-provoking and constructive in many ways. Nobody will mind if I single out Deputy Stagg's contribution in particular.  He <Col N="2752" /> addressed the difficult matter of constituency revision in a balanced, constructive manner.  Other Members had constructive comments to make as well.</P>
      <P>What can we make of the contribution of, say, Deputy Lee, the Fine Gael Member for Dublin Central?  He said the commission ignored their terms of reference, that the members of the commission allowed themselves be swayed by nefarious and sinister influences, swayed to such an extent that they deviated from their principles and disregarded their terms of reference.</P>

      <P>It should be remembered that Deputy Lee was speaking of the honourable President of the High Court, the highly respected former Secretary of the Department of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank, the now former Secretary of my Department and the former and present chief officer of this House.  He called into the question the honour and integrity of those distinguished public officials, each of whom has given long, valuable and honourable service to this country.  I raise the question of Deputy Lee's contribution more in sorrow than in anger.  I know he is a new Deputy, a person relatively inexperienced in public life.  I realise he has much to learn in relation to procedures and the behaviour and standards of debate appropriate to this National Parliament. I would urge him earnestly and sincerely to learn from the more experienced Members of this House, to seek to benefit from their example, indeed to learn from the very many fine parliamentarians his party produced in the past.  With Deputy Lee, and those who sought to make some innuendo in a somewhat more subtle manner, very much to my regret I must include the Fine Gael spokesman on the Environment, Deputy Shatter, who does not have the excuse of inexperience and who, in addition, is a lawyer of some attainment.

If any Deputy opposite considers there is any basis for making such a charge, I ask him or her to do the honourable thing and make the charge outside the privilege of this House.  In this way the members of the commission, and the officials concerned, will be able to have recourse to the remedy available to every private citizen to have his good name defended and vindicated.  To make such an allegation under the privilege of this House is to bring character assassination to a new depth and to give a whole new meaning to &ldquo;gurrierism&rdquo;.

      <P>I reiterate that the allegations made by several Deputies opposite are groundless and I invite them, individually or collectively, to take an early opportuntity to express themselves in similar language outside the House and then those who have been seriously maligned will get the opportunity available to them to settle matters.</P>
      <P>While on the matter, I wish to put on record clearly and finally that at no time did I seek, directly or indirectly, personally or through any other person, to influence the work of the commission. Subject only to the constitutional requirements and terms of reference, the commission were entirely independent and no attempt whatsoever was made by me, or by any person acting on my behalf or on behalf of the Government, to influence their deliberations.</P>
      <P>I do not see it as part of my remit to defend the individual constituencies defined in the Schedule to the Bill.  The basis on which I am recommending the Bill to the House is that it proposes to implement in full the recommendations of an independent commission charged with the drawing up of a scheme on constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of entrusting the job of drawing up constituencies to an independent commission was established by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 and I understand this principle has since been accepted by all parties in this House.  I understand also that the terms of reference given to the commission were fully acceptable to all parties.  What I am presenting to the House is a scheme of constituencies which is the product of an agreed process operating in accordance with the acceptable rules and with acceptable and honourable personnel.  Why the commission recommended this layout of constituencies rather than any other possible arrangement is simply a matter for the commission.  I have no information <Col N="2755" /> over and above that contained in the commission's report.  I do not see it as part of my function to defend any individual constituency.  However, I feel I must comment on the hypocrisy of some of the observations that have been made here.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Longford-Roscommon has been criticised on the grounds that it straddles the River Shannon. It may have escaped the notice of the Deputies concerned that no fewer than four constituencies straddle the Shannon.  The constituency has been criticised on the grounds that it breaches the boundary of the European constituency and of the planning region.  I remind Deputies that the terms of reference contained no prohibition and no guidance whatsoever on this point.  The proposed constituency of Dublin Central has been criticised on the grounds of size, taking that constituency as an example.  I can only say that from the Point Depot on the eastern extremity of the constituency to Kylemore Road on the west is a distance of about six miles.</P>
    <P>There have been quite a number of references to my own constituency of Mayo West.  As Deputy McCormack would know, my constituency at present runs from the bridge of Shrule to the pier at Blacksod, and Deputy McCormack knows how many miles that is.  It is not far off the distance driving from Dublin city to Galway city, yet Deputies have no difficulty in suggesting that the constituency should be doubled in size to take in all of the third largest county in the country.  They are, apparently, prepared to accept with unanimity the fact that this would also involve a departure from the 8 per cent of the national average, despite the statement by the 1988 commission that a departure of 8 per cent or over from the national average would be unacceptable and, in all probability, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I recommend to some Deputies that more detail is printed in the report of the 1980 commission.  I respectfully suggest to Deputies that they might have a casual glance at chapter 7 of that report where <Col N="2756" /> set down in clear detail by the commision are the reasons for their decision and recommendation in regard to Mayo at that time.  That has not been altered. There is something to be learned from a quick perusal of that report.  I can only conclude that a different set of principles, and different criteria of measurement, apply once one crosses the Liffey.  I regret that.</P>
    <P>There was a question about the 1988 commission.  I might make a few comments to draw aside some of the misrepresentations, innuendo and trivialities with which certain people have tried to invest it.  The terms of reference given to the first Dáil constituency commission, who were appointed in 1979, included a provision regarding the retention of the traditional pattern of three seat, four seat and five seat constituencies.  In retrospect it is difficult to see what meaning could be assigned to this provision.  In fact, there never was a traditional pattern of three, four and five seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>The one consistent feature in all previous provisions was the continuing shift away from the larger constituencies towards smaller ones.  Thus in 1935, eight and nine seat constituencies disappeared and in 1947 the seven seaters were phased out.  Prior to 1980 the highest ever number of five seaters was nine.  By 1969 the number had been reduced to two and in the same period the number of three seat constituencies had increased from six to 26.  The same general tendency was continued in the revision prepared by a Labour Party Minister in 1974 and the number of three seaters remained at 26. The number of five seaters was increased to six with a corresponding reduction in the number of four seaters.  Interesting enough, not a single five seat constituency was created in the Dublin area, and those five seaters created consisted generally of rural counties such as Carlow-Kilkenny, Cavan-Monaghan, Laois-Offaly and Donegal.</P>
    <P>In this connection it must be stressed that the responsibility for revising constituencies is placed by the Constitution on the Oireachtas and it cannot divest itself of this responsibility.  Proposals for <Col N="2757" /> revision are introduced as Government Bills, and I can find no evidence that any Government or the Oireachtas at any time took a positive decision to reverse the traditional tendency towards smaller constituencies.  It would appear that there had been broad acceptance of this tendency and it was certainly welcomed by individual Deputies, no matter what their party.</P>
    <P>Finally, when the question of revising the constituencies following the 1986 census arose, this matter had to be addressed and firm guidelines in one direction or another given to any future commission. When the outgoing Government, in January 1987, purported to set up a commission they obviously recognised the problem in this regard and, in the proposed terms of reference, they dropped the reference to the traditional pattern and simply required the proposed commission to recommend three, four and five seat constituencies. While this wording was a definite improvement it still left a large area of uncertainty so far as the commission might be concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2758" /> Several Deputies referred to the need for an amendment of certain aspects of electoral law, and I was pleased to hear that.  I have already informed the House that I am preparing a comprehensive general election Bill which I hope to be in a position to bring in soon.  While I am not promising that all the matters mentioned by Deputies in the course of the debate will be dealt with in the Bill, or that the Bill will provide exactly what individual Deputies might wish, it will be comprehensive and it will give the House an opportunity to have an objective and thorough review of all aspects of general electoral law, and it will in fact deal with many of the matters raised here.</P>
    <P>I thank those Deputies who spoke in such a constructive way on matters that need to be addressed, and they will be addressed.  Other Deputies made comments, I note, and they have already appeared in print even though they did not speak here at all, and I will be taking note of how that happens, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 3 dealing with constituencies, I would like to make one or two very brief comments as the matter was given some airing during the course of Second Stage debate as to how constituencies should be devised.  A number of speakers including Deputy Stagg, followed by a number of speakers from the Fianna Fáil side, expressed a preference for single seat constituencies.  Deputy Stagg may yet be found to have scored the most famous own goal politically of 1990 by suggesting the establishment of single seat constituencies.  If he for a moment thinks that the establishment of single seat constituencies is going to solve the problem of the scourge of clientelist politics, what does he think is going to happen in a small single seat constituency which, given the number of seats that we have in the House at the moment, would be smaller than most local electoral areas?  We will have precisely the same kind of clientelist politics that he has already criticised, except in this case the competition will not necessarily be with fellow Members of this House but perhaps with aspiring Members of this House <Col N="2761" /> serving on local authorities or politically active in one way or another.  Anybody who has read Denis Healy's autobiography &mdash; he has served for many years in a single seat constituency in Britain with a safe majority &mdash; can see that he shows clearly the extent to which, even in that political culture, service of constituents has been a very prominent part of political life.</P>

      <P>Given the welcome for Deputy Stagg's comments on the Fianna Fáil side of the House where, quite clearly, there is a desire to see how one can get over 50 per cent of the seats with 44 per cent of the vote, there is a necessity for the Labour Party to state whether Deputy Stagg was speaking on his own behalf or expressing the point of view of his party when he spoke yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I did not get an opportunity to deal with the issue of multi-seats and I do not want to transgress in this regard.  However, we have an electoral system &mdash; this is specifically relevant to section 3 &mdash; which has shown a distinct preference for a very large number of very large constituencies, which has a very profound effect on political life.  Clientelism is directly related to the number of seats in multi-seat constituencies. There is a good body of academic work and I humbly suggest that my own work in this area shows there is a distinct correlation between the most objectionable aspects of Irish politics. Clearly, this is not the Bill in which to do this, although clearly I support it because <Col N="2762" /> it is the product of an independent commission.</P>
      <P>When we examine our electoral system in the form of a general election Bill we should have some time to reflect maturely on this matter because Irish politics are scourged by clientelism and the same applies to public administration.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected.  My most profound apologies.  There will be another day to return to that point.  In regard to the specific constituencies while, like the other Deputies in Wicklow, I am delighted to welcome additional constituents from Kildare, I have doubts as to how a commission could, so extraordinarily, reverse the thinking of the previous commission.  However, we must accept what the commission said in this regard.  Like the other three Deputies in Wicklow, I will welcome representing people from Kildare.  I accept that they have been excellently represented to date by Deputies McCreevy and Power and I guarantee to continue that very good practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about that part of section 3 (2) which states that &ldquo;if any doubt arises as to the constituency in which any townland or part thereof, any road or street or part thereof, or any part of a ward, is included, the doubt shall, subject to section 1 (2) (b) of this Act, be determined by the Minister.&rdquo;  The Minister in question is the Minister for the Environment and, while innuendoes were made in relation to him, I accept his reply in regard to the section. I should not like the Minister to be criticised because he has to determine a townland. I know that the six polling booths in the areas I mentioned are now gone <Col N="2763" /> from west Galway to the Minister's own constituency.  I wish them the very best of luck and I know that he already well represents them.  I wish to assure the people in those areas that I will continue to represent them to the best of my ability at Galway County Council level.  They will get the same representation from me as they got over the last 14 years, even though they are now in west Mayo.</P>
      <P>It is very tricky along the Corrib where an island could be in Connemara or on the Headford side of the river.  In that case the Minister would have to determine to which constituency those places would belong.  The Minister went out of his way, when replying to Second Stage, to indicate that he would not have any bearing on the end result.  I accept his word in that regard.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the constituency boundaries in the Schedule as I did not have much opportunity to comment on the matter on Second Stage.  I specifically want to comment on the effects in Dublin West, particularly on the town of Ballyfermot.  A line is drawn right through the middle of Kylemore Road which separates the integrated town of Ballyfermot which is totally cut off from the remainder by the railway on one side and the division between it and Palmerstown on the other.  Not only is it cut in two, the parish is also cut in two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking at areas, the boundaries commission understand even a large town in a rural area, how it is integrated and that it is a community.  They understand parishes and wards in those areas but, in a city in an urban area, these things mean nothing.  Ballyfermot is cut in two, the church is on one side and the schools are in another constituency.  The whole effect will, in time, be separate development in both areas of the same community.  For this reason, I was very interested in Deputy Gilmore's suggestion for an appeals system where one could appeal to the commission on a particular issue <Col N="2764" /> regarding a relatively small area, the effect it has and to see if an alternative boundary could be made.  I know that you can make a submission to the commission beforehand but you have no idea if it will be taken into account.  There should be room for an appeal with an agreed solution. When one divides a parish, or a ward, a ward will be represented by councillors and in some cases the councillor will be the TD for the whole constituency of Dublin West and he will represent one part of Ballyfermot in the City Council and the remainder in the Dáil.  It is bad to divide communities.  It is resented in the Ballyfermot area that Ballyfermot is not seen as one community but that they can be divided up in whatever way the commission wish.</P>
    <P>There is not any point in a few people voting against this Bill.  I would not vote against it because I am in favour of the idea of the independent commission.  If we voted this Bill down we would be leaving it back to the Government and Ministers to make decisions.  The preservation of the independence of the commission is vitally important but we should have a system whereby one can appeal decisions of the commission because the commission cannot be expected to understand every community and the effect of their decisions on them.  I appeal particularly for the Ballyfermot area.</P>
    <P>This problem also arises with the growing new town of Blanchardstown.  The town centre there has just been constructed and it will have a great effect on the integration of the community there. The Ladyswell area had already been cut off and now another 10,000 people will be cut off from the Castleknock and Corduff areas, from Blanchardstown.  Those areas will be represented by Deputies with different considerations.  Tallaght has remained intact but the communities of both Clondalkin and Blanchardstown have been split.  The fact that Tallaght has not been split up and is represented by the same Deputies is seen by the people as very important for the development of the whole area.  In the other areas the Deputies may not even meet together as Deputies from the same constituency <Col N="2765" /> frequently do to discuss problems.  I do not agree with the idea of splitting Ballyfermot and Blanchardstown.  It is something that would not happen in the longer established towns around the country. Natural geographic boundaries might have been breached but the people in towns would not have been split in other constituencies.</P>

      <P>Deputies will understand that agreement has been reached that we conclude Committee Stage by 1 o'clock.  Accordingly, I would ask Deputies when making their contributions to note that we are only now at section 3, and many people are indicating that they wish to come in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome to an extent the decision to keep Mayo as two three-seat constituencies.  I would not be honest if I did not acknowledge that.  We on this side of the House do not in any way impugn the independence or integrity of the commission.  That has been made perfectly clear by Deputy Shatter.  Any implication, innuendo or attempt to draw us down that road is an attempt to construe in a false fashion anything we may have said on this side of the House.  We absolutely accept the independence and integrity of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we question is the adherence, in some cases, of the members of the commission in their final report to the recommendation in respect of the breach of county boundaries.  There have been clear examples of that breach specified. While I naturally welcome the retention of two three-seat constituencies in Mayo, it is nonetheless a camouflage for the true situation in Mayo.  In the forties and fifties Mayo had eight seats.  Up to 1969 Mayo had seven seats and from 1969 to now Mayo has six seats.  To now have two three-seat constituencies in Mayo and call them Mayo East and Mayo West is a misnomer.  Looking at the population structure, Mayo is literally dying on its feet.  That is what this report acknowledges. The population is not there to sustain two three-seat constituencies. The title is a misnomer and therefore <Col N="2766" /> on the Schedule, I will be moving an amendment and Deputy Kenny in conjunction with me will be moving a second amendment in relation to the titles for Mayo East and Mayo West.  A proposed reduction in seats for Mayo or rural constituencies fails to recognise the huge geographical area that rural Deputies have to service.  If it were constitutionally possible this should be looked at, although we would not advocate going back to the situation of rotten boroughs. Certainly rural TDs covering a huge geographical spread have an enormous task serving our constituents.  That is something not generally recognised within the ambit of what I would regard as &ldquo;Pale&rdquo; politicians.  One of our major problems is that there is early exodus of people in terms of emigration.  In this city we have a huge number of Mayo and Galway emigrés, people who come here to third level colleges or to work.  Often, these people are not part of the social ambience in Dublin.  They do not empathise with it and they often have little interest in participating in the political process.  They are registered voters in Mayo East and Mayo West and in Galway East and Galway West.  The Minister should seriously look at the possibility of Sunday voting to enable these people to participate in the political process.</P>
    <P>I will be moving amendments with regard to the title and definitions of the two constituencies when we come to that section.  It was a great pity and, indeed, was onesided on his part that while he referred to Deputies by name on this side of the House, he did not refer by name to his own colleague, Deputy John Stafford, who last night used the term that the constituency commission had been &ldquo;got at&rdquo;.  That was the most pointed reference made by any Deputy in this House, that the Minister had some influence over the deliberations of the commission.  I am not making any such allegation but I find it strange that the Minister could single out Deputies on this side of the House while he was not able to deal with the most specific allegation made in that direction by his own colleague.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the time allocated <Col N="2767" /> for discussion of this Bill has been so limited I was one of those people who waited here to contribute on Second Stage.  It is regrettable to find in the newspapers this morning a contribution attributed to a certain Deputy though that contribution was not delivered in this House.  Perhaps it resulted from the laziness of the press.</P>

      <P>It is strange that a speech should appear in the public press, printed and presented to the readers of the newspaper concerned as a contribution which was made here, when, in fact, that was not the case.  I compliment the Minister for referring to that but I would have liked if he referred to the Deputy in question because his reference was a broad sweeping reference as if other people, including people on this side of the House, made such references, and had had their references published but had not in fact, delivered them on the Floor of the House.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 3 (2) can the Minister explain what liberty subsection (2) gives him?  As stated by Deputy Mac Giolla, apart from urban areas the same parallel occurs in rural areas, for example, Luimnagh and Corrandulla &mdash; because they voted in Cloughanover &mdash; are now in Mayo West.  Does subsection (2) give the Minister liberty in that regard in relation to townlands?  Now that Second Stage is passed and we have a <i>fait accomplit</i>&mdash; I will deal only with my own end of County Galway, west Galway and east Galway which has been transferred into Mayo West and Mayo East &mdash; some recognition should be given in the titles of those constituencies.  As Deputy Higgins said there is no point in calling them Mayo West and Mayo East. A reminder that part of Galway is making up those constituencies should be included in the title.  Whatever proposal <Col N="2768" /> is made in regard to what they are to be known as, there should be a constant reminder of the fact that Galway is making up a portion of those constituencies. As the Minister for Finance said on a famous occasion this is only a temporary little arrangement and some day these areas can come back to their rightful place in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Connor, I too, was astonished, as someone who had sat in here from the beginning of this debate until the end, to read what was presented as a contribution from a Progressive Democrats representative whose party were not represented here at any level during the debate.  The Progressive Democrats were represented for a brief period this morning by one of their Deputies and by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, when he voted Headford into Mayo.  I regret that was the only time the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, was present. I know the people of Headford will not be pleased with that.  I would support the idea of including a reference to Galway now that the bad work has been done.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to them briefly.  No matter what report was brought out by the independent commission, and one has to accept their independence, we would always find fault with it.  It is interesting to note, given the terms of reference of the committee, that there are still four double counties, as it were, which conform with that criteria: Carlow-Kilkenny, Laoighis-Offaly, Cavan-Monaghan and Sligo-Leitrim. That is an important factor to be borne in mind.  One could make an arrangement in regard to the constituencies being discussed that might be more appropriate but then one can never be right in all these issues.  As Tip O'Neill said on one <Col N="2769" /> occasion &ldquo;All politics is local&rdquo;.  I formally welcome the people of Galway into the additional areas of County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that one bears in mind the traditional belief and pride people have in their own areas. By means of this amendment we will be asking the Minister, in the Schedule, to give recognition in their new homeland to the people who have traditionally been represented in a part of Galway by Galway representatives.  I guarantee them they will get a level of representation that is as good, if not better, from their Mayo representatives.  It is important to bear in mind, having regard to the tradition of the province of Connacht and the way people view rivalries within counties, that the people living in the section of County Galway to be added to Mayo East, that is the area including Addergoole, Belclare, Doonbally, Foxhall, Kilbennan, Killeen, Kilshanvy and Milltown, in the former rural district of Tuam, deserve to have their section of the new constituency recognised for what it is and that the new constituency should be called Mayo East-Galway North East. Similarly, people living in the townlands to be added to Mayo West &mdash; Ballinduff, Beagmore, Donaghpatrick, Headford, Kilcoola, Killeany, Killursa in the former rural district of Tuam deserve to have their area recognised.  Therefore that should be called Mayo West-Galway North West.  I support Deputy Higgins' sentiments in that regard.  I know the Minister for the Environment, Mr. Flynn, a kind and considerate gentleman, in this regard, will give due recognition to his new Galway constituents and recognise them for what they are.</P>

That, of course, depends on how long this Government lasts so it may well be a temporary arrangement.  I would like to be in a position to move on the schedule that the new constituencies be called Mayo East-Galway North East, Mayo West-Galway North West.  In view of the traditions, beliefs and pride that these people have in their townlands and villages they deserve to be recognised.</P>

      <P>There is one small matter I would like to refer to and that was remarks made by the Minister when replying to Second Stage in which he alleged that, in the course of my contribution, I had claimed that identifiable officers of his Department had performed their duties in an improper way.  I re-read my contribution and I cannot see how he could have come to that conclusion.  If that doubt exists I would like to clarify that under no circumstances would I claim or did I claim or did I intend to claim that an officer of his Department acted in an improper way.  I would like to clarify that point since he seems to imply that I was using the privilege of the House to make those allegations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I strongly support the approach taken by my two colleagues from County Mayo, Deputies Enda Kenny and Jim Higgins, who have suggested, in the context of section 3 and the Schedule, that the two new three-seat constituencies should be called Mayo East-Galway North-East and Mayo West-Galway North-West. The people from Galway who will be transferred into what is a reconstituted constituency are entitled to retain their sense of political identity.  The incongruities of one or two of the commission's recommendations we are now implementing have been dealt with at some length.  I do not intend to deal with them any further other than to say that people who live in Galway are entitled when <Col N="2771" /> voting to elect members to a constituency which recognises their local identity.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister in the spirit of co-operation which exists across the House to seriously consider accepting this amendment.  It will not affect the boundaries as listed by the commission.  We said very firmly that we would not table any amendments in that regard.  The amendment deals with the title of the constituency and no more.  I believe the amendments proposed by my two colleagues would be welcomed by the people in those constituencies, in particular, by those people living in the areas in Galway who are being transferred to Mayo.</P>
      <P>Finally, I do not know whether the reportage of the non-speech of Deputy Quill should be greeted with a sense of amazement, amusement or outrage.  As I remarked a few minutes ago, I suppose the non-speech, as reported today, at least proves that the quill is mightier than the word in the context of this debate.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy who will be affected by this revision, I should first like to acknowledge the concept of an independent commission.  All Members agree regardless of which political party are in power there is a certain amount of odium associated with any decisions in which a Minister is involved.  I should like to acknowledge fully the independence of the commission.</P>
      <P>It would appear that with the enactment of the Bill I will be bidding adieu to some of my very good supporters and friends in places like Rathmore, Kilcullen, Castledermot and elsewhere.  The commission had difficulty with their terms of reference because of the contradiction in them.  It was very difficult for them to observe the tradition of four or five seat constituencies while at the same time have regard to natural county boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2772" /> I was somewhat amazed at the Minister's self-righteous indignation and the scurrilous remarks he made about Members on this side of the House for allegedly impugning officials and others. I would like to point out that this is the second report issued by the commission in the past few years.  The 1988 report did not come before the House as it was rejected by a person or persons unknown. While I accept the independence of the commission in carrying out their work Members also have a right to comment on their findings.  If it was considered that the commission's previous report was not fit to see the light of day for some reason I do not understand for one moment why we should be precluded from commenting on the present report.  Having said that, I acknowledge the rights of any commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister and a number of other speakers &mdash; I fully agree with Deputy Gilmore's remarks in this regard &mdash; referred to the fact that politicians love to seek Utopia once they are in office. Obviously, Utopia for politicians would be a single seat constituency with a non-transferrable vote and, hopefully, a revolving and self-perpetuating seat.  For some reason or other the concept of a single seat constituency is only proposed by politicians when they are in office; when they are seeking election to this House very few of them put forward the proposal of a single seat constituency with or without a transferrable vote.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that we on this side of the House would be pleased to fully support the future electoral reforms to which he referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will have the opportunity to deal with many more sections of the Bill as the time is nearly up.  I had hoped the Minister would avail of this opportunity to amend the 1923 Act which debars presiding officers and polling clerks from casting votes in elections because they are not in their own polling stations.  During the recent Presidential election between 8,000 and 10,000 people were unable to vote because they were not in their own <Col N="2773" /> polling stations.  The Minister could have availed of the opportunity to correct that anomaly in this Bill.  Perhaps he can amend it when the Bill is being debated in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Durkan that the areas he is losing from County Kildare will be looked after with the same efficiency as they have been in the past for as long as they remain in Wicklow.</P>

I welcome the retention of 14 five seat constituencies.  I want to pay tribute to the members of the commission who did a fairly good job in all the circumstances. It is most unfortunate that only some of their decisions will be highlighted to the exclusion of the good elements in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot make any reference to any individual constituency. That was a matter for the commission and they dealt with it in the way they saw fit.  The amendment put forward by my colleague, Deputy Kenny, and by Deputy Higgins, proposed that we change the name of the constituency of Mayo East to Mayo East &mdash; Galway North-East and the name of the constituency of Mayo West to Mayo West &mdash; Galway North-West.  It has been the <Col N="2776" /> tradition to name constituencies by referring to the county or part of the county in which they are located.  Where a small part of one county is grouped with a neighbouring county the name of the county is normally used when naming the constituency.  For example, the existing constituency of Meath consists of the county of Meath with a part of Westmeath. Similarly, the constituency of Tipperary South contains part of Waterford county while the constituency of Roscommon consists of the county of Roscommon with part of north-east Galway.  That is the way the matter has been treated over the years.</P>
      <P>The constituency commission in recommending these constituencies saw fit to recommend the names of the constituencies as used in the Schedule to the Bill.  There is no change in the traditional pattern.  For this reason I ask the Deputies to agree that we carry on in the same fashion.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I wish to join with my colleagues in stating that we would welcome the people from Galway and hope we will be able to give them a service as good as that being given by the existing Deputies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2777" />&ldquo;(c) it is taken in the presence of a solicitor who has been requested to attend by the detainee and there has been no unreasonable delay by the solicitor in responding to the request to attend.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree that amendment No. 2, as it deals with the same issue, should be taken with amendment No. 1.  I do not propose to delay unduly on this amendment or go back over the arguments made in favour of each of these amendments in any depth as they were ventilated in the House on Committee Stage which took place ten days or so ago.  The reason I have resubmitted amendment No. 1 is that I wish to see if the Minister has reflected on it in any way.  I should say it has been slightly altered since Committee Stage.  I have introduced the proviso that the attendance of a solicitor at the taking of a sample should not be a prerequisite if there has been any unreasonable delay on his part in attending.  That was missing from the amendment on Committee Stage but I have included it now.  I hope as a result it will be more acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential and deals with the rights of a detained person and the circumstances in which a sample may be taken.  The proposition of independent professional observation on behalf of the detained person is very useful from the point of view of protecting the rights of the suspect, who is an innocent person, in the police station, on the one hand and on the other preventing unnecessary, unfounded and unwarranted complaints being made by a detainee in any subsequent or other proceedings and ensuring that at the end of the day these samples are taken in such a way that they are above reproach and criticism or untainted by unnecessary and unwarranted argument, debate and controversy.  I hope with this proviso the amendment will be acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Deputy will be aware from what I said in response to a <Col N="2778" /> number of similar amendments on Committee Stage that I cannot accept these amendments.  I recognise that by including the words &ldquo;there has been no unreasonable delay by the solicitor&rdquo; in amendment No. 1 the Deputy has sought to overcome certain problems which were highlighted during the course of Committee Stage.  However, this does not alter the fact that what the Deputy is seeking is that there should in effect be a requirement in the Bill that a sample should not be taken except in the presence of a solicitor.  I cannot agree to this.  In the first place, I do not see what purpose would be served by having a solicitor present at the taking of a sample. The Bill provides that an intimate or intrusive sample may be taken only with the written consent of the suspect and then by a registered medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>In support of his Committee Stage amendment, the Deputy referred to identity parades.  I want to make it clear that what we are dealing with here in this Bill, the taking of bodily samples from suspects for forensic testing, is not the same as questioning or identity parades where undue pressure might be put on a suspect or where incorrect procedures might be employed, unwittingly or otherwise. We are talking about a sample being removed from a person's body and sent to a reputable laboratory for objective scientific testing.  I see no need whatsoever to provide that a solicitor be present for this purpose.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, I see no objection to a solicitor being present at the taking of a sample if he happens to be at the station but what I am not prepared to accept, however, is any requirement or suggestion that a solicitor ought to be present.  Again, I must stress that the general rules laid down by the courts in accordance with the Constitution and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, as to the rights of detained persons to have access and to consult their solicitors will not be affected by the legislation. For the reasons I have given I am opposed to these amendments.</P>

I understand the amendment would make this a precondition and give the individual the right to demand that a legal adviser be present. The Minister has stated, however, that there will be no objection to a legal adviser being present at the Garda station. That is sufficient. It is not a matter that should be unduly pressed.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not accepted the arguments I have advanced.  Attendance would work in the interests of everyone and would enhance the reputation and status of these examinations and tests. I have made my case and I have not convinced the Minister.  He has stated that in the event of the solicitor coincidentally being present for the purposes of professional advice there would be no objection.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that some problems might arise, suggesting that a medical practitioner might not be happy to have a solicitor present if tests of an intimate nature were to be made.  Such concerns might lead to misunderstanding and confusion among the Garda.  Will that point of no objection in the event of coincidental attendance at the station be included in regulations so that there will not be any ambiguity or difficulty in that limited area?  If a person asks that a solicitor be there, it should be clearly set down that there is no objection.</P>

      <P>In the course of Committee Stage I invited Deputies who participated in the debate to meet Dr. Donovan, the director of the Forensic Science Laboratory, to discuss their concerns and to visit the laboratory to see at first hand how it operates and to observe the very high standards which apply in relation to the handling and testing of samples.  I regret that it was not possible to arrange for that in advance of Report Stage and I apologise to Deputies.  I understand that Deputy Flanagan has visited the laboratory and spoken to Dr. Donovan.</P>
      <P>I note that these amendments are in similar terms to those considered on Committee Stage.  I indicated then that I could not accept the amendments. Having given the matter very careful consideration in the light of advice from the Forensic Science Laboratory, I have been confirmed in my view that what the Deputies propose is unacceptable.  I recognise that I offered Deputies an opportunity to discuss with the director of the Forensic Science Laboratory the technical and practical problems to which these amendments would give rise.  If Deputies wish, I am still prepared to arrange for a joint meeting with the director at which these matters can be discussed. I am prepared to give Deputies an undertaking that if in the course of such discussion any workable procedures emerge which would go some way to satisfying their concerns I will provide for them in the regulations to be made under section 5.</P>

      <P>Having attended the <Col N="2781" /> Whips' meetings I appreciated that the Minister had indicated a firm agreement that we would visit the laboratory but I agreed to the Report and Final Stages being taken today, realising that such a visit was not practicable in the circumstances. It is no criticism of the Minister that we are back here so soon without having visited the laboratory.  It is important to use the time available to have the Bill passed.  I welcome the undertaking to look at this matter again in the light of a visit to the laboratory in the New Year.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between amendment No. 3 and the amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  The Minister and others pointed out on Committee Stage that it might not always be practicable to interfere with, dissect, copy or apportion a sample for the purposes of independent examination.  I have included in this amendment the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;. A solicitor or a detainee would be entitled to take possession of a sample where practicable and without interfering with the investigation by the Garda.  If the case were made that it was impossible or impracticable to divide, apportion or copy a sample, it would not be required. If the Garda maintained that dividing or dissecting the sample or copying it might interfere with their investigation, that would be the overriding concern.  The original amendment has been substantially qualified and I believe the Minister should consider it in the light of the additions.</P>

      <P>We felt on Committee Stage that the Bill would be somewhat flawed if it did not include provision to allow an alleged offender to participate in an independent examination by being able to remove from the Garda station a portion of the sample taken for inspection. I hope I did not step out of line by proceeding to discuss the matter with Dr. Donovan and availing of an opportunity to attend at the forensic laboratory.</P>

      <P>Having done so, I <Col N="2782" /> intend to withdraw amendment No. 4.  I am satisfied that every opportunity will be given by the Forensic Science Laboratory to a person whose sample has been taken to engage in discussion which would allow that individual, or an expert for the defence, to proceed to the laboratory and engage in the appropriate type of scientific research.  The forensic science laboratory never was and never will be merely a tool of the prosecution. It is important to stress that facilities are available to anybody who may have a sample there.  Ideally the legislation might have built into it an amendment of the type envisaged here but there are practical difficulties.  Having discussed the matter and having seen the operation in the laboratory, I fully accept the Minister's comments on Committee Stage that there would be practical difficulties, having regard to the type of sample and the difficulties involved in dividing a very small but significant sample which could enable a prosecution to be levelled.  It is unfortunate that it is unworkable.  I am satisfied that it is unworkable and I will be withdrawing my amendment No. 4.</P>

      <P>It would appear that all parties share the same concern about this procedure.  It is related to past experience in regard to the taking of blood or urine samples in respect of charges of drunk-driving. It is well known that, due to human error at times &mdash; not in any way the fault of the Garda &mdash; such samples can become mislaid or crossed.  In my constituency I learned of two people who, so to speak, were allocated the wrong bottle, the net result of which was that the mistake was only discovered when the case went to court.  Fortunately, both cases were dismissed.  But, in these cases, there could be more serious crime involved.  In drawing up the regulations under this section the Minister might consider that, whenever a sample is taken, it be contained in some type of bottle or carton to be transported to the State Forensic Laboratory for analysis.  What I am advocating is that there be provision whereby an accused person be allowed <Col N="2783" /> append his or her signature to the relevant carton or package containing the sample.  This would mean an accused person could be absolutely satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the sample taken was theirs and could not become confused with anybody else's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to examine that last suggestion in the context of the preparation of the relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy McCartan may I say that his amendment containing the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; is just not feasible.  Neither a garda nor doctor taking a sample from a suspect would have the necessary knowledge or expertise to decide whether, in any particular case, it would be practicable to divide that sample and give a portion to the suspect.  We are talking about samples containing traces of materials which may not be visible to the naked eye.  A trained forensic scientist only would be in a position to judge what might be practicable in any given case.  I am pleased that the arguments I advanced, when examined by Deputy Flanagan in the surroundings of the State Forensic Laboratory have been understood.  I am pleased he understands the difficulties and concerns I outlined on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have visited many forensic laboratories and while I have not yet visited our State laboratory, that does not mean I accept wholeheartedly the assurances or arguments being put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point of first principle involved here, that the suspect or detained person is deemed to be innocent until proved otherwise and is the person who is forfeiting the sample.  In part, it flies in the face of a person not incriminating himself or herself.  It is just as effective a denial of the right of self-defence if one is to not only say something but forfeit an article of clothing, sample, intimate or otherwise of the body.  Therefore, the forfeiture or invasion of both <Col N="2784" /> these rights &mdash; that of innocence until proved guilty and against self-incrimination &mdash; should be balanced against a counter principle, a recognition of the fact that the sample belongs initially to the suspected person.  It should also be recognised that we are legislating to give extraordinary powers to the Garda to take such samples, if necessary by force in certain circumstances, where they would not otherwise be so entitled.</P>
    <P>All that is being argued here is a recognition of all of that, that a balance be maintained: as a fundamental first principle, that the accused, or detained person, be entitled to retain &mdash; where practicable, without interfering unnecessarily in the investigation of the Garda &mdash; a sample that has to be appropriately analysed.</P>
    <P>I advanced the reasons for maintenance of these rights beyond the mere principle on Committee Stage by saying that the conditions in which a sample or article of clothing can be important, in certain circumstances in which there might be an element of dishonesty, not on the part of the Forensic Science Laboratory but in the process of an investigation, when samples or materials can become mixed, mislaid, wrongly labelled or interfered with.  There should be this safeguard enshrined in the Bill based on the rights of the individual which should be respected.</P>
    <P>Those are the reasons it is important that we pursue this matter again on Report Stage.  I have listened to the Minister. I merely ask now that the question be put.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  require the provision of clinical conditions and equipment for the proper and safe taking, receiving and <Col N="2785" /> storage of all tests or samples obtained,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very general proposition.  No doubt it is one the Minister will say he intends to deal with in any event.  I am asking that the provision be recited in the Bill that, as a statutory requirement, he must make regulations in respect of all of these matters.  I argue that strongly. Anybody who has followed this debate from Second Stage right through to Report Stage, will discover that I have been forced to climb down very substantially from the ideas I advanced on Second Stage.  I stressed then the need for a national bank repository of all samples, indeed, the need for a director of such a bank in respect of which I argued on Committee Stage, who would have responsibility for the retention, safekeeping and testing of all samples.  I further argued that samples be taken in conditions in which either a solicitor is present or that the taking of such samples be video-recorded, the tapes retained, or that there be some close scrutiny.  All of those proposals have been abandoned, or I have been forced to abandon them. This means we are thrown back to the basic text and structure for which the Minister is providing, which gives the Garda the right to take such samples. Thereafter, it is entirely a matter of regulation plus the goodwill of the Garda and the professionalism of the State laboratory to ensure that matters are properly conducted.</P>
    <P>Therefore my amendment No. 5 is a last attempt on the part of the Opposition &mdash; who are anxious to ensure that the highest standards of behaviour are maintained throughout these procedures and are provided for &mdash; to argue that, within the framework of this Bill, there be a statutory duty on the Minister to make regulations to ensure that these important standards are so maintained.  Otherwise, the whole process of genetic fingerprinting will be set at naught.  I hope this proposition, in its general sense, will be acceptable to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because I believe that the existing procedures which apply in relation to dealing with samples are more than adequate.  The Forensic Science Laboratory instruct the Garda on how samples are to be taken and subsequently handled.  They supply the necessary materials and containers for taking and storing samples.  The scientists in the State Forensic Science Laboratory are best equipped to judge how these things should be done.  Nothing would be gained by including detailed technical requirements of this nature in the regulations to be made under this Bill.  Deputies may recall that I dealt with those procedures at some length on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Without going over the whole of the ground again I might remind Deputies how samples or material for forensic testing are treated at present.  A garda who takes a sample, or to whom one is given by a doctor, generally delivers it by hand to the State Forensic Science Laboratory where it is personally received and entered into the records by a scientist. This is done because the courts insist on the continuity of custody of such materials.  There is no question of such materials being left lying around in the station or being handled in any slipshod way.  Once the sample reaches the Forensic Science Laboratory its movement, and the tests carried out on it, are meticulously logged.  These are the arrangements which have been operating since the laboratory was established some 15 years ago.  They have operated successfully, and without challenge, and I see no reason to change them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see every reason.  I am sorry I am going to have hard words for the Minister in conclusion on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first argument advanced by him is that it is not a matter for the Minister or for this House, it is primarily a matter for the Forensic Science Laboratory.  I do not accept that.  Every agency of State or otherwise who are given powers and authority, obligations and duties in law get them from this House.  As legislators we are&mdash;I do not want to say supreme <Col N="2787" />&mdash; the higher authority and to argue it has nothing to do with us is to argue against the order of things on the one hand and against the words of the section itself.  I ask the Minister to look at it.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) provides that the Minister shall make regulations relating to the taking of samples.  That is what the section is entirely about.  In fact, the Minister must make regulations about the taking of samples, so this suggestion that it is a matter for the laboratory flies in the face of the section itself.  Section 5 (2) provides that the regulations shall, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), make provision for the recording in the records of a Garda station.  It is talking about what goes on in a Garda station.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully on Committee Stage and I accept fully, that there are the highest of standards applied within the State Forensic Science Laboratory.  I did not visit it, but I remind the Minister that before it gets in the door of the laboratory a great deal happens to a sample.  The State forensic scientists will have no hand, act or part in the taking, sealing, putting into a container, safe keeping and conduct of a sample up to the door of the laboratory.  Their function starts from there on in but there is a whole life to that sample long before it ever gets there.</P>
    <P>This provision in no way ties the Minister's hands.  It is merely recording that this House believes we should put a duty on him to deal with matters of standards. They are important and, I believe, crucial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am slightly breaking the rules in speaking twice, but let me say to the Deputy that I am conscious of his concern in this area.  It is unwarranted but I am conscious of it and in an attempt to meet him some of the way, after a good debate on this whole area on Committee and Report Stages, I am willing to consider matters like sealing, labelling and other non-technical aspects of this issue in preparing the regulations.  We can discuss them on our visit to the Forensic Science Labortory.</P>

Clinical conditions and equipment for the proper and safe keeping, storge and the taking of samples are important.  The Gardas Síochána would welcome directives on this so that the standards are set and worked out in consultation between the Minister's Office and that of the Garda.

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the various Stages of the debate on the Bill.  All expressed general support for it and to the extent that some made criticisms I know they did so in an effort to be constructive and helpful.  Deputies McCartan and Flanagan tabled a number of amendments which have not been accepted.  This does not, to my mind, lessen the value of their being tabled.  It helped us to have a detailed examination of the provisions of the Bill and to tease out those aspects which may have been unclear.  I assure the Deputies I have considered all the amendments very carefully and objectively and, had I been convinced they were needed or would have improved the Bill, I would have happily accepted them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite certain criticisms made during the course of the debate, I am satisfied <Col N="2789" /> that this is a balanced Bill and that it contains all the necessary safeguards to ensure that there is no abuse of the powers which it contains.  I also assure Deputies that I will be carefully drawing those regulations and taking account of the points made in the debate.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which has now passed both Houses, is important legislation.  Forensic science has developed to the stage where it can provide important and even indispensable assistance to the Garda in the detection and prosecution of crime. The powers conferred in this Bill will ensure the Garda are in a position to take the fullest advantage of this assistance, and it will include safeguards in relation to defendants proving their innocence by the use of the most modern of forensic science facilities.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their co-operation in dealing with this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The new powers extended to the Garda Síochána under this legislation are to be welcomed.  It is very important that our criminal law code keeps pace with the developments in science and technology as we have been doing here over the past few weeks.  I had a number of disappointments on Committee and Report Stages as far as amendments are concerned.  Overall the safeguards in the Bill should allay the fears of any parties that there may be undue interference with personal rights and the freedom of the individual.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the regulations will be of tremendous importance and it is a pity the House will not have an opportunity of discussing them, but that is for another day.  I hope, however, that the Minister will act at the earliest opportunity on the recommendations of the Martin committee and that the placing of audiovisual recording equipment in Garda stations will be under way as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents a milestone in that it will see the further advancement of the use of DNA profiling.  It will be available to the Garda Síochána and will have wide use in family law matters.  It will aid the forces of law and order in the fight against <Col N="2790" /> crime.  It represents a major breakthrough in identification, and I am happy that this law enforcement tool of the future, as it has been described, DNA profiling, will be available to the Garda Síochána.  I welcome the legislation as far as that is concerned and look forward to the publication of the regulations.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for dealing with the matters raised on Committee Stage by the Fine Gael Party.  Unfortunately, perhaps, he did not take on board everything that was said, but we had a reasonable debate and I am happy that this Bill is being enacted prior to the end of this session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in thanking the Minister for the manner in which he has dealt with the Bill.  I came in at the latter end of the proceedings on this Bill, but from reading the debates in the Seanad and on the various Stages here, it would appear there was a good deal of agreement on it.  At least the Minister endeavoured, as far as possible, to meet the points of view of all parties. I look forward to the Minister's invitation to visit the science laboratory.  That will be a useful exercise for those of us involved not alone in this debate but in other debates that will follow.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Flanagan said, this legislation is a milestone in that it will provide the Garda Síochána with an important tool to fight ever increasing crime, particularly serious crime, and the Labour Party welcome that.  It will also help to ensure that people who are accused have the maximum scientific facilities available to them.  That is important as well because justice must not only be done but be seen to be done.</P>
      <P>I would join with Deputy Flanagan in his remarks in relation to the regulations. The regulations will be very important. The Minister has already given a commitment to take into consideration the views of the various contributors during the debate on this important Bill and I am quite sure that he will honour that in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>When DNA profiling <Col N="2791" /> was discovered it was probably one of the most exciting forensic science developments in this century.  It has profound implications not just for police investigations and the solution of crimes but also for the civil side in determining issues such as paternity and otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that it is a process of profiling, not fingerprinting as it was originally presented by ICI who hold the world monopoly on the process. There is a vast difference between a finger print and a profile.  The differences were teased out here very fully on Second Stage, recognising that there are peculiar factors of genetic mutation and development within small communities like our own in Ireland that have to be understood. The permutations and combinations have to be worked out before we can be mathematically certain that we are in a position to fully utilise the genetic profiling process.  We must also realise the importance of the clinical way in which the samples are taken, minded and dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, the point has to be made at this stage that the view within the legal profession &mdash; and it has merit in it &mdash; is that the genetic profiling process we are providing for under this law will be inoperative as a matter of evidence at criminal trials until we pass a new criminal evidence Act.  According to the literature explaining it, there are 11 stages of testing and evaluation before one ultimately gets the profile necessary for making a decision, and it would be virtually impossible to translate all that information into a presentable state at a criminal trial where matters are being contested, unless we have a criminal evidence Act that will come to the aid of the prosecution and the court in the <Col N="2792" /> presentation of evidence generally.  I know the Minister has indicated time and again during this debate that that is at an advanced stage.  I hope we will see that Bill before the House very early in the New Year because it is essential not just in this area but in many other areas of the criminal law that we have debated.</P>
    <P>The final point to be made here is that the position of the defence or the accused at the trial is also an important consideration. The legal aid provisions generally for the payment of fees to experts are not generous and they do present difficulties for practitioners in the field who have to top up what is provided for under the legal aid regulations out of their own resources.  This is something I would ask the Minister to look at in consultation with his officials because the role of the forensic defence expert will become important as forensic testing itself becomes important for the prosecution. One is directly related to the other.  No form of impediment should stand in the path of a defendant seeking to avail to the fullest of the advantages of this process in attempting to assert his or her innocence.</P>
    <P>Finally, I thank the Minister for listening with patience to the arguments and propositions put forward in this debate, to which he responded well.  I hope every step will be taken by him now in drafting the regulations to ensure that DNA profiling becomes an integral, trustworthy and reliable addition to the armoury of the prosecution in the fight against crime in this State.</P>
