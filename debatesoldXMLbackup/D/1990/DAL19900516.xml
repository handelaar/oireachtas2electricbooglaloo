      <P>May I ask the Tánaiste the current position regarding the Larceny Bill which is currently before the Seanad.  Last week the Taoiseach indicated, in answer to a question, that it was intended to bring the matter before this House as soon as possible.  Can the Tánaiste indicate if that is still the position? Would he agree that it would be a better practice to allow this House debate whatever amendments took place and to give his team in the Seanad a little more time to settle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach whether the Government intended to make time available in this House to discuss the proposals which they are currently preparing as Ireland's contribution to European political union. At the time I raised it, you correctly suggested that that matter should more properly be raised with the Whips.  We took up that option.  The Labour Party Whip raised the matter with the Government Whip, and we got no clear undertaking that time would be made available in this House to debate the proposals prior to their submission at the June Summit.  Can the Tánaiste now indicate that, in principle, it is the Government's <Col N="1679" /> decision to have a debate on those proposals in this House before they are submitted to the June Summit?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and the House can be reassured on that matter. It will be considered at the next meeting of the Whips.  The urgency of getting the Finance Bill through was the main consideration for this week, but I take the Deputy's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it then &mdash; and I appreciate what the Tánaiste has said &mdash; that when we come to talk about this matter again, the House will have before it a draft or a copy of the Government's proposals for European union?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the Second Stage of the Finance Bill the Minister for Finance promised that he would amend the Bill to extend the manufacturing relief to the year 2010 on Committee Stage.  The amendments still have not been circulated.  We have 130 pages of tax legislation to go through in four days.  There are 128 amendments down already.  The Minister has given notice of legislating a major change in industrial policy.  We, on the Opposition side, will be here today from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. and the key amendment has not yet been circulated.  I want to protest in the strongest possible manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>In page 1, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989 shall not have effect as respects the year 1990-91 and subsequent years assessment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to remove section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1987 with effect from this tax year, 1990-91.  In layman's terms the amendment seeks to restore full mortgage interest relief.  When the present Commissioner MacSharry was Minister for Finance mortgage interest relief in the Finance Act, 1987 was reduced from 100 per cent to 90 per cent and last year the present Minister for Finance, in section 7 of last year's Finance Act, reduced mortgage interest relief by a further 10 per cent to 80 per cent. When the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, introduced section 7 last year he justified the reduction by pointing out that interest rates had gone down during the course of 1988 and the early part of 1989.  Since that section was enacted interest rates have gone up by 4 per cent.  That 4 per cent increase has been a very severe imposition on people with large mortgages especially young couples buying their first house and taking out the average mortgage of about £35,000.  In simple terms, it means an additional £100 per month for a young couple with the average mortgage.  That £1,200 per annum extra must be found after tax and the effect of it is to wipe out gross salary in excess of £2,000 and, depending on one's tax rate, that figure could be £2,500.  That is a huge additional sum of money for a young couple to pay back on a mortgage.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister for Finance does not have full control over interest rates.  Statutorily, the fixing of interest rates is a matter for the Central Bank but, of course, they make their decisions against the background of Government policy.  The Central Bank have pointed out that they believe a differential of 4 per cent between our rates and West German rates, even though we are tied <Col N="1696" /> into the same currency basket, is justified because of the policies being pursued. The Governor of the Central Bank pointed out in the early spring that because our national debt was so high, at more than £25 billion, because the last budget set the minimum acceptable target for Exchequer borrowing requirement in the opinion of the Governor of the Central Bank, because the medium-term target of reducing the national debt to have it equal to the gross national product by 1993 also considered by the Governor to be a soft target &mdash; and because, traditionally, inflation rates here have been higher than in the other narrow band EMS countries, that 4 per cent differential between ourselves and German rates will remain.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister for Finance firming up on his intent on debt control to see if further interest rate increases in West Germany can be ignored here in the sense that we need not follow on and that the differential can be narrowed.  It is difficult to predict interest rates but there is a lot of uncertainty around.  Certainly, nobody can guarantee that there will not be a further rise in interest rates by the end of the year with more bad news for mortgage holders.  While the Minister has options open to him in terms of macro-economic policies he can relieve some of the burden on mortgage holders by accepting our amendment.  It seems to me he can act in two ways.  First, he can change some of his policies or firm up on some of them. Secondly, he can also treat the symptom and give some relief to those in need.</P>
    <P>This raises other issues such as the whole issue of housing policy here.  We have the highest home ownership anywhere in Europe &mdash; it is about 85 per cent &mdash; and if young couples are not in a position to obtain home loans and meet the repayments on them they will, naturally, go on the public housing list.  I am sure the Minister will tell us what our amendment will cost but, in doing the sum, the Minister should tell us the full story. It is false economy if people, as a result of Government policy, are not in a position to buy or build their own houses <Col N="1697" /> and must apply to local authorities for housing.  The cost of local authority houses is very high; comparatively speaking it is higher than that provided in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Another point in regard to housing policy is that, quite frequently, in the long term people do not want to live in locations where local authorities decide to put them.  In Dublin, Cork and Limerick many large housing estates are very unpopular, especially if the people relocated to them are from inner city parishes. We should actively pursue a policy of enabling as many people as possible to buy their own homes, and a policy which runs counter to that is neither financially nor socially desirable.</P>
    <P>This matter obviously raises a wider issue of taxation policy.  It is fashionable at the moment &mdash; particularly since the Progressive Democrats outlined their views on taxation &mdash; to run with the theory that allowances should be abolished, that the total amount of tax paid is not the issue but whether your marginal rate is 25 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 48 per cent.  A great debate is now taking place between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, as to whether the top rate should be 40 per cent or 48 per cent.  However, the key issue for most taxpayers is the amount they pay and not the rate at which they pay it.  In taking into account the amount they pay, the question of allowances must arise.  I do not hold with the theory regarding taxation that says if we abolished all the allowances and brought in a much lower rate, everybody would be happier. Nobody seems to take into account that the whole taxpaying community would not be paying any less tax.  For some reason, there is an expectation in certain political circles that people would be happier if they paid tax under a different scheme and that we should continue to argue about rates instead of allowances.</P>
    <P>Let us examine this matter.  There was a proposal by the Progresive Democrats in their Yellow Paper &mdash; which preceded <Col N="1698" /> their Green Paper before they produced the White Paper &mdash; to abolish mortgage interest relief.  However, the fright they got from their own supporters knocked that one on the head.  However, it is still at the back of the minds of their spokesmen who are not present here today.  What will happen if we abolish mortgage interest and life assurance relief?  It simply means that there will be a transfer from people who own houses to those who do not.  To a large extent, that will mean a transfer from the married person to the single person.  The kind of taxation policy which recommends abolishing or reducing mortgage interest relief is really saying that families should pay more tax than single people.  They use all sorts of arguments about incentives in the workplace to justify this stance.</P>
    <P>Young people in high-earning jobs have some disposable income and they are certainly not as hard up as married couples with children.  They tend to spend money on imported consumer goods, and if there are proposals to increase taxation on married couples by abolishing their allowance and reducing the rate to apply to all taxpayers, single people will gain. Their extra disposable income will go on holidays abroad and, to a large extent, on imported goods.  It is very hard to quantify these things but we all have enough commonsense to realise that I am speaking the truth.  Has the implication of that proposal been considered by the Progressive Democrats who argued for lower rates?  A fiscal policy which encourages the importation of consumer goods is not in the national interest.  It might sound very old-fashioned to the modern gurus of tax reform to say that only the marginal rate need be considered in terms of economic impact.  Before the Minister goes down the road advocated by Progressive Democrat theorists I urge him to look long and hard at the present system of allowances because it did not arise casually.</P>
    <P>People were encouraged to provide themselves with their own houses to give them a sense of independence and security and to ensure that they would not be a burden on the State.  They were <Col N="1699" /> encouraged to save, to insure their lives, and were given tax relief in that regard.  It meant that if the earner in the household died his widow and children would not be a burden on the State.  People were also given an allowance in respect of pension funds, where up to 15 per cent of gross earnings would be tax free.  Again, these people were being prudent and provident so that their dependants would not be a burden on the State.  They were also given an allowance so that they could insure themselves against ill health and their VHI payments could be claimed against income tax.  There is a wider issue here than that of mortgage interest and it also arises in section 4 where the Minister makes reductions in the relief on insurance.  We should have a thorough debate on the merits of the allowance system, because the fashionable economists and commentators regard people who support allowances as some kind of rural dodderers who are not really into the latest fashion tax reform.  There is an extremely strong case to be made for the allowance system.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear Deputy Rabbitte's argument for having all these allowances at the standard rate because I understand from the Revenue and the Department of Finance that this might not be technically possible unless all allowances were put on a tax credit system at the standard rate.  I should also like to hear the Minister's views on that issue.</P>
    <P>We need to open up the debate on tax reform because we are not really benefiting people if we simply lower the rate at which they pay taxes and abolish their allowances which really means that some of them pay more tax.  Any transfer in that regard goes from those with heavy family expense &mdash; life assurance, pension schemes, health insurance or mortgage interest &mdash; to the younger segment of the population.  This could be single people or the improvident section who make up provision to secure their own futures and you give them the tax break at the expense of the people to whom I referred. I strongly advocate that the Minister accept this amendment.  It is true that the <Col N="1700" /> great buzz in the house property market has ceased.  What I have heard from estate agents over the past six weeks or so is that they are now finding it difficult to sell houses, that they have many on their books and that this trend is related directly to rising interest rates.  If the Minister accepted this amendment I predict that houses would be sold quite rapidly again.  Last year's figures were improved enormously by the additional stamp duty revenue which accrued to the Exchequer through the boom in the house property market, particularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know that this mortgage interest relief becomes more expensive as interest rates rise.  I am sure the figure the Minister will give us now will be much higher than it would have been even, say, a year ago.  Obviously, as interest rates rise, more and more people get more relief. The Minister should examine this.  When replying to Second Stage I think the Minister quibbled with my contention that this might carry a 40 per cent buoyancy. Mortgage relief does carry a very high buoyancy.  I contend that what people do not spend on their mortgages will not be put into savings and will be spent very quickly; but if the Minister has a more precise buoyancy figure I will accept that. I do not want to exaggerate or reduce its cost at all.</P>
    <P>Basically that is the case I wanted to make.  Interest rates are very high with people experiencing greater difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments. There are some signs that people are going into arrears and that early legal process for repossession has commenced in a number of cases brought to my attention. Then I want to put my argument in the wider context, where do we go with the allowances?  Are we going to stand idly by and allow a small group of theorists to claim that the only thing that matters is the percentage at which one pays tax, that the amount does not matter very much, that all these allowances constituted some form of foolishness on the part of our predecessors, that really modern people would not have any interest in granting people allowances to <Col N="1701" /> protect themselves from ill health, enable them buy their homes, insure themselves against death and provide pension schemes for their retirement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Later I should like to join the debate Deputy Noonan has kicked off on the question of allowances. Probably the correct juncture to do so would be on my amendment No. 5.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan has ranged widely on the amendment with which we are dealing here.  I support a great deal of what he said.  In approaching this Bill it would be naive to come into the House with a range of amendments expecting they would be taken on board by the Minister, but one can avail of this opportunity to raise certain principles of reform hoping to have a serious debate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I said that my main objection to this section was that it meant the Minister was continuing his policy of going for some tax improvements as distinct from tax reform.  I have a straightforward view of my objective.  I agree with Deputy Noonan's criticism of the position that has become associated with the Progressive Democrats.  In commenting on that I am very conscious how popular that position was at least for a fleeting period of time.  People who are burdened by taxation see tremendous attractiveness in people canvassing for a 25 per cent standard rate of income tax. That is extremely attractive and, I believe, accounted for the rise out of nowhere of the Progressive Democrats in the 1987 elections.  But, as Deputy Noonan said, when people had time to reflect on its impact on the revenue of the State, on the services and infrastructure that must be provided, on what it meant in terms of their net tax burden, they began to take a slightly more sophisticated view of what constitutes tax reform.  While I think the Minister was nodding agreement with Deputy Noonan's analysis, there do seem to be signs that Fianna Fáil are going down the Progressive Democrat's hill heading for a 25 per cent standard rate of income tax as if that, of itself, constituted tax reform. <Col N="1702" /> Cosmetically it may appear to do so but, of itself, it is not tax reform.</P>
    <P>My view is simple.  The Minister is quite free to call it simplistic if he wishes. I will use the figures he gave us &mdash; I do not know whether this part of his script reached the Official Report in his reply on Second Stage &mdash; when he drew the attention of the House to the fact that the breakdown of the total expected income tax yield for 1990 under the existing system was as follows: PAYE 88.8 per cent; farmers, 1.9 per cent; other self-employed 9.3 per cent.  That is where I begin my brief submission now in regard to a system of taxation that brought people in unprecedented numbers &mdash; 750,000 &mdash; onto the streets advocating tax reform ten years ago when I think the share of income tax borne by the PAYE sector was approximately 89 per cent. The fact that it still stands at 88.8 per cent is where I take up my present submission.</P>
    <P>My proposition is that some of that burden must be shifted from the PAYE sector to other, wealth owning sectors and so on.  We must remember that, when talking about mortgage interest relief, essentially we are talking about the same people, the people who, in the kind of society Deputy Noonan described as a home ownership one to a very great extent, who have struggled to put a roof over their heads, to go on hock to a building society, are the very same people who contribute that 88.8 per cent tax yield.  I contend that any opportunity presented to us throughout the passage of this Bill to shift some of their burden on to others or to render their burden lighter should be availed of.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that in the amendment before us we are talking against the backdrop of circumstances in which there have been no fewer than four increases in interest rates since this Government assumed office, in fact four increases since June last.  It is against that backdrop and the extremely onerous penalty it imposes on so many people we have sought the repeal of the relevant sections of the 1987 and 1989 Acts in order to restore mortgage interest relief to 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> May I give an example of the type of circumstance to which Deputy Noonan referred in general.  I have been receiving a number of letters on this issue, as I am sure has every other Member of the House.  I took a particular letter out of a bundle this morning because it illustrates the kind of crisis being created for ordinary taxpayers.  From its layout I suspect other Members have received a copy of it. Certainly I suspect that Deputy Taylor, who represents the constituency from which it emanated, will have received a copy.  The pertinent paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>I am writing to you on the issue of re-instating the 100 per cent tax relief on mortgages.  I feel more justified than ever before for calling for this extra relief as increases in the last year have amounted to 4 per cent, a 50 per cent rise in percentage rates and costing me an extra £120 a month.  This major increase by all predictions in interest rates is not finished, as you can understand, by the past three years and was not predictable at all.  Therefore I would suggest an interim measure during a period of high interest rates over and above a certain interest rate figure to enable a stepped interest rate to be provided ... </P>
    <P>The writer goes on to specify a particular stepped interest rate relief.  That letter is typical of the experience of a number of people in our constituency of Dublin South-West.  It is also a good illustration of where the shoe pinches.</P>
    <P>I understand amendment No. 2 has been ruled out of order.  Whatever difficulties one may have had, and there were many, in coming to grips with the complexity of this Bill over a short period I should say I have not yet managed to grasp what is and is not permitted.  What amendment will or will not be acceptable is arcane.  What we are going for in tax reform does not reflect itself in the form of simplicity in the Finance Bill.  I plead with the Minister to produce legislation next year which co-ordinates the existing legislation, as it is beyond my scope as <Col N="1704" /> spokesperson for my party; perhaps other spokespersons, who in any event need it less than I do, can avail of expert advice which is not available to me to trace the complexity, background and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2, which, as I say, has been ruled out of order, initially formed part of amendment No. 1, in other words there was a part (a) and part (b).  The thinking behind the amendment was, having regard to the principle of equity, that there should be an attempt to be more egalitarian in dispensing mortgage interest relief to those who most need it.  I toyed with a number of options.  One of these options was to take an arbitrary interest rate of, say, 10 per cent and apply 100 per cent relief for as long as interest rates remained above 10 per cent.  That is one possible construction but it might only introduce other complications.</P>
      <P>The option The Workers' Party ultimately agreed on is the better one as it is in keeping with the wish to distribute the burden in such a way that there would be positive discrimination in favour of those on lower incomes.  They went for a system where the existing limit of 80 per cent of £4,000 would not apply.  The reality in the marketplace at present is that a £40,000 mortgage is not unusual.  The latest figures from the Department of the Environment suggest that the average mortgage is £33,500 to £35,000.  Therefore a £40,000 mortgage is no longer unusual.  What I am arguing for is that interest relief should be applied up to that level of £40,000 at the standard rate, in other words, people on lower incomes would benefit disproportionately as a result of additional relief on mortgages being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could do a range of calculations using this formula and one would find that the position of those at the marginal rates of tax would be slightly worse than it is under the present system, but for those not on the marginal rates of tax <Col N="1705" /> there would be a definite benefit to be gained.  It is important so far as possible that the tax changes we introduce are progressive rather than regressive; in other words, they ought to help people on lower incomes rather than people on higher incomes.  It is difficult to do this in practice and it raises the question which Deputy Noonan has referred to of tax allowances as compared to tax credits. That is a question we will deal with later but new mortgages for whom the mortgage limit I instance here is not unusual ought to be given full relief at the standard rate.  I accept that the amendment has been ruled out of order and that we are dealing with amendment No. 1 but it is imperative that the Minister take on board the views being expressed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Noonan has less experience of this than I have but I am not saying this would lead to a reduction in the number of homes being repossessed. Deputy Noonan referred to this as an incipient phenomenon.  The fact is that in my constituency this is an extremely serious social fact of life which I am sure Deputy Taylor will testify to in a few moments.  Both Deputy Taylor and I are members of Dublin County Council. I do not know whether he has figures in front of him but at every council meeting during the past year and a half we have had to deal with no less than 25 requests to repossess homes and put them back on the market as a result of people being unable to meet repayments on their mortgages.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest reservations about the HFA system.  It is extremely punitive and many people took out loans in the belief that they could handle them but, to their sadness, they have become casualties and are unable to keep up their payments.  The repossession of homes is an increasing phenomenon.  I personally am mediating on behalf of six couples with the HFA and two building societies. I am not saying we will tackle that phenomenon by merely extending mortgage interest relief, as it is more complex than that, but nonetheless it shows the reality with people having difficulty in keeping up their repayments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> It is important that the Minister rethink his position and give relief to people in a particular category who are liable for every tax that comes their way and who get very little benefit of any kind.  This would be, in effect, a progressive change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this amendment.  I do not want to go over any of the ground covered by Deputy Noonan and Deputy Rabbitte except to say that I agree with most of what they said.  The amendment deals with the question of mortgage interest relief, which now stands at 80 per cent of a maximum figure.  The reality for people living in average homes is that some are in danger of losing their homes, at the suit of local authorities and building societies; not a high proportion perhaps but to anybody hit by this it is a traumatic experience. There are many frightened people and families out there.</P>
      <P>Apart from those who are put to the extremity of actually losing their homes there is a very much larger number whose living standards have been eaten away by this provision.  The increases in their mortgage repayments have bitten deep into the nett family income and their everyday needs for food, clothing, education, transport and so on have been seriously prejudiced.  There have been serious drops in living standards among many thousands of people up and down this country as a result and that is an indeniable fact.  I am talking about unemployed people, people on low incomes and also people on middle incomes who have been very badly hit in this way. People on reasonably good incomes have been hammered as a result of these interest rate increases; their mortgage repayments have gone up by £20 to £25 a week in many cases and that has a very serious impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the problem is that the relief is not given on 100 per cent of what is paid up to the overall maximum and part is the fact that the interest rates at present are far higher than they should be when the rate of inflation is taken into account. I know the old saying that interest rates are not the responsibility of the Minister <Col N="1707" /> for Finance and at times he puts the responsibility onto the back of the Central Bank.  I know that theoretically the Central Bank gives the directives to alter interest rates.  Everybody knows well enough, however, that it is the Minister's policies that dictate interest rates.  The Minister conceded that himself to a large extent in his reply to the Second Stage of the Finance Bill when he said &ldquo;there is no doubt that the fiscal and economic policies pursued since 1987 by the Government have exerted a major positive influence on interest rates&rdquo;.  He is saying that it is his own economic policies that have produced the present position, and that it is a deliberate act of policy on the part of the Government to maintain those high interest rates.  In the same reply he said the reason for this was to provide a high exchange rate for the punt. We know that is desirable in some respects but it has a down side for exporters.  The other reason he gives for maintaining such unreasonably high interest rates is to maintain the position of the external reserves, currency movements and so on.  Looking at the figures as they are at present it seems that the external reserves are healthy enough to warrant a reduction in interest rates.  I am very sure that if the Minister gave the appropriate signal to the Central Bank they would be very happy to oblige.  Such a reduction in interest rates would be a major boost to so many people whose living standards are being eaten away not only in the context of home loans but of obtaining finance to buy fridges, motor cars and so on.  It would be a boon to traders and business people many of whom are trying to struggle with difficulties and maintain the employment they give in those industries.</P>
    <P>The amendment itself is not in quite the format I would have wished.  The issue should not be simply one of restoring the interest level.  It should be tied in, as Deputy Rabbitte said, to an upper limit provision.  I see no particular need to afford concessions to people who are involved in buying out homes costing anything from £100,000 to £200,000 and <Col N="1708" /> many homes in the country are going for such prices and higher.  Anybody who can afford to buy a home in that price range can carry their own position so far as tax and allowances are concerned.</P>
    <P>Likewise the question of whether the allowance should be at the standard rate or not arises.  I understand and sympathise with the thinking behind Deputy Rabbitte's amendment which was ruled out of order.  However, I would not have been supporting it had it not been ruled out of order in the present tax regime we have.  If the tax regime was reformed and was on a more equitable basis that amendment would have been appropriate but in the present tax regime we have, unfortunately, to deal with this issue on a more simplistic basis.  For that reason we will be supporting the amendment in the name of Deputy Noonan and others when it comes to be voted on.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House long on this amendment because it has been adequately dealt with by the three previous speakers.  I completely agree with the arguments put forward by all the speakers about the necessity to encourage home ownership so that the cost of providing homes does not fall on local authorities and thereby on the taxpayers.  It is essential that this relief be given on 100 per cent of what is paid, bearing in mind the huge and frequent increases in interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any relief will be costly and we must look at it in conjunction with the budget deficit which is substantial.  It is admittedly considerably reduced from previous years but nevertheless is very serious matter.  This deficit arises as a result, of course, of very bad housekeeping over a number of years by all the parties in this House with the exception of The Workers' Party.  However, I do not want <Col N="1709" /> to stray too far down that road except to say that I totally agree with Deputy Rabbitte's amendment which has been ruled out of order.  It was proposing that this relief be at the standard rate.  The reason I have not put down an amendment on that is that I would like to have all the allowances at the standard rate but, as in the case of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, my amendment to that effect has been ruled out of order.  This is a result of the arcane procedures of this House.  If mortgage interest relief were given up to 100 per cent, which ought to be the case, subject to the statutory limit already in force and if the allowance were at the standard rate only, there would probably be no cost to the Exchequer. That is a very serious matter.  Neither Deputy Noonan nor Deputy Taylor has said anything about how much this relief will cost or how it will be paid for.  We must have a sense of responsibility.  There is an obligation on Opposition speakers to make it quite clear how they think concessions are to be paid for.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte about the complexity of the present Finance Bill.  There has been no Finance Consolidation Act since 1967 and that matter has been brought up at Question Time on a number of occasions in my period in the Dáil.  There have been Finance Bills every year since then &mdash; in some years there were two Finance Bills. This Finance Bill is a monstrous piece of legislation.  The Revenue Commissioners issue pages of amendments to the Finance Consolidation Act but it would take an Einstein, with all the Acts that have been passed in the meantime &mdash; the wealth tax was abolished, changes were made in the capital gains tax and so on &mdash; to understand the whole matter.  The more time that passes the more difficult it will be to draft another consolidation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the people in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have a lot of work to do but I would appeal to the Minister to do something in this regard and to start working on it now because it will take at <Col N="1710" /> least three years to complete such a job. This Finance Bill is probably the biggest for a number of years.  As I said, it is impossible to follow the Finance Consolidation Act because so many changes have been made.  If the Minister would introduce another such Bill he would be congratulated by all tax practitioners, accountants and the general public.  The Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance do not seem to have the staff, the time or the inclination to do this but perhaps extra people could be taken on to do the job.</P>
    <P>Everybody seems to be in favour of amendment No. 1.  We would all like to receive as many allowances as possible and to pay as little tax as possible. However, I would like to address the question of tax reform which was raised by Deputy Rabbitte.  I have spoken on this subject on many occasions in the past two years.  Political parties on all sides of this House speak about tax reform but basically what we talk about are tax reductions, which is not tax reform.  Of course, the reason for this is that it is electorally attractive.</P>
    <P>The party now in Government have had many good ideas and should be complimented on them but some years ago they produced a policy of very low rates of taxation.  The country's finances were chronic at the time and we could not see the tunnel, never mind the light at the end of it.  This party proposed a system of tax reform to reduce the tax rates to 25 or 20 per cent and 40 per cent.  At the time I said why not do away with tax altogether?  The danger in introducing such policies is that all the other political parties have to respond to that type of nonsense.</P>
    <P>My own party should have learned from the 1977 experience that tax reductions do nothing but lead us into a terrible mess downstream.  They are electorally attractive only to the people who are working.  They are not attractive to the unemployed who do not pay car tax, income tax or benefit from reduced income tax rates.</P>
    <P>When changes were made in car tax in 1977 they were of no benefit to people <Col N="1711" /> without cars.  Likewise, reducing income tax from, say, 35 per cent to 30 per cent, 20 per cent or even 10 per cent, will not benefit people who are not working because they do not pay income tax, but it is very attractive to the middle class and those who are working.</P>
    <P>What I am saying now is not electorally attractive but there must be a little common sense in this whole area.  Reducing tax rates is dangerous because as sure as night follows day when it comes to an election Fine Gael will have to respond with something better, then Fianna Fáil will reply with something better again and The Workers' Party and Labour will have to do even better.  If we learned anything in the last 13 years it should be that to reduce tax is dangerous.  I hope the Minister for Finance, despite pressure from within the Cabinet or anywhere else, will have enough gumption &mdash; which he has proved to have so far &mdash; not to go down that road.</P>
    <P>I am, and have been for a number of years, in favour of giving people incentives to work and of having tax rates as low as possible but we cannot do everything overnight.  There are two reasons for having tax rates: firstly to redistribute wealth, which I am sure Deputy Rabbitte would favour, and secondly, to keep the machinery of the State in motion.  I am also in favour of the State keeping out of things as much as possible and I would disagree with Labour and The Workers Party in that regard.  If we reduced the cost of running the country, we could reduce the tax rates but the budget deficit that built up in the seventies still exists. We have not reached the promised land in terms of the public finances.  It would be a big mistake if we did not keep on the brakes in 1990 and 1991 as we did in 1987, 1988 and 1989.  It would be a mistake to say that the financial problem is solved and to start reducing tax.  That would cause as much confusion in two years' time as there was in the eighties.</P>
    <P>Has any debate taken place in the public arena about what is so sacrosanct in having a 48 per cent tax rate?  The only reason for suggesting such a reduction <Col N="1712" /> is that it is electorally attractive for all parties.  When tax rates are greater than 50 per cent it is a disincentive because people are taking home less than half of their earnings.  I would like a debate about what is so great in having a 40 per cent rate of tax, as has been mentioned by some politicians in this House &mdash; I am not referring to those on my left.  We should get the public finances in order, reduce borrowing and restore stability. We should try to eliminate the current budget deficit because there is no merit in it.  The original idea of a current budget deficit in the early seventies was to stimulate the economy, but it has become an endemic part of Irish financial life.  It should be the aim of the Government in the next budget to eliminate the current budget deficit but it would not be possible to eliminate borrowing in the next budget.  If the Government continue to reduce tax rates as a result of pressure or whatever, we will end up in a financial mess again.</P>
    <P>It has been proved that people will not allow you to give something and then take it back.  Therefore, politicians try not to attempt anything of that kind but the Minister for Finance, despite the pressure that may be brought to bear on him, should introduce a programme to eliminate the current budget deficit even if that means not further reducing tax rates.  He would be remembered for many years afterwards for doing the responsible thing.  The Minister would not benefit from doing the popular thing but he would be blamed in the years to come if the State's finances were to go off the rails.</P>
    <P>I am one of the Members who was in favour of the Government policy since 1987.  I was long preaching it in fact since 1980 when it was against the views of members in my own party.  As the public finances are now in some sort of order, surely extra services and tax relief should go to the people who have suffered most, the people in Tallaght, the people who have no jobs, the people who receive a bad health service or the people who have been affected by cuts in social welfare. Surely it is commonsense to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" /> I remember when all interest payments were allowable against income tax and that was not too many years ago, but they have been progressively restricted over the years.  In the early eighties ordinary interest payments, for example, interest on overdrafts, ceased to be allowed against income tax.  Later the Government tampered with the interest relief on mortgage payments.  I think there are two roads that any Minister can go down with regard to mortgage interest relief &mdash; he looks at the proposals of the Commission on Taxation and abolishes reliefs of all kinds and then has very low tax rates.  In Australia they have done that: they have abolished most allowances but they have low tax rates.  That is really what the Commission on Taxation suggested &mdash; the abolition of relief on VHI payments, mortgage interest etc., combined with low taxes.  On the other hand, we have built up a system of allowances for mortgage interest payments, VHI and life assurance and people have entered into commitments based on these allowances but now we are starting to restrict them.</P>
    <P>The upper ceiling of £4,000 on mortgage interest relief has been set for a number of years but two years ago it was reduced to 90 per cent of £4,000 and last year to 80 per cent of £4,000.  It is quite true, as other Members have said, that people are in serious difficulties because of the high interest rates and they now face the possibility of their homes being repossessed.  The Minister for the Environment will have to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Parts of my constituency closely resemble some Dublin constituencies and Kildare County Council, acting as agent for the Housing Finance Agency are bogged down sending out eviction orders and repossession orders.  The unfortunate thing about the housing finance scheme &mdash; it may have been a Minister on our side of the House or perhaps it was an Opposition Member who had very grave doubts about this scheme &mdash; is that the idea was very good, but there were doubts as to whether people would get into difficulties.  That has now happened and unfortunately the local authority, <Col N="1714" /> acting as agent for the Housing Finance Agency, have no discretion to make arrangements to take the people out of their houses and rehouse them in a local authority house.  This is a great problem in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I would love to see mortgage interest relief on a £4,000 minimum.  I know this would involve extra cost and that is the reason the Minister cannot go along with the idea.  I believe that mortgage interest relief should be allowed on interest payments of £4,000 at the higher rate or unrestricted mortgage interest at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what Deputy Rabbitte proposed in amendment No. 2, which was ruled out of order, that is, that restricting mortgage interest relief to the standard rate of tax on mortgages up to £40,000, will help the low income taxpayer, because that person would not be able to get a mortgage of £40,000 in any event.  In effect, his amendment would help very few people.  I do not agree that mortgage interest relief should be restricted to the standard rate of tax.  I see no merit in that suggestion and I think it is a false premise to say that it will help the lower paid.</P>
    <P>Over the years Government policy has been to encourage home ownership. Local authority tenants can avail of a tenant purchase scheme after they have been in their house for a number of years. We have the highest ratio of home ownership in Europe.  It is an Irish trait that people want to own their own home.  I think that is a good thing.  I am in favour of giving interest relief on at least £4,000 and if possible I would prefer to see it unrestricted, but I realise that there is a cost involved.</P>
    <P>With rising interest rates over the past year, I am sure the Minister and others are aware that many people face difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments. Has anyone ever noticed the level of aggression at the doorsteps when canvassing the new middle class homes at election time?  The places I dread canvassing at election time are the new middle class houses, and we have a great many of them in the north and middle of <Col N="1715" /> Kildare.  I would prefer to go to what people might term as rougher areas but where the people have been settled for a number of years.  You can have a camaraderie with them and have great crack even though they experience other social problems.  However, I have noticed over the years that you meet a level of aggression at the doorsteps in new middle class estates, they just want to fight with someone and you happen to come along. I have always put this down to the pressure they face due to meeting repayments in the early years of their marriage.  If you go back to those same houses in eight or ten years time, the estates have become more settled and the level of aggression has diminished.  They still may not wish to vote for you, but that is beside the point, but they do not eat you.</P>
    <P>With the rise in interest rates last year there are thousands of people under considerable pressure.  Interest rates have gone up at least four times in the past year.  I believe there is some merit in restoring mortgage interest relief to 100 per cent over the next couple of years.  I can see the trend in the Department of Finance.  They reduced the relief on mortgage interest to 90 per cent of £4,000 and then they reduced it to 80 per cent of £4,000 with the idea of gradually getting rid of it altogether.  It is obvious to me that this is the thinking in the Department of Finance and whether Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Noonan, or Deputy Rabbitte is Minister for Finance that will be the way the Department think because that is the way the Department will continue no matter what party are in power.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are very high and I look forward to the day when there will be unlimited competition in the financial market from all the European banks or banks from any other country.  I believe that what is operating, and what has always operated despite the protestations of some years ago, is a cartel.  There is supposed to be free and open competition but I believe the cartel operates because the differential between the lending rate and the deposit rate is too great. <Col N="1716" /> However, this is a matter for debate for another day.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have made constructive contributions in relation to this amendment and in relation to the whole income tax area generally.  I know we will be coming to it in more detail later but various points were raised and it is no harm to respond to some of these at this stage.  I will deal with the various comments but I want to assure the House, and Deputy McCreevy, in particular, that I have no intention of throwing away the common sense approach that has stuck with me for a number of years in relation to how I deal with any particular matter.  I have no intention of changing direction in relation to this matter either.  I have said repeatedly that I will not follow the Nigel Lawson line of drastically reducing income tax rates to create a boom in consumption that consequently puts back up interest rates and makes people much worse off at the end of the day than they <Col N="1717" /> were before.  The Irish economy is not in that position and, even if it were, I would not contemplate taking that route.  It should be emphasised again that our problems are not behind us.  We are starting to solve them but we have a long way to go.  Regardless of what Government are in office there is no question of making the kind of wild promises that were made in the past.  There is no Utopia and anyone who thinks there is had better think again.</P>
      <P>What is happening in relation to this amendment and, indeed, to the debate generally about mortgage interest rates &mdash; I will come to the details later &mdash; is that people are looking only at part of the problem.  The kinds of difficulties referred to by Deputy Noonan and others would not be resolved by a restoration of mortgage interest relief to its previous 100 per cent level.</P>

      <P>It is only a small part of the problem.  The Deputy must not have been listening to Deputy Garland when he talked about responsibility in the House.  Nobody has said where we would get the £55 million which restoration of the relief to its original level would cost in a year.  Most of the extra money people are paying in mortgage repayments is as a result of the interest rate increases last year.  That is the nub of the problem.  Deputy Taylor quoted selectively, as usual, from the Second Stage response.  He spoke on the lines that the Minister likes to pass the problem over to the Central Bank, that he does not have responsibility for interest rates. That is not my choice.  The House has given the statutory power to the Central Bank to regulate the monetary policy of this country.  I have no power &mdash; and this House has never given power to any Minister for Finance &mdash; to direct the Central Bank to either bring down interest rates or to increase them.</P>

      <P>The effect of Government policy on the level of interest rates is the important thing.  That is the reason this Government, as was the case of the previous Fianna Fáil Government, have been following a policy of creating an environment in which interest rates could come down.  We got them down to a very low level.  I do not think anybody believed that in the volatile world we live in, they would remain so. Interest rates increased four times last year and that is what has created the problem for the people represented by Deputy Noonan, Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Taylor, Deputy Garland and Deputy McCreevy.  The solution does not lie in what the Deputies have proposed here.</P>
      <P>We all know that interest rates used to be the instrument for bringing down inflation; now it is used for a different purpose, to stop flows of capital from one country to another.  Because of 1992 &mdash; the achievement of the Single Market and the full release of capital movements &mdash; it may well be that in future interest rates will be used more and more in that regard or it may be that, when there is a free flow of capital, when our largest single trading partner, the UK, is a participant in the ERM and the EMS, there will be less volatility.  I have no intention of looking into the crystal ball and trying to project what will happen.  There are many commentators trying to give views on what may or may not happen interest rates in the future.  I will give the detail as I see it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to respond briefly to some of the arguments made in relation to tax reform.  We will be coming to that later and it may give some people something to chew on.  For many years there has been much talk of tax reform but no action.  In three short years we have implemented significant reforms centred on major reductions in income tax. Deputy McCreevy and others are right in saying that many people have talked over a number of years in relation to tax reform but in effect what they are really talking about are tax reductions.  When <Col N="1719" /> one tries to do something with tax reform everybody cries foul, asking for restoration and so on.  Everybody wants tax reductions but nobody wants to engage themselves in tax reform.  As Deputy McCreevy rightly said, once something that has existed is reduced or removed, the electorate and Opposition Deputies from whatever party will always cry, during the course of a Finance Bill or a budget debate, to have it restored.  The reasons being given for restoration of the concession in the case in question are different from what they were when the concession was being granted originally, that was, to reduce the income tax burden while also bringing about a reduction in interest rates.</P>
    <P>I want to recall the situation that existed in 1987.  The Government who came to power in that year found the financial situation so bleak that no income tax relief could be provided.  This was not just the view of the incoming Government: it was also the view of the outgoing Government, as was shown by their budget proposals of January 1987 which contained no provision for income tax relief.</P>
    <P>I also want to recall to Deputies the principal features of the income tax structure obtaining in 1987.  The exemption limit for a married couple then was £5,300, regardless of the number of children they had.  The standard rate was 35 per cent and it stood at that that figure for 20 years.  The standard rate band was £4,700 for a single person and £9,400 for a married couple.  The top rate of tax was 58 per cent.  In 1987-88 only about 56 per cent of taxpayers were paying at the standard rate.  In short, we had an income tax system without special provision for the low paid, with a high standard rate being paid by less than 60 per cent of all taxpayers and well over 40 per cent on even higher rates of tax.</P>
    <P>The Government set out to tackle the problem by taking determined and rigorous action.  The first target was public finances; by getting these under control it was possible to consider doing something about our income tax system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> In the autumn of 1987 we negotiated the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which has been the cornerstone of our economic progress over the past three years.  A feature of the programme was the commitment to introduce income tax reliefs worth £225 million on a cumulative basis over the three years of the programme and, within that provision, to make significant progress towards having two-thirds of taxpayers taxed at no more than the standard rate.  Significant progress has been made since then and not just in relation to the number paying tax at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>Progress began in the 1988 budget which provided reliefs worth some £400 million over the period of the programme and increased to 63 per cent the percentage of taxpayers paying tax at no more than the standard rate.  The 1989 budget introduced a number of new elements.  The process of cutting tax rates was begun.  For the first time in 20 years the tax rate was reduced in the 1989 budget from 35 per cent to 32 per cent. That, as I said then, was the first step in cutting the personal rates of tax which all of us agreed were too high, which are still too high, but we have to be realistic and use common sense in our approach to this question.  As the House is aware, we have continued along that road again this year. In addition, special measures were introduced in the 1989 budget to help the low paid.  I increased the general exemption limit by £500 for a married couple and introduced a child allowance of £200 in conjunction with the exemption limits. The standard rate band was extended by £400 for a single person and £800 for a married couple, amounts sufficient to maintain at least 63 per cent of the number of taxpayers at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>This year I carried the process of reform a stage further.  I again increased the exemption limit for a married couple by £400, bringing it to £6,500; I also increased the child addition to £300 per child.  The percentage of taxpayers paying at no more than the standard rate was maintained at 63 per cent.  Finally, of course, the top tax rate was reduced <Col N="1721" /> to 53 per cent and the standard rate cut to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>What these figures mean is that, within a short space of time, a great deal has been done to transform the income tax structure inherited in 1987.  Special measures have been introduced to help low paid taxpayers, especially those with children. The standard tax rate has been reduced to 30 per cent.  The top rate of tax has also been reduced.  Progressively tax has been moderated and now not far from two-thirds of taxpayers pay at the standard rate.  Over the past three budgets over £800 million worth of income tax reliefs on a cumulative basis have been introduced compared with the £225 million commitment contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Of course the Government do not propose to stop there.  Substantial progress has been made on income tax but more is needed.  The income tax system is still acting as a disincentive to effort and income tax rates are too high.  The Programme for Government recognises these difficulties and commits the Government to further reducing the standard rate to 25 per cent by 1993 and to moving towards a single higher rate of tax.  Deputy McCreevy asked what was sacrosanct about any of the top rates. Nothing is sacrosanct about them.  I think everybody in this House would like to see them being as low as possible so that there would be a greater incentive to work.  I can say to the House what I have always said, that we have to be consistent, and whatever rates the economy can afford, those are the rates any responsible Minister for Finance will bring in in his annual budget.</P>
    <P>The changes I have mentioned are the objective of the present Government and will be continued and brought about in the same way as changes heretofore have been brought about, by sustained and concentrated action.  They will result in an income tax system substantially better than the one we have now and transformed out of all recognition from the system inherited in 1987.  The Government are firmly committed to this process and will carry it out just as effectively as <Col N="1722" /> we have carried out substantial improvements in recent years.  I do not mind getting proposals from anybody: as long as they are not wild statements, are properly costed and show where the money is coming from, I will look at them.  I do not care whether they are from people inside or outside this House, but I will not make the mistakes made by a former Finance Minister across the water who got their economy into such deep trouble as it is in now and will take some time to get out of.  I have no intention of doing that and will resist any moves to do so.</P>
    <P>A few figures are worth dwelling on. Deputy Rabbitte rightly quotes the figures I gave in response to questions on Second Stage about the numbers of PAYE people and the percentage of tax they are paying.  The figures he quoted are accurate.  It is important to dissect those figures and see what we are talking about.  We will take them approximately. There are 100,000 people between farmers and self-employed.  There are 846,000 taxpayers in total.  Take 100,000 from that and we are talking about an 8:1 ratio of PAYE <i>versus</i> self-employed, including farmers.  That is the relativity and is going to be maintained.  If you have seven or eight more PAYE taxpayers, inevitably they are going to pay more, so it is foolish to try to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about relativity.  I will give the average, taking the numbers and the total paid.  The average paid by a PAYE taxpayer in 1990 will be £3,080.  The average for those under schedule D, the self-employed, will be £2,786 and the average for the farmer in between is £714.  That gives a better insight into the real figures. We will come back to that later, but it is no harm to present the figures.  Irrespective of how you want to toss out figures, the relativity on numbers will be there.  The amount of money paid by PAYE taxpayers will always be a high proportion of the total tax because of the numbers.  What distorts the figures and does not give us the proper information is that many people are self-employed and directors in small companies are in the PAYE net anyway and are not separated out of it.  It is not really the true figure because you do not have a breakdown of the proportion of self-employed people, directors of small companies, proprietary directors and so on, who are on PAYE.  The proportionality and relativity are worth looking at.  Unfortunately, we do not have the statistics that could give us a total, but at least it is no harm to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might as well give the House some information on another input into the debate, that is the likely impact on taxpayers of the tax credit system that has been discussed and debated from time to time.  The main argument put forward over that period in favour of tax credit is that the tax credit system would reduce the relief to and thereby increase the tax liability of those with higher incomes.  In other words, a direct switch to tax credits would increase the progressivity of the income tax code.  Proponents of the tax credit system claim it would provide relief for those on lower incomes by taking from the better off.  However, a switch to tax credits based on exact conversion from the existing system would take from people who could not be described as better off.  The essential difference <Col N="1724" /> between the existing system and the tax credit system is that the higher rates of tax commence under the tax credit system at a lower level of total income.  At present more than one-third of all taxpayers pay the higher rates.  If the present system were replaced by a tax credit system, and if there was no compensating increase in the amounts of the personal allowance given in the form of tax credits or adjustments of the rate bands, some 63 per cent of taxpayers would be liable at the higher rates.  In other words, all existing higher rate taxpayers and very many of those currently paying tax at the standard rate would be forced to pay extra tax.</P>
    <P>When a taxpayer is liable at the higher rates it clearly creates a loss for him.  If his personal allowance or deductions are converted from deductions at his marginal rate of tax through deductions by way of tax credit computed at one of the lower rates, if only the wealthy were liable to tax at the higher rates this would be justified on progressivity allowance, but it could not be justified in the context of the tax rate structure which imposes the higher rates on a person having less than an average wage.  Change over to tax credits would bear relatively more heavily on those with modest and middle incomes than the better off, precisely because of the problem of the bands and the low amount of money on which people come into the various tax nets. The Deputy need not shake his head.  I know there was a commitment in Fine Gael to tax credits, I know it was given by various Governments, but they found when they went into Government it just did not work the way they were trying to tell people it was going to work.  There is the problem.  Perhaps I could leave this till later on, but if the Deputy wants me to I will go on.  It will focus the debate on the administrative nightmare of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The administrative nightmare is another aspect that nobody thought seriously about when they put forward this system.  The switch to tax <Col N="1725" /> credits, even on a limited basis in respect, say, of the main personal allowance &mdash; that is for single, widowed and married &mdash; would impose a very heavy administrative burden on employers and on the Revenue Commissioners, as it could not be drafted onto an existing income tax system without great complication &mdash; mind you, it is complicated enough as we discuss it here today.  For operational purposes, under the present computer based PAYE system, the credits would have to be converted back into allowances at each taxpayer's marginal rate, and employers would be required to operate additional PAYE tables.  The existing rate structure has six PAYE tables.  To provide the same coverage under a tax credit system in respect of the main personal allowances for single, widowed and married would require nine tables.  A mixed system involving allowances and tax credits in respect of more than the main personal allowances would result in a proliferation of tax tables.  For example, if tax credits were substituted for the PAYE and PRSI allowances in addition to the main personal allowances it would require 36 tax tables to cater for the permutations of the availability and non-availability of these allowances.  If non-standard deductions such as mortgage interest relief were given as tax credits, the number of tax tables would be further multiplied.  It would not be possible to increase the number of tax tables from the present six to anything like the number required without introducing substantial changes to the whole revenue administration, in particular to its computer system and without considerably advanced planning by employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their payroll systems employers use either tax deduction cards supplied by the Revenue Commissioners or various forms for commercially designed clerical, electronic and computer systems.  The provision of a large number of alternative tax tables would be excessively demanding on the designers of all such systems. There are now on record in the region of 7,600 employers catering for over 830,000 in employment using some form <Col N="1726" /> of commercial design system, which gives some indication of the implications of the complexity associated with that multiplicity of tax tables that I have talked about.  The operation in practice of so many options would undoubtedly be prone to error, generate large-scale demands for end of year reviews and lead to substantial losses of revenue.  Apart from the practical problems, it would be well-nigh impossible for either employers or Revenue junior staff to understand the reasoning behind such a variety of tables and allowances and differing ceilings of taxable incomes at each rate.  Already it is confusing enough for taxpayers &mdash; a view expressed by some Members &mdash; when they see the changes in tax-free allowances which vary with alterations in their earnings and marginal tax rates. That gives some insight into the complexities involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies Rabbitte and McCreevy referred to the question of consolidation. I am sure other Members do not disagree with the views put forward by them but, again, we must be realistic and keep our feet on the ground.  It is fair to argue that the time is not opportune to consider consolidation given the major changes that are taking place in our tax codes. The Finance Act, 1988, introduced new arrangements with regard to returns, assessments, tax payments and appeals. Those measures, which have been described as constituting the most radical improvement in the administrative system since the introduction of PAYE will have on ongoing impact on the taxation system for a number of years to come.  Provisions were extended to companies last year &mdash; the self-assessment &mdash; and this year we are providing for a move to a current year basis of assessment for incomes which up to now have been assessed on a preceding year basis.</P>
    <P>There will, hopefully, be further developments of the system in future years.  For example, I have already signalled my belief that the self-assessment system should be mandatory when circumstances permit.  To consolidate tax law in the light of these ongoing radical changes would not make any real sense. <Col N="1727" /> In the circumstances there is no alternative in the medium term to leaving the tax law in its present unwieldy form, as admitted by all.  When the system settles down, having acquired a structure that is likely to prove reasonably long-term, the question of consolidation can then be addressed.  With the major changes taking place in the system, and resources being transferred from one area to another, this is not the time to engage in that exercise.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to secure that the restrictions on mortgage interest relief imposed by section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987, and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989, currently standing at 80 per cent of the amount which would otherwise be allowable, will not apply for 1990-91 and subsequent years of assessment. In other word, the amendment seeks the restoration of mortgage interest relief to its pre-1987 level.  To restore mortgage interest relief to the levels which obtained prior to the introduction of the restrictions would cost an additional £31 million in 1990 and £55 million in a full year.  I have already explained on Second Stage why I do not propose to restore the relief to its pre-1987 level but in view of the amendment now before us I would like to remind the House of my reasons for this.</P>
    <P>The reduction of mortgage interest relief to 80 per cent must be seen in the context of the major progress made in reducing income tax in recent years. Taking the 1988, 1989 and 1990 budgets together, the general exemption limits have been increased from £2,650 to £3,250 for a single person and from £5,300 to £6,500 for a married couple.  A child addition was introduced in conjunction with those limits and now stands at £300 per child: this innovation was aimed specifically at low income taxpayers with family responsibilities.  The standard rate tax band has been widened by £1,800 for a single person and £3,600 for a married couple, so that 63 per cent of taxpayers are paying tax at the standard rate compared with less than 56 per cent in the 1987-88 tax year.  Finally, of <Col N="1728" /> course, a substantial step has been taken in cutting tax rates; the top rate of tax has been cut from 58 per cent to 53 per cent, and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>These reliefs have benefited every taxpayer, and it is against this background that the restriction of mortgage interest relief must be viewed.  The Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was to introduce income tax reliefs to the cumulative value of £225 million; in fact, the cumulative value of the reliefs introduced by the Government exceeds £800 million.  There is also, of course, the commitment to further reduce the standard tax rate to 25 per cent by 1993, and to move towards a single higher rate.</P>
    <P>The amendment is no doubt prompted by the rises in interest rates but it would not solve the problem.  Many people were led to believe, when they heard calls for the full restoration of the relief, that this would solve the problem but, in effect, it is only a small contributor to the problem. The level of interest rates is the real problem and the only way we will get them down is to continue our tight management of the economy and control of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>In addition, mortgage interest relief is already a very expensive tax relief and is estimated to cost some £220 million in the current tax year in terms of tax foregone. This represents a very substantial Exchequer subsidy for house purchase: restoring the relief to 100 per cent would add £55 million a year to its cost.  The Deputies have not indicated how this cost should be met.  Deputy Garland called for a show of responsibility in regard to this.  If Members want to spend £55 million they must tell me where that money should come from.  Members should bear in mind that we have a current budget deficit which we are trying to reduce and, eventually, eliminate.  We are trying to reduce and eliminate our Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Those are the hard facts that Members must face up to but they are not doing so.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the cost of mortgage interest relief has already risen by some <Col N="1729" /> £50 million over the last year: in the 1989-90 tax year, mortgage interest relief cost an estimated £170 million, whereas this year it is estimated that its cost will be some £220 million.  It should be remembered that I did not touch mortgage interest relief in the budget.  The increase in interest rates also cost the Exchequer an additional £50 million.  The overall figure demonstrates the commitment of the Government to those who own their own houses.  The Government are concerned about those people who have to meet mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>The increase in interest rates has occurred mainly because of international factors over which we have little control. The role of the Government is to provide, by their domestic budgetary and other policies, the economic background conducive to maintaining interest rates which are as low as possible, and this is what we have been doing.  I should add that domestic market conditions have shown considerable improvement in recent months and interbank interest rates have also eased considerably from their peak levels attained in early-March.  Against this background, the Central Bank, the primary decider of interest rate levels, are more optimistic about the general trend of domestic interest rates than they were in their February monetary policy statement.</P>
    <P>I should like to give another figure to the House which puts this matter into perspective.  The cost of restoring the relief would be £55 million, the number to benefit from such a move would be 325,000 and the average benefit &mdash; this is interesting &mdash; would be £169 per annum. I accept that if Deputy Noonan takes an extreme case he will get a figure close to the one he quoted, but the average benefit that would result from the Government spending £55 million would be £169. That bears out the point I made at the outset, that the real problem here is high interest rates.  The sooner we get those down the sooner the pressure on mortgage holders will be relieved.</P>
    <P>The cost of the tax reliefs in the budgets of 1988, 1989 and 1990 amounted to £553 million and the number benfiting was <Col N="1730" /> 830,000 people.  The average benefit to all taxpayers was £666.  While the average loss in mortgage interest by a reduction from 100 per cent to 80 per cent was £169 the average benefit on the tax reliefs given was £666.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This matter has been very fully debated and I listened with interest to the contributions made by all Deputies.  I should like to thank the Minister for a very full reply which ranged over various taxation themes far beyond the amendment. However, it is a good way to start as the sections dealing with income tax will be completed by 6 p.m. and I know that other Deputies will be anxious to discuss the amendments tabled in their names.</P>
      <P>I will start by dealing with one of the Minister's comments which was inspired by Deputy Garland.  One of the difficulties for Opposition Deputies in amending the Finance Bill is that we can show tax reductions but, if we attempt to propose an amendment which shows a tax increase, it is ruled out of order. Therefore, we cannot show, by way of amendment, how we cost our proposals which tends to place us in a false position. Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte was ruled out of order for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the constitutional position of the Minister for Finance; only he can bring proposals before this House to raise taxes.  However, any Deputy can bring proposals before this House to reduce <Col N="1731" /> taxes.  As I always understood the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle in regard to this matter, we may propose amendments which impose a charge on the Exchequer but not on the public but if we try to impose an amendment which costs any taxpayer an extra £1 it is ruled out of order.  Therefore, Deputy Rabbitte's proposal to reduce the relief to the standard rate of tax would cost several pounds to taxpayers who are already getting relief at the high rate and was ruled out of order.  However, it means that we cannot show how our proposal will be costed.</P>
    <P>I started a very strong public campaign on this matter several months ago and at least we have the satisfaction of knowing that the Department of Finance &mdash; which Deputy McCreevy described as the permanent Government &mdash; did not succeed in getting through the proposals in Cabinet to further reduce relief despite the fact that they had allies in the Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the debate has widened because, when we talk about the disincentives in the taxation system, it has been fashionable over the last couple of years to think that disincentives are simply represented in terms of the rate at which one pays tax.  The tax system is complicated and quite intelligent, numerate people do not understand the basis of their PAYE assessments.  They are particularly confused by the table allowances and because there is a note on the bottom to the effect that tax will be deducted at the rate of 56 per cent there is a belief that they are paying 56 per cent on every pound they earn.  They do not realise that the table allowance compensates them for moving from the standard rate to a higher one.</P>
    <P>Political debate has always focused on the rate and that has been stimulated by the Progressive Democrats for electoral purposes.  However, the incentive is not at the rate one pays, it is at the bottom line.  A man or woman coming out of a plant on a Friday evening is anxious to know how much money they are taking <Col N="1732" /> home and what deductions have been made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is in order to refer to the input of the Progressive Democrats to the tax debate. However, their ideas border on unreality. I was very interested in the Minister's remarks about tax credits.  It is an enormously complex change and it is not possible to move from allowance towards a tax credit.  The old argument in relation to the former child allowance was that if you brought it back at £100 per child it meant that the child of the high taxpayer <Col N="1733" /> was valued at £53 and that the child of the standard rate taxpayer was valued at £30.  It is very hard to support that kind of system and if such a resource was available it would be better to give it through child benefit and pay it to the mother.  Of course that creates poverty trap disincentives because it applies across the board and unemployed people would be getting the allowance under the child dependant allowance in the social welfare code and in the post office book. That creates great difficulties and we had a debate about poverty traps previously.</P>
      <P>Theoretically there is a great merit in moving from allowances to tax credits but I appreciate the complexities and I do not believe it is feasible to attempt to apply certain reliefs as credits and others as allowances.  I do not believe it is impossible &mdash; or too complicated &mdash; to move everything to a tax credit basis.</P>
      <P>I also appreciate that if you do a direct conversion many people who are now paying at the standard rate will move to the high rate but nobody is talking about direct conversion.  We are saying that a certain amount of tax is foregone to the Exchequer in terms of allowances; if you take that in total and pitch your credit to use it all so that the revenue position remains neutral after the changes have been made it is a more progressive tax code if the reliefs in terms of credits are worth the same to everybody.  We would have to ensure that the high taxpayer would not get more than the lower taxpayer for every £100 allowance.  It is very difficult to justify circumstances in which a £100 allowance is worth £30 to one householder and £53 to another.  I appreciate the complexity and I agree with the Minister that a partial change to tax credits is not feasible.  However, I again ask him to look at the overall picture to see if a total change to tax credits would be feasible, not on the direct conversion basis to which he referred here &mdash; which would result in impossible consequences &mdash; but by doing the sum on the lines I suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to mortgage interest relief, I presume the Minister's estimate of £55 million is the gross cost.  The rule of <Col N="1734" /> thumb in regard to giving back money to income taxpayers always specified about one-third; indeed, some of the reliefs were as high as 40 per cent.  I do not know what calculation the Minister is making of that at present but the net cost of that £55 million is certainly £20 million lower than shown.  Therefore, the Minister is looking at approximately £35 million or £36 million.  The Minister's experts will give him an accurate figure; they have rule-of-thumb figures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are moving along now; we are getting there. There is a major buoyancy effect and the net cost is about £35 million.  I recall the Minister making a speech about Disneyland schemes in the middle of last summer.  God knows we warned him sufficiently often here on the Order of Business about the tax foregone on the business expansion scheme which went totally off the rails.  I asked him on the Order of Business whether he would introduce legislation and not await the Finance Bill.  The tax foregone on the business expansion scheme must have amounted to £50 million to £60 million this year; at least that was the expectation. I know many schemes were not taken up.  I do not know what would be the breakdown of that figure, but there <Col N="1735" /> is an enormous amount of tax foregone by way of abuse of that scheme.  I might tell the Minister and Deputy Garland that there is no reluctance to advance proposals on where the money might come from.  It seems to me that if it amounts to a choice between giving somebody relief to purchase or hold on to their home when the mortgage repayments rise, when the shoe begins to pinch, and some of the crazy outer space suggestions within the ambit of the business expansion scheme, then I go for the mortgage interest relief.</P>
      <P>I will be making other suggestions as we go through this Bill but it is not in order to table them by way of amendment because, as soon as we table any amendment which would impose an extra penny tax on any member of the public, it is ruled out of order because only the Minister for Finance has the constitutional right to raise taxes.  That is the difficulty we experience but we are bona fide in our discussions.  I know the Minister will adhere to his budgetary figures but the issue is an important one.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister gave the House a lot of information about tax credits because they need to be examined.  I might reiterate that the other issue warranting examination is the merit of or justification for allowances.  To read the comments of some fashionable commentators one would think that people who advocate allowances are advancing some kind of arcane, out-of-fashion religious theory.  The case against the allowances has never been made while that for low marginal tax rates has been made.  The Minister has been able to reduce the income tax bands over the last couple of years, but to a large extent that has been achieved because there was a buoyancy in revenue.  At the Cabinet discussions on the budget, when the Minister decided to reduce the standard rate of income tax to 30 per cent, when he was ascertaining a way of funding that reduction, there was a certain amount of buoyancy obtaining, which was increased by not indexing the allowances.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister widened the bands but did not index the allowances.  The normal expectation would be that allowances would be increased by, say, 4 per cent or 5 per cent last year in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>We are proceeding from circumstances in which the general public feel the bite of taxation but do not understand the intricacies of the system.  It is very easy for the Revenue to set various snares to catch more tax.  One of the snares which will always catch more tax is not indexing allowances in line with inflation.  That was not done at all.  Therefore some of the leeway the Minister got to reduce the bands was got in that way.  Secondly, the Minister got it by reducing the relief applicable to life assurance premiums which has been cut dramatically.  It appears to me that the present thinking within the Department of Finance is to systematically rundown the allowances, either by holding them or not increasing them in line with inflation on the personal side and systematically removing others.</P>
      <P>We should open up that debate.  I am not sold on the idea.  For example, if the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation were so great why did no political party get up and say: we will implement the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation?  It is like a lot of these commissions, people who have never read their reports go around saying: all we have to do is implement the recommendations of the commission. When I was in the Department of Justice I set up the Whitaker commission.  I hear people on all sides of the House now talking about implementation of the recommendations of the Whitaker commission. I am sure many of those people contending they should be implemented have never read those recommendations because, had they done so, they would not be calling so loudly for their implementation.  There is a touch of that about the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation also.</P>

I am also concerned that we endeavour to broaden the tax base as much as possible in so far as we have any form of income taxation of individuals at all, which is not the policy of the Green Party.  It is too broad a subject to go into now.  I referred to it on Second Stage.  We are stuck with our present income tax system.  Therefore it is a question of how best we can deal with it in terms of collecting sufficient revenue to pay our expenditure while ensuring reasonable equity between different categories of taxpayers.  I contend the balance of advantage lies with my amendment. Consequently, I will not be withdrawing it.</P>

      <P>As has been said, Opposition Deputies are very severely restricted in the nature of the amendments they can table to this Bill.  It is high time that was changed, that more freedom was afforded Opposition Deputies to table whatever amendments they consider appropriate, whether or not they increase taxation, if we are to have a balanced approach to a Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill.  By reason of those restraints we are not in a position here to rewrite the budget.  Consequently the criticism that we are not saying where the other funds would come from to make up the shortfall of £55 million is levelled at us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have to say that a Labour Party budget, taken as a whole &mdash; as I am sure would apply to a budget of The Workers' Party &mdash; would have a totally different thrust, totally different objectives, totally <Col N="1738" /> different tax provisions from that brought forward by the present Minister for Finance. I do not believe that a budget introduced by a Fine Gael Minister for Finance would be all that much different from that of the present Minister; perhaps the dressing up might be somewhat different, the trimmings, a bit here or a bit there, but there is no material different in fiscal policy between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael; their economic objectives would be fairly similar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will look at his party's amendments he will see there is no dramatic difference in them, that in fact many are contrived differences.  I contend there would be no great difference in the thrust of policy between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  I have tried to figure out what a Green Party budget might be like but have to admit that I gave up on that one as I could not even begin to think what their budget would be like.  The Minister has asked that if we were to find the £55 million required what would the thrust of our provisions be if this matter was to be dealt with.  The amounts raised by way of capital taxation have been reduced during the years and will be reduced further as a result of the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister is increasing the CAT allowances and reducing the charges on capital gains tax. Those are the provisions I am talking about.  The amount being brought in, in relative terms, in capital taxation is derisory compared to the figure of ten years ago.  When the old estate duty system was abolished we were told that this matter would be dealt with more sensibly and progressively under the CAT system. However the amounts being brought in under that system cannot be compared with the amounts brought in under the old estate duty system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept there are differences in the Minister's and his party's concepts and political objectives and those of the <Col N="1739" /> Labour Party but we believe more substantial amounts should be brought in to the Exchequer in capital taxation, corporate taxation and farmer taxation.  If one adds up the cost of the major manufacturing reliefs, Shannon relief, urban renewal relief and pension scheme relief and so on to the Exchequer, the amount we are talking about here is pretty insignificant. The Government support all these measures.  They also support big businessmen and the wealthy, and the thrust of their taxation policy is directed towards helping that end of the scale and not the lower end.  A careful analysis of the figures bears this out.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the average benefit which would accrue if this amendment were to be accepted would not be enormous, about £170 per year.  I have no reason to dispute this figure.  It would not solve anybody's problems but nonetheless it would be some help.  It would also be a recognition of the difficulties experienced by so many families in meeting their mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>I also accept the Minister's point that this major problem arises out of the extraordinarily and unwarranted high level of interest rates.  There have been four increases in interest rates during the past year alone.  I do not know whether he is disclaiming or accepting responsibility for this but he appears to be wavering a little.  I say he carries direct reponsibility. This position suits his economic and fiscal policy.  I would further say that the interest rate, when compared with the rate of inflation, is totally unwarranted. The inflation rate, which at present stands at 3 per cent, has come down while interest rates have gone up.  This is unacceptable. In the normal course they would run in tandem in that when inflation rates come down interest rates should also come down and <i>vice versa.</i> Under the present administration the two have parted company.  At present the inflation rate stands at about 3 per cent while interest rates are running at between 11 per cent and 13 per cent plus. The differential therefore is either 8 per cent or 9 per cent and a person with <Col N="1740" /> money can get a rate of return of 8 per cent or 9 per cent over and above the rate of inflation.  Such a differential is unwarranted and unnecessarily high.  It may have resulted in large amounts of hot money being brought into the country but quite frankly the country gains very little overall, in that interest is paid at unnecessarily high rates with no tax being paid on it by the owners of the hot money who pass it in and move it around when it suits them.</P>
    <P>House purchasers making high mortgage repayments will only benefit if interest rates come down.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise that the real interest rate is unacceptably high, that he should take some steps to reduce it and give some relief.  Perhaps there would then be some merit in his argument that it is not necessary to restore 100 per cent mortgage interest relief.  There is no point saying that, on the one hand, that he does not accept responsibility for the increases and that the differential between interest rates and the rate of inflation is acceptable while at the same time saying that he is going to allow the present limit of 80 per cent to remain.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I am beginning to panic at this stage.  Having regard to the time limit on dealing with this section I think we are going to run out of time.  I think the point has been adequately dealt with, that it is unfair of the Minister to suggest we are seeking reliefs in certain areas without stating how these will be paid for.  It has been adequately explained in the context of the difficulties being experienced with the rules of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor made the point that the Minister has completely washed his hands of the responsibility for the increases in interest rates.  I recall that on the first day this Dáil adjourned the Taoiseach in an exchange with the leader of The Workers' Party pointed out that the favourable circumstances obtaining at the time of the election in June 1989 &mdash; there have been four increases since &mdash; were brought about by careful and prudent housekeeping on the part of the Government, <Col N="1741" /> and anticipated that if things were to go wrong the leader of The Workers' Party would castigate him for this a year later. That is what has happened.  Therefore the Minister must accept some responsibility.</P>
    <P>The point that has to be made on this amendment is that thousands of people are hurting as a result of the four increases in interest rates since the Government came to power.  The sum of £169 may not seem to be a great deal of money &mdash; this figure is distorted for the simple reason we are taking an average figure &mdash; but to some people 100 per cent relief on mortgage interest would make a difference and allow them avail of some of the essentials of life while at the same time repaying the building society to keep a roof over their heads.  It is very sad in modern day Ireland to come across people, whose dream was to own their own house, who made certain calculations, and who were told the indicators were coming right, but who now find themselves having to scrounge and save and cheat on their children because they have to find between £100 and £120 per month extra to meet their mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>In the unlikely event that there would be a Labour Party/The Workers' Party Government this century I hope the Minister's officials using their marvellous brains, expertise and ingenuity, would equally diligently apply themselves to framing the kind of Finance Bill we would bring in.  I am sorry they did not use the formula to work out what the figures would be at the standard rate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan very effectively dealt with the question of where the money would come from and instanced the tax foregone under the BES scheme.  It boils down to a question of choice.  It is very interesting that the BES discriminates yet again against the PAYE taxpayer.  The people who have money to invest in BES schemes are predominantly self-employed.  There is no ruse open to the PAYE workers to minimise their tax liability.  This is a very good example of where tax can be foregone for a section of society that least needs it and it is impossible, according to the Minister, to provide it for people who really do need it.</P>
      <P>I do not want anybody to detect a cosmic political shift in this statement, but I agree with much of what Deputy McCreevy had to say about hurtling down the hill after the Progressive Democrat hare that they have set to run on changing the minimum standard of tax.  Before the Progressive Democrats were ever heard of, The Workers' Party published, and were particularly associated with publishing, a number of programmes on taxation. I do not accept that the total tax burden in this economy is necessarily too high.  What is too high is the PAYE share of that tax burden.  By comparison with any developed economy in the OECD, taxation generally is not necessarily too high here.  The Minister said that the PAYE share was 88.1 per cent.  That is true, but I do not accept the breakdown given by the Minister or that the average figures advanced by the Minister prove that the PAYE sector are not being penalised disproportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The self-employed and farmers and so on are largely wealth owning sections of our society unlike the PAYE people who have absolutely nothing but their earned income.  I do not think it can be claimed that the average contribution from farmers of £714 as compared with £3,080 from the PAYE sector is a fair breakdown.  I cannot believe people who, by historical accident, are sitting on valuable assets should be paying an average of just £714.  One thing which has remained constant from the time of the Fir Bolg to <Col N="1743" /> the Progressive Democrats is the attitude of farmers to taxation and it is their aim to minimise their liability for taxation. We are not comparing like with like.  The share of the burden borne by the PAYE sector is still disproportionate.</P>
    <P>This amendment was merely to try to get some relief for the PAYE people who are hit for everything and are bearing the lion's share of taxation.  This would have given them some relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is aimed at restoring mortgage interest relief which has been reduced by the Government over the last couple of years.  One reason for doing this is that Government expenditure on housing which is highly inefficient needs close scrutiny.  The effect of high mortgage interest rates and the added impact of reducing mortgage interest relief is to push more and more people on to the housing waiting lists of local authorities and this is leading to a crisis.  In case the Minister for Finance does not know, the average weekly Exchequer subvention per local authority dwelling has been as high as £90 a week in the past number of years; I believe it is somewhere around £70 at the moment &mdash; the Minister might like to confirm what is the weekly Exchequer subvention per local authority dwelling for this year &mdash; yet no tenant is getting anything like the benefit of £70, £75 or £80 a week.  We would be better off making a gift of the houses or the dwellings to local authority tenants and giving them £40 a week to spend on them. This way we would save Exchequer money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the sort of fiasco that the Department of Finance have been presiding over for the last several years.  Is this because it has not been pointed out to them?  Why is this policy being continued? When the report of the Commission on Taxation was made and when the planning report was submitted by the three wise men to the Government of which I was a member, in which they advocated the abolition of mortgage interest relief, they were cross-examined <Col N="1744" /> by members of the then Government, including me.  It was manifestly clear that these so called experts had not a clue what the net effects of the proposals they were making would be.  They had not a clue what it would cost, how the local authority housing market worked, how people were taken out of the local authority housing market or pushed into it. One thing is clear.  By reducing mortgage interest relief over the past number of years the Government have succeeded in pushing more people back into the local authority waiting list and they have trapped more and more local authority tenants in their existing houses who would otherwise have been able to buy houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to consider this amendment very carefully.  He mentioned a gross figure of £55 million as the cost of restoring the old concessions.  We are not asking that he bring in some great new concession, just that he restore concessions that he and his Government have taken away.  He cites a gross cost of £55 million and that is to be reduced by whatever the buoyancy effect is.  An estimate has been given here that the buoyancy effect is £20 million which will give a net cost of £35 million.  I believe that buoyancy figure is too low but we will accept that figure for the sake of this discussion.  The tax revenue effect of this proposal would be £35 million.  Unfortunately that is the way the Department of Finance look at things.  As somebody said the Department of Finance is a much maligned Department but not without reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is not allowed by the Department of Finance to approve inner city housing projects because the housing unit cost is twice at the outer city housing unit cost. What the Department of Finance do not take into account is the other costs that arise in the outer city that do not arise in the inner city, like the fact that extra health centres, Garda stations, water services, schools, etc., have to be built.  They do not take the total cost into account, nor does the Minister in approaching this amendment.</P>
    <P>To go back to the nett figure of £35 <Col N="1745" /> million if this concession is granted, by how much should this be reduced if, as a result, 2,000 local authority houses can be thrown up?  I would ask the Minister, between now and Report Stage, to take a comprehensive view of the housing market and the ultimate effect of existing housing policy on the Exchequer, and not just to look at it within the narrow confines of tax revenue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister that between now and Report Stage he take a broader view of the housing market and the ultimate effect of existing housing policy on the Exchequer and not to confine himself to the narrow parameters of tax revenue. Indeed, I will go further.  The subsidy on local authority housing is extraordinarily high and it averages out at something in the region of £70 to £80 per dwelling per week &mdash; this includes one room dwellings, one bedroom, two bedroom, three bedroom or four bedroom dwellings.  The present policy of building large local authority housing estates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor is absolutely right, there are very few being built at present but they have been built. The policy of solving our housing problems in that way concentrates a great deal of unemployment and a great many social problems in the same place.  This is not the sum total of the problems but there is a very severe compound effect on the community.  Deputies Taylor, Rabbitte and Lawlor like myself understand this because we represent these areas in the outer city.  We have created, at enormous cost, very grave social problems and we do not seem to have learned from experience.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the amendment before us, if looked at narrowly, can be said to cost £35 million, but if we look at the matter sensibly, we will see that in reality it will cost much less; it could even be contended that it would save us money.  In that context, I ask the Minister to look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> Deputy Noonan's amendment has the support of all the parties on this side of the House, including the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Green Party, and I ask the Minister to consider it in the light that it should be supported by his side as well.</P>

      <P>I will respond briefly to the points made.  Deputy Mitchell's points on what we should be doing with regard to housing are more applicable to a debate on an Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  He tied this point in with mortgage interest relief, he accused the Department of Finance of having a heavy hand and said that when he was in Government he had been advocating this, and if the Government of which he was a member were unable to have their own policies implemented, I do not think he should complain to us about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy please let me finish?  The Government have taken the first positive step in relation to this in that my colleague, Deputy Flynn, has allowed local authorities to sell off local authority housing and to keep the receipts for repairs and renewals, which one can only describe as a very positive step.  As different parties we are entitled to have different views in Government.  I take a totally different view on the Opposition's policy while in Government to give people a £5,000 grant to move out of local authority houses into the private sector houses. The better off people, the leaders of their communities, left and I believe that when the best people left there were major problems.  When we came into Government we took a different view.  In Government you are entitled to take your own view, to stand over your own policies and to take responsibility for them. Deputy Taylor asked why the Minister for Finance does not accept his responsibilities in relation to interest rates.  In reply I must say that I do not have a <Col N="1747" /> statutory responsibility for interest rates but I fully accept responsibility for Government policy to create an environment that will bring down interest rates.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand how Deputies can make the case that we set interest rates.  Do Deputies Mitchell, Noonan or any other Deputy believe that interest rates will remain static, because that is the basis of their arguments.

      <P>That is not the solution either.  First, how we manage our affairs will have an impact on interest rates.  Second, the question of what the instrument of interest rates is now used for is different from long ago in that, as Deputy Taylor quite rightly said, low inflation brough low interest rates.  This was the case ten, 15 or 20 years ago when everybody believed that but now we are told that interest rates have a different use altogether and that the rate is used by central banks to stop the flow of capital leaving one country and flowing into another.  What happened in Ireland in the latter part of 1988 was that capital moved out of the country and that is why the Central Bank took the decision to increase interest rates.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is entitled to his own view as to whether we should be in the EMS.  He may be making the point to leave the EMS but I do not think that is his party's view.</P>
      <P>As to what will happen to interest rates in the future, it must be said first that we do not and cannot control international events.  They change every day.  For example, three weeks ago the yen was weakening and it went down by 20 per cent, but in the past few days it has gone up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are different forecasts of what will happen in the EMS as a result of the unification of the monetary system of the two Germanys.  The Deputy can have his view and I have mine, and over the past three or four months I have consistently stuck to my view as to what will happen to interest rates, and so far I happen to have been right although I could have been wrong.  I believed we would see money flowing into the country and this has continued since March and as a result we are now in a much stronger position. You can see from looking at the money market that the rate was hovering around 12 per cent, a very precarious point a couple of months ago but during the last couple of days the short-term rate was down to 11.38 per cent, and that has taken off the pressure.  If we get it down to 11 per cent and it stays there for four of the five days in a week it will trigger off a reduction in interest rates.  We are now in a much stronger position than we were but the events that triggered the rise in interest rates were outside our control. As I have said, we are doing our best by pursuing the right policy.  There is confidence in the market and the money is coming back into the country.  As I said four months ago, by the second half of the <Col N="1749" /> year the pressure will be easing; however things can happen to change that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat, the cost of the restoration of mortgage interest relief to 100 per cent on £4,000 would be £55 million and it would benefit 325,000 people with an average benefit of £169 per annum.  Deputy Rabbitte quite rightly made the point that £169 might not seem a lot to some of us but to people in Tallaght or elsewhere struggling to meet their mortgage repayments, it would mean an extra £3 a week.  Just as Deputies have asked me to look at the totality of the argument, I have to look at the totality of income in the household and ask what action was taken in the budget to help people make up the loss of £3 per week.  The VAT reduction from 25 per cent to 23 per cent affects household goods of all descriptions.  Do not let anyone try to suggest to me that that is not a benefit to those households, of course it is.  We have also reduced the personal tax rates, and that is of benefit. We have widened the tax bands to make sure that people would not be worse off because of the width of the bands, and at the same time we reduced the standard and the high rates of tax, and of course this was of benefit.  When Deputies ask about the totality of the argument, I reply that they should look at the totality of the household budget and see what that household budget is at the end of the day. That is the basic argument.  What the Deputies want to continue to ignore is that the major problem for the people for whom they make a case in here, and rightly so &mdash; I have sympathy with them &mdash; is that the interest rates increased four <Col N="1750" /> times last year.  The real pressure on those households that are in trouble comes from the increase in interest rates and not from the 20 per cent reduction in mortgage interest relief.  As I have said, even if I was to restore that relief, it would only benefit people by on average about £169.  I suggest as I suggested at the start, that the solution to that problem is to continue with the right Government policies to lower interest rates.  That would be the basis of relief for those people.  I do not think anybody should be as irresponsible as to try to convince people, as has happened in the last three or four months, that interest rates when they come down, will stay down and interest rates when they go up will stay up.  That is not the reality of the world we live in.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy made a strong case similar to the point made by Deputy Taylor about the level of real interest rates and how it has changed.  Deputy McCreevy said that the way to solve that problem is through competition in the banks, and he wondered when we might see the day when there would be open competition in this country in relation to banks.  I would say to him and to the House that with the Single Market in 1992 there will be free movement of capital, goods, people and services throughout the 12 member states.  After 1992 if a bank gets a licence from the Central Bank they will have the freedom to set up business in any of the other 11 member states without having to get clearance from that country.  If a bank in Germany or Italy wants to set up in Ireland or <i>vice versa,</i> as long as they get clearance in their own country under their own regulatory powers they can set up here.  Let us hope that competition will improve the position but, as I have said, the real answer is to reduce interest rates and promote the policies that will reduce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been accused of repetition but I want to refer again to the benefit from the full restoration of the mortgage interest relief.  The total relief given in taxes over the last three budgets was on average £666 per person, and one can <Col N="1751" /> argue that individual cases would benefit to a greater or lesser degree, but the average benefit of the restoration of the mortgage interest relief would be £169.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question raised by Deputy Rabbitte on the standard rate of tax, the restriction to the standard rate could have a substantial impact on taxpayers on the higher rates of tax not because they are highly paid but because the standard band is not wide enough. This would of course be particularly true of single and widowed taxpayers but it would also apply to young married couples in the early stages of a mortgage. In other words the taxpayer group that would be affected most by applying a standard rate band would be the people in the middle income group, those on the 48 per cent band.</P>
    <P>We have gone into this matter in detail and have argued the pros and cons.  I do not expect people on all sides of the House to agree with my policy or my philosophy.  Deputy Taylor has said that my budgets are no different from any other budget from whatever Government but I would like to think they are different. I would like to think that I am pursuing a philosophy of trying to give relief to the low paid people who have been hardest hit and to restore an incentive to work, recognising that I cannot do it all on the first day.  We have made very significant progress in the last couple of budgets.  I took the first step in 20 years to reduce the standard rate of tax from 35 to 32 per cent and also reduced the higher rate.  That is the road forward and I will not be deflected away from it or enticed by wild schemes suggested by people from either inside or outside the House who do not face up to the responsibility of where we will get the money. Even if it was available to me and if all the economic ills in relation to this economy were over, I would not pursue the Nigel Lawson route of causing major problems to the economy.  That is the way I see the position and that is the way I will continue to approach it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has <Col N="1752" /> obscured more than he has clarified and he is deceiving only himself.  Firstly, he uses an average figure of £169 per year as the benefit of this proposal.  You can obscure a lot by averages.  We all know that many people with mortgages for 20 or 25 years are not affected by the crippling mortgage rates because their payments are very small, but it is those who bought houses in the last five or ten years who are really crippled with payments.  If we ask the Minister to give an average benefit for people who bought houses in the last five years what would it be?  The Minister went on to make an outrageous claim, that the real cause of the pain for those on mortgages is not the fact that he has reduced mortgage interest relief by 20 per cent but that interest rates went up by 4 per cent.</P>

The Minister has argued that the problem is not the level of mortgage interest relief but the fact that interest rates have risen four times in the past 12 months.  He goes on to put the responsibility for rising interest rates, first on the Central Bank and secondly on the fact that the level of interest rates now is not so much inflation-related as an instrument of policy to prevent flows of money from one economy to another.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Central Bank have addressed this in the monetary statement at the beginning of the year and they argued that the 4 per cent differential would have to remain for the reasons I enumerated this morning. That brings it back to the Minister's area of responsibility.  As he said, the Government have responsibility for providing the environment which would allow the bank to make decisions to reduce interest rates and part of that environment is the overall level of the debt, the medium-term target which the Minister has set <Col N="1754" /> and which the Central Bank regard as the minimum acceptable target.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No, we want to make it harder and we are prepared to debate the matter.  There is no suggestion that the money we are talking about here does not have to be recovered elsewhere.  All of us have been around long enough to know what the wild promises of public expenditure and the wild promises of concessions lead to.  It seems the Minister has a responsibility to address his overall targets to see if he can put the Central Bank in a position to cut the differential between German rates and Irish rates, because that is the key factor.  I know the Minister has no control over the course of international interest rates &mdash; they will rise and fall &mdash; but he has control over domestic policy which brings about a situation in which the Governor of the Central Bank says emphatically that he cannot reduce the differential between our rates and the German rates because of the policies the Minister is following.</P>

Soláthar airgid de £200,000 atá ar fáil i Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta i mbliana chun freastal go príomha ar bhóithre áise agus portaigh sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cúram bhóithre na Gaillimhe ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, ach an cheist a chuir mé ná, toisc go bhfuil drochstaid ar na bóithre sa Ghaeltacht, agus go bhfuil a fhios ag an Taoiseach, agus go háirithe ag an Aire Stáit agus an Roinn Comhshaoil go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh, an bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire Stáit aon airgead breise a chur ar fáil i mbliana?  Nó an bhfuil aon scéim, mar shampla, curtha ar aghaidh aige chuig an Eoraip faoi na Cistí Struchtúrtha chun cabhair a thabhairt do mhuintir Chonamara?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Go bunúsach, níl aon airgead breise ag mo Roinnse.  Bhí dhá chéad míle ag mo Roinn anuraidh agus tá an tsuim chéanna againn i mbliana. Caitear an chuid is mó den airgead sin ar na bóithre áise agus na bóithre portaigh. Scríobh mé chuig an Aire Comhshaoil tamall ó shin, os rud é go bhfuil cúram bóithre na Gaeltachta orm &mdash; níl freagracht na mbóithre contae nó na mbóithre réigiúnacha orm, áfach &mdash; faoi cheist seo na mbóithre agus chuir sé in iúl dom go bhfuil £63 mhilliún le caitheamh i mbliana ar bhóithre réigiúnacha agus ar bhóithre chontae i gcomparáid le £47.4 mhilliún a bhí ar fáil anuraidh, agus £33.4 mhilliún i 1988.  Is ardú suntasach é sin i gcomparáid leis an méid a bhí le fáil ón Chomhrialtas idir 1982 agus 1987.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh airgead ar fáil le haghaidh na mbóithre portaigh agus na mbóithre áise.  Níl airgead le fáil ó rannóg Stáit ar bith eile.  Anuraidh caitheadh cuid den airgead seo ar bhóithre na Gaeltachta i gContae na Gaillimhe, ach bhí ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe 50 faoin gcéad den mheastachán a chur ar fáil.  Sin an méid gur féidir linn a dhéanamh.</P>

Má tá forbairt thionsclaíoch le déanamh sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus na daoine a choinneáil ansin agus an teanga a choinneáil beo, tá géarghá le bóithre cearta isteach le forbairt na turasóireachta agus forbairt na tionsclaíochta.

      <P>Ba mhaith liom aird an Teachta a dhíriú ar an bhfreagra a thug mé ar Cheist Dála ón Teachta M. D. Higgins ar 2 Bealtaine 1990 (colúin 381-384 de na Díospóireachtaí Dála don lá sin) maidir le staid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>An cheist a ndearna an tAire Stáit tagairt dó ón Teachta Higgins, sílim go raibh baint aige le leabhair éigin a cuireadh i gcló ar na mallaibh maidir leis an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Bhí mé ag déanamh tagartha speisialta don méid a bhí le rá ag Cathaoirleach úr nua-cheaptha Bhord na Gaeilge, agus ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis ar a cheapachán agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geall leis, anois go bhfuil cathaoirleach ar an bord taréis dhá bhliain.  Ach dúirt sé ina chéad phreasagallamh, nó a chéad phreasócáid, go bhfuil staid éigeandála Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Aire Stáit dul i dteagmháil leis an chathaoirleach agus leis an bhord chun é seo a phlé.  Uimhir a dó, an bhfuil sé ar intinn breis foirne a chur an fáil don bhord as an obair atá said chun déanamh maidir le staid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht?</P>

      <P>Chuala mé an méid a bhí le rá ag Cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge, ach ní dóigh liom gur féidir a rá go raibh sé gan dóchas nuair a labhair sé tar éis a cheaptha.  Tá iarrachtaí á ndéanamh ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú sa Ghaeltacht agus beidh mé ag castáil, ní amháin le cathaoirleach an bhoird, ach leis an bhord ina iomlán chomh luath agus is féidir.  Ba mhaith liom a rá, áfach, i mbliana, nuair a bhí go leor gearrtha síos i rannóga éagsúla, go raibh Roinn na Gaeltachta in ann ardú de 27 faoin gcéad a fháil, agus go bhfuil ardú suntasach faighte ag Bord na Gaeilge chomh maith.  Ceapaim go gcruthaíonn sé seo cé chomh dáiríre is atá an Rialtas faoi chúrsaí na Gaeilge.</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce an export subsidy on the sale of herring to South Africa in view of the current difficulties being faced by Irish Fish Exporters to mainland Europe.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the EC common organisation of the market regulations, provision is made for the possibility of granting export refunds for the sale of fishery products to third countries.  Such refunds may be considered in situations where the Community price is above the world market price.  If agreed at EC management committee level, the refunds will be paid, on application, to the exporter concerned to help him compete on the world market. No member states can unilaterally introduce such a refund system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the provision for the granting <Col N="1772" /> of export refunds still exists, no refund schemes have been in operation since November 1983.  My Department, my predecessors and I have constantly pressed the EC Commission for the introduction of an export refund for herring but this has met with opposition from the Commission itself and some member states.  The latest request was made at a Council working group on 27 April 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think he will have a positive response to his latest request?  The Irish exporters are facing difficulty in relation to the sale of herring to Germany because of the closeness of the Danish suppliers and they find it easier than we in Ireland. What response does the Minister expect to his latest request to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are hammering away on it.  I am fully aware of the situation in Germany.  I had a long discussion with the Minister for Fisheries from Germany, Mr. Von Gelderen, yesterday and continuing late last night and we discussed the problems.  The point about the Germans is that, while their federal fleet has been reduced considerably and consequently there has to be a considerable amount of importation even from outside the EC, the fleet in East Germany, or the German Federal Republic that was, is very large, almost double the western fleet and this will create problems. However, from my conversations yesterday with the Minister, I am convinced of the bona fides of the Federal Government and as a result of the meeting.  I am <Col N="1773" /> quite euphoric about the situation.  As the Deputy knows, this type of export refund was in operation for mackerel but as soon as the mackerel price in the Community approached the world price that was dropped.  As I said in my reply, it has not been in operation since 1983.</P>

      <P>The tonnage of the Irish fishing fleet is measured in accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Tonnage) Regulations, 1984 which distinguish between the length and type of vessel concerned.  These provisions are in line with internationally recognised and accepted conventions.</P>
      <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed by some Irish fishermen that the practices used in certain other member states may understate their tonnage <i>vis-à vis</i> Ireland and thus put Irish fishermen at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the matter under review to ensure that the system used here is consistent with the best interests of the Irish fishing industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister must appreciate that this is extremely unsatisfactory. It appears that other member states have a different method of measuring their gross registered tonnage which is to their great advantage.  In some cases they have up to 50 per cent of an advantage over their EC counterparts. What is the position about issuing sea fishing licences?  It is my understanding that those licences are not being issued because of the restrictions on the gross registered tonnage.  Tonnage is central to the issuing of licences and I should like to ask the Minister what action he is taking to correct this problem for the Irish fishing industry.</P>

      <P>I would like to repeat that we use an internationally recognised system.  Some countries, notably the Scottish authorities, were attempting to use a system which would give them an apparently lower tonnage than the generally recognised system of assessing tonnage. However, I am assured by my chief marine surveyor that the Scottish authorities have taken steps to rectify this anomaly and that we are not, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Scots who are under the UK flag, at any disadvantage.  Linking that matter with licensing, with respect to the Chair, is highly relevant.  There is a question about them on the Order Paper.  The Deputy should know that we are under strict instructions to reduce our tonnage year by year on the basis of 1984 which was a dubious basis to start with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I am sure the Minister recognises the difficulty that the 300 applicants for fishing licences are in.  Is the Minister aware of the discontent and anger among those involved in the fishing industry in relation to the imbalance that exists in regard to the gross registered tonnage?  I accept the position in regard to the Scots but the same could be said of the Dutch, the Danes and the French.  The Minister, as President of the EC Council of Ministers, must adopt a firm line on this issue or we will be left in a difficult position as far as the future of our fishing industry is concerned.  We must bear in mind that attempts are being made to introduce young people into the fishing industry.</P>

I should like to assure the Deputy, and the House, that there is no untoward delay in dealing with this matter.  We are confident about the method we have for assessing GRT as of now and that steps have been taken to remove any anomalies.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy into the House, as I have done privately, to the family of Leading Seaman Quinn on his tragic death.  I understand that a Naval inquiry into his death is continuing and, therefore, I would not like to comment further on the circumstances of his death.</P>
      <P>Regarding the comments made by the Cork county coroner on the adequacy of the helicopter search and rescue service, the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue Services have considered the various options for improving the air/sea rescue services and these options will be considered by the Government soon.  I do not wish to make any statement on the various options prior to their being considered by Government.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any official reports suggesting that the air/sea rescue role should be transferred from the Air Corps to commercial enterprise.  Suggestions have been made from time to time that current deployment by the Air Corps of Dauphin helicopters for search and rescue might be augmented by longer range helicopters provided on a contract basis by a private company.  The company referred to by one of the Deputies has, as was indicated in my reply of 23 May 1989 &mdash; volume 390, column 779, No. 72 of the Official Debate &mdash; made an unsolicited offer of such a service.

Is the <Col N="1777" /> Minister aware that the coroner's remarks were critical of the inadequacy of our rescue services?  This accident occurred only one mile off the Irish coast and the question arises as to why a helicopter from Shannon was not used.  That would have arrived at the scheme 20 minutes ahead of the RAF helicopter which travelled from Wales.  That amount of time is vital in any rescue operation, particularly when an accident occurs at sea.

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 9, 14 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the passenger vessel <i>St. Columba</i> is registered in the United Kingdom and as the fire on board the vessel on 31 January last occurred while she was outside Irish territorial waters my Department did not have the authority to carry out an investigation into the accident.  The marine accident investigation branch of the UK Department of Transport, being the responsible authority, have conducted an inquiry.  Sealink, the owners and operators of the vessel, are conducting their own independent inquiry and have already indicated that the report will be made available to my Department so that the benefit of any lessons learned could <Col N="1780" /> be passed on to Irish-registered passenger ferries.</P>
    <P>As the <i>Norrona</i> is registered in the Faroes, a Danish territory, and as the fire on board the vessel on 9 April last occurred while she was outside Irish territorial waters, my Department, as in the case of the <i>St. Columba</i> did not have the authority to carry out an investigation into the incident.  The responsible body in this case is the Danish Maritime Authority and they are conducting an investigation. The B &amp; I Line who were chartering the vessel at the time of the fire are conducting their own internal investigation and will make available to my Department the results of their inquiries.  Dyfed Powys police in Wales are conducting a criminal investigation as there are reasonable grounds for believing that arson was the cause of the fire.</P>
    <P>Lessons to be learned from the Danish and UK inquiries will be submitted to the International Maritime Organisation, which is the United Nations' specialised agency responsible for safety at sea, for detailed consideration.  Amendments to international safety conventions will be made, if necessary, in order to implement any recommendations relating to fire prevention, detection and extinction which that organisation may adopt.</P>
    <P>The on-board and shore response to both fires ensured that at no time were either of the vessels, or their passengers and crew, in great danger.</P>
    <P>A working group have recently been established by me to examine existing arrangements for dealing with marine fires to prepare a formal marine fire response plan and to identify the resources necessary to implement such a plan.  It is proposed to hold exercises at a later date to test this plan.  The working group comprise representatives from my Department, the Air Corps, the Department of the Environment, the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre and the Fire Services.</P>
    <P>In January of this year, and before the recent fires, the National Ferry Safety Committee, which are chaired by my Department, held a seminar for senior personnel of Irish-registered passenger <Col N="1781" /> vessels.  The seminar included a presentation and detailed discussion on fire prevention, detection and extinction which proved of benefit to participating personnel.  Further seminars are planned for the future.</P>
    <P>My Department were recently in communication with the owners of all passenger ferries operating out of Irish ports and the relevant port authorities stressing the need for constant vigilance in ensuring on-board and port security respectively, and requesting an urgent review of security arrangements.  All have responded positively to our request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he has set up this working group to investigate marine fires and to formulate a plan in relation to it.  Is information available to the Minister in relation to the <i>St. Columba</i> as to why two engines went on fire at the same time and why there were not fire proof protectors between the two engines to prevent that occurrence?  Is the Minister in a position to tell the House why &mdash; although the passengers were told that the fires were out at 3.30 p.m. &mdash; they were not taken in tow for another four hours?  What was the reason for this delay?  How close was the boat to capsizing? In regard to the <i>Norrona,</i> as the Minister is President of the EC Council of Fisheries Ministers, is he aware of any sanction operating at EC level?  While I appreciate the powers of the UN Convention surely there must be restrictions within the EC which can be put into operation in cases like this? Is the Minister in a position to elaborate on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31 January a fire broke out on the <i>St. Columba.</i> The ship left Dún Laoghaire at 8.30 a.m. and the fire broke out at 11.20 a.m.  As anybody who has travelled the route knows, it was then the responsibility of the United Kingdom which was quite close.  The reaction and the systems which went into operation were splendid and were carried out very effectively.  The emergency drill was put into operation immediately and, unlike what happened in another incident quite <Col N="1782" /> recently, the drill was known and immediately implemented.  When the ship's complement were fighting the fire additional firemen and equipment from Gwynedd were air-lifted on board.  The main fire was successfully extinguished at 12 noon but the machinery was damaged. This immobilised the ship and provision had to be made to have it towed, which caused the delay.  The fire was dealt with expeditiously, efficiently and without panic.  The ship had 199 passengers and crew aboard who all disembarked safely.</P>
      <P>With regard to the European Community question, the regulations in regard to safety are dealt with by the IMO of which we are a member and to which European countries subscribe. They observe the regulations of the IMO and contribute information to it which, if necessary, leads to any necessary amendments, improvements or reforms in the regulations.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister confirm that he received the report of the Sea Rescue Review Group on 13 February last?  Furthermore, can he explain why three months have elapsed without it being presented to Government?  In view of that delay and the overall urgency of the issue, can he be more precise in regard to when it will be presented to Government, giving some definition of the term &ldquo;soon&rdquo;; for example, will it be weeks, months or how long does he anticipate it will take before being presented to Government?</P>

      <P>In the context of accidents may I ask the Minister whether he, together with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will be launching a short campaign on safety measures at sea, particularly in view of the impending summer tourism season to ensure that life belts are not vandalised, that there is consideration and care given to seagoing craft of all descriptions in order to necessitate as few air/sea rescues as possible this summer in view of the serious consequences and tragic loss of life experienced in recent years?</P>

      <P>The conclusion of the rod licence dispute was widely communicated to the public here at home via all branches of the media some months ago and I have no plans for further publicity in that regard.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte have made the necessary arrangements quickly to inform foreign anglers through their normal channels abroad.  I understand that extensive campaigns were mounted by them in Britain, Germany, France, the Benelux countries, Scandinavia, Italy and the USA.</P>

      <P>One hundred and eleven fish kills were recorded by my Department in 1989, accounting for the death of in excess of 35,000 fish.  Estimates of the cost of restocking are not available.</P>
      <P>I am informed that legal proceedings were instituted in 27 cases.</P>
      <P>My Department have published a very informative report on fish kills in 1989 and I am arranging to let the Deputy have a copy.</P>
      <P>While the 1989 figures show an increase of 61 over 1988 this was largely accounted for by the exceptionally dry weather conditions obtaining during last year which gave rise to very low water levels throughout the summer period.  The total number of fish kills was down however on the 122 recorded in 1987.  A pleasing feature of the returns was that fish kills due to agricultural causes were well down over the 1987 figures &mdash; 26 as against 95.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to express my appreciation of the efforts of all those who in any way contributed to minimising the number of pollution incidents involving fish kills.

    <P>The Department of the Marine have been allocated £3 million, from the exceptional storm damage fund of £8 million, for its share of the cost of restoration works at commercial harbours, <Col N="1795" /> local authority piers and harbours and for other marine damage resulting from recent storms.

    <P>The cost of repairing storm damage to the Cork coastline has been estimated by my Department's engineers to be £1.5 million.  The amount of grant to be paid to Cork County Council will be settled when the council's response to my Department's request for applications for grant assistance is received.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of the average period taken to process an aquaculture licence application or obtain an aquaculture licence is not particularly meaningful given the variations in licence types and the nature of the legal process involved.  For example, technical assessment, consultation with relevant interests such as local authorities, local communities, fisheries boards and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the commissioning of environmental impact studies and assessment of those studies in the light of public comments thereon, all form part of the procedure.  This is a time consuming process with no guarantee as to outcome.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture licences, and foreshore licences issued in association with them are usually of ten years' duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says about caution because of the type of publicity that aquaculture has been getting in recent times, but hopefully the Marine Institute will resolve that.  Nevertheless, the Minister must be aware that in the aquaculture industry there is grave concern about the extensive delays in receiving these licences. Would the Minister not agree that because of cutbacks the Department of the Marine have run in an opposite direction to the one that was anticipated for the aquaculture industry when, according to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara plan, and the National Development Plan it was supposed to feature as an expansionist industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it forms a central and important part of the Bord Iascaigh Mhara plan.  What I do not accept is that there has been any change in the objectives or the targets in that plan, however ambitious they may have been.  There is a question later on on this matter.  I and my Department are committed to the development of aquaculture particularly in areas where no <Col N="1798" /> other industry is likely to set up, where there is no other source of employment, for example, in quite inaccessible areas, and where all environmental factors are taken into account and where the planning will carry obligations on the developers with regard to environmental protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which the former Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Mr. P. Gallagher gave to his question of 3 May 1988.  On that occasion the cost to the Exchequer of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited was given as £50 million. The cost has not changed.</P>
      <P>Provision was made for the recoupment to the Central Fund of £90.084 million from the Department of the Marine Vote during 1989 in respect of past expenditure from the fund under the Irish Shipping Limited Acts, 1947 to 1984, in connection with State guarantees given in respect of borrowings by Irish Shipping Limited.  The difference between this sum and the £50 million quoted as the cost of the liquidation arises from the repayment in full of lease payments on the <i>MV Irish Spruce.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the 15 year lease agreement, these payments fell due in the event of Irish Shipping Limited ceasing to trade.  Since 75 per cent of the lease costs would have been borne by the State in any event, only the 25 per cent which Irish Shipping Limited was to have repaid <Col N="1799" /> from its own resources is properly attributable to the cost of liquidation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, have any additional costs been incurred since 3 May 1988 which would add to the £50 million figure which was given then?  Second, how much of the cost related to compensating former employees of Irish Shipping Limited?  Third, when does the Minister intend ultimately to resolve the disgraceful neglect of the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited who, six years after the liquidation of the company have still not been paid their due redundancy payments and have not been fixed up with proper pension entitlements? When will that disgrace be finally resolved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the breakdown the Deputy is asking for However, I have in a note here a statement that is subsequent to the £50.6 million and it was anticipated there would be further cost associated with meeting guaranteed borrowings of £0.3 million. With regard to the liquidation of the company, I want to reiterate what I have said already; this party accept no responsibility whatsoever for the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  With regard to payments to the employees, they were paid the statutory redundancy amounts but they have applied for extra moneys and I know that as of now there are court proceedings in train which inhibit me from talking further about this matter.  I am not without appreciation of the service that those people gave to this State over a long number of years.</P>

      <P>The total cost to my Department arising from the rescue operation of the <i>Tribulus</i> is currently being assessed.  I intend to seek reimbursement from Shell Tankers (UK) Limited, the owners of the vessel, of the full cost to my Department of the incident.</P>
      <P>A diving survey of the damaged vessel revealed a hole measuring 21 metres long by 10 metres deep.  Steel girders were fabricated, lowered into the water and fixed vertically at the hole.  Steel plates were fabricated and put in place to patch up the hole.  All water was pumped from the hold of the vessel.  Additional strengthening was carried out inside the hold.  An inspection was carried out on Saturday, 5 May by a surveyor of my Department to ensure that vessel's safety and integrity.  The vessel departed Bantry Bay the next day and has now berthed in Rotterdam where it will be put into dry dock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied with the outcome of this incident.  The pollution operations group under my Department were successful in <Col N="1802" /> minimising the pollution threat and Shell Tankers (UK) Limited co-operated fully with my Department in discharging their responsibilities.</P>

They were very careful about the pollution aspect and about assuming responsibility in writing for any damage that might be done in the area.  I can tell the Deputy also that the company made arrangements to compensate local fishermen for any damage &mdash; there was not very much damage &mdash; through the very democratic and intelligent approach of having a local committee work in concert with the company.</P>

    <P>Yesterday afternoon, I issued instructions to the board of Aer Lingus: (i) to furnish to me immediately a detailed report on the measures which have been taken to improve the internal system of financial control within the Aer Lingus group; (ii) in particular, to satisfy me that there are now adequate controls in place to ensure that irregularities such as occurred in Aer Lingus Holidays Limited cannot be repeated anywhere in Aer Lingus or in any of its subsidiaries; (iii) to take disciplinary action, where appropriate, in the light of the Craig Gardner report and advise me in due course of the action taken; (iv) to take appropriate civil action, where necessary and let me know <Col N="1804" /> the outcome; and (v) to make arrangements for a phased and orderly withdrawal by Aer Lingus Holidays Limited from the tour operating business at the end of the current season.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is not possible to publish the Craig Gardner report or make any further comment on the matter.  I am advised that its publication or further comment could prejudice any legal action which might be necessary.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that on 3 May 1990 &mdash; column 692 of the Official Report &mdash; he informed the House that the Craig Gardner report should be formally presented to him within two weeks, that he was confident that it would indicate the exact ratio, if any, between fraud and anything else that took place and that he would make a full statement on the matter?  Would he further agree that what we are talking about here is fraud or attempted fraud on a massive scale?  Would he agree that an attempt was made to cover up this matter, led by himself when he told reporters only three weeks ago that this was a rumour and that his Department do not investigate rumours, despite the fact that he had been informed of it as early as 24 January, on his own admission, in this House?  Would the Minister now tell the House what has happened to our shareholding?  It is not the Minister's shareholding.  It is in his name because he is the Minister.</P>

      <Col N="1881" />&ldquo;1.&mdash;Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1987 and section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989 shall not have effect as respects the year 1990-91 and subsequent years of assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Before I reported progress I was urging the Minister to take whatever policy measures are necessary to reduce the differential between Irish interest rates and German interest rates.  I had only one final point to make and it arises from what Deputy McCreevy said this morning, something that has been reported by many commentators. I would like the Minister to tell us if it is true that the differential between deposit rates and lending rates in the Irish banking system is significantly wider than that which pertains in the United Kingdom and in continental Europe.  That has been said time and time again both in this House and outside it in the last 18 months or two years.  If that is so, it is one of the reasons interest rates are higher here than elsewhere, especially in Germany.  Should the banking system, either under stress of competition or through better management, be narrowing that margin to bring the practice into line with that in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Noonan has as good an idea as anybody else as to the differential in interest rates in this country and elsewhere, and the reasons for it.  The inflation rate in the UK is very high at 9.7 per cent while the Irish inflation rate is about 4 per cent.  Considering that one inflation rate is low and one is high, we are not comparing like with like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan is clearly aware of the reasons for the high interest rates.  As our reserves continue to improve &mdash; as <Col N="1882" /> they have done over the past couple of months &mdash; undoubtedly the Central Bank will take the first available opportunity to reduce interest rates on the basis that at present there is not turmoil in international exchange rates.  There is a downward trend in the United States, and let us hope that world interest rates continue in that direction.  Some members of the EC &mdash; such as France, Belgium and Denmark &mdash; have in recent times made slight reductions in their interest rates and I have no doubt that the Central Bank will take due cognisance of that.  It has already been reflected in the short-term reductions in the price of money on the market and no doubt the Central Bank will take the opportunity to reduce the rates at the most opportune moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 11, paragraph (a) (ii), line 22, to delete &ldquo;£6,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£10,000&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>We have just spent a long time dealing with the question of interest relief on mortgages in the context of a wide ranging debate on tax reform.  I submit that the subject matter of amendment No. 5 deals with tax reform at the other end of the spectrum.  In other words, we are dealing with the exemption limit that one is permitted before one is dragged into the tax net.  We are talking about tax reform in this context as an instrument of tackling poverty in our society.  I submit that it is not possible to talk about tax reform without dealing with the question of poverty and the fact that, ludicrous as it may sound, a great many people are caught in the tax net who are at or below the poverty line.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party amendment proposes roughly that one ought not to be liable for tax on an income just below £100 per week.  If Members think about that amendment they will agree that it makes eminent good sense.  It is inconceivable that people earning £100 per week or less should be liable for income tax and PRSI payments.  A fair amount of literature has been produced on this point.  I should like to refer to the recent ESRI report.  I do not know if that report was prepared for the Conference of Major Religious Superiors or delivered at a conference organised by them, but it made the point that between 11 and 18 per cent of our people living in poverty pay PAYE and PRSI, and more than half of those people are paying £20 per week income tax.  The report made the point that that amount was very significant relative to the total earnings of those people. That may not seem in absolute terms to be a large amount of money but in relative terms the earnings of people with a weekly pay of £100 or less, it is a significant amount of money.  The report estimated that between 56 and 66 per cent of those living in poverty and paying tax would be lifted out of the tax net if the measure we have suggested applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure generally accepted as being the cut off point for low pay &mdash; it emerged in consensus discussions on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; is that any person on £140 per week or less is in the low paid category.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the average industrial wage is £220 per week.  What I am proposing may <Col N="1887" /> seem at a glance to be a signficant shift from what the Minister is proposing but in the context of the average industrial wage being £220 per week, and the low pay net being £140 per week, any person on £100 per week or less ought not be paying tax.  That is reasonable.  How could one possibly consider raising a family on an income less than that?</P>
    <P>Members will recall the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Their updated figure would be £68 per week as the absolute subsistence minimum.  If one takes that figure and reconciles it for a person who went back into the workforce and was subject to PAYE and PRSI, anything less than £100 per week being free of tax would not constitute an incentive to work.  I do not wish to go over the debate we had this morning but it must be said that I would like to be dealing with this phenomenon by way of tax credits rather than allowances. However, the rules of the House constrain us in what we can do in regard to that debate.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there has not been any refutation of the argument that tax credits are more equitable.  Basically, the same amount of money is allowed to everybody, irrespective of whether a person is on the 53 per cent band or the 30 per cent band.  Allowances, no matter how one tries to tinker about with them, necessarily benefit disproportionately the person paying tax at the 53 per cent rate. No matter how one does it, the benefit under the allowances system goes to the higher paid.  Tax credits are worth the same to the person paying 53 per cent on most of their income as they are to the person paying 30 per cent on the top slice of their income.  For that reason tax credits are more equitable, apart from the fact that it is conceivable in that situation to reconcile the PAYE and PRSI systems.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a quotation by the Minister on the question of tax credits.  One learns to note carefully the language used by Ministers in answer to parliamentary questions or on occasions like this.  The Minister shot down Deputy <Col N="1888" /> Noonan's comments on tax credits on the basis, as he said, that if we were to switch to tax credits &ldquo;based on conversion of existing allowances&rdquo; and so on.  I suspect, if one had time to study that phrase, &ldquo;based on conversion of existing allowances&rdquo;, one would find a great deal in it. I am not necessarily arguing for such a simple switch based on a conversion of existing allowances.  The matter is more complex than that.  A whole range of issues needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>It is important to underline that poverty in this society is not merely a feature of people out of work, it is not merely a feature of social welfare recipients.  There are many people on low pay in a whole range of employments and the phenomenon is growing.  I am not just referring to part-time work but to low pay trades and a myriad of low paid employments. Some of them are in the black economy but that is a different matter.  It is ridiculous to keep those people in the tax net.  It is ridiculous that a person who goes off the dole, who goes off unemployment benefit and returns to the workforce for a low wage, should get as his or her reward, as the earning parent in the family unit, a demand for tax at the absurdly low rate that applies.</P>
    <P>If we did not change anything else the acceptance of our amendment would go a long way to constituting real tax reform as distinct from tax improvements.  There is nobody in the PAYE sector, no matter what his or her earnings, who would not accept tax improvements if they were forthcoming, but we are talking about the people at the lowest end of the earnings profile.  We are talking about giving them some relief, using taxation in a limited way to take some of the burden off their backs in terms of the kind of measure envisaged here.</P>
    <P>I referred to the ESRI report earlier in the context of the submission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors on that matter.  The author of the report commented that correcting anomalies in the impact of the PRSI system, exemption limits from tax and family income supplement, could still &ldquo;be of major significance for certain households&rdquo;.  I <Col N="1889" /> strongly support that view.  Perhaps the Minister will respond by asking how he will pay for it.  We have already discussed that today but I should like to mention in passing that there are a couple of amendments down in the name of The Workers' Party which propose to address that question. For example, I have sought &mdash; perhaps quite imperfectly &mdash; to adapt in respect of corporation tax the notion which is applicable in some states of the United States concerning an alternative minimum tax applicable in the case of the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>Mr. John FitzGerald, the author of the ESRI report to which I referred, opined that a more broadly based property tax could bring in £300 million which should be wholly devoted to reforming the income tax personal tax allowances and that there should be a higher tax take from companies if we were to seek to implement what they recommended in respect of the lower paid.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas which would yield more tax, for example, a more broadly based property tax and a wealth tax.  I have a specific amendment in relation to wealth tax which would take the 1975 1 per cent and make it a 2 per cent wealth tax.  Those who are wealthy could just about manage to bear a 2 per cent wealth tax.  Later we will be debating whether the corporate sector could make a bigger contribution.  If there is a political will there are ways of balancing the cost of alleviating the tax burden on the people who are most in need.  That is basically the thrust of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not necessarily referring to Deputy Rabbitte's contribution but I thought it proper to advise the House that there are one and a half hours left during which Deputies are obliged to debate amendments Nos. 1 to 48.  I will leave it to the good judgment of Deputies and Ministers as to how that time can be best employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as I do not intend to go over the ground referred to by Deputy Rabbitte.  He is correct when he said that people on very low incomes <Col N="1890" /> are being caught for income tax, which is a disgrace.  In a modern society it does not reflect credit on any of us.</P>
      <P>I have provided in my group of amendments for what is no more than a token increase in the exemption limits, an extra £500 in the case of a married couple.  It is a token figure to probe the Minister's thinking and to see if there is a chink of light in the armour plated front he puts up to us here.  It is a very small amount, considerably lower even than that proposed by Deputy Rabbitte.  It would cost a relatively small amount which could be recouped without any difficulty on the capital or corporate taxation side.  Even the tokenism which I propose would at least show some indication of a change of heart by the Minister in trying to provide for those at the lower end of the income scale.</P>
      <P>As I said during the budget debate, this is a rich man's budget.  Having further reflected on it &mdash; and looked at the figures in detail &mdash; my opinion on that occasion has now been borne out.  If one looks at a comparison of the benefits in relation to take-home pay which the Minister is giving, we can see that the position of the single person with a gross annual income of £8,000, as a result of the Minister's amendments to this Bill, will improve by only £97 per year.  On the other hand, a person earning £40,000 will benefit by £1,000 per year.  Even on a <i>pro rata</i> basis that does not add up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A married couple with two children, who have a gross annual income of £8,000, will benefit by £56 per year as a result of the Minister's manipulations in the budget and in the Finance Bill.  The position of a couple with two children earning £40,000 per year will improve by almost £900 per year; a couple earning £60,000 a year improve their position by almost £1,500 per year.  That shows where the Minister's real benefits are falling, clearly in this budget he is giving to those at the upper end of the scale.  There is not much point in the Minister coming in here and saying that he is trying to even up matters and that he is looking after those on the lower end of the scale. That is easily said but the facts and figures <Col N="1891" /> do not bear out his remarks.  They show quite clearly that those on the lower end of the scale get little or nothing, the higher up you are on the scale the bigger the boost.</P>
    <P>Ernst and Whinney, the well known accountants, analysed the matter in detail and they summed it up by saying that, without question, the more you earn the more the Minister has allowed you to take home.  The Minister's munificence is directed at the couple earning £40,000 or £60,000 per year.  They can improve their position by £30 per week and the unfortunate couple earning £8,000 per year must be content with an improvement of £1 per week.</P>
    <P>Ernst and Whinney also did research on the effects the budget would have on real purchasing power.  Here again the same trend comes through.  The so-called benefits, tax reductions and tax reform are shown up for the sham they are.  In the case of a married couple with two children on a salary of £8,000 per year the change in real income is a reduction of .6 per cent in their purchasing power when all factors are taken into account; in the case of a married couple with two children on £20,000 per year the effect of the budget and the Bill on their real purchasing power is 1.58 per cent.  That is nothing to get excited about either.  In the case of the couple earning £25,000 per year the effect of the budget is 1.62 per cent.  When these figures are examined in detail it is clear that the increase in purchasing power is negligible, 1.6 per cent.  It is only when one reaches an income of £60,000 per year that the increase and purchasing power takes on something even approaching respectable proportions of 4.19 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those who most need an increase in their purchasing power get virtually nothing and those who need it least get the lion's share; they get 4 per cent and the former 1 per cent.  This is the reality of what this Government stand for, the sham they attempt to put across by these exemption limits.  Those are the realities that are thrown up quite clearly when these figures are examined in detail.  I <Col N="1892" /> could discuss this matter at greater length but, as you rightly say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we have a lot to get through. That is the basic point I want to make here, that the entire thrust of the benefits of this budget is thrown on those who need it least.</P>
    <P>The amendments I have tabled within this group are modest in the extreme and would cost relatively little in budgetary or financial terms.  I would ask the Minister to show his good intent in this regard by conceding on these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If I understand them correctly all of these amendments seek to increase the exemption limits up to which people would have no tax liability.  I take many of the points made by Deputy Rabbitte, that the number of people who would be classified as poor &mdash; whichever source one resorts to in order to draw the poverty line &mdash; are liable to income tax.  The ESRI have undertaken some studies &mdash; again depending on whichever source one uses &mdash; showing that somewhere between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of low-paid workers who would be classified as being the main earner in families in poverty would have a tax liability.  When resources become available we would all have an interest in removing such people completely from the income tax net.</P>
      <P>That takes us back to the debate we had this morning, that if we concentrate exclusively on reducing marginal rates somebody with a modest tax liability &mdash; in receipt of an income which has been below the poverty line &mdash; gains very little if pulled from a standard rate of 30 per cent down to a standard rate of 25 per cent.  They should be totally excluded from the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way to exclude the low paid from the tax net is by increasing the personal allowances rather than simply raising the exemption limits.  There is a very big problem when exemption limits are way in excess of the total of the personal allowances.  Then we encounter the problem of the clawback provisions when people's incomes go above the exemption limit.  I am glad the Minister is reducing <Col N="1893" /> the clawback from, I think, 60 per cent to 53 per cent; that is helpful.  Again the perception and the reality are different. People at present in receipt of, say, a retirement pension from a job together with a contributory old age pension above the exemption limit have a perception that they are paying tax at 60 per cent; that perception is widespread.  People have commented and written articles on it to the effect: is it not dreadful that the Minister is penalising people on pension and taxing them at 60 per cent?  They are confusing the claw back provision above the exemption limit with the actual tax rate.</P>
    <P>I agree with the arguments being advanced about totally removing low-paid people who are in poverty from the tax net but the means selected to do so by the Deputies in whose names these amendments are tabled is wrong.  When resources become available I would prefer that the Minister would, by increasing personal allowances, take low-paid workers out of the tax net completely. I know his resources are limited at present; I am not advocating that it be done this year.  I recognise that progress has been made in lifting the exemption limits.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could request the Revenue Commissioners to provide people who are just above the exemption limits, especially the retired, with some type of clear, explanatory leaflet showing that they were not paying tax at 60 per cent in the last tax year, or are not paying tax at 53 per cent in the current tax year; that it is the clawback for those to whom the exemption limits apply in the first instance and who are slightly above it with regard to a tranche of their income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no amendments tabled on this section.  I was proposing to approach this in another way.  I had an amendment down which was disallowed and which would have abolished the exemption limits altogether.  I am going down the road taken by Deputy Noonan, which is advocating increasing the personal allowances although, funnily <Col N="1894" /> enough, there is no Fine Gael amendment to that effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I had a proposal to increase personal allowances, which has been disallowed, it having been scrambled up with another proposal of mine to introduce a standard rate of tax in respect of all allowances.  On that account it was ruled out of order, making a total mess of the overall position.</P>
      <P>We are faced with circumstances in which we still have the exemption relief unless the Government change their minds about it.  Then the question is: at what level should it be?  Obviously it should not be at the existing level.  The Government have made a reasonable effort to increase these amounts significantly. Nonetheless they fall short of what is needed to take a lot of low-paid people out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>The Minister should listen very carefully to what Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte said, because it made a lot of sense. When we come to the actual figures I contend that Deputy Rabbitte's are somewhat on the high side and Deputy Taylor's somewhat on the low side.  Perhaps a figure of £8,000 for a married couple and £4,000 for a single person would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  There is one other matter to which I might refer, that is children's allowances.  I see that children's allowances, for the purposes of the exemption relief, are proposed to be increased from £200 to £300 annually. That is all very well but there is still no child allowance granted to the ordinary taxpayer.  In my amendment which was disallowed I proposed the reinstatement of the children's allowance at £300 for all taxpayers.  In view of the very small amount paid in respect of child benefit, <Col N="1895" /> the very least the Minister can do is reintroduce children's allowances.  I suggest that that be done at the figure of £300 per allowable child.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan anticipated the point I was going to make in relation to the clawback.  I should like to add my voice to what he said in that respect.  I wonder if there is any way of resolving this problem in order to get rid of that perception?  I take the Deputy's point about an explanatory leaflet. Deputy Noonan knows as well as I do that we have had a proliferation of leaflets on tax allowances, exemptions and reliefs.  I contend the more leaflets produced the greater is the confusion created. No matter how simple a leaflet the Department may produce, people will continue to ask the same questions; that is the unfortunate reality.  I cannot see a way out of this problem immediately but if there is any technical way around it I would ask the Minister to give it his attention.</P>
      <P>I have been looking briefly at this group of amendments, principally those in the name of Deputies Rabbitte and Taylor. Basically they are seeking more money, more tax relief.  But we must remember that, if it is taken off one source, it must come from another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his record in the Department of Finance. Since he assumed office just over two years ago he has reduced the basic rate of income tax by over 14 per cent and the top rate by almost 10 per cent.  The tax bands have been widened by approximately 10 per cent and the tax exemption limits below which people are exempt from tax have been increased considerably. I debated many Finance Bills <Col N="1896" /> from that side of the House also when we sought more money, better allowances, extra reliefs, the raising of exemption limits and so on.  We were given very short shrift by the then Government. That was at a time when income tax rates were far more penal than they are now. This should be recognised and I did detect in the latter part of Deputy Noonan's comments a recognition that that was the case.</P>
    <P>There is one technical point I would like to raise in relation to marginal relief. It is my experience that in cases where people are over the exemption limits but not by a significant amount the income tax office often apply the ordinary allowances in issuing the certificate of tax free allowances even though it might be quite evident, and I am talking here about cases where returns of income have been submitted, they are in the marginal relief category.  Deputies, accountants and others often have to contact the income tax office to ask them to take this into account.  In some cases we have had to look for a tax rebate at the end of the income tax year.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to contact the Revenue Commissioners to see if something can be done about this and to see if some reference to the fact that the taxpayer is in the marginal relief category can be included in the certificate of tax free allowances.  Those who fall into this category should be entitled to get relief throughout the year and should not be obliged to wait until the end of the income tax year before getting this relief by way of a tax rebate.  It is quite clear, given their low incomes, that they are living at a marginal rate of subsistence.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to communicate with the Revenue Commissioners to see if something can be done about this matter. It may be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to apply a rule of thumb or other rought mechanism in dealing with such cases.  Having said that I am happy with the allowances outlined in the Bill we are all aware of the financial and economic background against which we are discussing this Bill.  The Minister is to be congratulated for reducing income tax <Col N="1897" /> rates given that economic background. While one expects the Opposition to oppose, debate and question, it should be recognised on all sides of the House that we are moving in the right direction in the area of taxation, in other words, income tax rates are moving downwards instead of upwards as was the case in the four years prior to the Minister's accession to office in 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who have contributed.  There is always some benefit to be gained from debate and dialogue.  I will deal with the points raised by the Deputies after first giving a general response to the amendments grouped together for discussion purposes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to increase the general income tax exemption limits and the exemption limits for aged persons proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment Nos. 5 and 7 propose to increase the general exemption limit, as set out in the Bill, by £3,500 for married couples and by £1,750 for single and widowed persons.  Acceptance of these amendments would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of £143.1 million in 1990 and £238.6 million in a full year and would exempt some 173,600 persons from tax liability.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 12 propose to increase the age exemption limits set out in the Bill, by £500 for married couples, and by £250 for single and widowed persons, aged 65 years or over but under 75 years.  Acceptance of these amendments would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of £1.7 million in 1990 and £2.9 million in a full year and would exempt some 3,900 persons from tax liability.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 13 propose to increase the age exemption limits set out in the Bill, by £300 for married couples, and by £150 for single and widowed persons, aged 75 years or over.  Acceptance of these amendments would result in an additional cost to the Exchequer of £0.2 million in 1990 and £0.4 million in a full year and would exempt some 370 persons from tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> The total cost to the Exchequer of amendments Nos. 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22 and 23 combined would be £145 million in 1990 and £241.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill already provides for very generous increases in the exemption limits: £500 in the case of a married couple under 65 years of age or £250 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category; £700 in the case of a married couple where either spouse is aged 65 years or over but under 75 years or £350 in the case of a single or widowed person in this age category; and £700 in the case of a married couple where either spouse is 75 years or over or £350 for a single or widowed person in this age bracket.</P>
    <P>In addition, in recognition of the difficulties faced by low-income families, the special addition of £200 per dependent child which was introduced last year is being increased by £100, a 50 per cent increase, to £300 per child.  This child element is intended to target relief at a group which has been identified as particularly in need of State support and, together with the increases in the basic exemption limits, will go a long way towards alleviating the tax burden on low-income families.  The increases provided by section 1 and the associated marginal relief will cost the Exchequer £14.2 million in 1990 and £23.7 million in a full year and will exempt 30,900 persons, with 58,100 children, from liability to income tax.  A further 65,000 taxpayers with 123,100 children, will have reduced liability because of the operation of marginal relief as a consequence of the increases.</P>
    <P>The increases in the exemption limits provided for in section 1 of the Bill are the most generous that can be afforded at this time especially as other significant reliefs, i.e. the reduction in both the standard and top rate of tax, the increases in the rate bands and the renewal of the PRSI allowance, are provided for in the Bill.  Accordingly, the amendments must be opposed.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the less costly amendments proposed by Deputy Taylor and <Col N="1899" /> the questions raised by Deputy Rabbitte on The Workers' Party amendments.  I will also deal with one or two other questions he raised.  He stated that a married couple on £100 a week will find themselves caught in the tax net.  I should point out that the exemption limit for a married man is £125 per week, and not £100 per week, plus £6 per week for each child. Therefore if married with four children he will be entitled to earn £149 per week tax free.</P>

      <P>I hope not but all I am trying to do is put the record straight. The exemption limit for a married couple is £125 a week plus £6 a week for each child.  This limit is also applied in the case of small traders, shopkeepers and farmers.  A specific new approach was adopted to try to target the low paid.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte stated that he rejected most of what I said on tax credits and felt that tax credits could be used in such a way that people would not suffer.  To put it into ordinary layman's language, what this means is that if someone wants to do this they can.  If we convert everybody to the top rate nobody will suffer but it will cost us a fortune.  I have not got the exact figure but it is an area I have looked at.  When we have the full figures I will give them to the Deputy. The debate will not finish here today or tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The Deputies also spoke about the US approach of a minimum corporate tax rate.  It does not matter which way one travels.  One pays 5 or 10 per cent of minimum corporate tax irrespective of what reliefs are there.  I am doing it the other way round.  I am taking away the reliefs bit by bit.  We have already reduced the accelerated allowances from 100 per cent to 50 per cent.  This year's budget and Finance Bill are providing for a further reduction from 50 per cent to 25 per cent and from 25 per cent to zero. That refers to the accelerated allowance which is one of the major reliefs in the corporate tax area.  The other one is section 84 which has also been dealt with.</P>

We cannot change the deals that are concluded or that agencies are negotiating, especially where jobs are concerned.</P>

      <P>I am just making the point in passing.  Deputy Rabbitte raised the question about paying for this £140 or £150, if I got it from corporate tax.  I am just answering that argument.  I do <Col N="1901" /> not know what other way the Deputy thought it might be paid for, but I am sure we will come to it later.</P>
      <P>The question is how does one arrive at a minimum corporate tax rate?  One arrives at it by ignoring the allowances or by doing away with the allowances.  We are on that road.  Of course, I have the same view as Deputy Rabbitte in trying to approach the low paid and the people caught in the poverty trap.  It will be seen that I have come quite a distance since I started.  This is only my second budget and I intend to bring in quite a few more while I am around and I think I will have made a lot of progress by that time.</P>

It might not even elect one to Dublin Corporation or to Dublin County Council in the highly populated areas that the Deputies over there come from.  So if they say that any Government is foolish enough to build a budget and a Finance Bill targeted directly at people earning over £50,000 a year, which is basically what they said, they would not get themselves elected to a county council or a corporation in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I would agree with Deputy Noonan and others who say that there is a perspective out there about the marginal rate of tax.  We have gone on a publicity campaign.  We put out leaflets with headings &ldquo;How I fare if my income tax is over the limit&rdquo;, &ldquo;No tax to pay&rdquo; or &ldquo;Less tax to pay&rdquo; in as simple a form as could be and sent it to those people.  As the debate progressed I mentioned it to the Revenue Commissioners who will now take it up with the Department of Social Welfare. The people who are most affected are probably old age pensioners, and maybe contributory old age pensioners where there are two in the house.  There are quite extensive reliefs for them of which they may not be aware.  We will look at the possibility of getting the Department of Social Welfare to distribute these leaflets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no trouble supplying them.  We will get them printed <Col N="1904" /> for everybody.  They are a help but they are not the full story.  Another leaflet points out where families fit in in relation to the family income supplement which is difficult for ordinary people to understand. Hopefully we will improve communications in that regard.  As a result of applications arising out of that publicity campaign, by the end of April last exemptions on marginal relief had been granted in some 14,000 cases for 1991.  We are making fairly good headway.  It has been a heartening response and I would like to take this opportunity to urge every taxpayer who thinks he might be eligible, but has not yet claimed, to do so without further delay.  I will be glad to have extra copies printed for distribution in the House to Deputies so they can assist us in trying to bring this message to the people.</P>
      <P>Notice of the reliefs, including the family income supplement, with the notice of tax free allowances were issued to some 130,000 PAYE taxpayers identified by the Revenue Commissioners as being possibly eligible for the relief.  I have already dealt with that aspect of it. What is marginal relief anyway?  It is not 60 per cent of the total.  Take, for example, a married man with five children earning about £8,300 a year.  It is only the £300 that is subject to the marginal rate of tax and not the £8,000.  As Deputy Noonan rightly says maybe people do not understand this as well as they should.</P>
      <P>The question of poverty traps was addressed by the Commission on Taxation in their first report when, in chapter 23, they looked at the area of negative income tax.  Deputies will be aware that since the 1960s the concept of negative income tax was perceived as a means of achieving a number of objectives, one of which was the removal of poverty traps which face taxpayers in certain income ranges and occur when a rise in income is associated with withdrawal of certain benefits and an additional payment of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion of the commission was that any attempt to solve the problem of poverty with a single comprehensive <Col N="1905" /> system of income maintenance which was integrated with the income tax system would be very costly.  In fact, the commission recommended that the direct tax and income maintenance systems should continue to be separate.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, are not unaware of the burden of personal taxation on persons with low income and in framing the budget last year and this year we were very conscious of the need to help those on low incomes, particularly families, and consequently we introduced a child allowance of £200 which was increased to £300 this year and we increased the exemption limits not only for those on low pay but for pensioners, small shopkeepers and small farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea made the point of trying to communicate this message to the taxpayers, as indeed did Deputy Noonan and we are all agreed that it is desirable to do so.  Provision has been made to include information on the appropriate entitlements in the tax free allowance in the 1989-90 tax year.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with all the points raised. As I have already said, significant reliefs have been provided, although I would like to provide more.  I am very conscious of the direction in which I am going and I intend to keep going in that direction. The Workers' Party amendment would cost £145 million to implement in 1990 and £241.1 million in total to implement in a full year.  It would cost £13.7 million to implement Deputy Taylor's amendment this year and £22.9 million in a full year.  I do not have those resources available to me.  We have been very generous with the resources available and if I have more resources they will certainly attach to those on the lower end of the income scale.</P>
    <P>Consequently I oppose both sets of amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely conscious that we are operating with a guillotine over our heads so I will not prolong this discussion.  However, amendment No. 5 is the substantive amendment and I am sorry that the Minister could not at least take the spirit of the amendment on <Col N="1906" /> board by having a look at it before Report Stage.  Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, I think this ought to be possible, if the political will was there to do it.  It is a question of choice and I repeat that it is an absurd situation that up to 18 per cent of people living in the poverty trap are subject to PAYE and PRSI.  Priority ought to be given to taking them out of the tax net.  While the Minister was speaking I was looking for the figures he gave on budget day.  I could not lay my hands on them but I think the Minister said that 31,000 people would be taken out of the tax net as a result of the measures he announced in the budget.  I am certain that that figure has already been widely eroded.  We dealt with that at another stage of the debate. It is crazy that people who are scrounging a living at subsistence wage levels are liable to taxation.  That position ought to be rectified as a priority of tax reform.</P>

      <P>In proposing the amendment I dealt with where I would propose to find some of the money.  It is simply a question of what are one's political priorities.  I am not relying on my political perspective or my expertise to advance my argument.  I instanced the ESRI report and the comments of one of its authors Mr. John FitzGerald where he indicated that the take from more broadly based property tax would result in a contribution of £300 million.  That <Col N="1907" /> would cover the cost of the substantive amendment.  Mr. FitzGerald is a reputable economist, known to all sides of this House, and I believe that his submission is reasonable.  I am not glibly ignoring the cost of implementing my amendment but I think it is a question of whether one wishes to give tax relief that is targeted at the poor or as Deputy Taylor has said whether the bulk of tax relief goes to people who are better paid.  A Cheann Comhairle, I am anxious to put the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: I agree with the arguments being put forward by Deputy Rabbitte in so far as we all agree that there is a number of people on low pay, whom we would all like to see taken out of the tax net.  I appreciate that the money that would be required to implement this package of amendments, a total cost of £241 million, is simply not there.  Therefore, I will not be supporting the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to address the problems of the low paid I think PRSI payments have as high if not a higher priority because PRSI is paid from the first pound onwards whereas people who are just in the tax net will pay 30 per cent on a small margin of income.  If we are to be logical in the argument, I do not think we can address the problem of the burden of tax on those below the poverty line without looking at PRSI.  I wonder why the Minister has not taken on board the suggestion we made as far back as the last election, to exempt the first £3,000 of income from PRSI payments and remove the income ceiling in this regard.  A reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me to the Minister shows that the same amount of money is recovered by removing the ceiling as is lost by exempting the first £3,000 of income.  Perhaps there is a problem in assessing peoples' eligibility for benefit if they are no longer paying PRSI but there are ways around that, for example, it could be brought down to a notional amount if there was a problem about establishing weekly credits against which eligibility for benefits could be measured. <Col N="1908" /> It could be levied at 0.5 per cent or at a nominal sum of 10p per week so that people would continue to be insured if a payment is required to maintain their insured status.  Levies and PRSI payments of £7.75 on every £100 of income is a much heavier imposition than income tax at 30 per cent on the tranche of income just above the exemption limit or the sum of the personal allowances, the PRSI allowance and the PAYE allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan when he says that PRSI is part of the wider debate and cannot be taken in isolation.  It is a matter for a debate that can involve PRSI, social welfare and tax, etc.  When we look at where we stand in the scale of contributions of PRSI in European terms we are by no means anywhere near the top.  There is a certain fallacy that PRSI is a tax on jobs or a cost to employment.  However, when we introduced a scheme last September to allow new employees to be taken on without PRSI contributions having to be made, there was a very small take-up. This is a deep subject that needs to be gone into very carefully.  We have only had an additional 1,000 people at work as a result of that scheme.  That was a poor response and is an indication that PRSI payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know that workers think of deductions from the pay packet as tax whether it is for PRSI or PAYE but at the end of the day PRSI should not be meddled with too easily because it is a contribution which people make for benefits they will receive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to increase the part of taxable income payable at the standard rate from £6,500 to £7,000, thus giving a modest increase to people paying tax on the standard rate. Much of the arguments that applied on the earlier group of amendments also apply here and I do not intend to repeat them.  It has to be pointed out and commented upon that when it came to reducing the income tax rates the Minister chose to take 3p in the pound off the top rate &mdash; he reduced the rate from 56 to 53 per cent &mdash; but only 2p in the pound was taken off the standard rate, thereby reenforcing my statement earlier, which I stand over, that this is a Finance Bill <Col N="1910" /> primarily directed towards the better off and the wealthy.</P>
    <P>I am rather puzzled by the Minister's statement to the effect that there are 4,400 people in the £50,000 plus income bracket.  I accept the figure the Minister gives &mdash; I assume it comes from the Department &mdash; but he seems to be asking how could he possibly be bringing in a Bill that would be directed towards improving the position of the better off since they are so few in number that they would not elect anybody to a county council.  That is a strange argument.  If, as he says there are only 4,400 people in the country earning over £50,000 a year, why does he go to such lengths to improve their position substantially as against that of the people who are further down the scale?</P>

      <P>It is no good saying he could not have done it or he would not do it because it would not make political sense.  I say he has done it because it makes political sense from his point of view but for what reason, I do not know. A couple with two children whose income is £60,000 a year would have taken home £31,371 in the 1989-90 tax year while in the current tax year, as a result of this bonanza from the Minister, they will be taking home £32,849, an incease of £1,478, £30 a week extra in net take home pay.  I do not care whether there are 4,400 such people or what the number.  Why did the Minister see the need to direct the resources available to him to those people while giving an increase of only £1 a week in take home pay to a married couple with two children whose gross annual income is only £8,000 a year? Even though the cost in net tax terms <Col N="1911" /> may be relatively small, from the eye of the couple on £8,000 a year, they are benefiting by a miserable, measly £1 a week.  They see that their neighbour in another estate whose income is £50,000 a year and whose need is non-existent is benefiting by £30 a week while their need is so great.  The indecency has to be commented upon.  The Minister should not tell me that as resources become available he will support this.  That is plámás. There are a lot of resources available if one is minded to use them.  There are resources to increase the exemptions on CAT and to reduce the take on capital gains tax.  There are resources not to bring down the top rate by 3p but to increase it by 10p if one is minded to do it but, of course, the Minister is not minded to do that.  There are only 4,400 people who would be affected by it.  It would not affect the books all that much so that cannot be the reason the Minister is not providing for it so please do not give me the excuse that resources are not available.</P>

Deputy Rabbitte put down an amendment &mdash; it was ruled out of order &mdash; which would have increased the top rate and so on.  I would have put down an amendment on those lines but I knew it would have been ruled out of order.  I simply put down amendments that would bring some small improvement to those at the lower end of the scale.  If the Minister is realistic in saying he wants to help those on the lower end of the scale he has the opportunity now and can say he will look at this proposal. The cost involved would be modest <Col N="1912" /> and could be made up easily by adjustments upwards on the capital side.  This is precisely what I am asking him to do.</P>

      <P>The amendments Deputy Taylor proposes would widen the standard rate band proposed in the Bill from £6,500 to £7,000 for single or widowed persons and from £13,000 to £14,000 for married couples, and would increase the 48 per cent band from £3,100 to £3,600 for single and widowed persons and from £6,200 to £7,200 for married couples.  The cost of the proposed changes to the Bill is estimated at £28.1 million in 1990 and £46.9 million in a full year.  The measures already incorporated in the Bill propose that the standard rate be reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent, that the band of incomes chargeable at that rate be widened from £6,100 to £6,500 for single and widowed persons and from £12,200 to £13,000 for married couples.  In addition the top rate of tax is being reduced from 56 per cent to 53 per cent.  Deputy Taylor seems to suggest that that rate is only for the smaller number of people but what I am trying to get at, and what he should appreciate, is the number of people who get into that high tax bracket so quickly.  That is what we are all concerned about.  The Deputy is putting forward ideological arguments and trying to create the impression that there is a huge pot of gold out there and that there is a fortune to be made from imposing higher taxes on the people earning in excess of £50,000 and £60,000.  That is a myth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the <Col N="1913" /> Deputy facts he is not interested in hearing. It suits him to have that nice argument for his constituency that if you tax people who are earning in excess of £50,000 to £60,000 at a 70 per cent rate, so many things could be done with the revenue generated.  When I give you the facts you do not want to accept them. The position is that there are 4,400 people earning in excess of £50,000 per year.  We know where the burden of tax is and that is what I am trying to get at but I do not have all the resources to do it in one day or in the one year.</P>
      <P>The cost of the income tax changes I have made in this Bill, not to talk about VAT and so on, is £171.4 million in 1990 and £280.9 million in a full year.  The total cost of the income tax reliefs provided for the period of the Programme for Government is in excess of £800 million compared with our commitment of £225 million for the period of the programme. The changes I have talked about will benefit 760,000 taxpayers and not merely the few Deputy Taylor would want us to believe are getting money from this budget.  Those are the facts.  If the Deputy cannot accept it I cannot help him.  If the Deputy thinks I am not dealing with corporate tax he should be aware that, at a later stage in the debate, we will have an opportunity to talk about capital allowances, section 84 exports sales relief being abolished and a myriad of other things by way of endeavouring to get a wider tax base so that we can introduce reliefs.  That is my approach and that is how we are proceeding.</P>
      <P>I will give a few other examples.  We have brought relief to 760,000 taxpayers. If a married person with two children, taxed under PAYE and on the high rate of PRSI &mdash; assuming that only one spouse is earning had an income of £5,000 in 1982-83 and got pay rises in line with inflation he would be earning in the region of £7,253 in the current tax year. I will outline how his tax, as a percentage of income, would have developed over the years.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is only when you look at the BES schemes, the write off of capital, the distribution of dividends tax free from certain locations in the country that you can see how people can keep their liability below £50,000.  It is not in any way a true profile of the distribution of income.  I do not want to get into the ideological debate. I am not supporting these amendments because there is a high cost involved but I agree with the emphasis being placed, we should widen the standard rate band significantly.  In trying to be consistent with what I said this morning I do not think we should get hung up on the targeting of low marginal rates and of a 40 per cent and a 25 per cent rate.  The emphasis must go on taking low income people out of the tax net and out of the PRSI net.  The second thing is to widen the standard rate band.  I would urge the Minister when he is preparing for next <Col N="1915" /> year's budget to make those two items his objectives.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 2 of the Finance Act, 1984, (inserted by this section) shall apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Effectively we have had the discussion already.  I merely want to make the point that of all the groups we have talked about who are discriminated against under the present tax code the discrimination that is most unjustifiable is the discrimination against single parents, i.e. widows, widowers and unmarried parents.  For the life of me I cannot understand why a man should lose the benefit of the double tax allowance on the death of his spouse.  Why should his conditions change so drastically in those circumstances? If one parent of a large family dies the other parent, if he or she wants to stay in employment, has to employ somebody as a childminder or housekeeper or whatever.  It is an incredible anomaly.  The cost may be around £3 million, but the Minister ought to rectify this and I appeal to him to do so.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  Widowers especially who have young children have to employ somebody when the wife dies and the fact that they are taxed as a single person puts them at great financial disadvantage.  I know the Minister is aware of this problem and has given it consideration.  I am sure he will, if at all possible, look favourably on this amendment and if the cost allows he will see his way to change the bands so that widowers and widows with dependent children will not be at such disadvantage.  I earnestly request the Minister to look favourably on this.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would this amendment have constitutional implications if one were to extend the allowances in the manner the Deputy suggests to single parents?  Would there be a consequential argument for doubling that allowance then for married people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This area would command the sympathy of everyone in the House, including myself.  We have done a great deal of work on it.  Deputy Noonan touches on one of the complexities, that is the possibility of constitutional implications and that is being examined in detail.  People have different views as to whether it would have such implications. The concern expressed by Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Ahern and others, would find no disagreement here because we all recognise this is an area of difficulty. Whether it is the mother or father of the family who dies, overnight the whole circumstances change for the surviving parent especially if the children are to go to second and third level education and so on.  While the tax code provides some help for taxpayers in the position described here, a special widowed person's allowance is given to widowed taxpayers which stands at £2,550 compared with the single person's allowance of £2,050, an extra £500.  There are also the widowed and single parents' allowances which, taken together with the relevant personal allowances, give widowed and single parents the same overall basic personal allowance as a married couple, that <Col N="1917" /> is £4,100.  Extending the double rate bands to widows and single parents would cost about £3 million in a full year.  Of course, these costs would be much higher in a full year if married couples opting for single treatment could not be successfully excluded.  It could get into the high realms of cost in various other areas.  Then, of course, the other reliefs could possibly be legally challenged to expand them.  I refer here to mortage interest, life assurance etc.  It is not just what we are talking about here but the implications it has that are of concern.  I assure the Deputy I am working on this in an effort to find solutions.</P>
      <P>The more we improve the whole tax situation the more the position of the people we are talking about will improve. Nevertheless, I am aware of the problems faced by widowed parents and I have looked at the possibility of making some concession for them in the short term since the budget up to now.  I am sure the House will appreciate that conceding double bands would raise difficult and complex issues which do not lend themselves to very easy solutions.  I am continuing to look at the position and I will bear in mind the point made by Deputy Rabbitte and others here today.</P>

    <P>(2)  Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1986, shall have effect subject to the provision of this section.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>Again having regard to the very inadequate time we have to discuss this section &mdash; and this is likely to be repeated for the rest of the night and tomorrow on other sections &mdash; I do not want to rehash the argument that has been made because there are a number of important amendments to follow.  Let me select from the range of provisions listed in column (1) the very last which relates to section 3 of the Finance Act, 1969, which deals with the housekeeper allowance for taking care of an incapacitated person.  I do not know when that figure of £2,500 was last increased, but I was reminded of this entire area and I included it in the course of researching how one might take some measures to alleviate the suffering and now financial penalty imposed in a very recent topical case, that of the Dunne baby, that I raised in this House.  I raised it here last week on the Adjournment, and I was amazed to hear from the parents directly that their entire entitlement as a result of a settlement made in respect of that minor suing through his mother for the awful infirmities endured now by the child was the £2,500 housekeeping allowance referred to here, in other words, effectively £50 per week. That amount of money will be paid out to look after an infant who has to have everything done for him.  The story has been written in very graphic and real terms by Gene Kerrigan in his book <i>Nothing But the Truth.</i> He details what looking after an infant as incapacitated as this boy involves.  The parents may draw down £50 per week and that is the limit imposed.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it is since the limit was increased but I suggest that for any person looking after an incapacitated relative, a son or daughter, £50 per week <Col N="1921" /> is no compensation at all, if &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; is the correct word to use bearing in mind the dimensions of the task that have to be undertaken.  Is the Minister sympathetic to this request?  If he acceded to the £5,000 limit I am not sure it would necessarily change the circumstances in the case I have referred to because the father would probably lose his entitlement to unemployment benefit. That would not lead to any net improvement in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to my amendment No. 39 which is related.  Will the Minister indicate if he is sympathetic to the content of that amendment which deals with the issue in a more specific way in that it relates to wards of courts?  Effectively, wards of courts should be considered to be exempt from tax liability where infirmity is visited on the ward of court, as happened in the case I have referred to.  That case warrants a compassionate response from the Government.  I anticipate that the Minister may be in sympathy with the essence of the case and he might wish to indicate at this stage whether he would be able to do something for this family.  I accept that this cannot be left open-ended but where heartbreak and hardship are inflicted on a family it is absurd to suggest that such a person should be taxed as a single person as if he had won the national lottery.  It is extraordinary that that is the position in this case.  The eight year old minor is being taxed as a single person with no dependants.  A sum of £12,500 is being taken out of the interest on the capital yields.  That was never intended.</P>
    <P>I understand that this has only arisen since the changes to self-assessment.  The ward of court office have suggested to me that before this might not have come to light inasmuch as at present the liability is on the taxpayer to make the return. Up to now if this had not come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners they would not have pursued it.  In the climate of self-assessment the liability is on the taxpayer to make a return and, as such, the award involved came to light. There is no option under the existing law but to impose the tax liability in the <Col N="1922" /> fashion that it has been imposed.  In terms of the compassion that this case deserves I should like to ask the Minister to be sympathetic to the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the case put by Deputy Rabbitte and looked at the amendments before the House.  I appreciate the thinking behind the amendment which was submitted in the last day or so.  The whole area of wards of court is complex.  I am aware of a case a couple of years ago which brought the problems involved home to me.  In that case a ward of court was made an award and the amount, as is always the case, was invested on behalf of the ward of court by the court.  The family in question did not receive any income although there was income accruing.  They went into court at various intervals and had certain capital allowances paid to them. Out of the capital sum the court paid out certain figures, £500 or £1,000.  I can see the point the Deputy is making about such cases but I am not certain I understand his entire case.</P>
      <P>If a child did not receive the money until he or she was 18 years of age and the family were not in receipt of income and, consequently, were not making a return of income received, there would be a roll-up of income tax assessments, demands, penalties and interest added. The family would not have been getting the income and, consequently, it would not have occurred to them that they should have been making a return although income would be accruing on the capital sum.  This is a complex issue and I do not think the case referred to by Deputy Rabbitte covers everything, but I undertake to have a look at this matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the areas referred to, and the circumstances which prompted the amendments, are not subject to income tax.  The Deputy will note that I am making provision by means of a new section to be inserted before section 5 to exempt from income tax payments made by the Haemophiliacs HIV Trust.  They are not payments made on foot of court awards.  What is happening there is that <Col N="1923" /> payments are made and they will not be treated under the Income Tax Acts as income because they are payments made out on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendment raises a second question which concerns not the amount of the court award but the income which would arise from investment of it.  The Deputy will appreciate that this raises much wider issues and while I am sympathetic with the terms of the amendment, I am anxious to have it examined in more detail before Report Stage next week.  Other questions must be answered and I am not sure that the way Deputy Rabbitte suggests we should approach the issue is the way to solve the problem he has raised.  For example, what is to happen in the case of an out of court settlement?  We will have to examine the issues in more depth.  I am not arguing against the principle the Deputy has in mind but I will see what can be done between now and Report Stage. However, I cannot give a firm commitment at this stage in relation to the wards of courts issue.  The Deputy can be assured that I will have a full report for him next week.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that the housekeeper allowance was not raised since 1985.  I will look at this issue sympathetically between now and Report Stage.  The House will be aware that the carer's allowance was increased from £28 to £47 per week in an effort to keep people out of institutions and in their home environment if at all possible.  What has been suggested is on the same lines and I can assure the House that I will look at it sympathetically.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his positive and sympathetic response to the issues raised.  I did not appreciate that the housekeeper allowance was not raised since 1985.  The Minister seems to acknowledge that that required some improvement at this stage. It is an onerous responsibility and if the Minister looks at the alternative &mdash; institutional care &mdash; it would be prudent housekeeping by him.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in the case of the Dunne baby &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is aware of this &mdash; it is a positive inducement to put him into care because in that case the hospital or the caring institution would effectively use the tax capacity so that the same yield would not accrue to the State.  It is because the parents want to look after him, especially while he is a minor, that they are subject to this tax liability.  My information from the ward of court office is that about 250 people are involved.  I accept that the Minister will have to tighten up the amendment but if he could come back on Report Stage with a positive reply I would be very grateful.</P>

      <Col N="1927" /> Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Amendment Nos. 44 to 48, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 27, after &ldquo;effect.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Persons whose basis of assessment has been changed by the provisions of this section, may claim a personal tax free allowance of £800 and PRSI allowance of £286, where they pay the full rate of PRSI applicable to case I or II of Schedule D taxpayers.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Chapter II to which we are now moving deals with a change in the basis of assessment for people who formerly paid their tax on the preceding year's income and who will now be paying on the basis of their income in the current year.  It appears to me that if one is liable to pay tax on a current year basis then one should receive the same allowances as all other taxpayers who pay on a current year basis.  At present a special allowance of £800 is applicable to PAYE taxpayers. This was provided for in the 1980 Finance Act.  The Minister of the day stated that those who paid their tax on a current year basis do not have the use of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to give an allowance along the lines of the PAYE allowance of £800 to people who pay their tax under Case I or Case II of Schedule D.  It was fully justified when introduced as a £400 allowances in 1980 to distinguish between people who paid tax as they earned as against those who paid their tax a year later.  When the Minister introduced the PAYE allowance in 1980 he pointed out that Schedule D taxpayers had the use of their money for 12 months before having to pay over money to the Revenue Commissioners. That position is to change as Schedule D taxpayers are now going to be taxed on a current year basis.  The Commission on Taxation had some observations to make <Col N="1928" /> on this matter in their report on personal taxation.  They pointed out that the Minister was justified in introducing the PAYE allowance for the very reasons he gave when introducing it in the first instance.  They went on to argue that if Schedule D taxpayers were to be taxed on a current year basis the justification for granting a special PAYE allowance would not be as strong.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the extension of the £800 allowance to farmers liable for income tax, to sole traders, to all Case I and Case II Schedule D taxpayers who include professional workers such as engineers, doctors, lawyers and so on who pay tax on a current year basis.  If one pays tax half way through the year one pays six months in advance and six months in retrospect. This would seem to be exactly the same as paying tax on a current year basis. Therefore, I do not take the point made by the Minister on Second Stage that major advantages are still available to Schedule D taxpayers.  Liability in the current year will be 90 per cent rather than 100 per cent but this does not justify the Minister's refusal to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>A stronger case can be made for extending the PRSI allowance.  Any self-employed person paying PRSI at the full rate, along with levies in accordance with the Social Welfare Acts, finds himself in exactly the same position as any PAYE worker paying PRSI at the full rate. Therefore, they should be allowed to receive the £286 allowance.  Once everybody pays tax on a current year basis there will be a very little difference between PAYE taxpayers and farmers, other self-employed and professional people.  I ask the Minister to consider very carefully granting an allowance of £800, similar to the PAYE allowance, as well as the full PRSI allowance to farmers and other self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>Frequently the case is made that the self-employed have a number of advantages over other sectors when it comes to paying tax.  If there is evasion then it is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners to collect any tax due but I do <Col N="1929" /> not think it is reasonable to advance the argument that allowances should be refused to those who are legitimately paying their taxes because there is a greater possibility of a Schedule D taxpayer evading his liability than there is of a PAYE taxpayer doing so.  I do not think that argument stands up.  Therefore, I commend this amendment to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor on behalf of the Labour Party had an amendment down to the Chapter we have just disposed of in which he sought the extension of the £286 PRSI allowance to Schedule D taxpayers but that fell following the division.  I know Deputy Taylor would want to be associated with this amendment for the simple reason that half of this amendment was included in his amendment.  However, we did not get the opportunity to debate that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is undoubted logic in what Deputy Noonan has said on his amendment which seeks the extension of this allowance to all taxpayers.  Having said that, the Minister for Finance, who I presume has computed the figures for 1990 will not agree because of the cost involved in granting the allowance to all self-employed persons, but that is not to say he will not do so in the future.  The Minister will probably say it will not be possible to do so this year, but in my humble opinion it will not be possible in future Finance Bills, having regard to the fact that self-employed persons will now be taxed on a current year basis, to argue against all taxpayers having the same allowances.  I think the Minister will have to concede on this in the 1991 Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to recall, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, the purpose behind granting the special PAYE and PRSI allowances. My memory sometimes fails me, but I do recall the purpose behind granting these allowances.  After hundreds of thousands of people had taken to the streets the Fianna Fáil Government, following the hullabaloo which had been kicked up, decided to make a concession and granted a special allowance of £175 to PAYE taxpayers.  This figure has been <Col N="1930" /> increased during the years and now stands at £800.  Some time later another carrot or special allowance was granted to PAYE taxpayers in the form of a PRSI allowance which now stands at £286.  If I recall correctly at one stage this figure stood at £312 but it has since been reduced.</P>
    <P>The reason for differentiating between taxpayers was that the self-employed had one advantage in that, depending on the year, they could have the use of their money for up to 20 months before having to pay any money over.  This is of tremendous benefit when profits are rising but can have the opposite effect when profits are going the other way as any practising accountant is aware.</P>
    <P>Chapter II represents a major change but I wish to reiterate that this allowance was granted to PAYE taxpayers on the basis that they had to pay their tax on a current year basis whereas the self-employed did not.  The self-employed will no longer have this advantage.  Despite what may be said by the Minister and other politicians in arguing that the self-employed have advantages in computing their taxes in that they are able to claim for expenses which PAYE taxpayers are not allowed, there will be no justification for denying one section of taxpayers this special allowance in future Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>There are two ways of doing this.  The first is, having regard to the fact that everybody will now be taxed on a current year basis, we could scrap the PAYE and PRSI allowances for PAYE taxpayers and grant each married person an allowance of, say, £4,100.  However, it would be a brave Minister for Finance or politician who would advocate that course of action.  The other alternative &mdash; which is the one I hope the Minister will go for in the Finance Bill, 1991 &mdash; is to increase tax free allowances.  At present a married person is in receipt of a married allowance of £4,100, a PAYE allowance of £800 and a PRSI allowance of £286, making a total of £5,186.  I suggest the Minister should increase the allowance by £1,000 for everybody.  That is the other alternative but everyone would have to receive the same allowance.</P>

      <P>Last night Deputy David Andrews implied that Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill was copied from the British. I see nothing particularly wrong with that. After all so much of our procedures in this city and in this Chamber have been borrowed en bloc from the British.  I see nothing wrong with this legislative larcency provided it is for the good.  Deputy Andrews implied that what was good law in England might not necessarily be good law here.  However, surely the principles of justice and one's rights to a correct legal decision are the same whether in Ireland or the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  Deputy Andrews also felt that the problem was more the lack of consistency of judgments handed down rather than leniency. I would contend that the problem arises on both fronts.  One sees extremely punitive sentences, in some cases jail sentences, handed down for relatively trivial matters.  We can all cite occasions of people being committed to jail for relatively minor larceny, non-payment of fines etc.  One finds it extremely difficult <Col N="1932" /> at times to understand the almost incomprehensively lenient sentences that are handed down on other occasions.  We must all agree, however, that this occurs in a minority of cases and unfortunately &mdash; or perhaps fortunately &mdash; these cases attract a considerable degree of media attention.  This media attention is good certainly from the point of view of a lay legislator because it helps to sharpen and focus our consciousness and awareness as legislators of the manner in which the law operates.</P>
      <P>I find it extremely difficult to rationalise the handing down of an 18 month suspended sentence with no fine in the case of a defendant who, for example, tricked a woman he met through a matrimonial column out of £2,795 and then proceeded to defraud his own brother-in-law out of over £5,000 of hard earned money which was intended for the treatment of his brother-in-law's sick daughter. Yet this decision was handed down in the Dublin Circuit Court in July 1989.  I do not care what the circumstances were. Some penalty should have been imposed in this case.</P>
      <P>Again in the Dublin District Court in April 1990 a man who indecently assaulted a woman in a telephone box was ordered to pay a mere £250 compensation. The district justice in the case even asked the defendant how much compensation he thought would be appropriate.  Imagine the psychological scar on an 18 year old victim as the bartering takes place across the floor of the court as to the gravity of the crime. Imagine the trauma of having to listen to this trade-off in relation to how much the defendant thought would be appropriate and, at the end of the day, the justice handing down a fine of £250, a mere £5 a week in instalments for a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course one has to be conscious that there may be mitigating circumstances. Allowing for such factors, however, it is extremely difficult to understand the decision handed down in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin in July 1989 where a man admitted to the manslaughter of his wife because a row had erupted over a new job he had taken as <Col N="1933" /> a trainee porter in a hotel.  Admittedly the investigation was made easier for the State and for everybody all round by virtue of the fact that the man walked into a Garda station and admitted to the killing.  I fail to see, however, how the justice in such a case could justify his decision to impose a suspended jail sentence of five years.  I find it extremely difficult to agree with the justice's summation when he said &ldquo;I do not think that society or the accused or anyone else would benefit from a custodial sentence&rdquo;. It is most extraordinary that a woman is dead, having been strangled, and the guilty person walks away virtually scot-free, because that is what a suspended jail sentence means.</P>
    <P>What about the case which came before the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in May 1989 when a deserted wife and mother of three was raped repeatedly, buggered and sexually assaulted with a kitchen knife in her County Cavan home during a two hour ordeal?  The accused man was duly arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act and taken to the local Garda station. While being interviewed he offered to tell the gardai the truth and agreed to make a written statement, not under any duress.  In his statement he admitted to a substantial number of the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charges which were brought before him.  The trial lasted three days and received a lot of publicity, and lo and behold, the senior prosecuting counsel who attended the opening day of the trial was unable to attend the case for more than one hour on each of the subsequent days.  His nonattendance at the case meant that he was not in a position to cross-examine the accused and give his summing up to the jury.  In his absence therefore, the task was taken over by a well respected but certainly less experienced junior counsel who appeared for the State.  The accused was acquitted.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation of an acquittal taking place despite a confession which was extracted, not under any duress, which was admissible in evidence and for which there was supporting forensic <Col N="1934" /> evidence.  Naturally there was wide public concern about the circumstances surrounding the case and the eventual acquittal, and there was wide public speculation that the Director of Public Prosecutions intended questioning the senior counsel prosecuting the case on foot of the report he had received from the Chief State Solicitor's office.  We do not know what happened subsequently, whether or not there was discussion or dialogue or whether or not the senior counsel was interviewed by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  All I know is that this represents a classic example of what Deputy O'Keeffe is trying to deal with in having this measure brought before the House and this broad principle agreed on Second Stage.  That is all we are asking.</P>
    <P>Often it is extremely difficult to decide whether a hefty financial penalty or a jail sentence is most appropriate in serious cases.  For example, in a case heard at a Dublin District Court in July 1989 an Army sergeant who kidnapped and indecently assaulted and beat a woman was ordered to pay compensation of £5,000. The man pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting her and also imprisoning her during which imprisonment she was kicked in the head, arms, legs and forced to have oral sex.  The man at this stage undertook to complete compensation payments.  He had already commenced payments of £200 per month.  The judge, therefore, agreed that the balance should be paid during the next 12 months and adjourned the case to allow time for the payments to continue.  The sad sequel to this case was that the counsel came before the same judge approximately two weeks ago seeking, in fact, to terminate such payments because in the meantime the poor, maligned victim had been murdered. The judge dismissed the case against the Army sergeant under the Probation Act saying that the defendant did not have to make any more payments in view of the woman's death.  In my opinion that judgment speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>First we had a most heinous and barbaric crime which the defendant admitted to and which the justice dismissed under the Probation Act.  Surely the fact that <Col N="1935" /> the poor unfortunate victim had been murdered in the meantime should not be an excuse for remitting the balance of the compensation due.  Even if the deceased had no next of kin, surely the justice could have ordered that at a minimum the balance of the compensation should have been paid to a charitable organisation in accordance with the principle of making somebody pay for his crime.</P>
    <P>The courts are supposed to oversee, administer and dispense justice.  Fortunately in most cases they do exactly that, but not always.  This is the type of contingency that Deputy O'Keeffe's measure seeks to address.  As things stand at present, people guilty of the most heinous, sadistic and brutal crimes walk free and will continue to walk free.  Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal, as enshrined in this Bill, will reduce the incidence and likelihood of this happening, but it will not correct things entirely.  All that Deputy O'Keeffe is asking is that in extreme cases, and not in trivial cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions would refer the decision of one judge to another in order to determine whether the sentence passed was valid, appropriate and sound, and met the demand of the particular crime.  The right of appeal should be fundamental to any decision-making process, so why deny the Director of Public Prosecutions this right?</P>
    <P>All of the Opposition parties will agree, indeed, the general public would agree, that it is most unfortunate that the general principle of the Bill, which has received substantial commendation from all and sundry.  Members on all sides of the House, with the exception of the Minister, welcomed this Bill loudly.  It is unfortunate that the Bill will not receive a Second Reading as a result of the Minister's opposition to it.</P>

      <P>My contribution to the Criminal Justice Bill, 1990 will be brief. As has already been referred to by most speakers, decisions of the Judiciary and the courts have given rise to concern on occasions.  We can all recall occasions when we were surprised, annoyed, or even shocked by some of the decisions arrived at in our courts.  It is very easy to blame the judge on an occasion, but it is also very easy to forget that the vast majority of cases that come before the courts are dealt with in a fair manner. However, I am sure that Deputy O'Keeffe is genuinely concerned that the unsatisfactory situation that has emerged on occasions should be corrected.  Equally, the reasons put forward by the Minister for Justice when advising that this matter should not be pursued at this time are equally valid.  What we are being asked to do in this Bill is a major change from existing procedures in the courts. We cannot ignore the situation that exists in Britain, our close neighbour, particularly since they amended their criminal law legislation, and there is clear evidence that the changes made in the legislation have not achieved what they set out to do, that is a more realistic sentencing of offenders for serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the cases referred to in the media from time to time overshadow the vast majority of the work that takes place daily in our courts. We must be very grateful to those who interpret and implement the law on our behalf.  Nevertheless we cannot ignore the public concern expressed on occasions about decisions in relation to serious offences.  People have said that &ldquo;we have too much law and not enough justice&rdquo; and we can quote examples, as Deputy Jim Higgins has just done, where elderly people have been beaten and robbed in their homes or on the streets; where children have been abused and assaulted and where women have been raped and attacked.  These cases incense the general public.  However, I believe we must be very careful not to rush in and make changes in our criminal law until we have conducted a thorough investigation to ensure that the correct <Col N="1937" /> changes will be made where appropriate, as our objective is to improve the areas that are causing concern at present.</P>
    <P>We also see defendants charged with very serious crimes being let off on technicalities because of the expertise of their lawyers.  They succeed in getting the case dismissed and here again people say that there is too much law and not enough justice.</P>
    <P>We should not proceed with the Bill at present, but the Law Reform Commission should be asked immediately to report on this area.  I believe this would not in any way diminish Deputy O'Keeffe's concern in bringing forward this Bill.  It would also ensure that all the expertise and advice available to us would be at our disposal if and when changes are to take place in this area.  The Minister has made the point, and I agree with him, that public dissatisfaction at sentences imposed by the courts arise from time to time because the sentences are considered too lenient.  While this problem exists, it should be recognised that in the vast majority of cases there is general satisfaction that justice has been done.  It is only the occasional case that gives rise to widespread public disquiet and this can often be the result of excessive media coverage.</P>
    <P>Media attention, which sometimes sensationalises the issue can serve to undermine confidence in the criminal justice system.  People begin to doubt whether the courts are providing the protection from serious crime which they have a right to expect.  A key factor often overlooked by commentators is that judges when passing sentences have access to relevant documents from social workers and other professionals which would influence the decision.  I am not making the point that people who commit these heinous crimes should be treated any differently but it is important that we bear all the facts in mind when we are discussing changes in the law.</P>
    <P>There are other problems relating to the Bill.  The Bill places no limit on the time the prosecution has to lodge an appeal against the sentence which has been passed.  It would be essential to have <Col N="1938" /> a strict time limit imposed on the prosecution for the lodgment of appeals.  It would not be acceptable that a person who is being dealt with by the courts should have a threat hanging over him indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands proposes radical changes in the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Up to now it has always been the position that the prosecution has not sought to influence in any way court decisions on sentencing.  The proposed Bill would involve the prosecution in sentencing in a new way.  The prosecution would have to consider the suitability of each sentence and reflect on whether they are satisfied.  As well as placing a burden on the criminal prosecution service and stretching their resources, the Bill has the potential to interfere with the impartiality of the Director of Public Prosecutions whose duty it is to ensure that the law is enforced fairly.  This Bill could expose the Director of Public Prosecutions to public pressure and lobbying.  It is extremely unlikely that he would be allowed to proceed independently. Certain cases are guaranteed to draw extensive media coverage and public interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill would also have implications for the independence of the Judiciary who up to now have had complete discretion in dealing with cases that come before them.  However, it is inevitable that there will be cases where sentences appear too lenient.  In an issue like this it is vital that we work on the advice of expert bodies.  The Law Reform Commission are engaged in an examination in this area at present and the Minister has asked them to give priority to a study and a report as quickly as possible.  Any major changes in our law of the kind proposed in Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill should be preceded by a serious study of the eventual implications.  For this reason I call on the Deputy to await the commission's report before pressing ahead with this Bill.</P>
    <P>In making these comments I am not in any way defending some of the decisions that have been made in the interests of the public.  Every Member of this House wants to ensure that the public have faith <Col N="1939" /> and confidence not alone in the Judiciary but also in this House.  For that reason we have a responsibility to ensure that we check every avenue before we make changes in this vital area.  We talk about civil rights and about a lot of other matters but this is an area where fundamental changes will take place and it is our duty to protect all citizens, both offenders and those who commit the offence.  With these words I would appeal to Deputy O'Keeffe to withdraw his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, it is suggested, would provide for a review of sentences, leading possibly either to a reduction or an increase in the sentence passed on the individual concerned.  Any decrease would have to be on the basis of their having been an error in law as to the powers of sentencing of the court concerned. Any increase could be based on the opinion of the appeal court that the sentence dealt out was too lenient.  There is no mention of the kind of sentencing involved.</P>
      <P>This Bill is built to look balanced and fair, but what we have is a device for increasing custodial sentences, among others, whenever popular opinion requires it.  This document is a hangman's charter.  It is a distasteful example of political cynicism at its lowest.  Deputy O'Keeffe is well aware that it does nothing to address the very urgent issue of real justice in this country.  By ignoring the issues and running with the herd Deputy O'Keeffe will only add to the crisis of credibility that is daily undermining our communal sense of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need is not the power to increase sentences but to fundamentally change our sentencing policy as part of a total review of the ends and means of our criminal justice system.  We are still clinging to the coat-tails of Victorian legislation and Victorian concepts of incarceration and punishment.  What we need is the political courage to face the failure of the courts and the prison system to provide any serious remedy for crime. We do not need more of the same.  This Bill is a sham and will solve nothing. <Col N="1940" /> We need to change what we think of as justice.</P>
    <P>It is just to send petty criminals to a university of crime, at enormous public expense while neglecting the physical and psychological needs of the victims of crime?  Is it just to lock people up, many of whom are little more than teenagers, others whilst awaiting trial and still innocent in the eyes of the law, in conditions that remind us of the worst dictatorships of Eastern Europe, conditions that are regularly driving people to suicide?  How can we expect someone to develop the feeling that they belong in society by sending them to prison?  If what they learn there about cynicism, brutality and crime, at our expense, is not bad enough, when they come out what hope have people got of living an ordinary life?  They are stigmatised forever, because no-one believes you can be reformed by going to prison.  People are right; you cannot be reformed by going to prison because prison denies you the essential power to make good, and only by making good do we become good.  We do not even seem to believe it is possible anymore.</P>
    <P>Is this the best we can do, a system that makes the guilty feel they can never be forgiven, that trains them in crime, that denies them the power to make good, earn their forgiveness and learn to respect themselves, much less others?  A system that marks out people as incapable of good, will never reduce crime.  A system that is so concerned with stigmatisation and punishment that it ignores the suffering and loss of the victims of crime, and their need to forgive and become whole again does nothing for our sense of justice.</P>
    <P>The Green Party, An Comhaontas Glas, rejects the desire to stigmatise and punish in favour of the real need for reparation, rehabilitation and reconciliation. We view the current justice system as overly-concerned with capturing, convicting and punishing the offender, with little time devoted to supporting the victim, repairing the injury and bringing the offender to understand the true unacceptablity of his or her offence.  As our highest goal we recognise <Col N="1941" /> the principles of reconciliation and forgiveness. We regard it as central to a healthy society that the emotional wounds caused by injustice and criminality be healed and not left to fester.  We deplore the living conditions and social climate in our prisons.  Whether for those awaiting trial or those eventually convicted, we regard the use of imprisonment as inappropriate in the cases of all but a minority of dangerous and violent criminals.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of those currently in prison should be released and required to participate in various forms of rehabilitation and education schemes, as part of a planned development of alternatives to custodial punishment.  Future sentencing policy must take account of the unsuitability, ineffectiveness, expense and counter-productive nature of imprisonment in all but a minority of cases.</P>
    <P>We regard as particularly unacceptable the current use of imprisonment for young offenders.  The incarceration of young, often disturbed individuals, in an environment of violence and intimidation, rife with the abuse of drugs and sexual harassment, with little or no provision for care and rehabilitation, is morally and socially unjustifiable.  The demands put upon the officers of the prison service by the over-use of the system are unreasonable and dehumanising. The prison service ought to be raised significantly in public standing.  It ought to become part of a greater body of specially trained carers entrusted with the vital educational function of restoring to society, where possible, those who have become habituated to a life of crime.</P>
    <P>We support the use of voluntary tagging, and open prisons.  We support the imposition of fines, instead of custody, allowing for the likely means of the offender.  We support schemes whereby offenders are required to make good the offence, inasmuch as this is feasible.  We regard as highly desirable the use of counselling for offenders, combined with whatever measures are taken to make them aware of the gravity of their <Col N="1942" /> offence.  We believe strongly in the provision of a counselling service for the victims, particularly of violent and personal crime.</P>
    <P>We defend the right of all citizens to equal access to law and justice.  We believe the legal system at all levels should be radically updated and democratised. In particular, every effort should be made to ensure that the legal institutions do not reflect the ideology of any particular class of society.  Access to legal aid and the quality of legal aid obtained should in no way be determined by an individual's ability to pay for such aid.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, the failure of this Government and, indeed, previous Governments to adopt and implement the provisions of the Whitaker report is deplorble.  It is generally recognised that the conditions in our prisons, particularly in Mountjoy, condemns prisoners to subhuman conditions.</P>
    <P>The lack of sanitary facilities is particularly demeaning to inmates.  The morning ritual of slopping out is an affront to our claim to be a civilized country.  We believe that the bulk of crime committed in our society derives from unjust and oppressive economic and social structures, rather than from any inherent human destructiveness, and that the current attitudes and practices of criminal justice tend to reinforce those unjust structures and to increase the rate of crime in our society.</P>
    <P>In a supposedly Christian society where we are supposed to show mercy &mdash; as Christ did &mdash; to those who offend us, it seems that whereas Christ forgives sinners, we seem to be unable to forgive those who offend us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The current crimes of rape, murder and indecent assault understandably repel the average man and woman.  The acts in themselves are so repulsive that there is a natural outcry for justice when these crimes occur.  When it appears that justice is not done then understandably the outcry turns to outrage. Like Deputy Higgins and other Deputies, it is not dificult for me to find instances which outrage me and which <Col N="1943" /> outrage my constituents and, on the basis of the partial knowledge which we have available to us, which outrage most people.  On the surface this Bill appears to have some not inconsiderable attractions. The idea that there should be some system of reviewing sentences is in principle a very good one; courts are human institutions, they are fallible.  However, the Bill before us falls far short of what is required.  It has been described accurately by the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Kavanagh, as hastily conceived and not very well drafted.  The Bill has many shortcomings.  This issue, as the House is aware, has been with the Law Reform Commission for some time.  It is a very complex issue.  The commission are better equipped than anybody to review and research the issue.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, has put it on the record of the House that he has requested the Attorney General to prompt the Law Reform Commission to speed up their examination of the whole process.  I wonder then, why the Bill is introduced at this time.  If the Bill was a perfectly drafted and well-crafted instrument I would say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to its sponsor, however, it is far from being well drafted</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews made the point last night that the provisions of this Bill are, in essence, a copy of the English Criminal Law Act of 1988.  While the provision of an English Act may suit the conditions of the English courts they do not necessarily suit ours.  We apply more rigorous standards here which arise in no small part from the fact that we have a written Constitution; they have none.  Moreover, their judicial procedures have proven so shaky in many cases in recent years, particularly where people who are Irish or who have Irish extraction were involved, that I wonder at their provisions commending themselves so fully and so forcibly to Fine Gael.  I was amazed at the views of Deputy Jim Higgins which were put on the record on this particular aspect and, specifically, his assertion that high standards of justice <Col N="1944" /> apply in the courts of our nearest neighbour; they do not.  The recent experience of Irish people who have sought reviews in British courts suggest that their review procedures, whether on sentences or on procedures affecting an accused, are far from a model.</P>
    <P>In points of important detail the Bill fails to do justice to this very serious issue.  Deputy O'Keeffe has not produced a convincing argument that his proposals do not militate against the principle of double jeopardy.  I accept there is a difficulty here if, on the one hand we want to retain the principle that there should be some form of reviewing sentences, particularly where the sentences appear to have gone off the rails.  In those circumstances it is difficult to bring the two principles together but at a minimum the sponsor of a Bill such as this should address that issue.  It is an important issue, it goes on the heart of justice.  By ignoring that issue, either Deputy O'Keeffe is suggesting that it is a matter which is of no consequence to him and, as a lawyer, I cannot believe that is the case or, alternatively, he is suggesting &mdash; by his silence on the issue &mdash; that he does not wish to deal with it because it is an issue of some difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not deal adequately with the problem of a time limitation on the State appeal.  This point was made by Deputy Wallace.  How long is the possibility of a further trial to hang over a defendant like the sword of Damocles? There is surely an issue of justice here.  If Deputy O'Keeffe had considered his Bill in great detail, or in the detail he would suggest to this House, if the proposals were well thought through, this is an issue that would be addressed.  When <Col N="1945" /> Deputy Kavanagh suggests that the Bill looks as if it has not been thought through this is surely an area where the truth of those words is proven.  More importantly Deputy O'Keeffe does not deal with the issue of protecting a case against prejudice. What happens when a sentence in a particular case does cause an outcry? These are the types of case where there will be a call for a review of a sentence yet, if such a case is to go back to the courts, how will the defence treat the understandable media coverage of the particular event?  How is the issue of prejudice to be treated?  The Bill is silent on this issue.  Perhaps that cannot be put into a Bill; I accept there are drafting problems but, at least, it should have been covered in the contributions on this Bill made by the various spokespersons from Fine Gael as they presented their case to this House.  They have failed to do so.  That is a very serious matter and yet it is swept under the carpet.  Does Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal mean that the media will be hogtied by consideration of an issue being <i>sub judice</i> until the Director of Public Prosecutions, or whoever it may be, decides that the issue is not to go back to the appeal system?</P>
      <P>It is not so many months since Fine Gael in this House were vehement about the need to defend the <i>sub judice</i> principle and yet, by definition, if there is a possibility of a review there will inevitably be a period of over-hang in which anything that is said could be regarded as prejudicial to that review.  How is this issue to be handled?  I accept that in a Bill which is put forward by a spokesperson from an Opposition party it is difficult to deal with that.  The fact that that matter is difficult to deal with simply bears out the point that has been made already by Deputy Wallace, and made last night by the Minister, that this is an issue of such complexity that we should be sufficiently patient &mdash; not patient for an interminable time &mdash; to await the views of the Law Reform Commission on this matter.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not tell us, nor does its sponsor, how legal aid is to be handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1946" /> What happens if a defendant exhausts his or her resources defending a case at the first trial?  Who is to carry the cost of the second trial?  How will this matter be dealt with?  This is important and again it goes to the heart of justice.  Obviously a person who has defended a case in the first instance in, say, the District Court and then in an appeal to the Circuit Court, will have exhausted his or her physical and financial resources.  How is that person's right to be vindicated? While we must be concerned with the rights of the victim, as a just society, a society where standards of justice prevail, we must ensure that justice is done both to the accused and the victim.</P>
    <P>Would Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill not in some cases mean a defendant is faced not just simply with double jeopardy but with treble jeopardy when, for example, a case moves from the District Court to the Circuit Court and onwards and is subsequently subject to review?  This is important but it is not dealt with in this Bill.  These are not mere issues of drafting; they are not simple issues that can be dealt with by amendment.  They are of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>Several speakers here tonight and previously have made the point that one of the big issues here is not just an appeal against inadequate sentencing but uniform standards.  Deputy O'Keeffe made an intriguing contribution when he introduced this matter.  He suggested that under existing circumstances judges cannot get together to consider the issue of sentencing policy because of some parsimony on the part of the Minister.  Oddly enough, I wrote to the Minister about that issue some time back and I took the trouble to find out the exact position. With due respect and without wishing to cause offence to Deputy O'Keeffe, his assertions in this important matter have fallen short of being either complete or even truthful.  Deputy O'Keeffe himself referred to this.  Of course, there are meetings organised by the President of the District Court.  That is well known, acknowledged and is not in question. What is in question is the position in the <Col N="1947" /> higher courts.  The judges here also meet regularly.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Keeffe is suggesting that the Department of Justice regularly pay for the attendance of judges at meetings abroad, that is a fact.  It has not just been brought into existence by this Minister.  Also the Minister and the Department have agreed over the years to pay any reasonable costs for meetings, and there is no evidence that there has been an application by judges which has been denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill the power is given to the Director of Public Prosecutions; the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is one for which I have considerable respect, and that respect is not always shared on the Fine Gael benches. In the two and a half years since I have been a Member of this House I have regularly heard the rights of the Director of Public Prosecutions in a case questioned, yet when it comes down to it we all know we have created an institution whose decisions we cannot question here. I wonder at the wisdom of giving these powers to the Director of Public Prosecutions. There is at least a serious point to be debated here whether this function should go to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General.  I do not think the issue is fully thrashed out here.  I realise that can be changed by an amendment to the Bill, but when we look at all the issues I have put before the House, the fundamental flaws in this Bill <Col N="1948" /> are such that it does not commend itself to the House.  I do not wish to take from Deputy O'Keeffe's industry in bringing the matter forward.  I compliment him on that.  I wish backbenchers on this side could bring Bills forward with the same alacrity, but I suggest that the wiser judgment in this case would be to await the views of the Law Reform Commission and then push for their speedy implementation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Let me reply to the last two speakers here. Deputy Roche outlined all the difficulties about doing anything in relation to this problem.  I had better say nothing about the last decision in case I say a bad word that I am not permitted to use here.  What in the name of goodness is wrong with all our draftsmen and all our able Ministers if they cannot deal with these problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> The Deputy said some of these provisions were not suitable for amendment.  I do not know what cannot be suitable for amendment in any Bill if something is wrong.  He said this is not a perfectly drafted Bill.  Since I came into this House I have discovered that nothing is right unless it comes from the Government side.  All the legal experts we have for drafting legislation are perfect, then we have court cases which reveal something is unconstitutional.  It has been drafted very carefully by the experts, and still it was wrong.  We must overcome the idea that anything drafted by a Member of the Opposition cannot be right.  It can.  We should stop fooling ourselves about the so-called experts who are always advising the Government and who very often get it wrong.</P>
    <P>We got a treatise on English law.  I have brought the Bill into the Chamber to see if I was in on the wrong Bill.  The main provision in this Bill is that if it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that the sentencing of a person in a proceeding in the court has been unduly lenient or that the presiding judge erred in law as to his powers of sentencing, he may, with the leave of the Appeal Court, refer the case for it to review the sentencing of that person, and on such a reference the Appeal Court may quash the sentence, and so on.  All this Bill is concerned with is the fact that sometimes sentences appear to be extremely lenient.  We are not discussing whether English law is perfect; we have motes in our own eyes.  Even on the last issue &mdash; whether it should be the Director of Public Prosecutions or anybody else &mdash; surely with a bit of discussion the Government can easily sort it out or bring in an amendment.  If it does not suit the Director of Public Prosecutions, then surely the Attorney General or somebody else can be brought in.  This can be amended.  I am sure Saint Augustine would turn in his grave &mdash; he is supposed to have said, &ldquo;Make me pure but not just yet&rdquo;.  Everybody seemed to be in favour of this Bill, but somebody will soon have to go for purity and accept that talking <Col N="1950" /> piously and sanctimoniously about accepting this is not enough.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Garland belonged to the Green Party, but I think he belongs to a Utopian party at the moment.  Turning the other cheek is fine, but we were dealing with crimes that were sent to the Central Criminal Court, the Special Criminal Court and the Circuit Criminal Court.  We were dealing with very serious crimes, not petty theft or some such thing.  We are talking about criminals who inflict serious injury on their fellow Christians.  While the Christian concept is the ideal, if one can follow it, there is a need for a deterrent.  Only last night I heard a story of a young couple whose house was broken into and the raider stripped the husband and cut him with a knife as one would cut a sausage.  We have reached the stage where we must decide that offenders should pay for their crimes or the country will close down. There are parts of this city that are getting quite rough.</P>
    <P>There was mention of Mountjoy and other institutions and while I accept that prisoners should, metaphorically speaking, get a fair crack of the whip, ordinary citizens should be given some consideration. I have heard many views on some of the sentences handed down by our courts.  We should be careful to state that not all sentences handed down are wrong, particularly if we base our judgment on a newspaper story or on a report on the radio or television that the sentence was wrong.  In general our people accept the rulings of our courts but we will always come across cases where the sentences appear to be glaringly wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything wrong with having a system under which the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General can be asked to review sentences. At estimates meetings of county councils we always express the hope that the fire brigade will not be called into service but we must provide money for that service, the brigade must be on stand-by in case there is a fire.  The provisions in the Bill before us may not be used in one year, they may be used on <Col N="1951" /> five occasions in another year and not at all in the next three years.  They will not interfere with the rights of people but should be available if there is a glaring injustice in a sentence.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government will not accept the Bill.  I do not intend to give details of cases where people were sentenced, or not sentenced, for specific crimes.  I could give two extreme examples from my county, one involving the death of a person and the other relating to a small theft.  The sentences handed down did not relate to the crimes.  There should have been provision to review those sentences.  We are dealing with serious crimes of violence and we should not allow the impression to go abroad that offenders will not be punished or will get a suspended sentence. We cannot close our eyes to the crime of rape and there must be a definite deterrent. It appears to me that once more the Government are passing the buck.  The House is being given an opportunity to be relevant but it appears that we will be asked to await the report of the Law Reform Commission on this issue.  The recommendation from that body will take as long as the reform on local government and when it arrives there will be obstacles put in its way.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the difficulty of getting free legal aid.  That is not something that will cause any upset to the Bill.  I accept that many problems have arisen in regard to free legal aid but they will have to be tackled on their own. Many of the arguments put forward against the Bill could be advanced in any debate on the importance of free legal aid or how we should adopt a Christian attitude to criminals.  Those arguments mean very little if we do not give power to those who are asked to deal with crime. The Minister should accept the principle of the Bill, amend it if necessary, and ensure that those who have been treated leniently by the courts for serious offences are dealt with by another court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commend Deputy O'Keeffe on the effort he has put <Col N="1952" /> into preparing the Bill which calls into question the sense of fair play and justice that people have when they read about and are involved in cases like those referred to in the debate in the last two weeks.  The Bill calls into question the ability and motivation of the Department, and the Minister, to effect laws that are just, and seen to be so, and allow for the continued independence of our courts.  Members have referred to serious cases that gave rise to public disquiet and, obviously, they came to light at irregular intervals in recent years.  However, it is fair to say that the public comment on many of those cases gave rise to a sense of fear in the parts of the country where the incidents occurred and criticism of the political system and the courts followed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe, and the Minister, that the independence of our courts is fundamental to our system of justice if it is to be seen to operate fairly. While we have often criticised the British system of justice at least they have an appeals system, as we learned in the case of the Guildford Four.  Such an appeal system is not available here.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech the Minister accepted that there is a problem.  I am not sure that the justice we are seeking, and the improvement in the courts and the judicial system we want will be best served by hiving off this problem to the Law Reform Commission who have more than enough on their plate.  It has been said that they will give this issue a measure of priority but I view such a move as putting the matter on the long finger.  If cases arise in the future they will cast reflections on our judicial system and the efficiency of the legislative process.</P>
      <P>The cause of justice would be better served if we had a system under which an appeal could be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to a higher court.  It should by the duty of such a court to determine the adequacy or otherwise of the sentences imposed.  It should be the duty of the judges of that court to protect their independence and not permit an infringement upon their independence by Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> In the course of his contribution on 8 May the Minister told us that there was no similar statutory provision here for discussion of disparities in sentences among High Court judges but there is nothing to prevent them having regular meetings about the matter.  The Minister is giving them the option of having occasional meetings and it is possible that they do hold them.  It might be better, from a legislative point of view, if that facility were available and that a system of reasonably regular meetings took place between the judges of that court so that disparities in sentencing could be brought to light, discussed and determined to ensure an equality of justice by each individual judge, depending, of course, on the circumstances laid before him.</P>
    <P>As many speakers on all sides of the House said, some of these outrageous cases which have caused fear among the public and excited a great deal of comment should be addressed.  If the Minister recognises that there is a problem then obviously it should be dealt with.  Deputy O'Keeffe does not pretend to understand all the complexities and difficulties involved in this area.  Although he is familiar with the legal world, he is broadminded enough to have stated publicly that he is more than willing to allow amendments on Committee Stage to be tabled by the Government and the Minister which would deal with any problems. Without consulting the Law Reform Commission I am sure there is a sufficient range of experience, knowledge of the law and its complexities within the Department of Justice and their contacts to enable amendments to be drafted to the Bill which would allow for a system of appeal to be determined by the Director of Public Prosecutions and enshrined in law by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If we accept that there should be a system of appeal it is like saying that the Minister for Tourism would eventually allow charter flights to land at the various regional airports.  The principle is acceptable; the question is the timing.  It is necessary to have clarification as to <Col N="1954" /> whether the principle of a system of appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions to another court is acceptable to the Government and to the Minister.  If it is, there is a method of dealing with it without referring it to the Law Reform Commission which, although they might give it priority, would still take considerable time to come up with a report and a series of recommendations.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is faulty, Deputy O'Keeffe has already said that he is willing to accept amendments by the Government on Committee Stage which would enable the House to introduce legislation giving effect to the acceptance of the principle of the right of an applicant, through the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, to appeal a sentence.  If the principle is acceptable there should be a right of appeal and the House, as an effective and efficient body, can deal with the problems that might arise instead of referring them to the Law Reform Commission. The Bill could be drafted and enshrined in law if there was co-operation on all sides of the House.  I again commend Deputy O'Keffee for his work in relation to the Bill.  I also wish to thank the Minister for his constructive speech. He knows that there are problems in this area and if there is an acceptance of the principles of the Bill any problem in regard to its drafting could be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have been given the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I commend Deputy O'Keeffe for introducing it and I should also like to thank the Minister for explaining the complex position regarding this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times, over a long number of years, ordinary people have been confused by the leniency of some sentences, but there are many reasons behind decisions which are not apparent to the general public and sometimes, when they hear the details, they understand the reason for lenient or stringent sentences.  No doubt at times judges make wrong decisions, which is understandable, as they are human.  I wonder if it is right to make a <Col N="1955" /> general rule in regard to correcting mistakes because the end result might be much worse than the original position. Maybe the intention is good but we all know that the legal profession are adept at finding loopholes in the law.  Therefore, if this Bill became law, lawyers would devote their time to finding loopholes in it, which was not envisaged by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>As a layman in this field I am not <i>an fait</i> with the details of the legal system but I understand that it is a very complex area.  It is important that issues like the constitutional standing of the Bill should be gone into in great detail.  I understand that if the Bill is passed the Director of Public Prosecutions could be the judge in <i>causa sua.</i> Would this be constitutional? Certain cases of minor indictable offences are heard in the District Court and if, subsequently, the person appealed to the Circuit Court which either changed or upheld the decision of the District Court then the Director of Public Prosecutions could appeal.  It would mean not just a case of double, but triple, jeopardy. These are areas which the legal profession will examine in great detail and they are matters which this Bill has not addressed.  Before the Bill can be accepted these matters should be examined and the best body to do that, to make judgments and to give advice are the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>Another area in which the provisions of this Bill would cause difficulty would be that of free trial because, once there has been a trial, inevitably there will be the attendant publicity and, in the event of an appeal, additional publicity.  Then there will be the Director of Public Prosecutions contending that there can be another appeal.  One must pose the question: how could a defendant get a fair trial on a second or third occasion with all the intervening publicity in the media when people would have made up their minds whether he or she was guilty? Therefore, that does present a problem.</P>
    <P>Since there are inconsistent, lenient sentences being meted out the Law Reform Commission should be requested <Col N="1956" /> to make a submission to the Government having examined all the complex issues raised not addressed by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill and compliment Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on its introduction.  Its basic principle seeks to give the Director of Public Prosecutions power to refer certain cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  All Members will be aware of the inconsistency in sentencing that has taken place in recent years in cases heard in their constituencies.  The provisions of this Bill merely seek to allow another look at such cases in the event of people feeling they have been hard done by in regard to the leniency, harshness or otherwise of the sentence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Ahern made the point that judges are human and make mistakes. That being the case it renders the implementation of the provisions of this Bill even more important &mdash; in that we seek to have a Court of Criminal Appeal so that cases of a criminal nature can be re-examined there.  Deputy Ahern referred to the fact that there are loopholes in legislation which solicitors and the legal profession seek to exploit.  As legislators it is our job to ensure there are no loopholes in legislation and, where there may be any, to have them closed off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is seeking to do is eliminate inconsistencies and loopholes which have given rise to public outcry in recent years, particularly in regard to inconsistency of sentencing in some of our courts.  In my area of Carlow/Kilkenny I am reminded of a Kilkenny soldier who was involved in the raping of a girl and who received a suspended sentence.  There was a huge public outcry over the lenient way in which that appalling criminal case was treated.  I have first-hand knowledge of cases in my area, as no doubt will all other Members of this House.  The inconsistency of such sentencing is difficult for lay people to understand &mdash; such as how a certain offence may be treated more leniently than others.  The House will be <Col N="1957" /> aware of the controversy surrounding the Fairview murder case.  These are just examples of cases in which the Minister would be given an opportunity of taking a fresh look at the position obtaining in relation to criminal law.  The provisions of this Bill afford an opportunity to an independent law officer of the State to refer a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal for re-examination.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any difficulty accepting the Bill in its entirety I might remind him that, on Committee Stage, he would be able to introduce amendments if such proved to be necessary when I know this side of the House would be more than happy to facilitate such amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the many Deputies who contributed to this debate.  It appears that all sides of the House agree that there is a problem and that something should be done to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I very much appreciate the compliments from all sides of the House on the initiative I took in proposing this Bill on behalf of Fine Gael.  While I very much appreciate those compliments I would be even more appreciative if there were now all-party agreement to the principle I propose.  Very simply, what do I propose?  I am saying that there is a compelling case for giving the State the power to seek a review of a sentence where it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that the sentence of a person in a proceeding in a criminal court has been unduly lenient.  It is very clear that such a procedure is a feature of the criminal justice system in other countries. Of course, that is not to say we should automatically import it, but at least it is a precedent as to how the criminal justice system has been advanced and progressed in other countries.  These are precedents we should not ignore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is very strong public support for the Bill I propose.  I had evidence of that in a survey conducted in the Clontarf (Dublin) Garda district area where this very question was put to the people involved in the survey, and the <Col N="1958" /> response was that 92 per cent of those surveyed were in favour of this change.</P>
    <P>The principle of what I am proposing is quite simple and straightforward.  Under this Bill I am proposing to give to the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; in any criminal case which has been dealt with by the higher courts &mdash; power to seek review of sentence.  I emphasise that I am talking about the Circuit Criminal Court where the main indictable crimes are dealt with.  I am talking about the Central Criminal Court where there are very few serious crimes reserved to be tried there, such as murder, treason, genocide and, of course, the Special Criminal Court.  I am not talking about the District Court where crimes of summary jurisdiction are dealt with.  Furthermore, I am not talking about giving the Director of Public Prosecutions power to decide on the sentence. I am merely suggesting that we empower the State law officer to bring the matter before the Court of Criminal Appeal. This would be a review court consisting of three judges drawn from the Supreme Court and High Court.  It would be a matter for that court then to decide whether, in the circumstances, the sentence was proper, whether it should be quashed and replaced by a sentence more appropriate to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>I have included the necessary precautions by providing that no judge can sit in the Court of Criminal Appeal who had been involved in the earlier proceedings. I have also dealt with the powers of the Supreme Court from the point of view of dealing with any point of law of public importance.</P>
    <P>What are the main objections that have been advanced to this Bill?  One of the points raised by the Minister is that there was a similar procedure introduced in the United Kingdom in 1988 and that we should not automatically transplant any such procedure here.  I accept that; of course we should not automatically transplant any such procedure introduced in the United Kingdom.  But, at the same time, surely we have a precedent there which deserves to be examined?  My <Col N="1959" /> understanding is that, since the introduction of that precedent in the United Kingdom, it has worked well.  Furthermore, my understanding is that there have been quite a number of cases &mdash; obviously there is a much larger population there &mdash; which have been reviewed, in some cases in the United Kingdom and indeed in Northern Ireland, when sentences have been increased.</P>
    <P>Our common law system is similar to the one operated in the United Kingdom. What I am saying is that while we should not automatically transplant anything introduced in the United Kingdom into our system we can learn from their experience and should examine their precedents and the way the system operates there.  I believe that their system operates well and we should not allow any feelings we may have about the British system of justice to stop us taking on board that system.</P>
    <P>The second question the Minister raised by way of objection was that of double jeopardy.  This is a phony argument. Again, I have to say that it does not cause any problem in the United Kingdom where there is a similar type of legal system.  The principle of double jeopardy does not arise following the conviction of a criminal.  I accept entirely that it is a basic principle of common law that someone who has been tried and acquitted of committing an offence cannot be charged again on the same count.  It is a spurious argument to raise the question of double jeopardy given that we are talking here about people who have been convicted and sentences imposed.  With respect to the Minister the question of double jeopardy is a red herring.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to refer to the concept of double punishment.  I am not talking about double punishment but rather about a single punishment that fits the crime, which may be greater than the original sentence imposed which may have been as my colleague, Deputy Hogan, stated a few moments ago a suspended sentence for the rape of an 11 <Col N="1960" /> year old child.  I am talking about the imposition of a single sentence and not double punishment.  Again, with respect to the Minister his argument is another spurious one.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to the independence of the Judiciary and said that the constitutional position could be called into question in some way.  The position is that sentences are appealed by convicted criminals every day of the week without the independence of the Judiciary being called into question. Therefore, how could it be called into question if the Director of Public Prosecutions decides to seek a review in the Court of Criminal Appeal?  Again, this is another spurious argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for consistency and uniformity in sentencing. I agree with him.  I want to see far more consistency and uniformity and I suggest that this Bill will be of help in achieving this.  I also accept that on its own it will not as I am strongly of the view that regular conferences of the judges of the different courts should be held at which sentencing policy would be reviewed and sentencing guidelines laid down.  In this way, aided by the appeal system I am proposing, we will achieve consistency and uniformity.</P>
    <P>The ridiculous question of travelling expenses for judges arose.  A High Court judge told me that this aspect is an obstacle and a bar to the holding of such conferences of judges.  The Minister should remove this obstacle straightaway.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the question of public comment.  Again, I suggest that this is not a real problem.  It may be a problem if we are talking about a case going before a jury but surely we have enough confidence in our judges to accept that they are not going to be affected by media comment.  We would not do justice to judges if we were to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister then raised the question of whether the Director of Public Prosecutions should be involved in the matter of seeking reviews.  This is a fair question. In the United Kingdom the Attorney General is involved in seeking a review. <Col N="1961" /> I am open to argument on this but I think the Attorney General should be involved in cases here.  I took into account the fact that the Attorney General has a quasi-political role and that in the United Kingdom the Attorney General is a law officer to the parliament whereas in this country he is a law officer to the Government.  If it is the view of this House that it should be the Attorney General and not the Director of Public Prosecutions who should be involved, fair enough, that is not an obstacle for me.  Similarly, the point made by the Minister on the question of a time limit was a very good one. I accept entirely that there should be a time limit within which the law officer would have to make the decision as to whether he should seek a review.  This matter can be covered under the rules of court or, if thought necessary by this House, by way of an amendment to the Bill.  There would be no problem about doing this on Committee Stage.  It is an excellent point but one that is very easily resolved.</P>
    <P>The question of legal aid was also raised by the Minister but, again, this is capable of resolution and does not touch the central principle we are discussing.  In relation to the question of a District Court appeal to the Circuit Court, I have made it quite clear that we are talking about serious crime.  This point can be dealt with on Committee Stage and the Minister is well aware that it is not my view that we provide that such cases should be capable of review within the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister's main defence in not agreeing to give this Bill a Second Reading is that he wants to get the views of the Law Reform Commission.  This question has been before the Law Reform Commission for four years who are an excellent body but who are inundated with work on both the criminal and civil side.  They cannot cope with their work load and for this reason I have consistently proposed that a separate criminal law reform commission be established, as if we fail to do so we will never update or codify our law.  It is not a defence to say that this matter should be <Col N="1962" /> dealt with by the Law Reform Commission as they have had this question before them for four years without touching it.  It is also relevant to note that when the Law Reform Commission do produce a report in many instances it is left to gather dust and in others, as happened in the case of that notorious Larceny Bill, memories of which will stay with the Minister for some time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Larceny Bill, let me say that the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission were largely ignored.  Very simply the Bill provides for the review of sentences which are considered too lenient.  I seek support from the House on the central principle.  The review will be carried out by the Court of Criminal Appeal at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General, if the House so decides.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, has accepted that occasionally mistakes are made and that sentences are imposed which do not fit the crime, yet he has indicated that he intends opposing the Bill on the basis that legislation should only follow a detailed and expert examination. He is either unaware or has chosen to ignore the fact that such a detailed and expert examination has been carried out.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure is chaired by a Supreme Court judge, Niall McCarthy, and comprises of judges of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court, <Col N="1963" /> the President of the District Court together with representatives of both branches of the legal profession and other experts.  It is my information that this high powered committee recently completed an examination of this issue and that their recommendations fully support the central principle of the Bill that sentences should be capable of review.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister is committed to a do-nothing policy he should agree to give the Bill a Second Reading.  If he does so I give a commitment to allow reasonable time for the tabling of Committee Stage amendments and, in addition, to give the fullest consideration to any such amendments. On the basis of the examination and report of the Committee on Court Practices and Procedures, the Minister's defence is exploded.  There is no reason whatever that this Bill should not be passed on Second Stage and the various points which have been legitimately raised can be debated and decided upon on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that a contribution was made <Col N="1964" /> by the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>The spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats indicated that she was in favour of the principle &mdash; I am talking about a principle on Second Stage.  I would have to say to the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats who presented the argument very well, that in some ways that little party reminds me of St. Augustine who prayed that the Lord would make him virtuous, but not just yet.  The chance for the Progressive Democrats is now.  If they agree with the concept then they will support the Second Stage.  If they do not support the Second Stage then they simply do not agree with the principle.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I am asking all parties to support the principle of this Bill and we can then have a reasoned debate on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 27, after &ldquo;effect.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Persons whose basis of assessment has been changed by the provisions of this section, may claim a personal tax free allowance of £800 and PRSI allowance of £286, where they pay the full rate of PRSI  applicable to Case I or II of Schedule D taxpayers.&rdquo;. </P>

      <P>Before the debate adjourned I said that I doubted that the Minister would be able to accede to Deputy Noonan's amendment due to the cost involved but there is an irrefutable case to be answered in the future.  I would advise the Department and the Minister to approach this problem next year by increasing the tax free allowance or alternatively, levelling out the pay increase by abolishing the PRSI and the PAYE allowances, which is not really a runner because it would be impossible to do this due to the political fall-out.  People would <Col N="1967" /> not accept having their allowances drastically cut but it is an alternative in levelling the playing pitch.  But it would be impossible to defend any future legal or constitutional action against it.  Irrespective of the legal merits or otherwise it would be unjustifiable now that the self-employed are going to be assessed on a current year basis not to give them the same allowances as everybody else.  The IFA, in particular, have been making a strong case to members of all political parties in this House to pressurise the Minister on the matter.  Long before it was the accepted wisdom in my own party I always made the point that farmers and the self-employed and, indeed, all taxpayers should be taxed on the same basis.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of nonsense as well as some good ideas expressed about farmer taxation.  There will always be a problem until one system is devised for everybody. There is a great deal wrong with the direct taxation system of assessing people on accounts.  Deputy Noonan will remember that I have always said that every self-employed person should be taxed on the same basis and if the system is found to be bad it would be the same for all sections of the population.  The difficulty arises in that there are different rules for farmers. Now that there is almost a level playing pitch there is no longer a case to be made for giving PAYE or PRSI allowances to PAYE taxpayers only and the Minister for Finance will have to concede that in the future.  I recognise that the cost of the proposal for this year would be in the order of £50 million or £60 million and that that has not been provided for in the budget.  As I said earlier today, income tax revenues, particularly from the self-employed, may be down this year, and therefore I concede that it would not be possible for the Minister to readjust the position now.  That is why I think Deputy Noonan's amendment will fall but there is an irrefutable case for change in this area which will have to be conceded in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unfortunate that in the previous legislation before the <Col N="1968" /> House an amendment which addressed this problem fell but I will not discuss it retrospectively.  This amendment approaches the problem in a similar way but also deals with other categories which, in equity, is probably correct.  I would have to have regard to the Minister's response as to whether we can afford to implement this proposal.  Let us put the argument as it was originally put to all of us, to the Government side as well as to those in Opposition, for the family farm and those working on the farm.  When the ICMSA campaign for farm tax failed or was rejected by the Minister on the basis that it was a fair tax, particularly for those farmers in smaller income categories, the Labour Party in particular, as well as other Opposition parties, immediately envisaged the anomaly that has now arisen whereby family farms do not get the same tax free allowances as other families with two working spouses.  Those people can benefit by over £2,000 more than family farms.  We are anxious to try to address that anomaly and we hope the Minister will be progressive in his attitude to the case we have made.  He might say this amendment goes too far in that it includes all Schedule D taxpayers but we hope that between now and Report Stage the Minister will consider the anomaly that has arisen.  Farmers are now taxed on a current year basis of assessment whereas heretofore they were retrospectively assessed.  As has been rightly said, it was in that context that the £800 allowance was introduced for PAYE workers. Never at any time in making this case did the ICMSA suggest that there should be any loss to the PAYE sector because they share our view that that sector is overtaxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope the Minister will address the anomaly whereby family farms do not get this tax allowance and also the anomaly whereby a farmer's son who works on the farm is not treated in the same way as other PAYE workers in that he cannot claim the £800 tax free allowance, in spite of the fact that he would be included on a tax deduction card in the same way as any other employee.  If he did the same <Col N="1969" /> work for his neighbour across the road and received the same wages, he would qualify for the £800 allowance.  This discriminates against the family farm and the concept of the family which the Constitution defends so strongly.  All of us who have made cases here about equality in taxation feel that families should be given preference under all tax codes and in regard to all benefits.</P>
    <P>I said on Second Stage, in support of my colleague, Deputy Taylor, that there is a belief that incentives should be given to small family farm units so that people will remain on the land where they are happy to work.  If these incentives are not given, the people will leave the farms, thereby adding to the problem of unemployment and emigration.  We should legislate in every way possible to keep these people on their farms.  This amendment addresses the matter to some extent but it is quite wide and I am anxious to hear the Minister's response to it.  I would ask him to take on board our suggestion that he introduce an amendment on Report Stage to deal with the case made by the ICMSA.  It could be addressed by Government and would get widespread support from all the Fianna Fáil Deputies who, I am sure, have also lobbied the Minister.  We do not want to put down markers for the sake of putting them down.  We want to address the problems and the anomalies and I hope the Minister will respond positively in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <P>This is a very important amendment.  I cannot fathom how a House of Parliament can accept that a certain section of the community should find themselves worse off than any other taxpayer.  This is a very important amendment in so far as the agricultural community is concerned and I was glad to hear Deputy McCreevy's comments on this matter.  It is on the floor of this House that we should correct an anomaly in the tax system which is clearly working against the best interests of a certain group of people.  I am referring to the farmers and, indeed, the self-employed.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a number of matters in so far as this amendment is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1970" /> The Government saw fit to change the tax system to a current year basis of assessment, but that was not done overnight. It is something the Minister and the Department hatched out over a number of years and there is nothing wrong with it, but we must remember that we also have to take note of the problems that certain industries will come up against when such changes are made.  The Minister has turned his back on the biggest industry in the country. Sufficient notice has not been taken of the system by which family farms earn their income.  As I understand it, on a current year basis of assessment, tax is paid in two instalments.  During the first half of the year the self-employed and the farmers have to pay what is believed to be their fair share of tax, calculated on their perceived income for that year.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, most farmers, so far as their expenses are concerned, do not actually have an income as such for the first six or eight months of the year, for example, people who grow beet and those who rear cattle.  They do not get their hands on a pound of &ldquo;lolly&rdquo; until the end of the year and at that stage they have actually paid their two instalments. Taken against that background there are many farming families who will pay tax on an income on which they will not lay a hand for a few months after paying the tax.  The Minister is aware of that system because he comes from a farming constituency. When this section was drafted, however long ago, sufficient notice was not taken of the tax take and how it was to come from the agricultural community on a self-assessment and current year basis.</P>
    <P>Sufficient notice has never been taken &mdash; indeed, the responsibility falls on all of us in this House that we do not say it often enough, and this is an opportunity to do so &mdash; of the contribution that families, and particularly spouses of one description or another, make.  I am not aware of any successful farmer, whether big or small, who succeeds in the world of farming unless it is a joint effort on behalf of both the husband and the wife.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> I do not believe one can obtain all the farmer of the year awards without the contribution of a spouse; one must take the good with the bad.  You can be assured that if they want to earn a reasonable living on the land, because of the very low incomes by and large, in agriculture, if there is not a combined effort on behalf of both spouses that farm will fail.  Anybody outside this House looking at the Finance Bill would say that Dáil Éireann has something against every farming family in the country.  That is not good enough.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to say &mdash; I do not accept some of the previous statements I have heard from the Minister for Finance and other Government Ministers on this issue &mdash; that it is too expensive to change. Nothing is too expensive to change if the system is wrong.  That is the point.  If the system is wrong it is up to us and the Minister to change it.</P>
    <P>When the planners were in action and when it was decided to collect the tax on a current year basis it should have been made known at that time that it would put enormous pressure on farming families and that it would be inequitable, as now seems to be the case.</P>
    <P>I take with a grain of salt all the pious platitudes which I hear from the Opposition benches that it is important that this should be changed as it is unfair.  There is no point in having a parliament or a Finance Bill if everybody believes that something should be changed and still we do nothing about it.  I hope the Minister will spell out exactly what this would cost. It is not now that he should be costing it, it should have been done when the idea was conceived of taking tax on a current year basis.  I understand that the Commission on Taxation have also suggested that farmers and the self-employed generally should be on the same level playing pitch as everybody else.  It will not be enough for the Minister for Finance of the day to say: &ldquo;It is too costly, we cannot touch it&rdquo;.  There is no point in throwing the ball to this side of the House and saying: &ldquo;It is a pious platitude on behalf of the Opposition and when one is in <Col N="1972" /> opposition one can say such things&rdquo;.  I acknowledge that, but what I am saying is that a monumental mistake was made when the idea of payment of this tax on a current year basis was hatched.  The Minister should have known extremely well what would happen.  It is incumbent on the Minister and on the Government to ensure that this anomaly is removed as quickly as possible.  It is not enough to tell the House that because it will cost so much we cannot change it.  No other sector of the community would accept that kind of treatment.  I have no doubt from the tremendous lobbying, certainly in my constituency, by both farming organisations, the ICMSA, the IFA, and by every other person I have met, that it is important that their views be brought to the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>There is no way that a sector as large as the agriculture sector and the people who make up that industry can be treated as second class citizens.  If this amendment is not passed a huge section of our people will be relegated to second class citizens.  That is something which I hope the Minister would not want to happen, I certainly do not want it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to place on record that I also support this amendment.  I, too, was formally contacted by both farming organisations, and particularly by the ICMSA.  There is an unanswerable case here.  It is probably fair to say that every politician who reaches the rank of Minister for Finance or, indeed, any ministerial office, would wish to leave behind at least one item of legislation by which he or she can be remembered to his or her credit.  I have absolutely no doubt that Deputy Reynolds, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, would want to have the same credit left behind before he aspires to higher things.</P>

      <P>In this House we preside over the drafting of legislation.  Occassionally laws are sent to the Supreme Court to test their constitutionality when <Col N="1973" /> they leave this House.  In those cases we are not sure whether they are constitutional. In this case it is very clear that there is discrimination and an anomaly which should be addressed on the floor of this House before the Bill leaves it. The only people who can apply themselves to rectifying this problem are the people who have brought about the anomaly in the first place.  The change to bring about the same method of taxation for PAYE workers and farmers will result in blatant discrimination against the farming community; husband and wife family team and the family farm.  If that happens this Government will preside over something which we know is unjust and which will have the consequence, before the end of this decade, of the disappearance of at least 40,000 farms of under 30 acres throughout the country. That will have a social impact of enormous consequences.  I would like to think that the figures and statistics which have been supplied by the farming organisations which stand up are being addressed by various members of the Government parties &mdash; even though it is a temporary little arrangement.  Once they have accepted that fundamental principle the Minister for Finance, in his benign office, should see to it that this discriminatory anomaly is dealt with.</P>
      <P>There never was any shortage of money in the Fianna Fáil Party.  There never was a shortage of money to deal with the problems when they were on this side of the House.  Indeed, these benches were always awash with crocodile tears of what should be done.  A sum of £5 million was floating around the west before the European elections to sort out all the problems.  I am sure the magic wand can be waved again.  The Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, thanks to the good Lord, has saved the country £300 million out of the holy mountain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider that.  A long way back our tax code differentiated between earned income whether from employment or self-employment on the one hand, and unearned income, dividends, rents and so on, on the other.  This seemed a fair, logical and equitable distinction but it went by the board.  If that were put back, earned income relief would be applicable to employers, farmers and the self-employed. In the absence of something like that I will support Deputy Noonan's amendment.</P>
      <P>This Government and the previous Government have been consistently anti-self-employment, anti-farmer.  We had the first example of that in the Finance Act, 1987, when they brought in withholding tax on professional fees, a very blunt instrument to deal with professional people who were discriminated against because they were seen to earn excessive fees.  If they were earning excessive fees, there was a way to deal with that.  The way to deal with it was not to use unfair sections in the Finance Act, 1987, to penalise them.  I had an amendment down on that which was also lost.</P>
      <P>I commend this amendment and I hope Deputy Noonan will insist on the amendment being put to a vote.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I will follow your advice, Sir, about not making a Second Stage speech.  When I made my Second Stage speech I mentioned equality in taxation.  We have inequality at the moment.  If we bring everybody into the tax net on the same basis, that they are paying on the year of earning, we must treat them all in the same way. I do not want to repeat what has been said, but the Minister cannot have it two <Col N="1976" /> ways.  He cannot have them paying tax on the current year and at the same time treat them differently.  In his reply on Second Stage he went on to &mdash; I will not say &ldquo;waffle&rdquo; because that would be unfair to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are some perceptions abroad on this question, and in the absence of any other body raising them I want to advert to the broader question.  I have some regard for the ICMSA.  That organisation has a more acceptable track record on the question of taxation than some others and in their heartland at least, they largely represent farmers who are productive, which, with all due respect to Deputy Connaughton, I would not say about all farmers.  As Deputy Ferris said, there is much to be said for the idea, regrettably now defunct, of a land tax, which was an inducement to production.  It is a pity it died.</P>

      <P>Looking at the equity of what is proposed here, I feel a little like Deputy Noonan earlier today.  He recognised the impeccable logic of the arguments from these benches but felt that when the resources will be made available the issues raised can be tackled. Deputy Noonan performed effortlessly all day when we were dealing with questions of tax, the PAYE worker and all the rest.  I am extremely impressed at the <Col N="1977" /> back up who have come in at this late hour to assist him.  Far from what Deputy Connaughton says about the farming lobby being neglected and disgracefully treated by Dáil Éireann, I think the farming lobby are exceptionally well represented. I am not complaining about that.  If the lobby can convince me of the equity of the argument, I am disposed to supporting Deputy Noonan's amendment, but it is not correct to refer to the origins of this allowance, as Deputy McCreevy did, as being due to the hullabaloo of 1980.  The hullabaloo of 1980 came from three quarters of a million people who were largely the only people paying income tax and the only people paying it on a current year basis. The concession of the PAYE allowance was as much to buy off that head of steam as it was to deal with the discrepancy between the current years and the previous year's assessments.  Manifestly the PAYE sector were disproportionately bearing the burden of taxation and were being unfairly treated.  There is no argument about that.  The PAYE allowance was some concession to that.  It was not just a hullabaloo, it was a fundamental issue of equity.  The perception at the time was that most farmers were paying no tax and the remainder of the farming community were paying only what they had to.</P>
      <P>I accept that the situation has changed, although the figures the Minister gave in his Second Stage summary are worth drawing attention to again.  Of all tax, 88.8 per cent is paid by PAYE workers and 1.9 per cent by farmers, or, to take the Minister's breakdown on average, he told us this morning that the average PAYE worker was contributing £3,080 and the average farmer was contributing £714.  You can prove anything with figures, and this is a question of perception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent an urban constituency and the perception among PAYE workers in it is that they do not have any routes open to them to escape liability under the PAYE system.  The tax is deducted from their pay and that is it.  The perception is that there are mechanisms open to the <Col N="1978" /> farming community that are not open to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that farmers can average their income over three years, to the fact that there is a certain element of stock relief.  There is the perception that generally speaking in terms of declaring income there is some latitude open to the farming community while the same does not apply to those in the PAYE sector.  It is important that that view is highlighted in the House.  The PAYE sector are still bearing 88.8 per cent of the tax burden and the only argument among Members is when we can give some relief to those people.  All Members admit that they bear an unfair and excessive burden.  How much relief can we give?  It is a question of choice.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be sarcastic about the Fine Gael muster on this issue; they represent their constituents and are perfectly entitled to put their point of view but I should like to refer to the debate that took place this morning with Deputies Noonan, Taylor and myself in which we were trying to convince the Minister to use tax reform to take people out of the poverty trap.  We were trying to establish threshholds below which tax would not apply.  We were making the point that up to 18 per cent of the people caught in the poverty trap are taxed under the PAYE system and liable for PRSI.  We were trying to establish a threshhold of £100 per week which one could earn before being liable for tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  We have only a certain amount of resources to spread around and choices have to be made as to who should benefit.  As Deputy Noonan is likely to point out, if some farmers are evading or avoiding tax liability it does not mean that those who are paying should be punished.  I accept the logic of that argument.  I also accept that if farmers are paying PRSI at roughly the same rate as those in the PAYE sector it ought to be taken into account and that the same relief should apply.  However, I retain my position on the question of giving the same PAYE concession until I am satisfied that we are treating like with like.  The situation is comparable notwithstanding the fact that the system is being changed to a current accounting basis.</P>
      <P>I accept the argument put forward by Deputy Ferris in favour of the family farm with a relatively small acreage where all shoulders must be put to the wheel to make a living.  There is a logic in that argument.  However, in fairness to the people I represent, I must state that there is a perception that there is still open to the farming community a method of limiting their tax liability that is not available to the PAYE sector.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Noonan's amendment which I consider to be significant.  I was interested to hear what Deputy Rabbitte had to say about the amendment.  I appreciate what he has said about the PAYE sector, a case that has already been put by Deputy Noonan but, being a native of the west of Ireland he should appreciate the problems faced by small farmers there.  Many small farmers are in difficulties and the granting of the PAYE allowance to them would be significant. The Minister should bear in mind that we <Col N="1980" /> are into a new ball game in that assessment will be on the current year rather than retrospectively.  Farmers will not have the retrospective advantage that they had heretofore.  On those grounds there is a need to give farmers the same concession that applies to the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>It would be unwise of the Minister not to accept our amendment, or at least to indicate that he will introduce a similar amendment on Report Stage.  If he does not accept our amendment it is likely that the issue will be challenged in the courts. If the courts decide that this is unconstitutional I would not like to be the Minister for Finance.  I suggest to the Minister that he bear that in mind.  We are talking about natural justice, equity and fair play.  How can the Minister justify discriminating against one section of the community?  It is not sufficient to tell us that it will cost the Exchequer a lot of money to implement the terms of our amendment.  The Minister should bear in mind that many people, small farmers in particular, are finding it difficult to survive on their holdings and retain a son or daughter to work with them.  The Minister has an opportunity to keep more people on the land and he should make use of it.  The Minister should consider the social implications of the amendment. If he is not prepared to accept our amendment tonight, he should give an indication of his intention to introduce a similar amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to place on record my support for Deputy Noonan's amendment.  I referred to this point in the course of my Second Stage contribution.  A Finance Bill should be an opportunity for a Minister for Finance to move towards greater equity in our taxation system.  While I welcome the introduction of the current year assessment for farmers and the self-employed, it is my view that positive aspects of this have been ruined by the fact that the Minister did not balance it by extending the PAYE and PRSI allowances to those people.  The reason the PAYE allowance was first introduced was to compensate <Col N="1981" /> for the fact that they were the only section being dealt with on a current year assessment.</P>
      <P>In bringing farmers and the self-employed into current year assessment the Minister was obliged, in the interests of equity and fair play, to extend the PAYE and PRSI allowances to them.  We have heard a lot about people in the PAYE sector being in the poverty trap but several thousand farmers are in the poverty trap.  They have to pay income tax but they will not have the benefit of the PAYE and PRSI allowances.  The Minister should bear that in mind. Farming organisations are justified in believing that they are being discriminated against in the Bill.  Farmers are being treated unjustly and unfairly.</P>
      <P>In the interests of equity and fair play, the Minister should extend the allowances to the farming community and the self-employed.  I do not see how the Minister can justify discriminating against one section of the community.  If our taxation system is to be progressive it must be based on fairness and equality. Farmers and the self-employed are discriminated against in this section of the Bill and I hope that the Minister will rectify this on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to introduce a PAYE-PRSI allowance for farmers.  However, I will explain to the House so the Deputies will understand exactly what I am talking about.  This was not cobbled together in a hurry.  Deputy Dukes in 1983 was the first to announce the introduction of a current year assessment. I do not know what happened in the meantime.  Perhaps, as Deputy Mitchell said earlier, that Government could <Col N="1982" /> not get the Department of Finance to fall in with their wishes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to extend the PAYE-PRSI allowance, where the full self-employed contribution is paid, to those taxpayers now on a current year basis of assessment.  I would like to make it clear that the PAYE allowance is &mdash; and always has been &mdash; viewed as an allowance for employed taxpayers, those who pay weekly, fortnightly or monthly, and who, generally speaking, discharge their entire tax liability within the year of assessment.  The primary reason for the introduction of the allowance was to improve the tax progression for PAYE taxpayers.  Notwithstanding the change to a current year basis, it is my view that this consideration is still valid.</P>
      <P>The figures for the average tax payments made by the PAYE sector, farmers and other Schedule D sectors in 1980 &mdash; the year in which the PAYE allowance was introduced &mdash; indicate that the income tax system still bears more heavily on PAYE taxpayers than other sectors.  I already referred to the figures in the debate tonight and I will repeat them.  In 1980 the average PAYE taxpayer paid about £1,130 and in 1989-90 that figure rose to £3,080.  In 1980 farmers paid an average of £597 per head and in 1989-90 the figure rose to £714.  In 1980 the other Schedule D people paid £889, a figure which rose to £2,786 in 1989-90.  It is quite clear that you cannot differentiate between one area of self-employed and another although some people seem to think I should do so.  Somebody raised the question about its constitutionality. The best legal advice has been taken in this regard and the Government have no worries in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major beneficiaries of the extension of the PAYE allowance proposed in the amendment are self-employed taxpayers. However, as I stated during the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, notwithstanding the change to a current year basis for the self-employed and certain other taxpayers, important differences will still remain between the income tax <Col N="1983" /> regime for PAYE and self-employed taxpayers. It is worthwhile to identify at this stage the main differences.</P>
    <P>The self-employed will in general still not be taxed on a current year basis, unlike taxpayers on PAYE.  They will be taxed on the profits of their accounts ending in the current tax year.  Those who have accounting periods ending early in the tax year will effectively remain on a preceding year tax basis.  The tax payment arrangements will continue to be different.  Persons on PAYE will satisfy their full tax liability for the year by the end of the tax year.</P>
    <P>By contrast, under the new arrangements, self-employed taxpayers need only pay at the end of the tax year either 90 per cent of their current liability or the full amount of their liability for the previous year.  The balance will not be due until close to the end of the following tax year.</P>
    <P>Farmers have further advantages, including the right to stock relief, which is not available to the PAYE sector.  A case could be made for other categories of income now being placed on a current year basis, mainly investment and rental income.  Regarding investment income, over the years the income tax code has felt it appropriate to distinguish between the taxation regimes applicable to earned and unearned incomes.  Moreover, the tax allowance does not apply to investment income already chargeable on a current year basis.  With regard to the recipients of rental income, it should be noted that these taxpayers enjoy the same liberal expenses regime as self-employed taxpayers who are taxed under Case I or II of Schedule D.</P>
    <P>I know that most people who spoke do not want to hear the cost of the extension of the PAYE allowance.  This allowance could not be confined to the self-employed; it would have to be granted to proprietary directors who, although on PAYE, are not entitled to the allowance. In these circumstances the full year cost to the Exchequer would be almost £85 million.  The overall effect would be a major reduction in the tax burden of the <Col N="1984" /> self-employed and farmers.  In this regard, it was useful to draw the attention of the Deputies &mdash; as I did earlier today &mdash; to the various percentages paid by different categories.</P>
    <P>With regard to the PRSI allowance, the switch to a current year basis does not affect the PRSI rate levied on the self-employer, the employee element of which is well below that paid by the full rate PAYE workers.  The employee element in the self-employed contribution rate is 1.8 per cent for 1990-91 which compares to the employee main rate of 5.5 per cent to which the PRSI allowance relates.  I should point out in this context that other groups, such as public servants, who do not pay the full employee rate, do not qualify for the PRSI allowance.  When we talk about one category we must also look at others.  The cost of granting the PRSI allowance in a full year would be approximately £33 million.</P>
    <P>I discussed this current year basis with various bodies including the Institute of Taxation and accountants with farming organisations have made representations to me.  I also met members of the ICMSA in my own county and we are certainly not unaware of the arguments being made.  The treatment of the farming community in this year's budget cannot be ignored.  Last year there was a decent increase in the refund of VAT &mdash; up to 2 per cent &mdash; and this year it is up to 2.3 per cent.  There was a problem in restocking in relation to disease eradication and there was a clawback of stock relief which I extended to two years.  I have always been pragamatic in my dealings with the farming community but it must be noted that they can avail of stock relief and averaging their income.  If we want to talk about equity, are the self-employed prepared to give up their liberal regime in relation to writing off expenses, stock relief and averaging of accounts?  That is the only way we will achieve equity. Deputy Connaughton may shake his head but that is the reality.</P>

      <P>I deal with all groups in the tax code.  There was a reference to land tax which is a dormant feature.  I do not want to keep repeating that the system of taxation in relation to farmers has changed so many times.  It takes a long time for any system to settle down and for the Revenue Commissioners to come to grips with it.  This Government decided they would operate on the basis of accounts for a period of five years and examine that position thereafter.  This means that, if one makes a profit, one pays and, if one does not make a profit, then one does not pay.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems I saw with regard to the land tax was that the fundamental principle of any taxation must be the liability to pay which should be taken into account.  Ability to pay <i>vis-à-vis</i> the land tax, was not taken into account.  One can argue that there are certain attendant benefits but a fundamental principle of any taxation system should be ability to pay.  With regard to the land tax there could be one farmer, married with four or five children, with heavy commitments, having borrowed a lot of money, a progressive farmer doing up his place; let us say he has 80 acres and is engaged in intensive dairy farming. Then there may be another fellow engaged in intensive farming in another part of the country, without any borrowings, with, say 80 acres.  Therefore, at £10 an acre we charge each £800.  The fellow engaged in intensive dairying, if he is sufficiently good, could be making any figure one can think of.</P>

      <P>Are Deputies suggesting to me that £800 per annum is all the tax he should contribute to the Exchequer?  I do not accept that as being a fair share of taxation.  I am a rural person myself.  I have said to the various farming organisations, as I met them, that I do not accept that as being a fair share of taxation.  There may be a system in between that will derive better production from the land.  This Government have decided that farmers pay on their accounts as they make money over a five-year period and the position will be reviewed thereafter.  Whether Deputies like to think about it or not, it amounts to approximately £130 million return in a year.  But Deputies must face up to all the other areas.  Deputies should not contend that there are not discrepancies obtaining or that there are not things enjoyed by one section of the community that cannot be enjoyed by another.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland referred to the earned income relief abolished in 1974.  At least Deputy Garland tabled a whole dose of amendments, pluses and minuses, many of which were out of order.  Anyway I will tell him what is the bottom line: the reinstatement of his earned income relief would cost in the region of £475 million in a full year.  Therefore, with all the pluses and minuses he is about £389.95 million short in offsetting one against the other.</P>

      <Col N="1987" /> I think I have dealt with all the problems raised.  I might give the House another example of comparisons to be added to the already long list they have been endeavouring to make all day.  It boils down to a question of how much money is there to go around, what choices one makes, what are one's priorities and what equity one attaches to them.  As far as I am concerned, as Minister for Finance I approach it with a fair and open mind.  I have done that in relation to taxation in my two budgets.  If anybody expected me to solve all the inequities obtaining in the system of taxation in two budgets they had another guess coming to them.  It is just not possible and any reasonable, common sense person will have realised it is just not possible.  I began on the basis of getting to the low paid, low-income earners first.  When I hear Deputies representing certain parts of the country standing up over there saying: &ldquo;we know, we want the small farmers fairly treated&rdquo;.  I should say we all know what is the average income of the small farmer around the country.  We know the figure produced by the various farming organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we some in Dublin 4 also?  As the Deputy has raised the question of small farmer's income, I will deal with it.  The latest figures to be published indicate &mdash; and I am open to correction on this point as we do not have the exact figures with us &mdash; that the income of a small farmer with a wife and family is in excess of £7,000.  In drafting this Bill I had the same regard for small farmers as I had for those in receipt of low incomes and the small shop-keeper on the corner as they are at the lower end of the scale.  I listened to this argument being made time and again in this House but no one did anything about it.</P>
      <P>We have introduced exemption limits, including an allowance of £300 per child, with the result that a small farmer married with four or five children and an income of £7,200 will not have to pay tax. If his income is above this figure by a few hundred pounds he will pay tax at the marginal rate.  I do not believe there are any small farmers in that bracket.  The national statistics, which I have examined very carefully as I do not easily walk away from the need to look at every category, indicate that 29,000 farmers are paying tax.  The small farmers I represent are not in the tax net because of the exemption limits.</P>

      <P>In this debate there have been calls for additional reliefs on the grounds of equity.  I am disappointed that such claims are being tagged on to the proposal to tax the self-employed on a current year basis, which is a well balanced administrative adjustment in the taxation system which has been designed to make things easier for taxpayers and their advisers and to reduce the amount of contact needed with Revenue officials. The simple facts are if I had not brought forward these proposals it is estimated that the sector concerned would pay income tax in 1990 amounting to £279 million.  Under these proposals it is estimated that the yield will be £290 million, which represents a modest increase of £11 <Col N="1994" /> million.  In contrast, I have been asked during the course of this debate, in return for this modest increase of £11 million, to reduce the contribution of that sector by £260 million.  Such a proposal can only be described as extraordinary and suggests, as I indicated at the outset, a distorted view of equity and a lack of understanding on what this system is all about.  Taxation on a current year basis represents an administrative adjustment in the taxation system which has been designed to make things easier for all taxpayers.  As I indicated at the outset, under this system farmers will not pay any more taxation.</P>

      <P>I recognise this amendment is very broad and fails to address the problems facing family farms where at least two members of the family are required to contribute to the income of the family. An anomaly exists and I accept the arguments the Minister made. <Col N="1995" /> In many family farms the spouse is expected to contribute to the family income.  Can this spouse not be treated in the same way as every other spouse? It is quite possible that she may jointly own the farm and I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter.  I accept all the arguments he has made, which I admit <Col N="1996" /> are valid, but the other argument also stands and should not be clouded by employers in the private sector.  I appeal once again to the Minister to eliminate this anomaly.  No one expects miracles but I ask the Minister to appreciate that people are concerned about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 50:</P>
      <P>In page 18, subsection (2) (a), line 25, to delete &ldquo;1988&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1989&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Section 12 (2) established in paragraph (a) that the provisions of subsection (3) &mdash; the relieving provision which provides for averaging where the income for 1990 exceeds the income of 1989-90 by 50 per cent or more &mdash; can only apply where &ldquo;the trade or profession was set up and commenced before the 6th day of April 1988&rdquo;.  It has now been pointed out that denying relief where a trade or profession was set up during the year ended 5 April 1989 could be inequitable in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>In a case where commencement occurred during the year ended 5 April 1989, the &ldquo;old&rdquo; basis of assessment operated as follows in the year 1988-89 it was on the actual basis, in 1989-90 it was on the basis of the first 12 months and in 1990-91 it was on a preceding year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential point is that the basis of assessment for the tax year 1990-91 was a 12 month accounting period ended in the preceding year just as with ongoing <Col N="1999" /> traders who can qualify for the transitional relief.</P>
    <P>The transitional relief was introduced to provide for cases where the profits of a basis period which falls to be disregarded are exceeded by 50 per cent or more by the profits of the new basis period.  This can occur in the tax year 1990-91 in cases where the trade or profession commenced during the year ended 5 April 1989.  However transitional relief is not available to a taxpayer who commenced during that year although he would be taxed on the same basis period as others in 1990-91.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have decided to bring forward the amendment to alter the reference in section 12 (2) (a) to &ldquo;1988&rdquo; to &ldquo;1989&rdquo; and thereby enable traders who commence in the year 1988-89 and who met the conditions to qualify for the relief.</P>

      <P>Chapter II is a major innovative step taken by the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and it is a terrible pity that this entire section must be dealt with in the next ten minutes.  There must be a better way of ordering the business of this House, either by a sub-committee or whatever. I know the Minister for Finance will be glad to get home but I am sure he is not satisfied with this either.  This Chapter of the Finance Bill deals with the new arrangement changing the basis of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would congratulate the people in the Revenue Commissioners who played a part in the drafting of this Bill.  I, as an accountant, as well as other accountants, have heard many crazy ideas in regard to the changes in the basis of assessment.  Perhaps it is a little technical for people who do not practice this <Col N="2000" /> business but for those of us in the business what we have heard is a little nightmarish. This provision is a great step forward and will make this a lot easier for practitioners, inspectors of taxes and so on, because it will allow the Revenue Commissioners to accept one single income tax return.  The self-assessment system which was introduced some years ago was a progressive step but unfortunately for people with two incomes, perhaps a PAYE income and also income from a business, it meant that a file had to be opened by the practitioner when the P60 was returned and the Revenue Commissioners or the inspector of taxes also had to open a file.  This was negativing the great leap forward in regard to the single basis of taxation.</P>
    <P>There are various ways in which the current year basis of assessment could be operated.  I have met people in the Revenue Commissioners and, having considered the matter, their proposal is very enlightening.  It shows that all the people in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are not living, like some civil servants, in a separate world.  As someone who has had negotiations with these people over the years, I am delighted with the change they have made here and I think it will work out very well.</P>
    <P>There are certain provisions in Chapter II with which I do not agree.  One of these is in section 12 which includes the transitional provisions that will apply in certain circumstances.  From the tax year 1990-91 people will be assessed on a current year basis.  Previously, a self-employed person taxed on a calendar year basis was taxed in the year 1990-91 on the basis of his profits for the year ended 31 December 1989 but under the new provision the current year will be regarded as the basis of assessment.  I advised the Minister privately some weeks ago that it is unlikely that there will be a windfall from the self-employed this year as a result of some of the changes being made here, for various reasons which I will not go into now.  The Revenue Commissioners envisage a very small increase in income tax from the <Col N="2001" /> self-employed &mdash; only £11 million, from £279 million to £290 million.  One of the reasons relates to this changeover but I will not bore people with the details now.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in section 12 and I would like the Minister to consider this matter before Report Stage.  For example, if in the year ending 31 December 1989 a self-employed taxpayer made £10,000, previously that is the income he would be assessed on for the year 1990-91 but under the new provision he will be assessed on his income for the calendar year ending 31 December 1990.  If he makes £14,000 in that year he will pay tax for the year 1990-91 on the £14,000 but under the transitional provisions the position would be different.  For example, another person makes £10,000 in the year ending 31 December 1989 but in the calendar year ending 31 December 1990 he makes £15,000 which, under the new provision, he will be assessed on.  I accept what the Revenue Commissioners are trying to do here but it seems very unfair that because the profits for the year 1990-91 are 50 per cent or more greater than the profits for the year 1989, he could be taxed on the basis of the average of the two years.  Therefore, taxpayer B has the option of being taxed on £12,500 in the tax year 1991 whereas taxpayer A, whose profits over the two years are £24,000, will be taxed on £14,000 for the year 1991.</P>
    <P>I recognise the purpose of this provision. I see one individual on the civil servant benches who worked in Schedule D districts and will know exactly what I am talking about.  These transitional provisions are very fair and I agree with the principle behind them but anomalies such as I have mentioned will arise.  I would ask the Minister and his officials to consider, before Report Stage, giving the taxpayer the option of paying tax on the average income at all times if he so wishes or, alternatively, doing away with the 50 per cent provision.  The reason taxpayer A cannot be taxed on the average income is that he has not made 50 per cent more in the second year.  This is an anomaly which should be corrected.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the House, this amendment is about the section 23 relief which, as we know, relates to the construction of residential housing.  In general, the current year basis will not affect the operation of the relief but in certain limited circumstances payments made during 1989-90 in expectation of the relief would not be relieved. Therefore, I have decided to remedy this by introducing this amendment.  The effect will be to allow relief for the 1989-90 section 23 payments against the 1989-90 assessment.  If the amount of the 1989-90 assessment is less then the deduction to be allowed, the balance will be available for set off against the year 1991 and subsequent years of assessment.  Because it is a special relief it had to be dealt with in this manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that this country needs to spend £8.5 billion in order to bring our road system up to a satisfactory standard.  A great deal of that money will need to be spent in the greater Dublin area, and most of it needs to be spent as quickly as possible so as to close the gap in transportation costs between this part of the EC and the rest of the Community.  It is estimated that transportation charges for our goods impose a surcharge of approximately 10 per cent on the cost of our goods comparative to other goods in the rest of the EC.</P>
      <P>What is at issue here is a decision by Dublin City Council to authorise Dublin Corporation officials to undertake consultancy studies for what is now referred to as the port relief road.  Those studies will, at a minimum, cost between £200,000 and £300,000 and I understand that the Minister for the Environment has sanctioned that expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first question to the Minister is to establish whether he has sanctioned that expenditure.  If it has been sanctioned, I put it to him that it represents a gross waste of taxpayers' money.  There is no guarantee that the money will be recouped in whole or in part from the EC through the technical provisions support. I fully recognise that Dublin city in general, and Dublin port in particular, have a transportation problem.  The competent road authority for the city, Dublin Corporation, should take action now to relieve that problem.  The proposal to <Col N="2008" /> undertake these exhaustive studies was adopted by the city council after they had published their draft development plan. It is, by their admission, a proposal which will not bear fruit for at least ten years. I do not believe Dublin city, and in particular Dublin port, can afford to wait that long.</P>
    <P>My second point of criticism is that the available managerial resources &mdash; frequently we hear complaints of how overstretched they are in Dublin city and county &mdash; should be devoted to completing what is an absolute necessity, the western motorway box, linking the Dublin-Belfast road with the intermediate roads and across to the N11 that will link north Dublin with Wicklow and on to Rosslare.  It should be borne in mind that at management level there is an integrated, shared management between the three Dublin local authorities &mdash; Dún Laoghaire is a part of the structure.</P>
    <P>I can recall from my time as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that capital expenditure was never a constraint on Dublin's local authorities in completing the western side of the box.  Managerial incompetence and engineering obsessions have delayed the acquiring of land and the implementation of design proposals.  It is a scandal that the Southern Cross Route will not be operational until 1995, if one accepts the figures that have been made available.  If the last part of the link along the western part of the motorway box was put in place some, but not all, of the transport problems of Dublin city and region would be significantly relieved.</P>
    <P>In the submissions that the technical officials of Dublin Corporation made to various residents' groups, backed up by a video &mdash; I compliment them on the video &mdash; they argued that a substantial portion of the cost of the road will be recouped from the EC Structural Funds. I should like to ask the Minister of State to confirm that the Commission regard the completion of the eastern by-pass &mdash; I refuse to give it its new cosmetic name of the port relief road &mdash; as a part of the national infrastructure which will qualify for what they have referred to as a <Col N="2009" /> measure to offset the condition of peripherality which we find ourselves in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the Community.  It is my contention that that road is a commuter road running from St. Helen's in Booterstown to Whitehall on the north side. If there is access from that road to Dublin city the vast bulk of traffic from the south side will be commuter traffic and I do not believe that the German taxpayer, or the Council of Ministers for the Environment and Transport, will give us money to offset the discomfort of south county Dublin commuters.  Will the Minister confirm that the road qualifies for major national road categorisation under the national plan?</P>
    <P>According to the CII newsletter of 17 October 1989 the road was not listed in the schedule of major road improvement projects for 1989-93.  On the question of costs, I should like to say that the consultancy study will cost up to £400,000 which, in the first instance, will have to be paid by Dublin Corporation.  If I contact the maintenance department of Dublin Corporation I am told there is a three months delay on basic maintenance and they are not in a position to send a plumber to repair a broken toilet or the sink in an old person's house due to a lack of funds.  There is no doubt that the consultants will recommend the construction in some shape or form of a major road which will cost, in today's terms, £200 million.  The plan submitted to Brussels by the Government for port access roads suggest an expenditure of £300 million.  By comparison, the total cost of completing the western motorway box from the M1 to the N11, on the basis of published figures, will be £150 million.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Quinn for giving me some of his time.  I am chairman of the Dublin Port Authority and I have no doubt about the need for this road, particularly the north fringe, from Whitehall to Dublin port. Environmentally it would be to the advantage of the city.  We cannot allow narrow roads to carry heavy traffic.  I am referring to such roads as the Clonliffe Road, the East Wall Road and the Malahide Road which carry very heavy vehicles daily.  As we approach 1992 we will have to make every effort to double our exports if we are to keep our employment on the right track.  I accept that we must spend money to ascertain if the proposed road will cause damage in the area it will pass through, but the most important matter to be considered is that the port of Dublin will not survive if the new road is not constructed.  The port authority have plans to expand their services by the installation of new cranes and back-up services but that investment will be wasted if the access to the port is not improved.  Most of the heavy traffic in Dublin is from east to west and the commuter traffic is from north to south and we must change that trend.  It may be necessary to introduce a charge on commuter traffic using the road in the port area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain briefly what is involved here.  In December 1987 my Department requested Dublin Corporation to undertake a traffic survey of Dublin port and the Custom House docks area.  That study, which was finalised last October, includes recommendations relating to road construction projects, public transport and parking.  Among the main recommendations, were the construction of port access from the airport road to the North Wall, a study of a location for an extra river crossing and an extension of the road to Booterstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal and the Dublin Ring Road would complete a high standard road around the city.  It is envisaged that <Col N="2011" /> houses will not be demolished and the work will involve extensive tunnelling at Grace Park Road, Griffith Avenue, Fairview Village and Fairview Park.  Last January the city council agreed to include the recommendations in the traffic study as amendments to the Dublin City draft development plan of 1987 which will go on public display within the next three to four months.  In the meantime, as directed by the city council, the corporation are proceeding with an environmental impact feasibility study relating to the line of the traffic of the entire route.</P>
    <P>The corporation intend to engage consultants to carry out the feasibility study and I understand that they will very shortly submit their proposals to my Department for approval concerning the scope and terms of reference for the study.  We understand that the cost &mdash; approximately £300,000 &mdash; will be met by State road grants and will not be an imposition on the corporation's resources.  A grant of £200,000 is being provided in 1990 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The draft operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructures which has been submitted to the EC Commission provides for the commencement of the construction of an access route to Dublin Port in 1993 at an estimated cost of £96 million extending from the M1 in Whitehall to Dublin Port, East Wall Road.  The estimated cost of the entire route from Whitehall to Booterstown is £150 million to £200 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Generally I do not consider the proposed expenditure for these studies to be extravagant as we are talking about planning a major road project.  I am sure Deputies will agree that these studies are essential before any major road works scheme commences, particularly when the scheme will cost between £150 million to £200 million.  In the context of expenditure of that magnitude proposed further studies costing £300,000 constitute a small integral part of the process in which roadworks can be designed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> The west link section road from Navan Road to the Galway Road and the section from the Galway Road to the Naas Road are now open.  A further section from the Naas Road to Tallaght is expected to be completed by the end of August or early September.  A public inquiry into the Northern Cross motorway will be held in late June concerning the Naas Road to the airport.  A motorway scheme for the Southern Cross route is being completed by Dublin County Council for submission to the Department of the Environment which I hope will be available as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In view of the expenditure which I outlined a sum of £300,000 is very small.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and for coming in tonight.  It is the middle of a long hard week and you are facing another long session next week.  I should also like to thank the Minister of State for coming in at this late hour to reply.</P>
      <P>CoACT is the generic title given to what in other towns would be known as the Regional Technical College in Limerick. It is a college, in so far as institutions are called colleges, but the schools in which the various departments of the college are housed are scattered throughout the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One school of the college &mdash; if I may call it that &mdash; houses the Department of Engineering and the Department of Building Construction at Moylish.  The second part of CoACT is in O'Connell Avenue, several miles away &mdash; the School of Professional and Management Studies &mdash; which is mostly involved in business. The third school is the Limerick College of Art which is housed in five different locations in the inner city area and caters <Col N="2013" /> for all the courses associated with the College of Art.</P>
    <P>Approximately 2,000 students are registered, 1,998 is the registered total for the 1989-90 academic year.  In student numbers it is far bigger than most of the regional colleges but of course it is overshadowed in Limerick by the size, student population, reputation and the magnificent building of the local university.</P>
    <P>The building in Moylish which houses the engineering school was built in 1974 and it had similar specifications to that of an IDA advance factory.  It had a flat felted roof, metal deck on steel trusses and columns, plastered and painted blockwork, divider walls, tiled concrete floors and concrete brick outer leaf aluminium windows.  Part of the internal area of the building has been converted from a student canteen, library and general purpose area art room to student classrooms simply to accommodate the extra students.</P>
    <P>Additional accommodation was provided by the purchase of second hand prefabricated buildings which were erected at the rear of the School of Engineering. The prefabricated accommodation is over 12 years old.  All the accommodation was provided from the current budget of the college and no capital allocation was made since it was built in 1974, with the exception of £150,000 in the last couple of years for computer equipment.</P>
    <P>The School of Professional and Management Studies at O'Connell Avenue is in two &ldquo;Bantile&rdquo; prefabricated buildings. It consists of two single storey blocks with a tiled roof which was built in 1964.  There is no sports room or hall or no hard surface sports area in either of the buildings.  There are eight car spaces for the staff and any students who would be travelling by car.</P>
    <P>The problems with the School of Art, in terms of accommodation, are extremely difficult as it is scattered throughout the city in five locations. George's Quay, formerly St. Ann's vocational school is the main building; rooms have been leased in The Granary, <Col N="2014" /> a modern office block structure; the same applies to Bruce House.  About two miles away the third floor of the Municipal Technical Institute has been acquired from the City of Limerick VEC, formerly a second level school.  There are also students in the School of Professional and Management Studies.</P>
    <P>Certificate, diploma and degree courses are offered and the certificate and diploma courses are funded by the European Social Fund.  The standard of education and qualification is extremely high.  It is validated, so far as the certificate and diploma courses are concerned, by the National Council of Education Awards.  Their students enter for the professional exams from the various institutes here and in London and achieve extremely good results.</P>
    <P>The quality of the teaching staff is absolutely top class but the problem is that the accommodation is absolutely dire.  When we come to the College of Art, spread over five locations, it is amazing that it has the reputation of being the premier college of art in the country.  It is a national institution in so far as it draws students from all over the country. With the exception of the initial funding in 1974 they received no capital funding of any sort up to 1989 when £150,000 was provided for computers.</P>
    <P>Third level education in Limerick was treated well by Governments in recent years.  An enormous amount of money was put into the construction and development of the university.  But there is this huge number of students who have to be educated in the most inadequate accommodation anywhere in the country.  There are now almost 2,000 students in dire need of proper accommodation. I would ask the Minister to treat them no longer as the forgotten third level students of the country; they should no longer be treated as a Cinderella group.  Their needs are as great as those of any of the other locations with regional colleges.  There are more students being catered for there than in most of the independent regional technical colleges elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>That is my case.  I understand that <Col N="2015" /> funds are being provided by way of the EC Structural Funds programme for third level education accommodation.  I understand there is a major budgetary allocation which will be used by the Minister in providing increased and better facilities and the upgrading of existing ones.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State in 1990 to include the CoACT Colleges in Limerick.  The solution is fairly simple. The School of Professional and Management Studies and the Engineering and Business School should be located on the one campus at Moylish Park.  The College of Art, now in five locations, should be housed in one building in down-town Limerick.  I am not suggesting that the College of Art should be taken out of the centre city area.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having allowed me raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming in at this late hour.</P>

      <P>Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology comprises three schools &mdash; the School of Engineering, the School of Art and Design and the School of Professional and Management Studies.  The college provides an extensive range of courses.  The courses are at craft, certificate, diploma and degree levels and are provided on whole-time, block release, day release, part-time and evening bases.  As the Deputy said, the School of Engineering is divided into five departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The School of Art and Design provides design courses in fashion, products and graphics; art courses in painting, printmaking and sculpture and a diploma for art and design teachers.  The School of Professional and Management Studies lays on courses in accountancy, marketing, economic science and German. As the Deputy said, the college operates <Col N="2016" /> in a number of different locations throughout the city, the School of Engineering being located in the Moylish Park campus.  The School of Professional and Management Studies is located in prefabricated buildings of approximately 1,200 square metres in O'Connell Avenue and caters for over 400 students. The School of Art and Design has an enrolment of approximately 400 students.  Again, as the Deputy said, courses are conducted in five locations.</P>
    <P>The Department have received proposals from the City of Limerick Vocational Education Committee with regard to the consolidation of the locations of the college.  Accordingly, the Department are aware of the accommodation difficulties being encountered by Limerick CoACT.  Discussions have already taken place with the college authorities with a view to solving the problems of the college.  A detailed study of the requirements of the college is now being conducted by the Department in the context of a proposed building programme which will involve modification and adaptation work in VEC third level colleges. This programme is intended to upgrade and enhance the existing facilities of colleges to enable them achieve their primary objective as providers of trained personnel.  Modifications of the colleges are necessary to cater for essential alterations of training programmes and for accommodation of new equipment associated with such alterations.  The programme is also intended to relieve space shortages through rationalisation and improved space utilisation levels.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, provision has been made in the EC Structural Funds programme for the development of facilities in vocational education committee third level colleges.  The CoACT college in Limerick will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 17 May 1990.</P>

      <P>No committee has been set up to investigate safety of sea-going craft but the <Col N="1809" /> Deputy may be referring to earlier statements by me regarding the preparation of legislation to govern the regulation of vessels which carry twelve or fewer passengers on our waters.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by my Department, apply to vessels which carry more than twelve passengers to sea or on rivers, canals, lakes or estuaries.  Such vessels are required to hold a valid passenger certificate and are subject to annual surveys conducted by the marine surveyors of my Department.</P>
      <P>I should explain that vessels which carry 12 passengers or fewer for hire or reward are outside the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts but may be licensed by local authorities under the Public Health Acts.  However, the token level of fines under these Acts and the absence of any statutory safety requirements in respect of such vessels has resulted in the legislation being less than effective.</P>
      <P>As Minister with overall responsibility for safety of life at sea, I am anxious to introduce new safety and certification requirements in respect of vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers.  My officials have, therefore, prepared draft legislation which will bring the regulation of vessels carrying twelve or fewer passengers for hire or reward within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  Enabling provision to allow for the regulation of pleasure craft should this be considered necessary are also included in the draft legislation.  The legislation is now ready for consideration by the Government. Once Government approval has been secured, I should hope, with the assistance of this House, to have the legislation enacted as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The organisation and improvement of ferry facilities in the greater Dublin area is a complex issue.  Among the factors concerned are future traffic projections, commercial demands and the comfort and safety of passengers.  The interim harbour board, which I recently established, has had discussions with Sealink concerning the proposed development of the harbour's terminal facilities.

      <P>The promotion of exploratory fishing is an integral element of the Government's policy for the fisheries sector and is aimed at developing additional catch possibilities for the Irish fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants of up to 10 per cent of eligible costs are provided by Board Iascaigh Mhara.  In addition, 20 per cent grants are available from the EC Commission under its structures regulation subject to specific conditions in relation to the size <Col N="1811" /> of vessels participating and the length of exploratory programmes.</P>
    <P>To date, all four Irish projects submitted for EC aid have been successful. These have involved total EC grants of approximately IR£830,000.  A further two applications have just been submitted to the Commission for consideration and I am hopeful that these will also be successful.  The main target species in both applications are blue whiting and argentines.</P>
    <P>With regard to further applications, I understand that BIM are currently in the process of finalising an application in respect of exploratory fishing for deep-water, non-quota, whitefish.  I expect that this application will be with my Department shortly for examination and submission to Brussels.  A programme involving tuna fishing is planned and it is hoped to have this underway by August.</P>
    <P>I should point out as well that there is also a number of smaller ongoing exploratory programmes being assisted by BIM.  These include programmes involving brown and white shrimp, scallops and white fish.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset the promotion of exploratory fishing is a key element of our programme for the development of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Equally important is the take up by our fleet of all available catch opportunities and especially those which are not subject to quotas but could become so in the future.  I have stressed to the fishing industry the priority that it must attach to diversifying the catch.  The State agencies will facilitate the industry in every way they can in pursuing such diversification.</P>

      <P>Production from fin fish cage development in 1986 came to just over 3,000 tonnes of which 2,200 tonnes was salmon and the remainder trout.  In 1989, production amounted to 6,200 tonnes of salmon and 900 tonnes of trout.</P>
      <P>The indicative production targets set by BIM in 1988 for the fin fish sector of the aquaculture industry for 1990 were 9,000 tonnes of salmon and 1,100 tonnes of trout (sea and freshwater).  For 1991 the corresponding targets were 14,000 tonnes of salmon and 2,400 tonnes of trout.  These targets indicated on a technical basis the potential for production but their achievement is, of course, subject to market developments and the planning process.</P>

      <Quest>if there is any record of the number of surviving officers and seamen who served on Irish ships bringing essential supplies to the country during World War II; if any consideration has been given to recognising that service to the country; and, in particular, if he will introduce a special scheme of support and assistance for such survivors who may at present be in need.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recognition of their service to the country during World War II, the Government decided in May 1947 that a medal should be awarded to eligible members of the mercantile marine who served for a minimum of six months in Irish ships between 3 September 1939 and <Col N="1816" /> 31 March 1946.  In addition to the medal, a certificate was granted to qualifying seafarers.  The certificate of service was granted to all those who served in Irish ships however short that service may have been.  In all about 553 medals and 594 certificates of service have been issued.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware of the recent ceremony at which President Hillery unveiled a monument at City Quay which commemorates those seamen who lost their lives when their ships were attacked or sunk during the Second World War.  The monument was erected with the aid of a grant from my Department.</P>
      <P>At the commencement of the Second World War the Government undertook to pay pensions to the dependants of any Irish seamen who might lose their lives. Pensions continue to be paid by my Department to eleven such dependants. In addition a pension and medical expenses are paid in respect of one ship's captain who was disabled as a result of injuries received.</P>
      <P>Surviving seafarers of the period would be eligible for the normal social welfare entitlements and I am not aware of any cases of particular need.  If, however, the Deputy is aware of any such case he should bring it to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare who will examine the matter most urgently.</P>
      <P>The records available to my Department give details of all those who served on Irish vessels during the period.  It is not possible, however, to estimate how many of those seafarers are still alive.</P>

      <P>Information regarding overflights of the state by foreign military aircraft in the twelve months ended April 1990 is set out in the attached tabular statement.  There was no occasion in that period on which permission for an overflight was refused.  Permission is normally granted provided that certain conditions are met, the most important of which are that the relevant aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence-gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of military exercises or operations.</P>

      <P>The EC Council of Ministers approved on 7 May a mandate for the Commission to negotiate an agreement on trade and economic co-operation between the Community and Romania. Such an agreement would complete the Community's network of trade and co-operation agreements with the states of Central and Eastern Europe.  These basic agreements form part of the overall EC approach to relations with these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beyond this, it was agreed by the Special European Council in Dublin on 28 April that discussions would begin in the Council on a further stage in the development of relations through the negotiation of agreements of association with each of the countries of Central and <Col N="1824" /> Eastern Europe.  It was decided that the Community will work to complete association negotiations with these countries as soon as possible on the understanding that the basic conditions with regard to democratic principles and transition towards a market economy are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>In the negotiation of these agreements, and more generally in the extension of economic aid in support of reform, the Twelve will continue to follow closely the evolution towards full democracy in Romania and other former communist states and will monitor the extent to which the basic conditions set by the European Council are met in each case.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to establish if a rebate is due to the taxpayer until additional information is supplied.  The inspector of taxes wrote to the taxpayer on 5 April 1989 requesting this information.  A further request was made via the Deputy on 20 July 1989, but the information is still outstanding.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in reply to two previous questions on this subject on 25 April 1990, my Department operates a scheme whereby service may be transferred for pension purposes, on a reciprocal basis, between participating organisations.  Any organisation in the public or private sector &mdash; including organisations based in Northern Ireland, <Col N="1830" /> Britain or elsewhere &mdash; is free to join this scheme if it is prepared to accept the obligations of membership, including the liability to make financial contributions where necessary towards the ultimate cost of service transfers.</P>
      <P>To date, no organisation in Northern Ireland or Britain has been willing to accept the conditions governing the transfer scheme.  Moreover, the Northern Ireland authorities do not allow service given here to be reckoned for benefit purposes under their public sector pension schemes.  In the absence of reciprocity, it would not be appropriate to allow service given in Northern Ireland to be reckonable here &mdash; such a &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; arrangement would entail substantial Exchequer costs which could not be justified.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to German real investment in general rather than to some specific case. I have no evidence of a general fall-off of investment into Ireland by German firms due to switching of investment to East Germany.  The volume of total fixed investment grew by 10 per cent last year and a similar performance is expected this year.  Developments in Eastern Europe have not altered the considerable advantages which Ireland offers to overseas investors, namely broad competitiveness, an educated, versatile and skilled workforce, good and continually improving business infrastructure and an appropriate tax regime.  The overall impact of East European developments &mdash; taking into account any potential negative impact through relocation of specific investment projects and the additional demand which may be stimulated &mdash; can offer potential for increased inward investment to Ireland provided we retain the advantages we now have.</P>

      <P>The proposed use of a small area within Killarney National Park as part of a golf course is fully compatible with the status of the park as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.  UNESCO policies state explicitly that biosphere reserves, in addition to containing a core zone where ecosystems are fully protected, should also contain other zones where natural ecosystems have been modified for different forms of land use including timber production and grazing, or otherwise altered by human activities.  In a region where tourism is a mainstay of the economy it is quite reasonable that tourism-related recreation should be accommodated within part of a biosphere reserve.  The area in question will continue to be grazed by red deer and to contribute to nature conservation within the national park and biosphere reserve.</P>

      <P>I have outlined my views in regard to coast protection generally when repling to Dáil Questions on 13 February 1990 and 15 March 1990.</P>
      <P>In the case of Ballybunion, I understand that the proposals for coast protection works previously made by Kerry County Council to the Commissioners of Public Works were not processed due to the removal of beach materials.  Any new proposal to extend funds on coast protection at Ballybunion would first have to address the long-standing problem of beach removals.  In this connection, Kerry County Council is in touch with my Department concerning a further order prohibiting the removal of such material in the Ballybunion area.</P>

      <Quest>the cost, to date, of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited; if this cost is in keeping with the estimated cost of the liquidation at the time of the decision to liquidate; if not, the reason for the difference in costs; the Department's estimated cost of the liquidation to the State at that time; his views on whether the real cost could have been less, given the significant improvement in the shipping freight rate; and his views on whether the freight shipping lines which stayed in operation are experiencing a lucrative market at present.</Quest>

      <P>With regard to the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the reply which the former Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gallagher gave to a similar question on 3 May 1988.  The figures quoted on that occasion have not changed.</P>
      <P>The cost of liquidation at the time the decision was taken was estimated as being of the order of £50 million.  Since the majority of the liabilities which the State was obliged to discharge were known, the estimated cost was substantially correct.  Certain costs such as the cost of maintaining the <i>M. V. Irish Spruce</i> and the revenue which would revert to the State on the disposal of the vessel could not be definitively predicted. In the event however the difference between estimated and actual cost was just 1 per cent.  The third part of the Deputy's question does not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the remainder of the Deputy's question, it should be noted that once a liquidator had been appointed to the company, the terms of the State <Col N="1837" /> guarantees of borrowings and of the lease arrangements in relation to the <i>Irish Spruce</i> required immediate discharge of the cost involved.</P>
    <P>During the recession in world shipping demand, virtually every shipping company in Europe found the going very tough.  Indeed over the period the European share of the world fleet was reduced by half.  While the resurgence in demand which has taken place over the last two to three years has been welcome, in real terms freight rates are still somewhat lower than they were at the beginning of the 1980s.</P>

      <P>: I would draw the Deputy's attention to the statement I made on 16 March 1990 on the subject of imported motor vehicles in general, both new and used. I am arranging to have a copy of the relevant press statement placed in the Oireachtas Library.  Briefly, I propose to make regulations, with effect from 1 August 1990, which will make it an offence to supply a vehicle which does not comply with all of the road traffic regulations relating to the construction, equipment and lighting of vehicles.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EC competition rules, imported motor vehicles are only roadworthiness tested prior to being licensed to carry goods or passengers, where the vehicles concerned are in categories for which domestic vehicles are liable to compulsory testing.  In the case of Ireland, these vehicle categories are heavy goods vehicles, buses, taxis and ambulances over one year old.  Light goods vehicles over four years old will be roadworthiness tested by 1 January 1995, in accordance with an EC Directive.  The question of the compulsory testing of used cars and motor cycles will be kept under review in the light of developments at EC and national levels.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if he will clarify the reason diagnostic scanning equipment is still not being utilised in Temple Street Hospital, Dublin 1, further to the fund raising efforts of the Irish Hairdressing Association in raising the money for both the equipment and the staff training; if he will arrange, in view of his previous positive committment in this area, to ensure that this service is made available as soon as possible, in order that children do not have to go to Great Britain for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Funds for the purchase of this equipment were raised privately by the Irish Hairdressers' Federation.  This was done without reference to the board of management of the hospital or to the board's priorities for medical equipment.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to you in my reply to a previous parliamentary question of 24 October 1989 (Dáil Debates Volume 392, column 233) on this matter, the hospital itself did not at that stage regard the operation of this equipment as a priority. The hospital's top priority is the reduction of the length of the ENT waiting lists, for which purpose I have already provided special additional funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Hairdressers' Federation has made an offer to the hospital authorities to provide funding of the order of £30,000 over a period of two years towards the additional revenue costs which the use of this equipment will involve.  This, however, <Col N="1865" /> will not cover the total revenue costs of operating the equipment.</P>
    <P>I understand that the hospital intends to submit a request to my Department to fund the balance of the revenue costs. This request will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for resources and the hospital's priorities for new developments.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out further that the Deputy is misinformed when he states that children have to travel to the United Kingdom because this equipment is not yet in use.  The position is that samples taken in this country are sent to the UK for testing and results can be obtained within 48 hours if necessary without the need for children to travel abroad.</P>

      <P>Public education programmes funded by my Department encompasses a range of themes and are undertaken by statutory and voluntary bodies as well as by the health promotion unit of my Department which was established in 1988.  Prior to the transfer of its function to the health promotion unit the Health Education Bureau was responsible for health education. In addition, health education programmes are operated by health boards within the functional area of individual boards which respond to local needs and priorities.</P>
      <P>The information is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy for the years 1985 to 1987 when the Health Education Bureau was responsible for health education but I have asked my Department to try to extract the relevant figures for the major programmes during those years and I will pass these on to the Deputy when they are available.  The following is a breakdown of expenditure by the programme during the years 1988 and 1989.</P>

      <P>An outbreak of Salmonella food poisoning is defined as any instance involving the isolation of a Salmonella species. Most outbreaks involve one or two cases of Salmonella food poisoning.</P>
      <P>All outbreaks are investigated by the health board through the Director of Community Care and his team in accordance with guidance issued by my Department in October 1984 on the steps to be taken in the investigation of suspected food poisoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the normal course my Department receives full information from health boards only in regard to large or unusual outbreaks of Salmonella.  The numbers of cases of Salmonellosis reported for the <Col N="1868" /> years 1985, 1986 and 1987 did not include any large outbreaks.</P>
    <P>In 1988 there was a large outbreak in the Cork area and the evidence pointed to the consumption of infected poultry as the cause of the outbreak.</P>
    <P>In 1989 there were two large outbreaks. One in Donegal was associated with confectionary products, and one in County Wicklow associated with the consumption of poultry at a barbeque.</P>
    <P>Health boards in discharge of their responsibilities under the Food Hygiene Regulations ensure that proper hygiene standards are maintained in food premises. The CLEANWATCH hygiene programme which I launched in May 1988 has raised the level of public awareness to hygiene generally and my Department has advised the general public with regard to the safe handling and cooking of poultry.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to be precise in relation to the number of physically handicapped people employed in the North West Region of Cork because many physically handicapped persons who secure employment themselves or through family contacts or who become disabled at work and are retained in employment are not officially recorded.  However, 27 physically disabled persons registered with the National Rehabilitation Board were placed into private industry in the region in the years 1987 to 1989.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board provides a specialised assessment, counselling, placement and follow-up service for all disabled persons.  Following vocational assessment, disabled persons are referred to specialised training centres in Cork city, Tralee or Bantry. Where appropriate they are referred for FÁS training or on-job training is arranged for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the problem of under-age drinking in our society and several initiatives have been undertaken by my Department to help combat this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Drug Question &mdash; Local Answers?&rdquo; training programme has been specifically developed by the health promotion unit of my Department to promote a community response to drug problems.  It brings together health and education professionals and interested voluntary workers in their local communities and it places great emphasis on <Col N="1870" /> the problems posed by alcohol abuse.  To date over 400 persons have participated in the course at local level and it has been very favourably received.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit is also targetting young people themselves and in conjunction with the National Youth Council of Ireland, it is developing an alcohol education programme for use with young people, primarily in an informal youth club setting.  Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) is a prevention programme which aims to inform and educate young people about alcohol and the dangers associated with its abuse.  A pilot study of the programme has been completed at various centres throughout the country and final production is now proceeding. It is intended for distribution to youth leaders for use after completion of a short training course.</P>
    <P>Resource materials on alcohol education are also available from the health promotion unit of my Department.  A series of booklets focus on the problem of underage drinking, one for young people, one for parents and one for youth leaders and professionals.  Additional materials cover specific issues such as guidelines towards the assessment of an individual's drinking habits and women and alcohol. An educational video is also being developed which emphasises the need for abstention or moderate consumption of alcohol among young people.</P>
    <P>However health education alone is insufficient to tackle the problem of alcohol abuse.  Measures necessary to address the problem are multifactorial and are encompassed within the remit of a number of Government Departments. Such measures include, for example, access to and availability of alcohol as well as education and health promotion strategies.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Government has decided that the Advisory Council on Health Promotion should develop a national policy on alcohol which will address the broader economic, social, educational and health factors that impinge on alcohol use including the problem of underage drinking.  The council which was established in 1988 is a <Col N="1871" /> broadly based group representing the main economic and social interests in society whose activities impact on health.</P>
    <P>On the question of research, both that which has been conducted to date and any further research that may be deemed necessary by the council, will be considered in the context of this new national policy on alcohol.</P>
    <P>As you are aware, on assuming the Presidency of the EC Health Council on 1 January 1990, I announced that I was adopting the theme of Youth and Positive Health.  In this context, I have been discussing with my colleagues in the Council the position in their countries relating to alcohol misuse and the objective of the Irish Presidency is to identify, with the assistance of the European Commission, the extent of the problem community-wide as a basis for a Community action programme to be agreed by Member States.</P>

In order to qualify under the terms of the circular a school had to be within quota.  A temporary post was allowed in the school in which the teacher in question was employed, for the 1987-88 school year only, as an exceptional matter, even though the school was over-quota.  Such exceptional appointments did not come within the framework of a subsequent agreement to offer panel rights to teachers appointed under the terms of Circular Letter 41/87.</P>
      <P>In any event, panel rights were agreed in the context of a negotiated redeployment scheme for secondary teachers.  The school in which the teacher was employed in a temporary capacity was not of the schools for which agreement on a teacher redeployment scheme was reached.</P>

      <P>I have received a request to meet a deputation regarding this matter.  I do intend to meet the deputation at a suitable date and time and I will ask my office to make the appropriate arrangements when my schedule permits.</P>
