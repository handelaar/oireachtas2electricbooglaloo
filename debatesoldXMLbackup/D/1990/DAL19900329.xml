      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 12 and 13.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that business shall be interrupted at 11 p.m. tonight and the sitting shall be suspended from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.; that the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 12, and the Report and Final Stages of No. 13, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m., respectively, by one question in each case, which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Member of the Government in charge of the Bill; and that the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 5 p.m.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal for a late sitting today agreed?  Agreed. Is the proposal to suspend the sitting from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. agreed?  Agreed. Are the proposals for dealing with No. 12 and No. 13 agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals for dealing with No. 13, Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990: Report and Final Stages, are not agreed.  This provides for four hours of debate for the Report and Final Stages <Col N="1702" /> of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990. Given the debate we have had on Committee Stage, that time is inadequate and I therefore oppose the Government's proposal to guillotine this debate at 11 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the concluding Stages of the Defence (Amendment) Bill and the Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1990.  It is clear from the number of sections that remain to be dealt with on the Social Welfare Bill and the importance of the debate on the concluding Stages of the Defence (Amendment) Bill that adequate time has not been allocated. It is surprising the degree to which business has been crammed into this week when we could quite legitimately sit for another week at least.  There is no reason that the business should be guillotined here tonight and we therefore oppose these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the serious objections which the Opposition parties have to the shortage of time available for both the Social Welfare Bill, 1990, and the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, I wonder if the Tánaiste would consider allowing time next week?  There are no pressing reasons that the House cannot sit next week and I ask the Tánaiste during the course of the day to consider that this House should sit for at least two days next week to give adequate time to these serious and important matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party's spokesman for Defence, I wish to oppose this proposal. Yesterday, on Committee Stage we had time to discuss only 21 of the 36 amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Defence spokesperson for The Workers' Party, I would point out that originally it looked as though there was a clash of agendas between the Tánaiste and PDFORRA; however, PDFORRA have suspended their elections and now there is no urgency to push this Bill through the House.  I ask the Minister to accede to what has been suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clear up a point.  The Taoiseach in this House yesterday said that the Dáil would adjourn for the normal Easter recess.  In my time in this House the normal Easter recess has been Holy Week and Easter Week.  Therefore the point made by the Taoiseach yesterday was totally incorrect and it is quite proper that the record should disclose that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>First, at the conclusion of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, tonight at 11 p.m. we will have had a total of 26 hours debate if we include the four hours allocated today for the Report and Final Stages.  I have sat here for most of that debate on all Stages and I can assure the House that the fullest and most detailed consideration has gone into every aspect of the matter and the fullest, most detailed and constructive consultations are proceeding with the people who are legitimately interested in this matter, the personnel of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>Deputies Ferris and Flaherty raised various points about the lone parent scheme.  This scheme is a very important and valuable development which has been widely welcomed.  I shall bring the scheme into operation by regulation as early as possible.  I have noted the points made by Deputies in relation to the subsections of section 12.</P>
      <P>Although this scheme represents an advance, we must in the future go further and introduce measures which will maximise the opportunities for lone parents to achieve some degree of financial independence. They must be given educational opportunities and the means to develop skills and raise their confidence levels in order to make it possible for them to return to work.  Unless this is done lone parents will be permanently dependent on the scheme without an opportunity of enhancing their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note what has been said in relation to child care facilities and I am anxious to ensure that lone parents are facilitated in this respect.  The scheme sets the scene for the future.  Deputy Flaherty has recognised that we have been putting things in place during the past two years in order to go ahead at this stage with the lone parent scheme.  It is my conviction that we should go further in assisting and <Col N="1718" /> encouraging lone parents to get back into the workforce where they are capable of doing so and where it is suitable for them. It will not be suitable in all circumstances but I believe a substantial number could get back into the workforce in due course. I should like to see facilities developed which would assist them.  This means extra expenditure and must be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>The lone parent's allowance is a welcome rationalisation.  The Minister has given some indication that he will look at two areas of concern. The first of these is the disregarding of earnings and the opportunity to return to work or education.  Yesterday it was stated that certain specific categories of lone parents currently are allowed additional expenses.  Can we be sure that those relatively favourable terms will be extended to all lone parents when the regulations are introduced?</P>
      <P>The other issue is that of cohabitation. The Minister might consider if there could be a more sensitive approach by his officials in dealing with investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night about midnight I welcomed the elaboration of some of the expenses that could be set against means testing in the case of lone parent families.  Due to a breakdown in communications it is sometimes not known that these allowances are available and some of them are fairly tightly means tested.  I asked the Minister if the intention was to pursue spouses who had reneged on their responsibilities and deserted.  That can be done within the jurisdiction here and I asked if the Minister had any plans to go outside the jurisdiction within the EC and in Britain in particular.  Britain has a close working <Col N="1719" /> relationship with the Minister's Department in the area of social welfare contributions, equalisation of contributions, adding together for benefits for people who work here, emigrate, return and work here again, and contributions made in England are taken into account and given credit for here.</P>
      <P>In that close working relationship with the Department is it possible that the Minister may be able to ensure, through either the social welfare system in England or the tax system there, that people cannot just drive away in a BMW and expect the State to take up the tab for their responsibilities?  Deputy Byrne worried about the trauma of going into court, but there is a widely held view that it is time these people made a contribution to their family.  Up to now their spouses have been requested by the Department to pursue them but have often been unable to do so legally because of their inability to benefit from free legal aid and they found themselves unable to claim maintenance in the Family Court.  I welcome the fact that the Department are taking that responsibility on to themselves and that payment to the beneficiaries will not be interrupted in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I continue to express concern and reservation about what ultimately is going to happen on foot of the information the Minister gave us, which has been supported by various other Deputies, about how he is going to define alleged cohabitation.  He said that allegations more often than not are made by people to his Department and that it is not really his inspectors who are out snooping.  That worries me.  I would almost go as far as to say that maybe on occasions I would prefer it would be the inspectors rather than reports from neighbours.</P>

      <P>We politicians have all heard the most incredible, outlandish, <Col N="1720" /> outrageous comments from constituents about the so-called carry-on in the house down the road or the house next door.  I have vivid memories of an artisan dwelling type housing complex where people were buying and letting to young people from rural Ireland, and the scandal put about by people who had lived all their lives in that area about the carry-on was quite frightening, to say the least.  There is danger involved in the Minister acting on such allegations made by people on the street.  You would want to be extremely careful, especially if you are going to try to chase fathers for payments, if the information you are getting from the neighbourhood is that a certain gentleman has been seen frequenting a house occupied by a person in receipt of a lone parent's allowance and that woman subsequently has children.  It is an awkward, delicate area.  I would like some further information from the Minister as to how he hopes to chase up the errant fathers.</P>
      <P>There is nothing more reprehensible &mdash; and we have all experienced it in our contacts with people in the city &mdash; than a husband and father just walking out, thumbing his nose at the family unit and acknowledging no obligations, financial or otherwise to them.  It happens, and I have no hang-up about claiming back some money from such spouses. However, there are more awkward cases. Think of the young unmarried mother chasing the father, bringing him to court, proving paternity and so on.  Section 12 provides that: &ldquo;A lone parent shall not, if and so long as he and any person are cohabiting as man and wife, be entitled to and shall be disqualified for receiving payment of an allowance.&rdquo;  Will the Minister explain how he envisages the classification of living together as man and wife?  Is it a weekend relationship?  There are all sorts of relationships.  How will we apply the definition of cohabiting as man and wife?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, our amendment No. 41 to section 16 which we consider of key importance to this debate was ruled out of order.  By it we sought to insert &ldquo;but such day or dates shall not be later than <Col N="1721" /> three months from the date of enactment of this Act&rdquo;.  The Minister obviously has a fair amount of work to do but, going through this Bill today and tomorrow, it would be nice to know at the end of it all when the scheme for the lone parent's allowance will be implemented.  We would have liked to provide that it commenced within a three month period but as that was ruled out of order I request the Minister to give me some ideas on that.</P>
    <P>If a single parent is in receipt of £53 and some inspector from the Department decides that cohabitation is going on, how will the disqualification be implemented? Is £53 to be just whipped away from the lone parent?  Does the Minister envisage a different approach to removing the allowance?</P>

      <P>What Deputy Byrne and Deputy Flaherty have referred to comes under section 15 but indirectly it has some application in this area.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The High Court do not have any difficulty in understanding the intentions of the operations of the system.  Such schemes are operated in other administrations and it is a control measure which is used very sensitively by social welfare officers.  Of course, an isolated incident will be highlighted and suggestions will be made that this sort of thing is happening everywhere but there is nothing unusual about that.  A person seeking something to which he or she is not entitled will always complain.  When we get the extra money to implement schemes of this kind conditions must be attached to keep them under control.  The control measure in question has operated satisfactorily and the number of cases which the Deputy mentioned is extremely small.  I do not want to highlight that because you do not want to suggest that control measures are not there.  I assure the Deputy that it will be handled with sensitivity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris raised the question of pursuing people outside the administration. It is possible and is part of the system but we need people to undertake this.  The Deputy will be glad to know that preliminary discussions have already taken place with the Department of Social Security in Britain.  Obviously it is very practical as far as we are concerned because of the free movement between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Ferris also raised the question of the means test generally.  Deputy Flaherty was concerned that the test would apply to everybody and that some people might lose out in the process.  I do not know if Deputies have seen the fact sheet, which was published for circulation with this Bill.  They contain the proposals but they are only information sheets with press releases and so on.  These are merely proposals and later on we will get out another fact <Col N="1723" /> sheet bearing in mind what Deputies said. The means test will be the same as that used for the widows' non-contributory pension and it is designed to allow for a certain amount of part-time work. However, that will be spelt out more clearly in the final leaflet following the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Unless I am misinterpreting it, this is the section which extends the requirement of the Minister to pursue the new category of lone parents who have failed to maintain their children.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister effectively admitted yesterday that, although he had the power, nobody had been pursued under it last year.  This year the Minister is extending the power, which I welcome in principle.  When we discussed the Status of Children Act we referred to the fact that other jurisdictions go much further in ensuring that parents, married or single, take economic responsibility for the children they brought into the world.  That is a reasonable position and indeed, in some countries when a child is born without the parent being identified, the authorities require that such identification is made and will even undertake paternity suits, where appropriate.  The Minister gave an explanation regarding the difficulties in relation to this when he referred to the fact that the decentralisation of certain sections of his Department had led to a slowing down in the processing of claims.  I know he has set up a working party which obviously <Col N="1724" /> will also relate to other Departments as well as the Department of Social Welfare. It will also relate to the Revenue Commissioners and there may be legal elements involved as to what he can do. How realistic is this section?  When will it be implemented?  Does it mean that when a person has proved that he or she is a lone parent &mdash; by virtue of desertion or another cause &mdash; that from October there will be no requirement to indicate that they have pursued the matter in a particular way?  Is that the new situation? Will it not be necessary for them to fulfil this obligation because the Minister intends to pursue it?  How realistic is this? When does the Minister expect to have such arrangements in place and what will they involve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated last night that after the move to Sligo the priority was to ensure that the payment of all the different pensions was streamlined.  As Deputies know, new staff from other Departments were transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, which created substantial difficulties in terms of training.  That has now been completed and things are settling down.</P>
      <P>We are also bringing in the full scheme which means that there is hope for streamlining and rationalising the operation which gives us an opportunity to develop other matters, like the question of the liable relative's provision.  A detailed report was completed in January. Its recommendations are now being considered and we will very shortly be in a position to bring into force the provision in regard to liable relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It raises the question as to whether you get a provision in an Act which gives power to a Minister or if you should wait until everything else is in place.  I, unlike many people, take the first approach although it is dangerous because people criticise you.  My colleague in The Workers' Party would be telling me every day that I had powers which I had not used.  If I went the other way, I might be ready to do something but would not have the power and would have to wait for an opportunity to introduce a Bill and <Col N="1725" /> ensure that it is included in that Bill.  I find it is much more practical to get the power and then get the other administrative matters into order as quickly as possible, with all the difficulties that go with them.  I appreciate that that may leave Deputies wondering at times if we are really serious about what we discussed here.  I would normally make it clear that we would bring in the provision as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne asked about the lone parents' scheme and the time of its implementation.  The date I have given is 1 October but I will certainly try to introduce it earlier if possible.  If we were to discuss all the administrative arrangements, it would take a long time because they are quite extensive, as the Deputy may well appreciate, in terms of the different people and the different phases involved.  It is not quite as simple as it looks here.  Deputy Byrne also asked that the allowance, when it is removed, be phased out and that is something we can consider for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy with the Minister's response to the questions I raised.  I welcome the dialogue with the DHSS in Britain and I have no doubt the Minister will get co-operation in that matter.  One question arises from that.  Is it to be taken that it will no longer be necessary for the applicant to prove that she, generally speaking &mdash; in some cases he &mdash; will no longer be obliged to chase the liable spouse?  As the Department are now taking the power on to themselves, are we removing that obligation from the applicant?  Do the Department intend to approach employers of liable spouses to ensure that the payment is made directly to the other spouse?  I know some voluntary arrangements can be made but perhaps the Minister is looking for more powers in this area and if we knew that we would be happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ferris is asking much the same question as I asked in regard to the obligation on the individual to seek maintenance.  The Minister indicated that this may be removed entirely. <Col N="1726" /> There is one great advantage about the way the Minister does things &mdash; I do not think there is anybody who is quite such a master at it &mdash; in that he makes announcements more often than any other Minister.  He announces his intentions, the taking of power and the implementation of schemes.  Many people could learn from him.  His means of doing things gives him the maximum possible exposure on virtually every issue which he initiates and fair play to him but I do not have great sympathy for him if he has to take a little stick for the fact that some of us want to see proposals implemented earlier than he anticipates. He wants his bread buttered on both sides if he expects us to agree to proposals here while having nothing to show for them later.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the powers given?  He has had time to have discussions in relation to last year's proposals. The system in relation to people on social welfare is simple enough but the people we would really like to follow up are those who are in a position to support their spouses.  It is a question of the Minister having power, for example, in regard to maintenance which a wife or mother could get having proven her case in court.  Is that the road the Minister is thinking of taking?  At this stage has the Minister adequate powers or what kind of procedures will be required, in relation to private earnings, to recoup from individuals' contributions towards the maintenance of a spouse or children, which, obviously, these people should make themselves?  Obviously this will involve costly legal proceedings.  Does the Minister anticipate having the staff to process this arrangement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the announcements are getting across to the Deputy. The detail of the provisions will follow the report I have mentioned.  The main extra provision is that it will be possible to get District Court orders, where necessary, to enforce payment.  It will also be possible to get attachment orders or whatever kinds of orders are suitable.  In so far as possible we want to ensure that the individual will make reasonable efforts to contribute to the maintenance. This raises the question as to what level of maintenance applies and our involvement in that level of maintenance.  I said yesterday that I want to look at that area to ensure that it is treated as sympathetically as possible.  I do not want to say any more about it at this stage.  I think the Deputies will know that my sympathies are in line with theirs in that area but the matters we are talking about have financial consequences.  In any event, we will have the necessary power and will be free to exercise it where necessary. We do not want to exercise it unduly but when it is exercised on a few occasions it can have a good effect because people will know they are expected to contribute and can make the arrangements without having to go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have other ideas in this regard but I will not go into them now because Deputies might hold me to them.  There are possibly other ways of going about this matter without necessarily having to go to court but that is something that can be looked at further.  We are certainly going to seek that some of the money be returned where that is possible.  The Department will be in a position to act on behalf of the person who is seeking the support.  Failure to supply the necessary <Col N="1728" /> information to establish liability will be an offence and will be subject to substantial fines.  As I have said earlier, those powers are provided for in the 1989 Act and we will be bringing them into operation in conjunction with the steps we are taking at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 4 and 5, after &ldquo;pension,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Bill as initiated the proposed new carer's allowance will be payable, subject to a means test, to persons providing full-time care and attention to incapacitated persons who are in receipt of a specified social welfare payment.  The payments in question, which are specified in Chapter 198G, are old age, contributory and non-contributory pension; blind pension; or invalidity pension.  In the case of persons aged 66 years or over, widow's, widower's or parents' pension under the occupational injuries benefit scheme; retirement pension; widow's contributory or non-contributory pension or other analogous payments; widower's non-contributory pension or deserted husband's allowance; or the new lone parents' allowance provided for in Part III of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that there is also a need to entitle to the new allowance persons caring for severely disabled persons who are not in receipt of any of these payments. In order to meet these needs, therefore, as I announced on Second Stage, the Government have approved <Col N="1729" /> my proposals to entitle to the allowance persons providing full-time care and attention to recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.  These amendments are designed to extend the scope of the carer's allowance to include such persons.</P>
    <P>As I made known during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the new carer's allowance represents a very significant improvement on the existing prescribed relative's allowance.  The rate of the allowance is being increased from £28 to £45 per week, increases will be payable in respect of dependent children, for the first time married women and persons who are not related to the pensioner will qualify for payment and entitlement will not be affected if other persons are also residing with the pensioner.  These are major improvements in the concept of a carer's allowance.  The amendments which I am now proposing to include persons caring for recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance further improve the provisions of the new scheme and I am sure that it will be welcomed by all Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The necessary regulations in this regard will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, and section 51 of the Bill, which relates to regulations requiring the sanction of the Minister for Finance, has been amended accordingly. We have extended the concept to include persons caring for severely disabled and incapacitated persons who are in receipt of DPMA; they were not included previously.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, this category will have to be defined very clearly because the disabled person's maintenance allowance applies to a very wide range of people.  The intention is to give the people who are very severely handicapped or incapacitated the equivalent benefits and rights of what we will be covering under the other scheme.  It is of course a further enlargement of the scheme.</P>

I welcome the fact that the Minister indicated at the end of Second Stage that he would take on board our very strong request that the people who were providing care for severely handicapped adults should be included as a category for the proposed new carer's allowance.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken our request on board. This was one of the major weaknesses of the Bill because the categories of recipients were the same as those established for the prescribed relative's allowance. While the Minister had made substantial progress in widening the categories of persons who might be carers there was no advance in the original proposals in relation to those in need of care.  Therefore, their inclusion is a very welcome additional proposal.  Are we also discussing the regulations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's very positive response to many of the points raised by Members on this side of the House.  A variety of speakers had indicated that it would be unfair to exclude certain categories of persons in receipt of DPMA from the categories covered by the new carer's allowance. The categories proposed originally were old age pensioners, whether in receipt of a contributory or non-contributory pension, a blind pension, or an invalidity pension.  The Minister also included other categories but in all cases the persons had to be aged 66 years or more and would have qualified for old age pensions were they not in receipt of other pensions or benefits.  We immediately saw the anomaly that the carer for an adult severely handicapped person, who had not attained the age of 66 and was in need of full-time constant care and attention would not be entitled to the new carer's allowance.  In the case of severely handicapped children, there is a special payment to the parents who have to look after them.  We feel that their problem is being addressed at that stage but the moment they become an adult and are in receipt of benefits in their own right, even though they may still either be confined to bed or to a wheelchair or suffer from severe handicaps which preclude them from any normal life and means they are in need of constant care and attention, the persons who care for them are not entitled to any allowances.  Invariably, this task falls to the mother, who is then confined to the home almost on a full-time basis to look after this special adult who has not reached the age of 66 years. We had suggested similar amendments to what the Minister now proposes, but they were ruled out of order because they involved a charge on the Exchequer and only the Government could widen the categories.  I congratulate the Minister for having convinced the Government that this category should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the publication of regulations and guidelines that cover this new category, so that there will be no ambiguity about who will be entitled to the <Col N="1732" /> new allowance.  We realise that the allowance will be confined to those with severe handicaps, who are in receipt of DPMA and need full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>I will deal later with the concept of means testing, but I am not sure whether I should deal with it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we are restricted to discussing the amendment only and I will try to restrict my comments to them.  It is a pity that our amendment was ruled out of order.  In it we asked the Minister to include an adult or child who is physically or mentally handicapped.  The carer's allowance announced in the Bill is incredibly restrictive.  It appears that one must be a pensioner and be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention to be eligible.  That means that very few people will be eligible.  I welcome the Minister's move.  The whole concept is worthy of support but it is unfortunate that it is too narrowly based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that only certain people in receipt of the DPMA will qualify under the new scheme.  That allowance is paid to physically and mentally disabled persons and I should like to know what new procedure will operate to incorporate the DPMA beneficiaries. I expect the Minister to tell us that this matter will be covered in the regulations. They are the bone of contention as far as I am concerned.  Will it go out from the House that the carers of those who are in receipt of the DPMA will be eligible under the new scheme?  In my view it is wrong to give that impression.  I am anxious that the right message should go from the House and we can only do that if we know the classification the Minister has in mind.  However, I do not intend to look a gift horse in the mouth and I <Col N="1733" /> welcome the decision to give more people benefit under the new scheme.  In the explanatory memorandum it is emphasised that the carer would have to reside with the person being cared for.  Will the Minister elaborate on that?  One newspaper report implied that one did not have to be living with the person being cared for.</P>

      <P>This amendment is in my name and those of Deputies Byrne and McCormack.  It is my view that we should discuss this amendment with the section.  I should like to put a marker down about the feelings Fine Gael have about what has happened under the carer's allowance. The only way we can give expression to our views is to call a vote on the amendment. Our reasons for tabling the amendment are tied up with what is happening to the carer's allowance.</P>

      <P>I am anxious that the Minister accept our amendment and that regulations made under the section be brought before the House in the form of <Col N="1735" /> a positive motion.  While we welcome the broad structure of the section, there is a great deal of concern at the level of hype and expectation generated at the time of the announcement of the allowance. Many people will be sadly let down when they realise how limited the scheme is.  I am not saying that that is the Minister's fault.  The Minister can do only what is possible under the social welfare system, which is an income replacement set-up in the case of unemployment or sickness benefit.  I do not think this is the best vehicle for the Government to use to introduce a carer's allowance.  It will lead to many problems.  Many people expect that the carer's allowance will be an additional allowance but it will not be any such thing.  In most cases it will amount to a tiny additional supplement to the existing benefit.</P>
      <P>The idea has gone out that those who were in receipt of £27 will receive £45 and those who are caring for people and qualify will receive £45.  However, very few people will qualify for the £45 allowance. The Minister should identify those who will qualify.  He has told us that 8,000 of the 66,000 carers will benefit.  At present 2,000 people qualify.  That leaves a huge number of people not included. There will be a great deal of disappointment about the scheme.  The Minister must accept some of the responsibility for the way the scheme was presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision to broaden the categories of those who will be considered as carers under the scheme.  It appears that there is no exclusion in the scheme.  It is a major reform and on its own it would be welcome but it is wrong of people to think that they will get an additional £45.  Unless they do not have any means they will not qualify.  If they are living with a person who is working or in receipt of a social welfare benefit the benefit under the new scheme will be very limited.  I suggested that we should consider the idea of a carer's benefit to be given to a person as a right and on the same basis as unemployment benefit or disability benefit is given if people are in <Col N="1736" /> benefit or give up employment for the purpose of looking after a person.  This would at least extend the category substantially and would mean that persons who vacated a job voluntarily, thus leaving one available for someone else in the workforce, would be acknowledged.  I further propose that the existing prescribed relative's allowance should not be removed because this is the only element in this package which is not means tested. It is now being replaced by a means tested carer's allowance.  Some people who would have obtained the prescribed relative's allowance will not qualify for the new allowance.  My colleague, Deputy McCormack, is particularly concerned about this because he has had experience already regarding the interpretation of the prescribed relative's allowance in terms of full-time care and attention. What does full-time care and attention mean? If you are a farmer's wife and live on a farm and you happen to feed the chickens, are you considered therefore as being precluded from giving full-time care and attention?  I do not have that much experience with a prescribed relative's allowance in a rural setting but I know it has been a problem with the existing scheme.  Therefore, the regulations are vital as to how flexible this scheme will be in its application to so many people.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the principle of establishing a carer's allowance, and I commend the Minister for introducing it, I question whether this is the best vehicle by which to acknowledge that we want people to care for their handicapped, the disabled and the elderly in their own homes.  It is certainly a good response in the context of the social welfare system, that is apart from the fact that it does not introduce a benefit.  The restriction of the means test will lead to its application being very limited.  For all those reasons many people will be disappointed.  In that context I wish to record our dissatisfaction with much of the detailed proposal while welcoming the principle in general.  These regulations should be positive.  We should have an opportunity <Col N="1737" /> of discussing how the detail of the Bill will be interpreted for individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like clarification from the Minister on what will be contained in the regulations.  As I interpret section 17, Chapter 5B, 198L, which this amendment proposes to amend by way of bringing it before the House, it is a set of regulations which enables the Minister to bring in this new section.  He has intimated he intends to bring it in on 1 October or before that date if he is administratively ready to do so.  It also provides for the categories of people to be included in the section which sets out the existing areas which we have agreed to amend, including severely handicapped DPMA recipients.  By regulation it also sets down the levels of payment but in my opinion regulations will not specify either the means testing or those who will be excluded by means testing because they are already determined in the section of the Bill which deals with means testing. This is dealt with in section 17, Chapter 5B, 1981.-(3).  The Minister said last night that he does not want to be precluded from bringing in the regulations when he is ready to do so and that he will circulate the list to us in advance to indicate what is in them.  I would like the Minister to clarify if the regulations will address any of the problems outlined by Deputy Flaherty or if they will address only the problems originally specified in section 17, Chapter 5B, 198L which brings the section into operation, details the people who will be included for benefit and also details the maximum amounts to be paid but will not deal with means testing or with the question of excluding some people because they do not qualify in accordance with the means testing or because they will not qualify now under the categories which all of us, including the Minister, have agreed.  I have reservations about the Minister coming back to the House for approval if these are simple regulations which all of us would wish the Minister to speedily prepare and circulate and bring into being under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my reservations on this section.  In fact, I am a signatory with Deputy Flaherty and Deputy McCormack to this amendment dealing with regulations.  The interpretation of the carer's allowance is quite clear.  Whatever I may say about regulations as they affect other sections of the Bill, this section is a key one for considered debating, and voting on in terms of the regulations.  Even as matters stand the whole question of the means test is up for debate.  Means testing of any person at an income level of £2 is ridiculous. I find it hard to imagine that the Minister and his officials would sit down and insert such a ridiculously low, incredible and meaningless sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic means anybody should be allowed to have in this regard in any shape or form should be at least £25 or £30.  Because the Minister has put in such an incredibly low figure thousands of people who would otherwise be entitled to a carer's allowance will be excluded.  I will not detain the House any longer on this issue.  Deputy Flaherty has made up her mind on this issue also.  We are not happy with these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the amendment.  Deputies withdrew two fairly similar amendments earlier.  To do as suggested would cause severe administrative difficulties and substantial delays.  I have no doubt that if that amendment were to be accepted, very serious delay would be caused to the people we want to assist.  The categories are defined in the Act.  This amendment is seeking to extend the provisions to include the disabled person's maintenance allowance.  That is going beyond what is contained in the Bill.  The regulations will cover only those who failed to get in under the categories specified in the Bill; in other words it is an extra power for me to include people such as those over 80 years of age.  It is not possible to define everything in an Act and be certain that everybody will be included. <Col N="1739" /> Because of that there is a power whereby the Minister may, through regulations, bring other people in and make other arrangements.  The old age pension means test is the most favourable means test we have.  I could not have got a better means test.  We can see how the provision here develops, how everything shapes up, who does not fit in and where it can be expanded in time.  This is a very big step from the point of view of what is in the Bill already.  Deputy Flaherty is right in saying that the matter of including the DMPA is a health issue.  We are taking that from the Department of Health.  You either want me to do something practical or you do not but do not involve me between Departments.  I have got the Government to agree to the step I am taking.  It is a further big step and is in line with what Deputies want.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  There is an opportunity to discuss the broader issue once we have disposed of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in relation to the DPMA has been agreed by all of us and we are not discussing it at present.  We all agree with that wholeheartedly and welcome the fact that it is being done at this time by way of this mechanism.</P>
      <P>What is at issue now is our amendment in regard to the regulations.  The regulations will allow the Minister to do a number of things &mdash; for example, define &ldquo;carer&rdquo;, &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo;, &ldquo;relevant pension&rdquo;, etc.  Those definitions will have to be spelt out.  Under paragraph 198L (2) of section 17 the Minister is enabling people to bypass his means test.  I am interested in hearing the reasons for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the means test was one of the most generous but paragraph 198L (2) (a) of section 17 disregards the rate set by the Minister and refers to a weekly means of <Col N="1740" /> £2.  Does that contradict what the Minister said about the means test for the old age pension which he said he was applying?  The regulations will spell out how the Bill will impact on people.  I referred to the question of full-time carers and asked if they would be subject to the regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms &ldquo;carer&rdquo;, &ldquo;relevant pension&rdquo; and &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo; are spelt out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo; is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;full-time care and attention&rdquo; is set out in the Bill in so far as it refers to &ldquo;a person who is so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention&rdquo;.  We have never had any problems with this term in the operation of the prescribed relative's allowance, which is operated by my Department on the basis of full-time care and attention. I do not believe I have ever had a query about the nature of full-time care and attention.  I have had queries from people who wanted someone else included but I have not had any queries in regard to full-time care and attention.  That scheme has operated satisfactorily and I am using this as the criterion here.  If I did not use some criterion I could not get authority to introduce something which is totally open-ended.  The criterion we have used works well and we have built it into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke about expectations. I did not mean to create any hype; I have tried to make it very clear that the scheme will have to be introduced in a controlled way.  Just under 2,000 people benefited previously from the scheme and my Department officials estimate that 8,000 people will now benefit.  This was the position before we brought in the DPMA, which is another question.  I have to draw the line here because I have achieved a lot.  I have to put the scheme into operation and I need the regulations as certain things I cannot anticipate now will arise in the future with which I want to be able to deal.  No matter what Bill is <Col N="1741" /> brought in there will be things people cannot anticipate.  Deputy Byrne is very concerned about this issue but he has literally no experience in this business.  I know he is learning about it at present and is doing so very well.  As Deputy Ferris knows well, we can talk all we like here about the Bill, but if flexibility is not built into it in regard to administration the Minister will be completely stuck and will not be able to operate the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have accepted amendment No. 55. Amendment No. 56 proposes that I should come back into the House with any regulations which are made.  I believe the inclusion of this amendment in the Bill at this stage would be totally unnecessary, very restrictive, an administrative nightmare and push back the implementation of the scheme.  There is no question in my mind but that that would be the outcome if the amendment was accepted.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not necessary.  If the Deputies are concerned about the regulations they will have the opportunity of challenging them within 21 sitting days of the House if they believe this needs to be done.  This hardly ever happens. What really happens is that the next time the scheme is being discussed the Deputies can say which people they would like to be included.  They can say &ldquo;We know it will cost a lot of money but these are the people we would like to see included&rdquo;.  This sort of proposal will be considered as we go forward and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputies need to be concerned about the manner in which we are approaching this scheme or to do what is suggested in amendment No. 56. The amendment would ensure that matters would be discussed and thrashed out here, but the proposal that a draft of each regulation should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and should not come into effect until a motion approving them had been passed by each House would be unduly restrictive.  I would certainly be against such a proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to disagree with my colleagues on this side of the <Col N="1742" /> House but I ask them to consider what we will be doing if we accept this amendment. In fairness to the Minister, the section relating to the regulations gives him certain powers, including the power to include people whom we have not yet identified.  Hopefully, as a result of all our teasing out of the Bill, we will have considered everybody, but I have no doubt whatsoever that other categories which are not specifically identified in the Bill &mdash; we welcome the additional categories included by the Minister &mdash; will be identified for inclusion.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 198L(2) (c) of section 17 gives the Minister additional powers, which we welcome.  The Minister cannot make the regulations any more restrictive than already provided for in the Bill. When we have disposed of this amendment we will have an opportunity to discuss the section.  I will be expressing my reservations about the type of means testing suggested by the Minister.  I am glad the Minister indicated on Second Stage, in response to our reservations, that he was prepared to look at the principle of means testing so that we would not exclude people who are giving this loving care and attention but who are excluded at present under the means testing provisions in other Acts.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he has chosen the most liberal means test.  However, we know from experience that there is very little liberal adaptation of means testing. We know from the previous subsections what the Minister's intention will be and the absolute means testing he will apply. If the amendment is accepted I would be worried that we could be holding up the implementation of the carers' allowance because of the obligation which would be placed on the Minister to come back into the House to get our final approval to the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the contents of the regulations. We are not sure about the date, but it is the Minister's intention to implement this in October or sooner. These regulations will allow for that.  If for some reason we are not satisfied with the regulations we can rescind them.  I know from past experience that once <Col N="1743" /> regulations are published by the Government they cannot be amended.  The only thing that can be done then is to send them back by a vote of the House.  We know now what the Minister wants to put into these regulations and it is not unreasonable.  I would ask my two colleagues to reconsider their position in view of what the Minister has said because I do not want to delay making the carer's allowance available to people who qualify for it under the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said that if we were to press our amendment and succeed it might hold up the Bill. The Minister has indicated he hopes it will be ready for October.  I hope we will be ready to work again in October; indeed this side of the House will be pressing for a resumption in September. These ludicrously long holidays have become a feature of this House and we have to try to do our business around these.  We would have had a particularly appalling example of it this month had not the Government's executive wings been clipped by the level of opposition in the House.  We will not be restricted in <Col N="1744" /> doing what is best in relation to this by that consideration.  It will be open to the Government to have new regulations ready.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for having taken the initiative but there are so many elements of this that are not what we wish they were.  The regulations will flesh out some of these.  The Minister may not be aware of problems but my back bench colleagues have come to me with real problems relating even to the definitions under the prescribed relative's allowance and difficulties particularly in rural Ireland that people have had in proving that they are providing full-time care and attention if their activities might be interpreted some other way.  For that reason I am anxious to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance section is a little like the curate's egg, good in parts.  There is a huge problem with confusion, expectation and the very restrictive means test.  On Second Stage I argued that its presentation as an increase from £27 to £45 was misrepresenting the case, and that is putting it as gently as I can.  The number of people who would receive that kind of increase would be fewer than the current number in receipt of the prescribed relative's allowance. Other than that, they are persons with no income at all and where they are to come from I do not know.  Either they have a private income or an income as a dependant of a married person who will now be included, or they have a social welfare income either as a dependant themselves or as an individual.  If such persons are individual social welfare recipients the allowance will mean a net loss in income for them.  If they are dependants it could mean an increase, depending on what their rate of benefit, from £16 to as low as £6.  There will be more people in receipt of this benefit but the additional amounts will be a great deal smaller than the presentation of £27 to £45.</P>
      <P>Had it been presented in that modified fashion we could have welcomed those increases, but there is a great expectation that carers are being acknowledged and the rigidity of the means test or the exclusions therefrom really have not hit home.</P>

    <P>The categories of people who would qualify are widened and that is welcome. <Col N="1747" /> I would like the Minister to clarify my reading of that &mdash; that there are now no exceptions.  If you are residing with somebody and providing full-time care nobody is excluded, relative or otherwise.  That is a very welcome major reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister has amended the scheme, as we asked him to do on Second Stage, to include recipients of DPMA and has broadened significantly the categories of people who qualify for care. I regret that he has not taken on the other proposal I made in my amendment that he also consider persons in receipt of other income such as occupational injuries pensions who themselves require full-time care and attention and whose incomes might be no greater, or only marginally greater, than those who are being considered at the moment.  These people do exist.  People have had to retire from teaching with psychiatric illness and people retire in other walks of life through various disabilities.  If we are to apply this scheme comprehensively, this group should be considered also.  Perhaps the power the Minister is giving himself under the regulations will allow him to meet that situation.</P>
    <P>The single most limiting factor in this proposal is the means test.  The Minister said he picked the most generous means test but, as Deputy Ferris said, there is no such thing in the social welfare system. Under our general amendment means which have stood at the same figure since 1974 should be updated.  This is very relevant.</P>
    <P>There are improvements that we welcome. It is not sufficient to acknowledge the 66,000 people who are providing whole-time care.  Had the Minister taken on my proposal in relation to carer's benefit it would have included as of right at least one group not means tested.  Under my proposal if the person who had a benefit entitlement similar to a unemployment benefit or if he would qualify for unemployment benefit or disability benefit and gave up his or her employment to provide full-time care, hence creating another job in the workforce, the <Col N="1748" /> cost to the State would be insignificant. Extension of the provision to such persons would be an acknowledgement of the value, to which we give lip service at least, of the kind of care these people are providing.  If the Minister is not willing to take that on board this year he might look at it for the future.</P>
    <P>Given that it is ruled out of order as an amendment because of the charge on the Exchequer, the question of maintaining the prescribed relative's allowance alongside the new carer's allowance is something the Minister might take on board. The prescribed relative's allowance is not means tested, I understand.  Once you prove that you are providing full-time care and are not working outside the home or engaged in other employment, you can qualify for it.  It will mean only a small number of additional people and it would broaden the scope of the proposals.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the improvements we are concerned at the very limited scope, the impact of a very rigid means test and the huge level of disappointment and let down that will be felt throughout the community as the restrictive nature of the scheme as proposed becomes more broadly known to the people who have great expectations of benefiting from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Flaherty.  The Minister is going on the right road in introducing the carer's allowance, but, as far as I can detect from what he has published, in the case of a husband and wife where one of the spouses has a take-home pay of £100 per week, they will get nothing under the carer's allowance because of the application of the means test.  That is effectively rendering it ineffective for anyone who has even a low paid job, and it is unduly restrictive.  The Minister should bear in mind that for his colleague, the Minister for Health, the weekly cost of keeping a person in an acute hospital is probably about £1,200 at this stage and even in a non-acute hospital it is probably about half that figure.  The care being provided by carers keeping people out of hospital is being under-valued by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> The recent study on the 66,000 carers was startling.  It showed that only 3 per cent of carers were getting the prescribed relative's allowance at that stage, which will be increased by this proposal but not substantially.  Similarly, only 3 per cent were getting home help provisions under the various health boards and in the same way even basic medical requirements were only being afforded in a very patchy manner to many of the people being cared for in the home.  The Minister needs to set himself a schedule over the next two or three years to radically widen the scope of this proposal.  The £2 means disregard which he has introduced in this Bill is particularly niggardly.  The Minister said in his public statements that the means test was going to be modelled on the non-contributory pension where the means disregard is considerably higher. Equally the means test should take account of genuine expenses being incurred in caring for people in the home. There are many expenses such as heating, lighting and care of different sorts and people have to get relief from the day to day caring, even if it is someone coming in to sit with the person.  These expenses should be consolidated in some fashion and brought into the means test.  The Minister needs to look carefully at that area.  He was very niggardly in confining his change in the electricity allowance to persons over 80&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that the Minister should have a plan over a three or four year period to tackle the needs of carers as outlined in the special report.  This is a welcome small first step but the hype surrounding it leads people to believe that a genuine response to their requirements has been made in this Bill. Even if the Minister does not intend to implement the welcome alternative proposals made by this side of the House, he should have a three or four year radical programme in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The categories which will <Col N="1750" /> be included as carers have been identified in the Bill.  I want to discuss how some carers will be excluded.  We recognise that in the past married women were excluded, particularly if they were related to the person being cared for. From that point of view this is a major step forward in that it does not automatically exclude married people. However, the problem with means testing is that under the 1978 Act wives are allocated 50 per cent of their husbands' income &mdash; regardless of whether they receive it &mdash; and if a husband is earning £90 per week his spouse, if she is caring for someone in this category, will be excluded because she will be termed as having £40 per week.  That is the stark reality of means testing.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave some hope in his Second Stage speech that he would adopt a more liberal approach in regard to the means test.  He can now implement the regulations which give him the power to extend the categories in relation to means testing.  If he did that it would mean that thousands of married women throughout the country who provide this useful and loving service would not be penalised.</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage that these carers save the State a colossal amount of money each year and Deputy Bruton also referred to this in relation to acute hospitals. The same applies to geriatric hospitals, welfare homes and sheltered housing.  I know that the Minister has to allocate within his own budget, but the Government should appreciate what this would mean in regard to savings in the Department of Social Welfare, hospital services and the cash strapped health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prescribed relative's allowance is extremely restrictive.  Deputy Flaherty felt that it was not means tested, but it might as well be because a person is expected to be at home on a full-time basis and not to have any outside occupation. You are excluded from receiving the allowance if you are related to the person being cared for, which meant that only 2,000 people qualified for this allowance in the past.  Because the Minister included married women he thinks that <Col N="1751" /> the figure will rise to 8,000 beneficiaries. However, I respectfully submit to the Minister that that is a very optimistic figure.  I cannot see this happening because married women will be means tested.  The only married women who might benefit are the spouses of social welfare recipients because they would qualify in their own right for the carer's allowance, which exceeds the adult dependant allowance.  Indeed, this allowance has suffered in social welfare terms anyway.</P>
    <P>New legislation from the EC precludes recipients from claiming for one another as dependants because it would mean they would be in receipt of two social welfare payments.  If that clause is applied here many people will be excluded from benefit.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5B, 198K. requires that a prescribed relative's allowance shall cease to be paid to a relevant pensioner or prescribed relative.  I am not unduly worried about it not extending to the new categories where it is paid directly to the carer, not the pensioner; but if I am reading this correctly it will cease to be paid to the pensioner and all hell will break loose in rural areas.  Old age pensioners look on this element of their pension as belonging to them although it is being paid because someone is looking after them.  We know from dealing with prescribed relatives that they have little or no income, they depend on the pensioner to give them back some of the carer's allowance.  However, some very old people do not pay this money to the carer because they regard it as theirs.  It does not occur to them that they are in receipt of it because someone is looking after them.  Some old age pensioners with an existing prescribed relative's allowance included in their pension will suddenly suffer a drop in income and this will cause problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, and that is what worries me.  I have a feeling that there will be unhappiness about this matter and they will blame the Minister for removing it from them.  They certainly will not give him any credit for paying more to the person looking after them.</P>
      <P>I share my colleague's views that there is an expectation by all married women looking after people in the home that they will get this allowance.  The concept of means testing has not entered their mind yet because they have never been subjected to it except by the Revenue Commissioners.  When they discover the nitty-gritty of the Bill they will find that many married carers will be excluded because of means testing.  For that reason I had hoped the Minister would spell out the position today, but perhaps the Department of Finance have precluded him from giving even his own thoughts. We had hoped this concept of means testing would be a lot more liberal than it is.  The figures are so ridiculous that one could not even get the price of a packet of cigarettes from one's deserting husband without being excluded from getting carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are anxious that as many people as possible would benefit because they are providing a service for which the State would otherwise have to pay sub-acute, geriatric and welfare homes.  It would be a recognition of the invaluable work these people have done down through the years with no compensation.  They often felt at a disadvantage as a result of not being compensated &mdash; not that they felt they should be paid to look after their own relatives but some of them made tremendous efforts in their homes to look after old people day and night, with no thanks from the State and often relatively little thanks from the person for whom they cared.  These people can be quite independent and demanding, especially as they get older, and it can be frustrating for them to have to depend on somebody to do everything for them.  It can be very difficult to care for these people, particularly if they are incontinent.  In my constituency there are carers looking after such people without receiving a penny. <Col N="1753" /> We are initiating a very restrictive regime here in regard to means testing.  Many people will feel they would have qualified for the allowance were it not for the Minister's announcement that married women are no longer excluded from the means test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We should highlight who will be eligible for the carer's allowance. Firstly, I would like to say that the carer's allowance is a progressive move, but it is extremely restrictive.  It is geared to cater for the needs of pensioners in full-time care and attention.  In the main, we are talking about the elderly.  A huge number of people will be deprived of this allowance by virtue of the fact that they are ineligible under this Bill.  There is a large number of people outside the old age pension category who are in need of full-time care and attention and are getting it from family members, neighbours or relations.  Although the Minister has spoken about the DPMA, we have still not been told who will be eligible for this allowance.</P>
      <P>Many people have to make incredible decisions as regards an ailing spouse who has not reached old age pension age but is still relatively young and through accident or illness, either physical or mental, requires a lot of care from a family member.  There are lonely people with no family connections who are also being cared for by a very supportive community. People in the community give, in a voluntary capacity, great time and care to such people, but they will not benefit from this allowance.  Quite a large number of people will on foot of their experience as a carer expect this £45 but will find, having gone through the interpretation clauses, that they are not eligible and they will be very disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said there are 2,000 people in receipt of prescribed relative's allowance and that after the enactment of this Bill there will be 8,000 beneficiaries. What does that mean in relation to the total number of people who are at present engaged in a caring capacity, even for those at a pensionable age?  Is it a way of quantifying how much care and attention <Col N="1754" /> is being given in this country at present? I suggest the number is vastly greater than 8,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If that number is correct and only 8,000 will be eligible, it reinforces my point that there are many people being cared for by people who will not benefit.  They will not benefit in the main because the people they are caring for are not sufficiently aged.  Where does one draw the line between full-time and part-time care and attention?  I am sure many a heart-broken applicant will have it defined for them by a social welfare official.  What they believe to be full-time care will be alleged not to be so and they will be excluded.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the question of the means test.  On the one hand we are congratulating the Minister for bringing in a carer's allowance and on the other hand we are pointing out its inadequacies. The means test will deprive a large number of people of this allowance and it is very inadequate in that sense. There are three competing factors at play and they will exclude huge numbers of people who should otherwise be eligible. What is wrong with making somebody eligible who has not reached the age for old age pension?  There are many younger people who, as I said earlier, through accidents or physical or mental illness are in receipt of full-time care.  Why should they be excluded?  In many cases these people may be receiving care far in excess of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 26, 36 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Workers who are employed for less than 18 hours per week and who are not mainly dependent on their earnings from that employment are regarded as part-time under the social welfare Acts and are insurable at a reduced rate which gives cover for occupational injuries only. Workers who are employed for 18 hours or over are regarded as being in full-time employment and are insurable accordingly under the social welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>One of the original objectives of the regulations governing part-time employment was to ensure that persons who are insured and thus eligible for the full range of social insurance benefits pay more than a minimal contribution to the social insurance fund.  This was widely accepted at the time as being in the interests of insured workers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been concerned about the position of part-time workers under the social insurance system especially in the light of the growing extent of this form <Col N="1757" /> of employment in particular sectors.  I am aware that there are certain anomalies and inefficiencies in the provisions for these workers in the social insurance system, and I am examining the question of changing the present criteria for insurability so as to provide a greater degree of coverage for workers in this situation. This is, however, a very complex matter and one where there could be considerable financial and other implications for the social insurance system depending on the course of action which is taken.  As part of this review the European Court judgment, referred to by Deputies, is being examined.</P>
    <P>I have also specifically asked the National Pensions Board to examine the question of pension entitlements of part-time workers.  I expect that they will report by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Labour, during the discussion on the Private Members' Bill on the Protection of Part-Time Workers, a Social Action Programme has now been drawn up by the European Commission.  As part of this programme it is expected that the Commission will be in a position to publish a draft directive on a typical work during the summer.  The Government will have regard to these proposals to ensure compatibility between the draft directive and our own proposals.</P>
    <P>The issue of social welfare coverage for these workers will also be considered in the course of the discussions at the forthcoming informal Council of Social Welfare Ministers to be held in Ireland next month.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's response but I must ask him why he has given the standard response that somebody is looking into the matter and that he has to wait for them to report to him?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would the Minister not agree that women part-time workers are discriminated against in the main and that he should reclassify them as class A PRSI contributors, as a first step in recognising what has happened as a result of the European case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I had already started this investigation long before the court finding. Deputies who have been in the House for some time longer will know that we have discussed this issue before. It is a very important and complex issue. Indeed, the Commission on Social Welfare discussed this issue but found that it was too complex for them to deal with so I then had to set up a group specifically to tackle this question, which I did.  I am sorry that the Deputy does not like this. There are groups tackling various questions because we want to resolve these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy must be aware that if we make changes, everybody involved will have to pay the full rate of PRSI, but not everybody involved may want to pay the full rate of PRSI, for instance, married women may or may not wish to pay the full rate and they will ask why they should pay the full rate and what extra benefits they will get.  We also have to ask how this will relate to the income level and whether there should be a cut-off point: for instance, if a person is paid £10 per month does he have to be included in the category that pays full PRSI?  There are many implications in changing PRSI and the matter is being urgently examined at two different levels.  The case the Deputy referred to is very specific and the implications of this very recent case are also being considered.  In the Dutch case it appears that part-time workers were the <Col N="1759" /> only group not covered by a subsistence income scheme which applied to other groups.  Therefore the situation is not strictly analogous to what we are concerned about.  The judgment will have to be considered in detail before any position can be taken on it.  We have to ask whether the judgment precludes any insurability threshold, if it affects one group more than another.  This will have to be considered as part of the review and has been included in the review.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the study of this matter was already under way and the case which the Deputy referred to is being considered in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the significant point, and the reason the case was successful, was that it could be proved that women were over-represented in the group of part-time workers.  In view of the statistics which show that Irish women make up 78 per cent of the part-time workforce, would the Minister not accept that he is in breach of the EC Directive and the women who are applying for reclassification as Class A contributors are entitled to be reclassified under the EC Directive?  What legal advice has the Minister received concerning the immediate demands on his Department from part-time workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an established appeals procedure for those who feel they should be included.  A case is being appealed and I do not think I should be asked to comment on it.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the National Pensions Board, as part of an investigation they are carrying out, have been looking into the extent of part-time employment. It is worth bearing in mind that Ireland is one of the EC countries with the lowest proportion of employment which is part-time &mdash; I understand that it is 6.4 per cent.

There is a heavy concentration of part-time jobs <Col N="1760" /> in the services industry such as retail outlets.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 39 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the PRSI system introduced in 1979 when a single number for tax and social insurances purposes was adopted, <Col N="1762" /> the Revenue Commissioners collect social insurance contributions from employers in respect of employees.  Contributions are collected from employers in respect of over 1.1 million employed persons.  Employers submit detailed returns to the Revenue Commissioners after the end of each tax year.  These details are recorded by the Revenue Commissioners, who conduct some initial processing.  This leads to the transmission of details of the social insurance contributions to my Department for further processing and updating against each person's central social insurance record.</P>
    <P>The bulk of records received from the Revenue Commissioners are processed immediately and without difficulty. However, each year there is a proportion of records which are deficient mainly in relation to identifying details such as the employee's RSI number.  This can occur because it was either omitted by the employer or was not available to him at the time of making his end of year return. A number of measures are taken both by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners to resolve these deficiencices.</P>
    <P>Where inquiries are initiated by the Revenue Commissioners with employers and the issue is resolved my Department are notified and the records are amended accordingly.  In other cases where there is no RSI number and where there is sufficient other information, for example, an address, inquiries are made by my Department to the person to establish the RSI number so that the appropriate contributions can be properly credited.</P>
    <P>I should say that the accuracy and completeness of the PRSI records is very much dependent on the quality of the information supplied by employers who, in turn, depend on the co-operation of employees.  The importance of RSI numbers as an identifier is constantly stressed by my Department in dealings with members of the public.  In addition, one of the functions of my Department's investigative staff is to ensure that employers keep adequate and up to date records for social insurance purposes.</P>
    <P>Another development which will help <Col N="1763" /> in this area is the transfer of responsibility for allocating RSI numbers in the first instance from the Revenue Commissioners to my Department.  Arrangements for this are being finalised.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that the whole operation of the PRSI system is kept constantly under review by my Department and officials of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that the best mechanisms and procedures are adopted. Over the years, refinements in the procedures have been made to improve the timeliness of decisions on entitlements. Millions of claims to social welfare benefits have been processed and paid promptly using the PRSI system and I am satisfied that the present system ensures that my Department receive all available information from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of PRSI contributions paid by employers and employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the effect that 1.3 million records are unassigned in his Department?  Is he concerned about that?  Will he agree that that has significant implications for people's entitlements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons a file is not sorted out, like those I advanced earlier.  The principle reason is the allocation initially of an RSI number.  We are anxious to resolve the problem in regard to RSI numbers and for that reason we offered to take over the allocation of those numbers.  The preparation for that has been long and administratively difficult but it is nearing completion.  It is <Col N="1764" /> my hope that following that change we will have less difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is need for public education in regard to RSI numbers?  Will he agree that it is important that people should know that their records relate to them? What mechanism does he have to trace records?  Will he ensure that the 1.3 million records are examined?  Are all records looked at as a matter of course when controversial claims are made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Departments are co-operating trying to identify the records.  One difficulty we have come up against is the whole question of multiple RSI numbers.  That occurs when a person who has an RSI number moves to another area and takes out another number.  In certain sectors there is a great deal of such movement.  The Revenue are there to collect tax and we give out benefits. They need to get the money in.  If somebody is in an anomalous situation for one reason or another Revenue will want to give them a number and get them into their system.  That can result in a number of RSI numbers going to one person without Revenue being aware of it.  That problem would be dealt with if the matter were under the control of the Department of Social Welfare.  It is for that reason we are proposing that change, which will remove some of the difficulties that have emerged.</P>

There are continuing contacts at official level dealing with the topics agreed with my counterparts.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is effective co-operation in dealing with fraudulent claims on both sides of the Border. However, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be prudent for me to go into details on operational matters.</P>
      <P>Persons resident in Northern Ireland involved in cross-Border fraud would fall to be prosecuted by the authorities there where abuse of their social security schemes has also been involved.  Persons resident here who abuse our schemes would be considered for prosecution here.  Consequently, no prosecutions of people resident in Northern Ireland have been taken by my Department.</P>

      <P>The question refers to pensioners with mixed insurance records, which denotes a pensioner with an employment background some of which was insurable at the full rate and some of which was insurable at modified rates, which does not give cover for old age (contributory) pension.  There is no data readily available on the number of pensioners on the Department's books with employment records of that nature or, more important, on the number of persons who failed to qualify for reduced rate pension because of their records of mixed insurance.  In order to obtain a reliable estimate of the likely numbers involved, it has been decided to carry out a survey during the coming months.</P>
      <P>The issue of mixed insurance for pension purposes is being given detailed consideration by the National Pensions Board and it is expected that they will be bringing forward proposals in their next report, which is expected later this year.</P>

      <P>I welcome this movement on the part of the Minister.  This is a matter which my colleagues and I have been pursuing and we have been wondering how the Minister proposes to deal with it without having the data referred to here.  I am anxious to know the nature of the survey, can he give us a time scale for the completion of the survey and how he anticipates the National Pensions Board can make any decision in relation to this issue without having some idea of the scale and the likely take-up?  Can he say &mdash; this relates to comments made during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill &mdash; if he accepts in principle that <i>pro rata</i> pensions should be payable?  Does he have the resources to carry out the preparatory work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the general question is concerned, the Deputy will know that it is a very complex issue.  It affects not only previous pensioners but also existing pensioners and future pensioners because of the mixed insurance. Obviously it is related to the whole question of insurance for the public sector because about half the public sector, 140,000, are in the full scheme and 160,000 are not in the full scheme.  That situation affects the mixed insurance. Out of that 160,000 there are people who can at any time come into mixed insurance.  They are the people who are going to Deputies but, of course, they are retired.  When you talk to somebody who has not yet retired they do not particularly want to know about this because it means bringing them into the full insurance.  It is a complex matter and it is one on which we are trying to get an estimate of the numbers that would be involved.  I do not have the likely timescale for the completion of that study other than to say that it is under way at this stage.  I imagine it will not take very long to complete.</P>
      <P>In relation to the National Pensions Board, all these groups &mdash; part-time employees, the mixed insurance group and the other groups such as the public sector who are not in the whole system &mdash; are inter related.  Whenever a question arises I know that Deputy Byrne says that we refer to the study which is taking place.  These are major questions with major financial implications.  The board are coming close to the completion of that report and I hope to have it some time during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the indication in relation to the establishment of records.  I would like to feel it was as a result of our prodding and the Minister's unwillingness to come in here with no information month after month that has led him to do that.  Does he not accept that while he has established the principle of a <i>pro rata</i> pension for one group of pensioners, whose contributions are <Col N="1768" /> between five and 19 Class A1 contributions regardless of their other contribution records, anomalous treatment exists now in relation to other groups of pensioners with the same contribution records, who are being excluded from pensions?  That issue has to be faced relatively soon.  We could all face it much better if we knew the scale of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite different in its nature because as I have said before in this House, the people whom I could deal with were those who were caught in a short-term situation which was overcome in 1974.  That matter was open and closed.  They were shut out and they were allowed back in again.</P>

      <P>It was possible to put a figure on it and to say what it would cost and how many people would be involved. It took some time to do that but, nevertheless, it was possible to have it done. In regard to mixed insurance it is not as straightforward, as I think the Deputy will appreciate.  In relation to the prodding, I could not agree with that because I started out very urgently to bring the self-employed in.  I would have brought more people in at that time if it were feasible but I could only do what was feasible at the time.  I hope that the report which will come from the National Pensions Board will give us the basis on which to go further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the second EC Poverty Programme I arranged for a report on poverty to be prepared by the Economic and Social Research Institute &mdash; ESRI.  This report was based on a major survey carried out by the ESRI and was funded jointly by the institute, the Combat Poverty Agency and the EC. The report was published in October 1989 and a number of other reports have been made based on the survey's database.</P>
      <P>The findings indicate that certain groups, such as households headed by an unemployed person, families with large numbers of children and lone parents, were at risk of poverty in 1986 and early in 1987.  One of the most important ways to tackle the problem of poverty for these groups is through increasing the level of support available through the various social welfare schemes.  I have taken steps in recent budgets to give special assistance to the long-term unemployed, families and lone parents.  A family with three children on long-term unemployment assistance has received an increase of £26.55, 29.7 per cent, almost 30 per cent per week since June 1987.  I have also raised the long-standing rural rate of unemployment assistance to the higher urban rate, and introduced new schemes for widowers and other lone parents.  I am satisfied that this is the correct approach to aiding the less well off, and that any regional disparities in standards of living, to the extent to which they occur, will be overcome by this approach.</P>
      <P>The development of regional poverty statistics from the current ESRI database would be problematic as the sample was not drawn with this in mind and the sample size may not be sufficient to allow definitive conclusions relating to regions to be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently the Combat Poverty Agency is funding a number of further research projects based on the ESRI survey covering child poverty, take up of social welfare benefits and income sharing arrangements in households.  It is <Col N="1770" /> expected that draft reports on the findings of some of these projects will be available this year.</P>
    <P>As was announced in this year's budget, I have made a special allocation of £525,000 to fund a new nationwide programme of community development initiatives which will tackle poverty in disadvantaged urban and rural areas. Fourteen projects from various regions of the country have been invited to take part in this initiative.  The allocation of funds will be made once each of the projects have drawn up an outline of their proposed activities over the next three years in consultation with the Combat Poverty Agency.  I will also be discussing with the agency their plans for further research in the poverty area in the context of their strategic plan for the period 1990-93.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's very comprehensive reply in which he gave a lot of facts.  The ESRI report states that 30 per cent of our population are living in poverty at present and that the economic climate is now better than ever to tackle this problem.  Does the Minister not agree that there is an urgent need to identify the rural and inner city areas where poverty is prevalent at present?  I accept that the Minister has allocated money in the budget for a nationwide programme of community development initiatives which will tackle poverty, but this problem calls for a more indepth study in order to tackle the problem urgently.</P>

      <P>The 30 per cent figure referred to in the ESRI report is not the absolute figure of poverty; this figure is taken from one of the lines they use as comparative lines.  It is very important to understand that when people set about carrying out research they first set up a research model.  The ESRI have made it clear that this is not a measurement of poverty but was based on the &ldquo;relative poverty line&rdquo; method.</P>
      <P>This figure is based on 1986 data.  The ESRI report, which admittedly was published in 1989, refers to the 1986 data. All the increases were given specifically to people in rural areas, lone parents and the long-term unemployed.  The approach we have taken is to direct increases specifically towards those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> These figures can be misrepresented by people involved in protests and pressure groups who take a figure off the top of their heads.  These are not real figures. People who are carrying out research set up a comparative model to show where the people most at risk are, but it never sets out to show how many people are living in poverty or where absolute poverty exists.  Apart from anything else, the report did not take into consideration all the sources of income or support.  The report never set out to do that but its real value lay in the comparative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes, I can give her the reply I would have given her to Priority Question No. 4.</P>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute's report entitled <i>Poverty, Income and Welfare in Ireland</i> was published in 1989.  It presented a study of poverty in Ireland and an analysis of the effectiveness of the social welfare system in reducing it.  It was based on information collected from households during 1986 and early 1987.  I wish people would be clear about that and not keeping repeating figures.  Even official bodies and organisations use figures which are now three years out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the level of poverty in Ireland, the authors of the report stated that in their view there was no objective scientific method of establishing the threshold below which households could be regarded as poor.  I want to make it quite clear that they established at the outset that there was no objective method of establishing the threshold below which households could be regarded as poor.  However, the <Col N="1773" /> approach to the measurement of policy which was given most emphasis in the report was the &ldquo;relative poverty line&rdquo; method.  This calculates income thresholds as proportions of mean equivalent income.  The percentage of households or persons in households which fall below given income thresholds can then be measured.  The ESRI derived results for relative poverty lines set at 40 per cent, 50 per cent and 60 per cent of mean equivalent income.  It was established, for example, that 12.8 per cent of persons lived in households below the 40 per cent line in 1986.</P>
    <P>I accept these figures on the basis on which they are presented in the report. It is clear that they do not purport to show, as has often been erroneously stated, that a particular percentage or proportion of the population is living in poverty.  The real value of the ESRI report was the identification of those groups in society which were more at risk of poverty &mdash; households headed by an unemployed person, households with three or more children and single parents. Prior to the publication of the ESRI report, the Government had already taken steps in 1988 and 1989 to provide special increases for the long-term unemployed and for child dependants.  There is no definition of poverty which is universally accepted as scientifically valid by researchers and academics working in the field of poverty research.  Because of this, any attempt to compile official statistics on poverty, whether by the Central Statistics Office or other Government agencies, would be a source of considerable controversy, and would not contribute to improving the position of the less well off in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving that aside for the moment, I want to ask the Minister how he defines living in poverty, the <Col N="1774" /> groups he believes are living in poverty and on what he bases his policy.  He should answer those questions in order to end the sterile debate about figures and acknowledge that there is a real problem in regard to the levels of poverty.  It does not matter whether the relative poverty lines are set at 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 60 per cent of mean equivalent income; I want to know what concerns the Minister and on what he bases his policy.  He has avoided replying to that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out again and again, as I did in my reply to Question No. 8, that my approach is to raise the income levels to ensure that people have an adequate income.  We all want to reach certain income thresholds and that is why I have been increasing the basic payments to people on social welfare.  The difficulty is that there is no objective means of establishing an abosolute poverty level in research terms.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we know when income levels are too low.  We know the people who are at risk and we know the ones who need to get increases.  I would not attempt to put figures on it at this stage.  We have 11,000 recipients of supplementary welfare allowance and over one million recipients of other payments all of which are higher, with the exception of short-term unemployment assistance. Various other allowances that people in receipt of these benefits are entitled to are not shown.  We have brought up the rates for pensioners.  The rate set by the commission for Governments to achieve was £45.  That now comes to £53 in the current year.  The old age pensioners rates are well above that and the widows rates are going up above that too.  The only ones below it now are those in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, and people in receipt of disability benefits who have no pay-related benefit.  The next rate suggested is around £60.  Some have gone above that now and others are approaching it so we are tackling the problem of income in the most practical way.</P>

Let me also say that the Combat Poverty Agency, which is funded by the Department, also put forward that figure. The scorn thrown by the Taoiseach on the figures and the refusal of the Minister to accept that the figures are valid are offensive to these organisations and smack of extremely Right wing politics which can only be described as Thatcherite insensitivity at its worst.</P>

I have said here that the work done by the ESRI is accurate and valid so let the Deputy not say again that I said there is anything wrong with those figures.  It is the interpretation being put on the figures by certain people which is wrong.  The figures given by the ESRI are correct as far as they go.  The ESRI have asked people not to misuse their figures for their own purposes, but these figures have been thrown around for all sorts of purposes. Those figures are 1986 figures, not this year's figures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 20, 30 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question on 26 January 1989 about accommodation in my Department's local offices I made it clear that many of the older offices were not designed for the numbers now attending. I outlined the Department's building programme to provide new offices and to improve existing ones and I indicated my determination to continue with this programme to ensure that all of the Department's local offices will measure up to a high standard in the quality of facilities available for the public and staff alike.  I am glad to be able to report that considerable further progress has been made <Col N="1780" /> since then with the opening of a further three new offices and the extensive refurbishment of four others.  This brings to 13 the number of new offices which have been opened and to nine the number extensively refurbished in recent years.</P>
    <P>This progressive approach has not been confined to local offices.  Last year, under the Government's decentralisation programme, a new pensions office to accommodate 300 of the Department's staff was opened in Sligo.  This building is of a very high standard and conforms to all modern requirements.</P>
    <P>With regard to 1990, the major project on hands is the provision of a new decentralised office in Letterkenny, County Donegal, to house some 190 of the Department's staff.  The new office is expected to be ready for occupation in the autumn.  Self-contained accommodation is also being provided in D'Olier House for the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which is being set up as a separate executive office of the Department. The necessary preparatory architectural work has been completed by the Office of Public Works and the new offices are expected to be available in a few months' time.  In addition, a major refurbishment scheme for my Department's headquarters at Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, Dublin, has just commenced.</P>
    <P>In relation to local offices, work is in progress on the construction of three new offices at Cork, Limerick and in Dublin at Ballyfermot.  These offices will be ready for occupation during the course of this year.  In addition, I expect that work will commence later this year on the construction of three new offices at Tallaght and Finglas in Dublin and in Ennis, County Clare.  Detailed planning for a new office at Navan Road, Dublin, will be completed this year to enable construction to start as early as possible in 1991.  Already this year major alterations have been carried out at my Department's offices at Tralee, County Kerry and Letterkenny, County Donegal, while a scheme to refurbish the office at North Cumberland Street, Dublin, is currently in progress.  It is expected that major <Col N="1781" /> alterations will commence during the year at a further four offices at Cavan, Mullingar, Longford and Athlone.  In all, my Department and the Office of Public Works will spend some £4.2 million this year on the various building and renovation projects at the Department's local offices.  New offices are being planned for a number of other areas but commencement of construction is subject to the availability of the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>All new and refurbished offices are being designed to take advantage of modern technology and particular attention is being paid to the provision of facilities for privacy at new claims reception areas and at points where interviews with applicants are conducted.  In addition, the position at existing offices where no major work is, at present, planned is being reviewed to see what immediate improvements in privacy facilities can be made.</P>
    <P>Everything possible is being done within available resources to ensure that the standards of accommodation in my Department's offices, including insulation, ventilation, heating and lighting, are of a high standard.  In that respect, no cases have been taken against me or my Department under the Office Premises Act in the last five years or indeed at any time.  Improvements are still needed in some offices but the object of the programme I have outlined above is to address these problems as quickly as resources will allow.  I wish to repeat my determination to continue this programme of improvement in office accommodation in order to ensure that all offices of my Department measure up to the high standards which are necessary for staff and public alike.</P>

      <P>We wish the Minister well in projects which have started and recognise any advances in this area.  I refer specifically to Question No. 30 tabled by Deputy Mac Giolla.  I do not know why employment exchanges are called by that name since they are used only by unemployed people and there are certainly no jobs to be found by going there and signing <Col N="1782" /> on.  Are there any architects in the Minister's Department who could plan a soft, more humane type of environment for people in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance?  It seems there is a policy, whether malicious or not, on the part of central Government and the Department of Social Welfare to create a division between the staff and the institution ministering to people who are unfortunate enough to be in need of benefit. Will the Minister deliberately devise a scheme to make these places more congenial so that people will feel less alienated and downgraded?  I refer to such things as soft furnishings, lighting, painting on the walls and other architectural effects.</P>

      <P>I would recommend the Deputy to see some of the new offices such as those at Newbridge or Kilbarrack, although his party protested at the opening of the latter office and got publicity in the cheapest possible way.  These are very fine new offices which relieve pressure on the central Dublin offices.  Work has been going on in Kilkenny, Arklow, Apollo House in Dublin, Ballymun, Newcastle West, Clondalkin, Sligo, Limerick, Galway, Rathfarnham, Buncrana, Newbridge and Kilbarrack.  The Deputy should look at any of those offices.  I know the Deputy will never get his friends in RTE to accompany him because when we open a new office with brand new facilities affording privacy to those attending RTE will not come along.  Perhaps the Deputy would use his influence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Availability for Employment) Regulations, 1989, enable certain unemployment assistance applicants to engage in a full-time, second level course of education by day and at the same time be deemed to satisfy the statutory condition of being available for work.  Claimants availing of the new arrangements continue to receive unemployment assistance and are required to attend weekly at their local office or signing centre to prove unemployment.  The regulations were made in December 1989.</P>
      <P>In January 1990 all employment exchange and employment office staff were circulated with details of the regulations and the conditions for eligibility, namely that the claimants should be in receipt of the long-term rate of unemployment assistance, aged 21 years or over and participating in a second level course of education at an approved centre leading to a recognised certificate.</P>
      <P>A claimant who intends to engage in a full-time course of education at second level is expected to notify his or her local office in advance.  The application is then referred to a deciding officer to determine that the qualifying conditions are satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the new arrangements came into <Col N="1784" /> effect from December 1989 only, the take up so far has been limited.  However, I am confident that when the new academic year commences in September next there will be a very sizeable number who will come forward to avail of the scheme. Take up will be monitored by periodic returns from each employment exchange manager with more regular monitoring beginning next September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the detailed nature of his reply.  This is a very important course and it is vital that it be publicised.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the course is now up and running, what effort is the Minister making to ensure that more than 200 &mdash; the figure he gave me in December &mdash; out of the 250,000 unemployed will participate in the education opportunities scheme?  What effort is he making to publicise the courses?  What kind of second level courses are being approved? What kind of certificates, what courses of study will be turning up?  Have guidelines been given to the local officers or are they required to come back with specific applications which are cleared at some other point?  The more publicity we can give to this course the better, either through our efforts or through the Minister telling me some of his plans to publicise it more directly from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions are that they must be in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance, aged 21 or over, apply in advance, participate in a course of education at second level and the education course must be in an approved centre and lead to a recognised certificate.  There have been no difficulties so far and I do not envisage difficulties.  Most of the approved centres are former centres of second level education.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a private institution would qualify once it was an approved <Col N="1785" /> centre at which there was bona fide learning at second level.</P>
      <P>The 200-240 mentioned by the Deputy refers to the other scheme and that is functioning on a more formal basis in the 12 centres.  I will give further attention to publicising it as widely as possible.  We have leaflets on it, of course.  I believe there is a great deal of scope for development, and next year we should be able to increase very substantially the numbers who will participate.  I met the Dublin City VEC about this question and they told me they were interested in this development and would be able to provide 1,000 places.  I hope to meet directly with more of the VECs and colleges throughout the country to make sure they understand this and get it functioning as urgently as possible.  I agree with the Deputy it is very valuable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1973-77 era the then National Coalition Govenment, with no reference to national pension boards in four consecutive years, reduced the non-contributory old age pension age from 70 to 66.  Surely it is a political issue, a Government decision, so why not do it? It would be a recognition of the services people have given to the country.  It is almost 15 years since there was any movement in the age limit.  I ask the Minister to make a decision to reduce it to 65 years.  Will he consider that without referring to boards and committees?  That is only an excuse for not doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Pensions Board are considering a number of the issues which are still outstanding and their report this summer will be particularly important in that it will deal with all these interrelated factors.  The Deputy points to the fact that the age was reduced <Col N="1787" /> between 1973 and 1977.  He will be well aware that that was when we had benefits of our membership of the EC when for the first time we did not have to pay for the milk.  Initially at that time the taxpayer was saved over £30 million in 1972-73 terms.  As part of the arrangements for going into the EC, that money ws directed into social welfare.  We have concentrated on bringing more people into the scheme and we have brought all the self-employed into it.  That was our first step.  This question raised by the Deputy remains to be considered in a future budgetary context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In some countries at this stage they are increasing the ages because, as the Deputy probably knows, people are living much longer and it is estimated that in future they will live considerably longer.

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the number of disability benefit claims referred to medical referees in 1989; the average waiting period for an appointment to see a medical referee; the number of decisions by medical referees that were in conflict with the original medical certification; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 86,410 disability benefit claimants referred for a medical referee examination in 1989.  In 21,345 cases the claimants were deemed to be capable of work.</P>
      <P>When a case is selected for examination by a medical referee the claimant is usually seen within a couple of weeks and is given at least a week's notice. Where a person is found to be capable of work and appeals against this decision, he is referred to another medical referee for further examination.</P>
      <P>The time taken can, however, vary with the location, as the Department try to ensure that persons are examined at locations as convenient as practical to where they reside, it can depend on the frequency with which the particular area is visited and the fact that the examination has to be carried out by a different referee from the first one.  Every effort is made to arrange the examination in these cases in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area in which all Members have problems.  In view of the fact that medical referees do not heed medical evidence when they are checking patients, is the Minister satisfied that people have been refused disability payments although it was proved afterwards that they were incapable of working? Public representatives and others have to make strenuous efforts to ensure that the Department have regard to some of the <Col N="1789" /> medical evidence which was disregarded initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a case of this kind this morning, indeed, I have them most mornings.  If we want the system to operate independently we must establish medical referees so that if people are not satisfied with one they may seek a second opinion from another.  The last avenue is to go to an appeals officer.  There are all sorts of reasons for wrong decisions being made and we query them every so often. I have often asked how decisions have been arrived at but we must trust the professional people who are doing the job even though our own views may differ from time to time.  In most cases the local general practitioner is invited to submit a report on the case and he can also enclose a specialist's report if one is available. Very often people know they are not well and, although they have been to a specialist, they do not furnish a report until the second examination.  There will always be some cases that will fall through the net but, broadly speaking, the system works well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is very deep concern regarding this area?  There is a feeling that there is a slapdash approach to examinations. What instructions are given to medical referees in relation to how they conduct examinations?  Has the Minister any proposals to end the practice whereby medical examinations are of a most cursory nature and do not seem to relate to the problem in the medical certificate?  For example, I heard of an outrageous case of a cursory physical examination of somebody who has a certificate for a nervous breakdown.  Are there general guidelines, training or instruction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a largely statistical question and, consequently, I do not have all the relevant information.  All medical referees are fully qualified.  They have to have at least six years' experience in <Col N="1790" /> practice after their basic qualification and quite a number of them have a higher qualification.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Appeals officers are not medically qualified and that is the value of the system.  When a person is first examined and is not satisfied he can appeal to a second medical referee and if that fails it goes to the appeals officer who will examine the decision in an administrative way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any doubt about referees' medical qualifications but all such people have the ability to give an opinion and, as the Minister is aware, opinions always differ.  Unfortunately, doctors dealing with social welfare cases tend to agree with one another.  Is the Minister aware of the fact that medical referees do not want to see medical evidence, X-rays and so on and that they do not use the facilities of a medical institution to assist them in making a decision?  None of us would dispute their opinion if it was based on a proper examination. I hope that the chief appeals officer, set up under the new Bill, will address some of these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was outlining my reservations on the one hand and my support on the other for the concept of the carer's <Col N="1838" /> allowance and the fact that it was restricted in the main to old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>I was arguing that there is a huge range of people who will not qualify because the people for whom they are caring are not in the prescribed age bracket.  There is also a problem with the definition of full-time care and attention.  I argued, and I will not repeat it now, that there are deficiencies in regard to the means testing, which would exclude many people, and also in regard to the qualifications for full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>I want to move on to the third part of my reservation; I referred to this in my Second Stage contribution.  Deputy Ferris mentioned the potential savings to the health boards as a result of the carer's allowance and I want to address that question and also the question of the Minister's thinking on the carers' allowance. Although we welcome the introduction of this allowance, there may be an attempt by the health boards in particular to cut back on the services that exist already, for example, the number of public health nurses and so on.  We are dealing with people who are in need of full-time care and attention and there might be an attempt by the Department of Health to reduce the number of health board beds to which many of these recipients of care might be entitled.  If it were not for the carers these people might be in nursing homes, either private or those run by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people providing care on a voluntary basis, at tremendous personal cost.  The burden seems to fall heavily on the shoulders of single daughters, whose marriage prospects are diminished as a result.  They have to make sacrifices because of the pressures on them to stay at home and look after the ailing parent.  As these people are now being given an allowance, the health boards might take the view that it is their obligation to look after the ageing member of the family, that they should get on with the job.  The carer's allowance should not be seen as a substitute for a proper health service and should not result in a reduction in the number of public health <Col N="1839" /> nurses.  The allowance of £45 is comparable to the bed subvention for people in nursing homes.  That matter is being dealt with in the Health (Nursing Homes) Bill, which is going through the House at present.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give me a reassurance that he has not colluded with the Department of Health to cut back the funding to the health boards in the area of care of the elderly as a result of introducing this £45 allowance.  There is no one more exploited in the country than the people who in many cases voluntarily sacrifice themselves to care for the elderly.  There are other people who would never be prepared to make these sacrifices or do this work on a voluntary basis, notwithstanding the fact that the £45 allowance is available.  I am concerned that those people who, for many reasons, whether through lack of time or lack of a sense of commitment, do not care for their aged relatives, may be pressured into taking on board a task which they would not normally have taken on.  Pressure should not be put on them by the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Health to take up this allowance but health board services have been so badly depleted that people will be faced with very little alternative. I would like assurance from the Minister that there is no collusion between the Department of Social Welfare and the health boards or the Department of Health to put undue pressure on these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>As many speakers have said, this section dealing with carer's allowance has received great publicity. The scheme appears to be very attractive and it would be wonderful if all carers &mdash; there are over 60,000 in this country &mdash; could qualify for it.  The Minister praised the wonderful work of those carers, we would all recognise that but I hope false expectations have not been raised by various PR statements and reports in the press on the matter.  Now is our chance to tease out a few of the problems that have arisen.  I referred to this matter in <Col N="1840" /> my speech on Second Stage and I am still not satisfied that it has been fully clarified.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify first the definition of full-time carers, which has been raised on a few occasions. The allowance has been increased from £28 to £45 and will probably replace the prescribed relative allowance which was availed of by about 2,000 people.  It is expected that the carer's allowance will be paid to 8,000 people but that is only about one-eighth of the carers in the country.  I hope the situation will not arise whereby genuine carers will not qualify either on the grounds of the full-time clause or on the means test.</P>
      <P>Social welfare officials are conscientious people and they might use the full-time clause as a means of disqualifying people.  As I said on Second Stage, a small farmer with five or six cows, 30 or 40 ewes and ten or 12 cattle could not be disqualified on the means test but technically he could be disqualified by a conscientious social welfare officer on the grounds that he is not a full-time carer because it might be interpreted that he has to look after his livestock as well as his aged relative.  I hope that situation will not arise.  We as public representatives know through our work in our constituencies how these cases can be interpreted by conscientious social welfare officers but I hope the Minister will clarify that matter.  In other words, will people who may have to devote a small amount of their time to other duties be disqualified on the grounds that they are not full-time carers?</P>
      <P>The second aspect on which I would like clarification is the means test.  Section 17 (2) (b) states:</P>
      <P>Where such weekly means exceed £2, at the scheduled rate reduced by £2 for each amount (if any) of £2 by which those weekly means exceed £2, any fraction of £2 in those weekly means being treated for this purpose as £2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is farcical.  How do you arrive at a situation where you begin to take all means in excess of £2 into account in a means test?  If income of £2 is taken as the base figure, is income in excess of this <Col N="1841" /> taken into account?  If that is the case, then the very good step which the Minister has taken in increasing the carer's allowance from £28 to £45 will be lost, as the increase will be clawed back after the means test.  The Minister acknowledged in his contribution the wonderful work that carers do in caring for people, and there are over 60,000 carers looking after people at home who would otherwise have to go into institutional care, whether to hospital or somewhere else.  It could cost the State anything in the region of £350 to £500 per week to keep such a person in institutional care.</P>
    <P>I had said on Second Stage that if carers were given an allowance up to £100 per week, this would not be too much, because of the good work they do; because of the saving to the Exchequer in caring for people at home and the fact that some carers have to leave gainful employment to act as full-time carers in the home. What I mean by a full-time carer is a person who is available at home at most times to care for the person.  Some people might leave gainful employment if the carer's allowance were set at a more realistic level and this would leave a vacancy for somebody else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisified with the direction we are going with the means test.  In the case where a husband has an income of £100, a wife is adjudged to have an income of half that, £50, so the wife would not be entitled to a carer's allowance.  It is no good saying in the media that wives will now be entitled to the carer's allowance when in fact they will not qualify under the means test. <Col N="1842" /> Let us not be deceiving people that the scheme is something which it is not.</P>

      <P>Before the sitting was suspended I had asked the Minister a whole series of questions and perhaps the Minister's replies would be helpful to those who have since contributed.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that he has been given power under a section in the Bill to interpret means testing liberally.  The Minister might also consider using a similar facility as he used when dealing with the bean an tí in the Gaeltacht areas, which was a magnificent idea.  It allowed the Minister to exclude a particular category and in the case of carers, the Minister might apply similar criteria; he has this mechanism available to him.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the questions of the means test for carers and the way to qualify as a carer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to set out in more detail where he plans to go from here.  The announcement of a carer's allowance scheme raised a great many expectations among the public that people would qualify for the allowance. I despair because social welfare are dealing in a piecemeal, disjointed way with what is basically a health issue; and the Department of Health are involved in paying supplementary welfare allowance, which is really a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask if the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Health, have an overall view of the direction of this very important section of health care?  As I have said, it is a very restricted scheme. I hope the Minister can tell us at some stage if he has any plans to develop the other very important arm of home care, that is, home help, and whether he is having discussions with his colleague in relation to this issue.  At present we are spending £700 million per annum on hospital services and if a small investment was made by either the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare in community care, we would get a massive return and a reduction of the <Col N="1843" /> amount of money we are spending on hospital care.</P>
    <P>At present nearly 50 per cent of the health budget is going to hospital care and there are huge savings to be made in that area.  This provision in the Bill is a feeble effort to deal with that problem. Does the Minister plan to introduce a more comprehensive scheme, because at present in my health board area we employ several hundred home helps at 75p per hour, which is slave labour and we expect them to give a service.  If we are really serious about developing the whole area of home care, for which the Minister is responsible, with his colleague, the Minister for Health, we have to deal with the areas of overlap and the areas where no service is being provided at all.  I must ask the Minister if there are plans to revamp the present scheme and if there are plans to incorporate it with the home help scheme.  The home help scheme exploits the good nature of people.  I will finish now, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

I am asking the Minister to get together with his colleague, the Minister for Health, and clear this whole muddy area once and for all. Many good natured and civic-minded people are being exploited and underpaid. A rate of 75p per hour in these days is a scandal.  This murky area should be <Col N="1844" /> cleared up once and for all.  If we can get our act together there will be a major return to the State in that there will be a great reduction in the £700 million that is being spent on hospitals.  If we can keep people out of institutions the community, and the State, will benefit.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of concern about the carer's allowance.  That is more apparent in the west because there are more old folk there and many of them stay at home.  I am critical of the section because of the way it is laid out.  I have no doubt that the Department will issue pamphlets on the lines of the section and that they will list those who are entitled. I am sure they will contain a definition of a &ldquo;relevant pensioner&rdquo; and include the list of 12 people who qualify.  I commend the Minister for introducing this scheme and he is entitled to any kudos that are going for introducing it.  However, expectations have been raised because the Department have stated that many people will be entitled to the new allowance.</P>
      <P>Last week I was informed that an allowance paid to a daughter looking after an old age pensioner was disallowed because her sister was living in the house. The first condition the Department attached to the free electricity scheme was that an applicant must be living alone.  That is not right.  The conditions of the scheme should be clearly set out in any literature produced by the Department following the passage of the Bill. The limitations of the scheme should be highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to commend the Soroptimists, who are campaigning to get a holiday break for those in receipt of the carer's allowance.  The Minister has an opportunity to make a provision for that in the Bill.  The Soroptimists are a caring organisation and the Minister, who has the reputation of being a caring person, should help them in their objective.  I am sure he will agree that carers need a holiday.  Other spurious amendments have been accepted by the Minister and there is no reason he should not accept one that will provide for a ten day or 14 <Col N="1845" /> day break for those who must care for elderly and handicapped people in their own homes.</P>

      <P>I do not have any objection to carers getting a holiday break.  I accept that the Deputy is concerned about the difficulties carers have to deal with.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the leaflets which will be issued following the passing of the Bill will be very clear.  We take a lot of trouble to make our leaflets clear.  Credit for that is due to the Department, and a little to myself for the idea. The Department produce the leaflets in a very professional way.  The Deputy can be assured that while the legislation may be complicated the leaflets will be very clear.</P>
      <P>I recognise the fact that once one uses the word &ldquo;carer&rdquo; in regard to an allowance people assume that everybody will be entitled to it.  We are introducing the scheme in a controlled way and at a later stage we will see what can be done with it.  I have been trying to keep expectations down but I accept that once the scheme was announced many people felt they were entitled to the allowance.  Deputy Carey referred to the exclusion of a daughter because another person living in the house had an income.  One of the benefits of the new scheme is that the other person will not affect a carer's entitlement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen suggested that this was a matter for the Department of Health.  He suggested that the Department of Social Welfare were jumping into their area.  The Deputy should bear in mind that most of the people who will be cared for are in receipt of invalidity pensions, old age pensions and so on.</P>
      <P>The only area where it could be said that we are encroaching on the territory of the Department of Health would be in regard to the DPMAs and that is why I introduced an amendment, which was accepted by the House, to the effect that people in need of full-time attention and in receipt of the DPMA will be considered. We are considering moving the DPMA scheme to the Department of Social Welfare.  The question of home help is a matter for the Minister for Health and I do not intend to get involved in a debate on that scheme today.</P>
      <P>Deputies McCormack and Ferris asked about the means test.  There is no difficulty about the definition of full-time care and attention.  Basically, it means that the carer should not have any full-time outside occupation.  I do not anticipate any difficulty in regard to that.</P>

If a wife is giving the care, I do not think there would be any difficulty under the new arrangements but there would be a difficulty under the old scheme.

      <P>The sale of chickens will not affect an application unless one gets involved in a major chicken hatchery.  I should now like to deal with means tests.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCormack missed the point that the £6 disregard is still there, the £2 is the way in which it reduces, so they are two separate matters.  In other words, you can go to £2 before it starts to reduce, otherwise it would start reducing at £1. It does not reduce until one gets to £2. All the allowances for the old age and non-contributory pensions are there, including the £6 disregard.  I know it is difficult to understand all the details of the means test but if there are children there is an allowance for them.  Deputy Ferris said he thought a figure of 8,000 recipients of this allowance might be optimistic. That figure will include people who get partial payments, that is, those who transfer from one payment to another; in other words, a person might give up a payment as a dependant and get a payment in his own right at a higher rate.  I accept the figure which has been computed by my own officials.  The best thing is to set up the scheme to allow for flexibility and proceed from there.  I want to assure Deputy Byrne that all invalidity pensioners are included, it is not only old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned the figure of 66,000 people.  The study of the aged showed that figure to be 50,000 of whom 25,000 were full-time carers giving full-time care and attention.  When talking about doing something for full-time carers one is talking about 25,000 people, according to known figures, but that figure could be very much higher when we start working in that area.  Deputy Byrne was also concerned that health boards may reduce the number of public health nurses and that there might be collusion. I am being attacked on the one hand for jumping in and taking something from <Col N="1848" /> the Department of Health and on the other hand for collusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the new allowance, the definitions are very clear. The new carer's allowance broadens very substantially the scope of the scheme. For the first time married women and persons who are not related to the pensioner will be able to qualify for the allowance. Furthermore, their entitlement will not be affected, as at present, if other persons are also residing with the pensioner; that gets back to the point I was making earlier.  In addition, the rate of the allowance is being increased from £28 to £45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point I want to make, which is relevant to most of the discussion, is that section 198L provides for the necessary regulatory powers to facilitate the introduction of the new allowance.  These <Col N="1849" /> are the powers which Deputies would not let me have without coming back and going through the whole administrative process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ferris and the Labour Party were prepared to trust me, and for that I thank them.  It is also very practical because section 198L provides for the necessary regulatory powers to facilitate the introduction of the new allowance.  In addition, I am conscious of the need to make special provision for certain exceptional categories of carers. Section 198L contains regulatory powers to entitle the new allowance persons who would otherwise qualify but for the fact that the conditions as to means are not satisfied.  I have provided in this section for the very thing we are talking about here.  I will have the facility to make judgments on these issues.  That is the way I would normally work as the Minister.  I listen to what is said by Deputies and when regulations are being made we try to bear those issues in mind and meet them as far as we can.</P>
      <P>The categories of carers to whom these regulations will apply are under consideration at present but I would envisage, for example, that entitlement would be extended to persons of moderate means who are caring for old age pensioners. I will have to do that in a controlled way.  For every step I take there is a cost element, but I have the power here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is why that power is so important to me and why I felt it was important that I have the power to act on it and lay regulations on the table which, if any Members of the House do not agree with, they can vote on them within 21 sitting days of the House.  That is a very important provision. It gives the Minister the opportunity to keep these questions under <Col N="1850" /> review.  All in all the section, as amended, is a good one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are reforms in this section but one of the biggest problems was the way in which it was introduced and the presentation, which led to a totally unjustified expectation.  The Minister in representing it as an increase from £28 to £45 continues to mislead people and to fuel that expectation because people will be disappointed when they make application.  Out of the 8,000, how many does the Minister estimate will receive the full benefit without the loss of some other benefit?  Is it not a fact that the largest category of people will be dependant wives whose benefits will actually increase by £10 or £15?  If the Minister says that is what he is doing, it would be welcome but to present it as an increase is ridiculous.  A proportion of those who currently qualify for the prescribed relative's allowance will benefit by the increase from £28 to £45, but the benefit will be limited by the means test. I ask the Minister again &mdash; he did not make any comment on my proposal in relation to the carer's benefit &mdash; if the issue in principle will be consistent with the general social welfare system and in line with disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  Will he acknowledge that where people give up employment they would be entitled to this benefit? Does he have a view on that?  Is it for purely cost reasons that he rejects it? Would he not accept the fundamental argument?  Would he be open to considering an expansion in that direction in the future?  Can he give me an estimate of how much will be given to the 8,000 he anticipates will receive the allowance? Obviously he has set aside some money for it this year, but I do not anticipate that he will use all of it this year.  What scale of benefit does he anticipate that those 8,000 will receive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Minister an example of some of the categories of married women who would qualify.  I identified the married spouse in a social welfare family who could qualify for the <Col N="1851" /> carer's allowance, but her husband would lose her dependant's allowance, and the number of children would have to be taken into account.  Will she be allowed to claim for all the children in the means test exemption, or will it be as for other social welfare benefits that she can claim only for half the children as dependants? Is that how it will work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Sadly, in conformity with the equal treatment legislation, which Deputies are very conscious of, that will be the position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Flaherty, I certainly made it very clear in presenting the scheme initially that it would be very tightly controlled, particularly in the early stages, until it was set up, that we could see how it was operating and how the costings were working out.  I have got agreement to go as far as I am going in this Bill, which we estimate will bring in about 8,000 people. This is an estimated figure and I cannot tell the Deputy exactly how many people will be involved.  It is mainly the people who have no or low means or those on social welfare who will get the increase of £17 or half the rate.  The basic criterion is that people cannot be in employment. We will have to wait and see what happens. It could transpire, even using this criterion, that there would be more than 8,000 people.</P>
      <P>This will be very comprehensive legislation which will give us the power to deal with some of the variables mentioned by the Deputies.  Obviously, there will be some financial consequences and I will have to bear these in mind when I am dealing with them.  I will not be constrained in tackling them; I will be able to tackle them under the powers being given to me by the House.  The Oireachtas will be giving me the power to go ahead along those lines and to measure the scheme as we go along.  Certain basics are set out very clearly in the Bill and I will have the power to go further.</P>

Will they be invited to make their applications a month in advance so that some of the problems we have identified can be teased out?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60.</P>
      <P>In page 16, lines 21 to 28, to delete paragragh (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  the insertion after subsection (4)  of the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" />&lsquo;(4A) Notwithstanding anything in regulations made under subsection (4) of this section, any person seeking to appeal a decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall be entitled to an oral hearing of that appeal, and</P>
    <P>(b)  shall be entitled to be represented and accompanied at that appeal by a relative, legal representative or welfare rights activist or any other individual nominated by the appellant.',&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Byrne and I are seeking the same thing in our amendments, that is, the right of a person to request an oral hearing.  I am proposing an additional provision in my amendment.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the setting up of a new appeals office.  This is a response to the demand which has been made for some time by welfare rights organisations and groups for an independent and separately managed office with a separate executive.  Some of us may have preferred the Minister to go a different road in the establishment of this office.  The Minister has chosen to reorganise the appeals section of his Department and establish them in a separate office with different structures.  The Minister will disconnect himself to a degree from this office by devolving a lot of power to the appeals officer but he has retained the power to make a decision in regard to an oral hearing.  Obviously we are concerned about this.  It is hard to set up a structure with adequate consumer representation or outside influence so that people believe it is genuinely the people's appeal system and not the Department's appeal system run by officials trained by the Department.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that the entitlement to an oral hearing should exist for anyone and should not depend on the Minister being satisfied about certain conditions.  Obviously there would be earlier stages in an appeal, and I hope most people would be satisfied with the response they get, but they should be entitled to an oral hearing of an appeal if they believe this is appropriate.  This <Col N="1854" /> entitlement exists to some degree in the current legislation in that an appellant is entitled to be accompanied at an appeal by a family member or with the agreement of the appeals officer, some other person.  I should like this provision to be extended so that it would be made known to all appellants that they are entitled to be represented and accompanied at an appeal by a relative, legal representative, welfare rights activist or any other individual nominated by the appellant.</P>
    <P>I have attended appeals, as I am sure other Deputies have, and I regret to have to say that this can have a significant influence on the outcome of the appeal. The welfare rights groups who have been active in this area, in particular the Coolock Law Centre, have said that their presence at appeals has undoubtedly had a beneficial effect on the outcome for the appellants.  People have very real problems with the appeals system because they do not understand it or know what kind of information is required. Obviously this could be dealt with by way of regulation and greater explanation of what is required.</P>
    <P>It should be written into the Bill that people have an absolute right to an oral hearing of an appeal and to be represented legally.  I should like the provisions of the free legal aid scheme &mdash; if we ever get it back on the road &mdash; to be extended to social welfare appeals by individuals and groups.  Obviously the outcome of these appeals can make a huge difference to the standard of living of these people.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister accepts my amendment. I will be supporting Deputy Byrne's amendment.  I presume the Deputy is implying that the response to all requests should be in the affirmative. His amendment could be clearer but I presume the intent of it is that an appeal should be granted if a request is made.  I ask the Minister to consider these amendments favourably so that we can look at the substance of section 19, as amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the wording of section 19 (b) which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> Notwithstanding subsection (4), where the Minister or a person designated by him considers that the circumstances of a particular case warrant an oral hearing of the appeal, the Minister or any person so designated by him may direct the Chief Appeals Officer ...</P>
    <P>We are not happy with that wording because this must be seen to be separate from and independent of the Minister if there is to be any degree of faith in the appeals system.  At present there is a lot of scepticism about the appeals system; people feel they will not win because the Minister is up there watching.</P>

      <P>Why is there a need for a reference to the Minister?  Why does the Minister need the power to direct a person designated by him to direct the chief appeals officer?  The chief appeals officer should be at the top of the tree.  Like the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, we do not like the notion that the Minister can give permission to certain people to direct the appeals officer.  They argue that there seems to be unnecessary political clientelism and see the Minister's role as being unnecessary.  They argue that if the chief appeals officer's decision is reliable on the matter of people's income then it must be reliable on whether an oral hearing is to be allowed.  Any person who wishes should be entitled to request an oral hearing. We feel it is unnecessary that the Minister or appointees of the Minister should be able to decide to direct the chief appeals officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the same representations made to me by the Dublin <Col N="1856" /> Welfare Group and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  I discussed with them this morning their concern about this and tried to reassure them on the basis of common justice, which seems to be a very popular phrase around here lately.  I do not think anybody can be refused the right to have their case heard on appeal at an oral hearing if they so wish.  Common justice demands that. Disability benefit is dealt with by doctors and if a person persists he will be granted an oral hearing, which will take place in front of an inspector who is not a medical person.  This was discussed already.  I presume this will continue.  If not, then Deputy O'Flaherty's concern is justified; the words she wants to include are to ensure that people have that right.  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed were worried about what looks like the Minister's right to call for an appeal, but the Minister is answerable to the House and I have the right to question him.  If this right attaches to somebody outside of this House the Minister could say, if I questioned him in the House, that we gave this right to an outside agency over which he has no control. The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed are concerned that prople might not be aware of their rights.  It is our responsibility to tell people their rights and we will fight for their rights here on the basis of common justice, and the Minister is answerable to us.  If that is not contained in the Bill then Deputy Flaherty is right to be concerned, and the words used by Deputy Byrne would not be strong enough because he is just looking for the right to make an application. Perhaps the Minister would respond and clarify the situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is appointing an appeals officer and delegating to the appeals office powers which were previously held by him.  In subparagraph (b), which we seek to have deleted, he is rescinding the right to make decisions relating to an oral hearing.  This Minister is, of course, a decent and honourable man who operates on behalf of us all so generously; he is a wonderful man at keeping lines of communication open and undoubtedly handles his Department exceptionally well.  We might, however, have a change of face and a change of approach and we are leaving in a power which is unnecessary if we leave the entitlement directly to the individuals and not through their politicians and the good grace of a good Minister or a bad Minister or a good Deputy or a bad Deputy or through going to the local advice centre run by a Deputy.  Why do we not just write it into the legislation, as I suggest here?  That would remove the necessity for having to go to a Deputy and everybody would have an absolute right.</P>

      <P>At the end of the day people go through a series of appeals; it is rarely limited, as the Deputy suggests. It is extremely helpful for people to have the system clear and simple.  One of the difficulties is that people do not know exactly where they are and they find it a lot more difficult than we do to know <Col N="1858" /> what their rights are.  The changes we are making are minimal in terms of the establishment of an independent appeals system.  The preferred system would have been something like an ombudsman's office but I know that would involve enormous initial expense.  It is important to have some elements which strengthen the rights of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the appeals procedure is of extreme importance. I am not satisfied that this section as it stands, even with the benefit of the amendment, is adequate to protect the needs of people who are knocked off benefit in the social welfare system. Unfortunately, large numbers of people have been knocked off benefit almost arbitrarily in recent times after very cursory medical examinations by the referees. There are many cases of people who have complicated illnesses and injuries and have been in-patients in hospitals, are on heavy drugs, are attending outpatients departments and require X-rays and detailed investigation of their conditions. Some GP acting as a medical referee knocks them off benefit after a ten-minute examination and they are thrown back on the appeals procedure. Everything is against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new procedure there will be an independent official.  This is certainly an improvement but it does not go far enough to meet the needs of justice.  Very many of the people making appeals have to attend by themselves.  They are often inarticulate and unable to get across the circumstances of their case.  This obviously militates against them.  To deal with this matter properly, the Minister and the Department should not only allow a relative or a legal representative to attend but should ensure that assistance is available for them.  It is a waste of time to provide in the Bill for legal representation.  It looks very nice that a person is allowed to bring along a legal representative.  What person who has been in receipt of social welfare and has been knocked off will be able to afford legal representation at a social welfare appeal?  These people are on their uppers <Col N="1859" /> and their money has been cut off.  Will they be in a position to pay a solicitor to help them?  It is nonsense.  Perhaps it is thought that the Government's legal aid scheme could cover the situation &mdash; some hope, some fat chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The dice are loaded against these people.  I know from personal experience that many of them have very good cases but they cannot get this across.  If they had a representative the position would very often be different. The Department should retain a staff of two or three experienced people to act on behalf of appellants and help them in presenting their case.</P>
      <P>People are being knocked off benefit at a disgraceful rate on the flimsiest of examinations.  The position has got out of hand.  I do not know how medical referees &mdash; who I think are just GPs &mdash; can ignore and cast aside written memos from specialists, without the benefit of having X-rays and blood tests carried out. I have yet to hear of a medical referee who referred a person for a test before reaching a decision.  It is never done.  The whole system is very unsatisfactory and very unfair.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new procedure, as far as it goes.  Deputy Flaherty's amendment is excellent and will help somewhat but it still goes nowhere near meeting the justice that the situation requires.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 seek to provide appellants with a statutory entitlement to an oral hearing of their appeal.  Amendment No. 60 also seeks to provide appellants with a statutory entitlement to be represented and accompanied at their appeal by a relative, legal representative, welfare rights activist or any other individual nominated by the appellant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as these amendments are concerned, I would point out in the first instance that the social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial tribunal.  On the one hand, it operates as a judicial tribunal <Col N="1860" /> but in a less formal manner than the courts and on the other it has an administrative capacity and function.  If the system is to function properly it is essential that it have a degree of flexibility so that appeals officers will have a certain discretion as to how they determine appeals.  The annual volume of appeals is around 20,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different question. Let us stick to this section.  We dealt with questions on medical examinations earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring now to the number of appeals.  We dealt with the other matters at Question Time and the Deputies were here.  The appeals system covers all areas, ranging from appeals in relation to insurability, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, invalidity benefit, death grants, child benefit, widow's and orphan's pensions, old age pensions, blind pensions, retirement pensions, unemployment assistance, deserted wife's allowance, single woman's allowance, rent allowance, etc.  As I have mentioned, the number of appeals arising from all these areas is about 20,000 per year.  Let us keep matters in perspective.  There will always be problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no existing legislative provisions entitling appellants to an oral hearing.  Regulations made under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provide that if the appeals officer is of <Col N="1861" /> the view that the case may be determined without an oral hearing he may determine the appeal summarily.  I would like to emphasise, however, that no case deserving an oral hearing will fail to get one. Deputy Flaherty was concerned that those regulations might be set aside but they still apply to the system.  Making an oral hearing mandatory under the legislation would mean that many cases which by any standards would not necessitate an oral hearing would have to get one.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that claimants appeal even in cases where they do not have sufficient contributions to satisfy the required contribution conditions. This is one of the cases where they do not give an oral hearing and an explanation is required then.  Deputy Ferris raised the question about information. There would be much improved information with this system and part of the administrative arrangements is to provide the information in advance, to let people know their rights and, in terms of the welfare rights people, to ensure that adequate staff have been recruited purely to deal with that to ensure that people are fully informed and properly advised of their position.  We know from experience that claimants appeal even in cases where they do not have sufficient contributions to satisfy the required contribution conditions and I consider it would be inappropriate to grant an oral hearing in such cases.</P>
    <P>There are close on 20,000 cases reaching the social welfare appeals office for appeal every year and we must make the best use of our resources in determining these cases.  At present about half are given an oral hearing.  Oral hearings in all cases would require the allocation of much extra staff for what in effect would be unnecessary because an oral hearing is given in any case which is considered appropriate.  In other words, where it is not appropriate and would not be of benefit, an explanation is required rather than an oral hearing.  For the convenience of clients we have to send appeals officers to all parts of the country <Col N="1862" /> to hear appeals.  In the case of some UA-UB appeals it is frequently necessary to have assessors present and again it would be wasteful of their time &mdash; they are non-civil-servants &mdash; to have to attend appeals where the outcome was clearly evident from the beginning.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which I would like to highlight is the danger of being unfair to the client if an oral hearing were to be conducted in all cases as it might be evident that his appeal had little prospect of success and expectations might be raised unnecessarily by calling him to an appeal.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is provision in this Bill in section 19 (b) enabling the Minister, or a person designated by him, to direct that an appeal be determined by way of an oral hearing in any case.  I am satisfied that this provision will provide an adequate safeguard to appellants who feel aggrieved about the refusal of an oral hearing in the circumstances of their case.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Byrne.  I think TDs are very important people.  I do not agree with people outside who say TDs should not be representing people. They are there to represent them, they represent them very well and I regard them as very important.  I regard the work they do in that respect as important.  I know others do not and people are writing books about the subject.  Nevertheless, I regard them as important, particularly in relation to residual situations when all other things fail.  Where something that was not anticipated comes about you will almost always find there is a TD somewhere who knows the position and brings it to attention so that something can be done about it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ferris can see what I am talking about and why I believe it is important to have it there.  That is my view.  If others differ than let them come in and vote and we will vote differently.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 60 also seeks to provide appellants with a statutory entitlement to be represented and accompanied at an appeal by a relative, legal representative, welfare rights activist or any other individual nominated by the appellant. This amendment raises the question of the procedures to be followed at appeal hearings.  This is already provided for in the relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide that the appellant may appear at the hearing in person, that he may be represented by a member of his family or, with the consent of the appeals officer, by any other person.  In the case of appeals relating to entitlement to unemployment payments, assessors must, by law, be present and the hearing cannot proceed in their absence without the consent of the appellant.</P>
      <P>In practice, an appeals officer will not refuse any reasonable request from an appellant to bring along a representative to a hearing.  Indeed, I would like to point out that as far as can be readily recalled, no request by an appellant to be represented by any person at an oral hearing has ever been refused.  The appeals officer does, however, have discretion in the matter and this is as it should be so as to preserve the standing of the appeals system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the social welfare appeal system is a quasi-judicial tribunal. It is necessary, therefore, that there <Col N="1864" /> should be certain formalities to enable the appellant get the best value out of the hearing.  Within this framework it is necessary that someone be responsible for the orderly conduct of the hearing and this responsibility clearly rests with the appeals officer.  The appeals officer is the person responsible for making a decision arising from the proceedings &mdash; a decision which incidentally may subsequently be referred to the High Court. It is only fair and reasonable that the appeals officer should have some control over who should attend the appeal hearing &mdash; outside of the appellant and a member of his family.</P>
    <P>I consider that the statutory entitlements being sought in the proposed amendments are unnecessary having regard to the way appeals are conducted at present and they could have the unintended effect of affecting the efficiency of the existing appeals structure.  For these reasons, I must oppose the proposed amendments.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other questions were asked that I have not answered.  Deputy Flaherty mentioned the Coolock Law Centre.  That study was in relation to their own appeal.  If they had looked at other appeals they would have found it was not very different.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response to this proposal. On the one hand he said all these things are done anyway and are never refused in the case of anybody wishing to attend and on the other hand that oral hearings other than where there is a qualification problem are also never refused.  That has been my experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem with the social welfare system for average people who are directly affected &mdash; in many cases people who are the least articulate, least educated &mdash; is that they find it the most difficult system to get through and often simply the presence of somebody else can be of great assistance to them.  To them their rights are hidden away somewhere in regulations.  If they are lucky enough to go to a welfare rights group or to come across a TD, then they know about their <Col N="1865" /> rights.  I have often asked such people if there was anybody who could go with them to make their case when it was clear to me that the person was one who was often intimidated by medical referees to such an extent that he may not even take out the medical certificate or ensure that the guy reads it.  If he has a psychiatric problem he will not refer to it because he is embarrassed by it.  He does not realise it is essential for him to refer to the psychiatric problem if that is the issue on which he intends to base his appeal.</P>
    <P>We are talking about people who need a great deal of support.  If that support depends on the person having the knowledge and is also dependent on various people's agreement, there is no chance of that improving their situation.  We could pass this appeals provision today and nothing would have improved for the individual social welfare recipient who should be at the centre of all this and for whom as a result of this there should be great improvements in the appeals procedure.  I am very much aware that the direction of the communication with the various welfare rights groups was opposite to the one that Deputy Ferris mentioned, but I got in touch with them to seek their views because they represent a large group of people.  That view is also shared by FLAC, who voluntarily represent people in relation to social welfare issues.  I agree that my hope in relation to legal aid being extended in the future is a long shot but at present my concern is in regard to people who are willing to provide free legal aid.  I considered debating the matter further but I decided we had enough on hand.</P>
    <P>If an amendment of this nature is not included in the Bill there will be very little benefit in the new arrangements for social welfare beneficiaries engaging in an appeal.  The Minister has undermined his own argument by saying that these things are done anyway, apart from a very limited number of cases.  I see no reason for taking away the power and then giving it back to himself.  It indicates that the Minister has a lack of confidence in his appeals officer if he feels that he must have this fail safe provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes. Indeed, I gather that there may be changes as early as October or November in the line up of the Front Bench opposite, according to rumours, and we do not know who will be facing us.  Not everybody on the Front Bench inspires as much confidence as the Minister.  Therefore, I am very concerned to take this away from the area of the efficient TD and to give it as a right to people.  I will give the Minister a guarantee that if I am still in this position in 12 months time and if he can prove there have been substantial difficulties as a result of vexatious claims and that a great deal of time has been taken up in processing these cases, I will accept an amendment this time next year.  I am sure my colleagues will agree that we should set up an appeals procedure which will be consumer friendly and will be an improvement by making the system more humane and effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly support Deputy Flaherty's comments.  The very concept of an appeals system must carry with it a very strong conviction in relation to its impartiality and fairness.  In any form of appeals system, in the courts or in the Department of Social Welfare, there must be a clear understanding by everybody involved that when an appeal is heard there will be an impartial decision because there will be no vested interests or interference of any sort.  They must feel that everything will be above board in relation to the hearing of an appeal. We are specifically relating this debate to the whole question of oral hearings and who will be entitled to decide to grant them.  Everybody should be entitled, as a matter of right, to request an oral hearing in a case for which the appellant has felt he has not been treated fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it helps that the Minister seems to be retaining to himself the power to decide which particular appeals warrant an oral hearing.  Why should the Minister take all this responsibility?  I am <Col N="1867" /> worried that the Minister &mdash; like his colleague, Minister Flynn &mdash; has outlined the arguments in favour of clientelist politics to such a degree that, if it were to continue, the whole parliamentary system would be awash with people bypassing Parliament and requesting to see the Minister.  I am afraid that the Minister is asking us to make our representations to him in order to get him to agree that the cases we are presenting are suitable for an oral hearing.  That is not the way we want the system to work, too many of us are involuntarily engaged in the pursuit of clientelist politics because this is the way it is presented to us.</P>
    <P>The public perception of the chief appeals officer should be that he is on a par with the Ombudsman in the sense of impartiality and fairness.  The politicians should have confidence in the chief appeals officer and the Minister should have confidence in decisions taken by him.  The Minister said some people would be looking for an oral hearing when they did not have a good case. However, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed clearly covered that point when they said they believed that an oral hearing should be mandatory on request.  We do not go that far, our amendment is slightly different. Unless the matter is in regard to a technicality, the number of stamps paid and the number of weeks unemployed, etc., the appellant should be informed of the decision to disallow an oral hearing and be given two weeks to raise any reason for the matter depending on more than a technicality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy now amending his amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to take on board the full meaning of our amendment, which says that a person who submits an appeal under subsection (1) shall be entitled to request an oral hearing. The request for an oral hearing can, in all cases, be acceded to except where there is a technicality which means that the person will be written to.  Of course, <Col N="1868" /> the applicant still has a right to reply, to say that there is more to the appeal than the technicality listed by the appeals officer and that he wants to have an oral hearing.  That is perfectly legitimate and above board.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that TDs should retain the right to lobby and to make representations to him.  Irrespective of whether we remove the power of the Minister and his appointees to decide which cases should have oral hearings, we will always be here to lobby the Minister and to make amendments to next year's Social Welfare Bill if we have collectively discovered that the system is not working.  We have a yearly review of every decision taken on the Social Welfare Bill and I do not see any reason for such review not monitoring how the appeals system is working.  I am very unhappy that we should be seen to be canvassing Ministers all the time.  Surely the Minister recognises that he has a very responsible job to carry out on behalf of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The concept of a new chief appeals officer was guaranteed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  We also accept the point made by Deputy Taylor which outlined the tremendous problem people throughout the country have in trying to have their case heard properly. The Minister confirmed my original point about the Consolidation Act, 1981. There is a provision in that Act which allows people to request an oral hearing and I know of no case where a hearing has been refused.</P>

      <P>Neither do I know of a case <Col N="1869" /> in which the local social welfare officer did not allow somebody to accompany the person making the appeal.  At times they even suggested that the person could bring his own doctor if he wished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it happens more regularly in rural areas.  I know of people who have been rejected by two medical referees and who, before going before a final panel of referees for adjudication have received communication that they could bring a doctor with them, but, unfortunately, some doctors are very busy.  I know of a case where, when the doctor was not available, my constituent, because he felt he was unable to put his case properly, asked if I was available. Naturally, I approached the social welfare inspectors and asked them, out of common courtesy, if they had any objection to my attending on behalf of my constituent.  That was a medical case and I could have been turned down on the basis that medical evidence was confidential to the Department and the applicant, but the officer agreed.  I attended and put the case to the panel on behalf of my constituent and, I am glad to say, we were successful.  The Consolidation Act, 1981, allows people the right to appeal and we do not know of any case where that has been refused.  However, that does not take from the case made by Deputy Taylor about all the problems that lead to further appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look on this new section as an additional safeguard.  In the case of a chief appeals officer refusing an appeal, there should be recourse to somebody and the Minister, as head of his Department, could direct him, although I am not suggesting that he do so in all cases.  I believe people would want the Minister to intervene in the case of refusal of an appeal, unless there is a technical reason for its refusal.  Even then it should be open to people to approach an advice centre, a politician or somebody for assistance. What is wrong with that?  We are always knocking ourselves in regard to the service we give and we allow others to knock <Col N="1870" /> us as well.  I see nothing wrong with giving advice to people who elect me to represent them.  The Minister represents the Government and if the appeals officer is not answerable to the Minister, I cannot expect him to be responsible for a parliamentary question I might ask regarding a case about which I am aggrieved.  If the Minister were not responsible, he would immediately say that the final decision rests with the chief appeals officer.</P>
    <P>This provision is a safety valve but it may not be used very often.  If after a 12 month period it becomes obvious that this amendment is absolutely necessary and if the chief appeals officer has not been giving people a fair crack of the whip, I would have a different attitude to it but as of now I am satisfied that this provision should be available under the Consolidation Act, 1981, and on the basis of common justice.  If an appeal is refused the person has a right to go to court, and nobody can take that right from him.  He also has the right to go to the Ombudsman. People now exercise that regularly and rightly so, because of the Department's failure to meet their legitimate requests.  I have had to avail of the office of the Ombudsman, because some Ministers in other Governments admitted that they were hamstrung by regulations and legislation and could go no further in the area of medical opinion, in particular. I had to invoke the Ombudsman, successfully in many cases, and the Ombudsman's office will confirm that.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that, at times, we have to go to these lengths.  I am glad the Minister is making the machinery available in this case and I hope he will use it if necessary. If it was not there I would not have recourse to anybody, except by representation to the chief appeals officer who might say, as the Revenue Commissioners' often do, that the matter is confidential.  As I have said, public representatives should not knock themselves in regard to their powers of representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper to pay tribute to the appeals officers of the <Col N="1871" /> Department of Social Welfare.  In my experience I found them to be extraordinarily courteous and dedicated to their task.  By and large they are people who do their very best with the material before them.  They have done a fine job over the years.  I do not know whether they are the same people who will be hearing the appeals when this new procedure comes in, but I hope they will because over the years they have done us proud, they have done a very fine job, and we should acknowledge that here.</P>
      <P>In this section we are trying to do something new, to bring an element of fairness into the system.  Not only should it be fair but it should be seen to be fair.  If the system is fair I do not think anybody appealing a case could be denied representation. In many cases people lose on appeal because they were not represented and their case was not put properly. Does the Minister disagree with that?  The Court of Human Rights decided on such matters and the country was compelled to bring in a legal aid scheme.  The Minister could be compelled, under EC law or Council of Europe human rights legislation, to make provision for people in these appeals cases to have legal representation.  Does the Minister agree with that?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to tell the House that he will so organise the system that if a person facing an appeal brings a solicitor with him, the Department will cover, even to some extent, the solicitor's fee?  It is very important that the person's GP be in attendance at an oral hearing. Otherwise the appeals officer gets a very one-sided picture of the position.  He has the report of one or, more likely, two medical referees who are departmental officials but he does not have an opportunity to hear the appellant's doctor. What usually happens is that they bring along some scrappy note from the GP &mdash; I have seen many of these notes, first of all they are usually pretty indecipherable &mdash; written in prescription type writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there no scrappy notes from solicitors?</P>

    <Col N="1872" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  With the level of fees paid by the Department of Social Welfare, you would not expect much better.  I do not know about the GPs in small county towns, referred to by Deputy Ferris, but I can tell the Minister, and Deputies Flaherty and Byrne will agree with me that it takes some job to get any type of a note in any depth on the person's condition from the very busy Dublin GPs.  The notes are written off in a very big hurry, and perhaps the GPs do not realise how much depends on them. A great deal depends on these notes.  It means a very great deal to the appellant and his family whether his appeal is successful. There is a lot at stake for those families and it requires that the GPs take a little more care when writing instead of giving two or three lines of a scrappy note in prescription writing.  However, many doctors do their best.  In many cases the appellant needs more than a note from the GP.  Many people coming before the appeals board are under hospital care and receiving treatment at out-patient departments and they then require a note from the consultant.  With the health cutbacks, there are long queues and it is difficult to see the consultant at the outpatients department.  The consultant would look at you if you said you wanted a note for the appeal hearing because they are even busier than the GPs.  The unfortunate people trying to organise their case for the social welfare appeal hearing face these difficulties.  The Minister has said, and he is right, that it is a quasi-judicial procedure, which is to say it is like a court case; it has quite a lot of resemblance to a court case.  That requires tremendous expertise on the part of the person themselves and of the witnesses they need to back up their case. Who are the witnesses?  The witnesses are the doctors because the overwhelming bulk of cases depend on the medical evidence, the unfortunate appeals officer has to make do with the more experienced medical referee of the Department who is dealing with these cases and a very short and inadequate note presented by the GP, or a busy consultant, who has had a few hundred <Col N="1873" /> people queueing up to see him in one of the very busy out patient departments. That is why the dice are loaded against the person and we are trying to remedy that situation.  We are looking to the Minister for fairness and the Minister can give the balance to a quasi-judicial system between the Department on the one hand who are trying to cut the people off from benefit and the appellant and his family who are trying to get what they are entitled to.  The Minister can achieve the balance if he tells the House he will make provision for a contribution towards the fee of the legal representative of the person coming before the appeal.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not make such a provision, I say plainly to him that the system is unfair.  It is putting the weight of the strong, the Department with their resources, against the weak, the people who have been cut off from the very low social welfare payments and are appealing the decision.  It is oppression of the weak by the strong.  This small measure of ensuring legal representation is available would do a tremendous amount of good. I should declare my interest when I say this; I am a solicitor, but I can assure you Sir, and the Minister that that is not the objective of what I am doing.  I say this because I have experience of a number of people who go before the appeals hearings.</P>
      <P>We have had some measure of debate on the right to an oral hearing.  I do not think anybody is saying there should be an automatic oral hearing in every single case.  Many people would not want to have an oral hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>However, any person who wants to have his case determined by an oral hearing should as of law be so entitled.  The Minister has said that they have that anyway.  Why then does he not agree to the proposal?  I agree that Deputy Byrne's amendment is not very satisfactory in this regard; it does not say anything much.  The amendment proposes that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> A person who submits an appeal under subsection (1) shall be entitled to request an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>Of course, anybody can request an oral hearing, they are requested all the time but they are turned down.  The point is, as Deputy Flaherty's amendment says they &ldquo;shall be entitled to an oral hearing of that appeal.&rdquo;  Why not?  Why should they not have it if they want it?  It does not necessarily mean that there will be an oral hearing in every single case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not given an oral hearing in cases where it is not relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister raised that point.  The Minister has said that an oral hearing would be refused where the Department's records show that not enough contributions have been paid.  You would not need an oral hearing because the Department can say that the matter does not arise due to insufficient contributions.  However, the Minister should know the state that the records of contributions are in, which is a disgrace and it required the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is an independent official of the country established under the Constitution, to point out that the Revenue Commissioners, who hold these records of PRSI contributions on their computer file records, have failed and continue to fail to give up-to-date details of people's contributions to the Department of Social Welfare.  If a person feels he is entitled to social welfare payments and is refused he applies for an oral hearing of his case; the Department officials look up their records and if they find that he has not got enough contributions they refuse his request.  The person knows that in actual fact he has enough contributions but they do not show on the records of the Department of Social Welfare because, as the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out, the Revenue Commissioners who have the records from the PRSI payments have not passed them on to the Department of Social Welfare.  I cannot remember the number <Col N="1875" /> of cases that the Comptroller and Auditor General has noted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Why on earth should a person not be entitled to have an oral hearing where he can go before the appeals officer and say that &ldquo;of course, the Department say one thing but I will take an oath on the number of contributions I have made, and I can call the evidence of my employer who has paid the contributions.&rdquo; What has happened is that there has been a breakdown between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  People are being <Col N="1876" /> denied their entitlements under the social welfare insurance scheme because of the disgraceful cutback of staff in the Department of Finance and in the Revenue Commissioners and thus there is an inability to feed in this vital information to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister for Social Welfare has the gall to come into this House and say that the category of case in which he will not give an oral hearing is the case where the person has been disallowed his rights and entitlements because of the Government's own failure to have adequate staff to update the contributions records which would entitle those people to the social welfare rights they have under the legislation. The Minister said that it would be inappropriate to grant an oral hearing to people in that category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that of the 20,000 appeals heard annually only 3,200 refer to invalidity and disability allowances.  The remainder refer to qualification certificates where the assessors are involved or relate to unemployment assistance.  That is what happens in practice.  I accept that Members in making representations may say that an employer did not make a return or that an employer absconded, but such cases are usually sorted out without having to go through the appeals procedure.  In any event, a sworn affidavit is accepted in such cases.  As far as we are concerned the system bends over backwards to support workers.</P>
      <P>A person who feels aggrieved, even though they do not have the requisite number of contributions is entitled to lodge an appeal.  I do not intend to argue the point any further.  I am opposed to the amendments.  What they are proposing will be less efficient and more expensive.  It is desirable to leave in the residual power to request an oral hearing; I am not referring to a decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne suggested that Ministers interfered with decisions.  That is more of the jargon that we have been hearing from him.  It should be remembered that we are setting up an independent office to deal with appeals.  If a person is refused an appeal we can direct that an oral hearing be held and a decision will be made at that hearing.  We want to ensure that a person will get an oral hearing in exceptional cases.  I have given my view as the Minister and said why I have included that provision.  I am happy to disagree with the Deputies in regard to the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be necessary to have any residual power if we give <Col N="1878" /> an absolute right.  Given that in most cases, other than those involving technical qualification, the Minister ordered an appeal, I do not know what difficulty he has in accepting our amendment.  I would be happy to rephrase the amendment to include the words &ldquo;an oral hearing on request&rdquo;.  There is no intention to indicate that there should be an appeal in each case.  I am grateful to Deputy Taylor for proving how valuable legal representation can be for a recipient.  On occasions I have attended appeals with constituents and I am aware that there is always a question mark over whether I should be allowed attend.  My amendment is reasonable.  It is not Romanian in its excesses or Thatcherite in its limitations. I appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we are all impressed with the way the Minister's office answer our queries in an effort to avoid an issue being raised in the House. I am sure that the vast bulk of queries on entitlements and so on are dealt with in a satisfactory manner.  Given that the Minister frequently makes an offer of an appeal, I do not see why he should have any difficulty in including in the section a right to an appeal.  The appeal procedure has done nothing to make the system more supportive of the people for whom we are trying to reform it.</P>

      <P>The debate has highlighted the incredible inadequacies that exist in the services for appellants.  On one occasion I deputised for a Deputy colleague at such an appeal and I came to the conclusion that the appeal was an intimidating ordeal for the appellant.  He had a stutter and he had to deal with the appeals officer and an official from the Department.  Without the moral support of a politician sitting beside him, that man would have walked out of the appeal after two seconds.  The system is so bad that politicians in their spare time, if they have any, have to take constituents by the hand and sit in with them at their appeals which can last up to one hour. Why is the system so lacking that many voluntary agencies are stepping in to fill <Col N="1879" /> the gaps?  The system must give an appellant a right to representation, from whatever source.  The appellant must be represented by an independent person who will take time to prepare the appeal and present it to the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>In page 17, paragraph (b), between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>299B.&mdash;(1)  As soon as may be after the end of each year, but not later than 6 months thereafter, the Chief Appeals Officer shall make a report to the Minister of his activities and the activities of the appeals officers under this Part during that year and the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(2)  A report under subsection (1) shall be in such form and shall include information in regard to such matters (if any) other than those referred to in that subsection as the Minister may direct.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Chief Appeals Officer shall, whenever so requested by the Minister, furnish to him information in relation to such matters as he may specify concerning his activities or the activities of appeals officers under this Part.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 65 proposes the insertion of a new section 229B in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which will require the publication of an annual report by the chief appeals officer. Section 299B (1) requires the chief appeals officer to publish an annual report of the activities of the new social welfare appeals office within six months from the end of each year.  Copies of this report will be laid before the Houses of <Col N="1883" /> the Oireachtas and will be available to Deputies in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Section 299B (2) will enable the Minister for Social Welfare to specify the form of the report and to require such other information as he considers necessary to be included in the annual report.  Section 299B (3) will enable the Minister for Social Welfare at any stage to direct the chief appeals officer to furnish him with any information in relation to the activities of the appeals office as he may request.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 62, 63 and 64 contain minor adjustments and these have been agreed at this stage.  Information on the operation of the appeals system is currently provided in the reports of the Department of Social Welfare, which are now published every two years.  An essential function of the new social welfare appeals office will be the publication of a report on its own activities.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended the publication of such annual report. The commission recommended that the report should give details not only of the number of appeals received and decided by category but also of the outcome of decisions.  In addition to those details the annual report should contain some commentary on trends in appeals, the reason for the incidence of certain types of appeals, an analyses of the need for the legislative change to remove anomalies and inequities and, where necessary, the implications of its decisions for policy making generally in the Department.  I fully endorse the commission's recommendations in this matter and I consider that the information provided would be very useful in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness not only of the new appeals office but also of my Department's decisions process.  Publication of an annual report will make an important contribution to the task of developing public confidence in the new social welfare appeals office as well as emphasising its independent status.</P>

      <P>This amendment is welcome and I would like to support it.  It adds substantially to the section.  It will ensure that the appeals office present a report so that regular information is available to this House.  The duties anticipated by the Minister should help the appeals system to improve and the Minister's Department to see trends that may be causing problems.</P>
      <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to debate this and that the necessary information will be to hand.  Something was said in the debate on the last section which indicated that, as a result of section 19 and Part V in general, the Minister will no longer be dealing with questions relating to the functions, activities and process of appeals in this House?  Will information from the appeals office via the Minister be available to Deputies by way of questions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. It has illustrated the necessity for all these officers to be responsible to this House through some process.  This will give us an opportunity to see if the appeals officer has encountered any problems that we are unaware of, such as whether his office is properly staffed. There is the added advantage for the House and the Minister of being able to monitor the Department's relationship with the chief appeals officer.  It is an exrtension of what we spoke about on the other amendment, the reservations about politicians and public representatives being involved.  It is important for us to be involved.  Perhaps the Minister could allay the fears of Deputy Flaherty and those of us who are worried and assure the House that the chief appeals officer is still answerable to the House at all times.  I had doubts about the fact that the Minister was taking powers to direct the appeals officer to do certain things and he would only do that on the basis that the appeals officer might have refused.  Having taken that power, I take it that the appeals officer is answerable to the Minister and to the House, so this process of reporting back to us is a <Col N="1885" /> welcome one.  I hope I am right in that assumption.</P>

      <P>In the light of the Minister's amendment I do not know why he could not have accepted the amendment we have just voted on.  I confess I have not had time to go through all the Minister's amendments, but now we see that the annual report will be produced and this will indicate how the appeals system was working.  Our amendment would also have allowed the appeals system to be monitored in the House.  I do not therefore understand why the Minister would not accept our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if the Deputy reads what I said at his leisure later he will see that I said why.  There is no point, however, in going back into that at this stage.  As the Deputies have said, the system will be seen to be fair.  The report will come back to me as Minister and will be laid before the House.  Deputies will still be entitled to put down parliamentary questions about the system.  The appeals officers are independent in carrying out the functions delegated to them under the legislation and the regulations.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 20, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>In page 17, before section 21, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;An appeal submitted under the terms of this Part shall be heard and determined by the Appeals Officer within six weeks of the date of the receipt of the said appeal.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that when people lodge an appeal they should not be left wondering what has happened to it, whether it is being continued with, whether it has been heard, whether it has been won or lost and when they will be told the results of <Col N="1886" /> it.  That is why we have written in &ldquo;within six weeks&rdquo;.  We had in mind a shorter period &mdash; say, three weeks &mdash; but the Minister made the point that that might not be enough time to get the documentation together.  Perhaps the Minister might take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is forever trying to tie me up in regulations and fixtures of one sort or another.  I am not about to be fixed.  It is my objective to ensure that all appeals are heard without undue delay.  The extra staff going into this area are for that purpose.  We are trying to get the system working as efficiently as possible.</P>
      <P>Subject to the nature and location of the appeal it would be possible in a number of cases to have the appeal heard within six weeks.  In other cases, however, it would simply not be possible and to insist upon such a timescale would be to the detriment of the appellant in certain cases.  For example, when a decision is appealed it is frequently necessary to have the case re-examined.  This is done by a social welfare officer in cases involving an assessment of means or desertion.  In cases of an appeal against disallowance of disability benefit a second examination by a medical referee will be necessary.  If we had to dispense with such reinvestigations or examinations in the interests of expediency, then the appellant's case might suffer.  If the appellant is in an isolated locality it might take some weeks to get this stage of the examination completed.</P>
      <P>An important point which must not be overlooked is that the Department as one of the parties to the appeal also have to prepare to submit a case.  There are other factors which can cause delay in organising appeals, for example, in booking a venue, notifying all interested parties and giving sufficient advance notice so that their attendance can be guaranteed and they will have adequate time to prepare their case.  If, for instance, an assessor did not turn up at a hearing because of a lack of sufficient advance notification, then the appeal could not proceed without the appellant's consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> We must also have regard to the question of resources.  In fairness to the appellants, the nature of an appeals officer's work is not such that the application of additional resources would provide an immediate improvement since some period of training is necessary.  Temporary appeals officers have recently been assigned to the social welfare appeals office to deal with arrears and these should be cleared within the next two months.</P>
    <P>Having regard to what I have said, I do not consider that we should legislate for a timescale for a hearing of appeals. For this reason I am opposed to the amendment.  Broadly speaking, I agree with the desirability of achieving that kind of timescale in as many cases as possible.  Our operation is designed to achieve it but to write it into legislation would be unwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a number of points, some of which are valid, but the latter part of his reply highlights the need to spell out a period.  He said he had taken on some temporary appeals officers to clear a backlog.  Essentially he is saying that the physical resources were not available to meet the demand by appellants.  Earlier today we were given figures indicating a massive number of appeals.  It would help if we did not leave it as open-ended as the Minister suggests.  It may not be apparent to people who are appealing that because of cutbacks, under-financing and under-staffing in the appeals section there is a long waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no cutbacks there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were no cutbacks and no staffing problems, I do not understand why the Minister would have to clear up a serious backlog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time complicated and more distant appeals are made.  Various things can happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1888" />
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that temporary staff were brought in would indicate a hiccup in the system and the building up of a backlog.  The open-ended nature of this provision is not satisfactory from the appellant's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising an important issue.  All of us who are dealing with constituents who have problems will know that in certain cases oral hearings can take up to two months.  Does the Minister have any figures for the average length of time for the hearing of an appeal?  It is obviously in everybody's interest that appeals should be heard as quickly as possible.  A person might lose disability benefit and be thrown back on unemployment assistance and a family could suffer a significant loss of income. Perhaps the Minister would ensure in the context of the report of the appeals office that they would keep records of this point so that we could assess progress.  That might respond in some way to Deputy Byrne's proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment reflects genuine concern about delays.  the Minister has admitted that delays have occurred, for whatever reasons. Although he has convinced Deputy Taylor that more people have not been knocked off, there is a feeling that more people are being taken out of the system and that a major appeals process is going on.  All of us would like to have appeals heard as quickly as possible.  The Minister has said that this is his intention.  Hopefully this will be achieved by the new chief appeals officer operating from a computerised office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make a suggestion in an attempt to overcome problems in this area.  Perhaps some kind of an arrangement could be devised whereby a person would continue to receive his entitlements pending the hearing of an appeal. Then there would be an incentive for the officials of the Department to have the appeal heard quickly.  Such a system would eliminate the complicated arrangements which must be put in place when a person is knocked off benefit. <Col N="1889" /> Such people are advised to apply for supplementary welfare and we know that sick people sometimes sign on as being available for employment when we know they are not.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that it might be easier to allow people to retain their income if they lodge an appeal, although I admit that it may not be technically possible.  The bureaucratic costs involved in contacting health boards, supplementary welfare officers and so on, would be eliminated, together with the need to deal with the backlog of retrospective payments in the event of the appeal being successful.  I suggest this as a compromise which Deputy Byrne might accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legal entitlement once a decision is made; therefore we cannot pay by virtue of the entitlement. I understand the point the Deputy is making but that is the way the legislation operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the time, most appeals are decided in three to four weeks.  Where the oral hearings come in the longer time applies.  The ones the Deputy is talking about would be within the time scale of six weeks, but with oral hearings you can have all sorts of questions and reports from consultants and from various people.  In February there were just over 300 cases awaiting oral hearing in disability benefit, the area the Deputy mentioned. The figure that time was 336 and they will be the ones Deputy Flaherty mentions which are taking two and three months or whatever.  The numbers are not that enormous and remember they are spread all over the country.  When you remember that you are paying out to changing people maybe 60,000 or 65,000 disability benefits in the week you realise you have a fairly efficient system.  While we tend to hear a great deal about the residuals, that is the essence of our democracy and that is what keeps us on our toes.  That is what I like about it.  The numbers are not great, nevertheless we are trying to get that right up to date at present and there will be additional staff in the appeals office.  As things will be organised in that office a great deal more <Col N="1890" /> time will be taken on getting information to people.  They will concentrate on making sure people are well and fully informed along the lines mentioned.  We should let the system go ahead and see how much it can be improved.  I believe it will be improved greatly.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the amendment.  I do not think it is a suitable thing to do, or even desirable from the point of view of the clients we are dealing with in social welfare.  It would cause more problems than it would be worth for people who will need more time to prepare their cases or may have other problems like the difficulty of getting an assessor or whatever. The main thing is to make the system administratively effective.  I am opposed to that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not push this one. If the Minister requests from the chief appeals officer the details of the delays, say in an annual report, we could monitor them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister outlined the procedure that is the norm now for disability benefit appeals and we accept that. What is the level of delay at the moment on appeals on means testing or, as outlined in my priority question today which was not reached, the number of people who are knocked off in the category of genuinely seeking employment?  I referred on Second Stage to social welfare officers.  There are difficulties with some social welfare officers.  Apparently they insist on seeing the applicant no matter how far out from the office he or she lives.  They continue to drive out until they see the applicant physically.  They almost insist that the applicant must be at home before they see him to make a judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" /> For the applicant to go into the social welfare office is not enough.  He is told to go home and wait until the social welfare officer calls to see him.  In addition to the cost factor, I am worried about the delays involved in this and the kind of information requested.  When it is provided further information is requested and there is tedious means testing.  I submitted an up to date sworn affidavit and certification from another Department about the ownership of two misfortunate cows two years back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We had those cows here before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>They were Galway cows today.  There is quite a delay about the means test and appeals investigating means and the requirement of the social welfare officer to see the applicant in his home to prove he is available for work in case somebody should turn up with a job, God bless the mark, because that does not happen too often.  I know of cases where someone had genuinely gone to visit a sick relative and had no idea the social welfare officer was to call on that day.  Because he was not there another delay occurred.  Is that kind of procedure to be tidied up?  It is tedious, time consuming and extremely expensive on the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I am very anxious to tidy that up as far as we can, but I find if a person is not there on one occasion he is normally requested to be there on the next occasion.  If he is not there then serious questions are put.  The Deputy mentioned a PQ.  When he goes out of here at 7 o'clock he will have the reply all to himself.  Statistics are not maintained in a manner which would provide the information sought.  Deputies may be interested to know that, excluding appeals relating to means assessments, the total number of appeals decided in relation to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance claims for the 12 months ending 31 <Col N="1892" /> December 1989 was 1,912 and 1,595 respectively.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the number of cases for means assessment that were outstanding.  At the end of February it was 139 including the means, old age pensions and so on.  These would be regarded as gone outside the six weeks. Overall the numbers are not that huge but they are very important.  This tends to show the sensitivity of our democracy. Even though the numbers are small they tend to be picked up very rapidly by Deputies.</P>

      <P>It really is because we are putting something more comprehensive in the regulations.  I will come back and tell the Deputy.  Subsection (3) of section 297 of the 1981 Act provides that the chief appeals officer shall be responsible for the distribution of appeals among appeals officers.  Section 21 of the Bill provides for the repeal of this subsection as all the functions of the chief appeals officer will be set out in regulations under section 20.  They are being consolidated in regulations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 67:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 15, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but such days shall not be later than three months from the date of the enactment of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the commencement period and we are anxious that it should not take longer than three months after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">

      <P>I have the pre-retirement regulations and I will give them to Deputy Byrne afterwards as I know he is very anxious to see them and wants to study them.  They are very technical and merely implement the matters to which we referred here.  This amendment is designed to impose a legislative requirement that the provisions relating to the new social welfare appeals office should be brought into force within three months of the date of enactment of the Bill.  That is a totally unnecessary restriction because I have already made a commitment to have the new appeals office operating as quickly as possible.  If it was possible to make the order within one month I would do so.  However, a number of necessary arrangements must be made to facilitate the establishment of the new office.  Many of these are outside my control. For example, the offices in D'Olier House must be refurbished to a level which will provide the maximum degree of convenience and comfort for appellants in hearing rooms which will be sound-proofed for the confidential discussions of the appellants affairs at the hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This work is being carried out by the Office of Public Works which, although outside my direct control, are particularly helpful to me.  I met them earlier and all the work and preparation by the architects was done quickly.  Necessary administrative arrangements have also to be <Col N="1894" /> made, including the transfer of administrative staff so that the work at present carried out by my Department can be transferred to the appeals office.  This is necessary for the total independence of the new office.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that all these arrangements will be completed by late summer and I will make every effort to ensure that that deadline will be met.  Indeed, if I can, I will have the arrangements in place before then.  If for some reason, however, the work cannot be completed within three months it would be undesirable for the appellant and the appeals office to have to commence operations without all the necessary preparation being completed.  For these reasons I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>If my colleagues agree, I should like to discuss section 36 which deals with a change in relation to widows. The section needs to be clarified because there is a great deal of concern.  If the Minister does not clarify this matter in the House the only way it will be clarified is when people feel the changes in their pockets.  They do not know what the Minister's long term plan is.  They know they will be paying a good deal more but they do not know what they will get in the short term or what is planned for them over the next two years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a once-off gain of £52 million as a result of this amalgamation. For two days we have been arguing about the paucity of the increases to various recipients.  Why did the Minister send this money back to the Central Exchequer instead of redistributing it among those who are most in need?  I made this point on Second Stage but obviously the Minister did not heed it. The Minister has saved in excess of £100 million over the last few years and in this case he is saving another £52 million. Does the Minister not feel morally bound to redistribute the money among the various sectors dependent on social welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The money went into the social insurance fund.  It will help to meet improvements in social insurance fund payments.  The State undertakes the liability for the future.  Where it was not part of the social insurance fund but purely an employers' fund, there was a need for some security for the future to cover the vagaries which might occur.  At present those liabilities are taken on by the social insurance fund and, in that sense, by the State directly but the contribution rates and the benefits stay the same.  In that sense it is just a rationalisation as far as this scheme is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we reached this section but I am sure the Minister is sorry we have had to gloss over some of his improvements in regard to mná tí and so on.  However, we have to deal with a more complicated issue before we finish. This section introduces a PRSI payment for widows.  From next week they will be paying 3 per cent PRSI, and this is a very big change.  There is a long and complicated history to this which I have not been able to grasp fully.  I have had calls from widows with a decent salary, who are looking after adult families. These people will now have to pay an additional £30 or £40 a month out of an income on which there are heavy demands.  In return, they will get a half rate of benefit.  Up to January 1989 they received this benefit without making any contribution by virtue of the fact that the employer makes the full contribution for any employed widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people are very concerned about the fact that the contribution will be paid over three years.  They question the current position where there is an employer's contribution, but they have no benefit entitlement.  What is the Minister's long-term plan for these people?  Does he anticipate giving them full benefits in <Col N="1898" /> three years' time, or is it intended to retain them on the additional half benefit which is being introduced in this Bill? It would be helpful if he could clarify publicly his intention in relation to this group.  Widows generally are concerned with the sudden change which, they say, goes back to a period pre-1974, a position they believed they had worked their way out of through negotiation with the Department.  Their association feel that this is undoing a lot of work that had been done.  As I have said, I am not sufficiently briefed to be able to deal with the matter fully but I would like the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to clarify the position.  I received representations from widows and widows' associations in relation to their inclusion in the system so that they could get the half rate benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Since that time they have been without the 15 months' payment for disability benefit.  I have received representations that they want to receive that benefit at half rate.  I have no time to go into the whole matter but the Deputy raised the question of a sudden change. It is not a sudden change because it is being phased in over three years: 3 per cent this year; 4 per cent next year and 5.5 per cent in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be an additional 3 per cent tax on every £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the self-employed, the figures are 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent.  In regard to the abolition of the exemption for social insurance contributions applying to <Col N="1899" /> recipients of widows' pension and other analogous payments from 6 April 1990, such persons, in addition to their pensions, will be entitled to receive half rate disability benefit for a period of up to 15 months when they are out of work through illness.  That is regarded as particularly important and is something they wanted.</P>
      <P>The problem arose because the benefits, instead of being short-term, became long-term and for some of them became almost like a second pension, in other words, the disability benefit was paid for many years.  The half rate will apply to unemployment benefit as well as disability benefit.  In addition, these people will get the full rate of pay-related benefit and will also be entitled to dental, optical and other benefits because they are contributing.  I know this matter has been argued among themselves, but the widows wanted to be included in the system.  The fact that those earning less than £60 a week are exempt and will still get the benefits is an additional advantage. Many widows at work have said that they want to contribute the same as everyone else and want to benefit from the schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's long-term plan that when they are on full contributions they will have full benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They will get one-and-a-half benefits.  They are getting the full benefit on widows' pensions and will get half a benefit on top of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new attitude to widow's pension and is seen as something that is not an established right because people must contribute to their widow's pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one fund and it is not infinite.  It will provide one pension plus a half rate of disability benefit or unemployment benefit, as the case may be, as well as the dental, optical and other benefits which would not have been available otherwise.  The widows' <Col N="1900" /> association have said they are anxious to be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The widows' association feel the Department are not doing all the work they fought for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the representations we received.  This means that one-and-a-half time's the rate will apply.  It can be quite important to a widow or a deserted wife that she can get disability benefit if she is out sick.  If she is on a lower income then it is all the more important but the cost would be very small in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible that the people who are excluded as a result of the change in the legislation in 1987 could be brought back into the system?  Some of them are still ill and are unable to go back to work.  There are very few of these isolated cases, but there are still anomalies.  I know two contributions are going into the one fund in the Department while payments to the value of one-and-a-half times benefit is going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> In page 2, line 27, after &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, welfare and efficiency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert after the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; the words, &ldquo;welfare and efficiency.&rdquo;  The object of the amendment is to give some meaning to the basic terms of reference of the representative association once established.  As the section stands the Government propose to acknowledge that remuneration is a matter that the representative association, once established, can work on and be active about. The section goes on to state: &ldquo;and such other matters (if any) as the Minister may specify in the regulations...&rdquo;.  I now acknowledge that the Minister proposes to delete the words: &ldquo;if any&rdquo;.  We have had a long and detailed debate about these regulations.  We are not to have anything to say or do about them.  The Minister made his views quite clear on the Order of Business today that he does not regard this House as having any role to play in this matter and that the people whom he will have regard to, in the first instance, are members of the Defence Forces.  I do not need to make any comment on that as the answer was forcibly made by Members of this House in retort on the Order of Business.  We should at least make some small effort to give some reflection of what this House believes representative associations should be about.  We are being asked to hand over everything to discussions and negotiations that will take place outside the House.  I fully recognise that is an essential step in the process of establishing for the first time representative associations but I do not think that should deny us the opportunity to set down some broad parameters as to what we believe representative associations, once established, should be working towards.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I had proposed an amendment which included a number of specific items involving welfare, health, education, housing and all related matters.  I did not win that issue but I had indicated to the Minister that the Government might take on board the <Col N="1905" /> wording of the corresponding legislation in respect of the establishment of representative associations within the Garda Síochána.  The words used in section 13 of the Act of 1924, &ldquo;welfare and efficiency,&rdquo; which I am now seeking to borrow, would be the basis for debate and consideration.  Those words were acceptable to Parliament in 1924 and were equally acceptable to the Minister's party when in Government in 1977 when the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, found the words in regard to the Garda Síochána to be still adequate and incorporated them in the Act.  I cannot see why we cannot accept the same wording here and include it in this Bill as reflecting general parameters which we believe the representative associations should be involved in.</P>
    <P>When I asked the question on Committee Stage as to why the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; should be there the answer I was given &mdash; and I accept it &mdash; was that that has been a central and pivotal issue of major concern.  It is certainly one of those issues, not the only one, which has fallen so far behind that it requires to be specifically mentioned in the Bill.  There is no suggestion of including in general terms, the words &ldquo;welfare and efficiency&rdquo; that have been applicable to the Garda Síochána representative bodies.  In putting those words into the Bill there is no suggestion that we are in any way restricting or limiting the scope of being so specific because the words &ldquo;other matters as the Minister may specify&rdquo; remain in the section.  That argument was advanced here in chorus fashion by the Deputies behind the Minister in supporting this debate. They repeated the suggestion that we were in some way restricting, limiting or delimiting the areas of work.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We are merely adding to the remuneration list by three and leaving the omnibus formula in the section allowing for the other matters that would arise in time as experience and negotiation would establish.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 3, Deputy Nealon proposes a form of wording with which I would have no difficulty.  I will accept <Col N="1906" /> that wording if it is acceptable to the Minister.  I have no problem whatever in dealing with words involving welfare, schemes of medical benefit and family support systems.  The Minister promised us that he would look at this matter and I had anticipated that something would be forthcoming from him whereby the wording of the Garda Síochána Act would be specifically examined.  I hope he has not closed his mind entirely on the matter.  After listening to further reasoning and debate here this evening he might accept that there is a strong feeling that we should give greater expression to the views of this House in this enabling legislation.  For that reason I urge him to accept what is proposed here.  It does not involve any major departure from good sense or from precedent to the extent that we have a precedent, and it has been borrowed by the Government, in advancing argument here, that of the Garda Síochána Acts.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendments in this regard.</P>
    <P>In this context we are also taking amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Ryan.  Again this is an attempt to expand upon and give some further expression to the view of the House in terms of dealing with &ldquo;conditions of employment or service,&rdquo;. I have no difficulty, as a next option, in accepting those words if agreeable. I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken out the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; under amendment No. 4a even if it is for no reason other than to acknowledge a concern which I have about the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; and which I advanced on Committee Stage.  I repeat it here by including it under amendment No. 4.  I would ask the Minister to accede to that proposition.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely concerned that in the expression &ldquo;remuneration and such other matters&rdquo; the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; may be borrowed judicially to indicate that that expression in its entirety is a limiting one rather than the all enabling broader based opportunity the Minister talks about as leading to an infinite base of what the representatives associations can deal with.  If I am wrong in what I say, the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; is entirely irrelevant and can be easily done without but because I have <Col N="1907" /> a lurking doubt I am asking the Minister to accept amendment No. 4.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that this amendment is vitally important in the context of the Bill and the regulations I do not intend to delay the House for too long.</P>
      <P>I support amendments Nos. 2, 3, 3a and 4a, in the name of the Minister.  I acknowledge that the Minister has moved in response to the proposals I and other spokespersons put forward yesterday. The Labour Party believe this section will be too narrow if it deals only with matters relating to &ldquo;.... remuneration and such other matters (if any) as the Minister may specify ....&rdquo;.  It was pointed out clearly yesterday that remuneration deals basically with pay.  We want to include in this Bill some of the matters the members of the Defence Forces will get involved in. It is all very well for the Minister to say, as he did yesterday, that all these matters will be covered by regulation; but it is important to strengthen this provision.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not go a bit further and include an amendment which would meet the proposals put forward in the three amendments yesterday.  If the Minister had done this, it would have enabled us to fully support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to strengthen this provision in the Bill.  I said most of what I wanted to say yesterday and there is no point in repeating it.  Obviously, the Minister &mdash; perhaps his officials are pulling the strings in a certain direction and other bodies are telling him not to go down that road &mdash; has made up his mind. As I said earlier, I am disappointed that <Col N="1908" /> the Minister has not included other matters in the section.  Obviously, the Minister has made up his mind but I hope that on the basis of the contributions we make here at the eleventh hour he will incorporate some of the wording we put forward in our three amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was formulating my amendments for Report Stage I did not put down any amendment to section 2 at first because I genuinely thought from listening to the Minister yesterday that he would have introduced an amendment which would broadly meet the wishes of Deputy Ryan, Deputy McCartan and myself.  I suppose I was naive in expecting the Minister to do that and I want to express my sincere disappointment that he has made no move to meet our wishes other than to remove the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, which is a very minimal change.</P>
      <P>Section 2 will deal exclusively with remuneration, the only specific item mentioned in the section.  I am sure everyone, including the Minister, knows that the section should be much broader than this.  From having listened to members of the Defence Forces I believe elements other than remuneration and pay will become very important in future years.  Yet there is no specific mention in the Bill of any matter other than remuneration, which, as defined, will deal exclusively with money and pay matters. So far as I can recall &mdash; I am sure this can be substantiated by the Official Report &mdash; the Minister indicated that he would make some gesture in this area on Report Stage.  While I am glad the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; will be removed from section 2, my verdict on that amendment is that it will stop the Minister from looking foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands is totally unsatisfactory. I believe the members of the Defence Forces will be very disappointed that the section has not been expanded in the conciliatory fashion which was manifested here yesterday.  If our amendments had been accepted it would have meant progress in relation to the Bill.  As <Col N="1909" /> Deputy McCartan said, the members of the Defence Forces will be in a less satisfactory position than the Garda Síochána are under the 1924 Act.  Such a provision was included by the Dáil of that time in the Garda Síochána Act, 1924; but, even after 66 years of experience which showed it had no detrimental effect of which the Army authorities might be afraid, the Dáil of 1990 are unwilling to insert a similar provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, who is also Tánaiste, is a very powerful man within the Government and, as he said yesterday, represents the Government here. Therefore, the buck must stop with him and I must attach the blame to him for not expanding the section further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought yesterday that the Minister would bring forward an amendment on Report Stage which would bridge the gap between the three amendments which had the same thrust and the section as it stands.  I thought it would have been easy enough to bring forward a simple amendment which would have bridged that gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many members of PDFORRA have expressed concern about this section. While I appreciate the explanation given by the Minister yesterday that all these matters would be incorporated in the regulations, I did not think the inclusion of such an amendment would disturb the section.  Matters such as accommodation, dining hall facilities, pensions and the way they operate, medical cover for serving members and their families and housing, particularly in Dublin and Cork, have been discussed for many years.  I think Deputy McCartan referred to housing for members of the Organisation of National Ex-servicemen who have retired from the Army and who do not have any housing at all.  While it is the intention of the Minister to try to reach agreement with the representative body in relation to all of those areas of concern, I thought that a simple amendment would have taken care of that.  There have not been too many changes to the original Bill.  I thought this was reasonable and I would, <Col N="1910" /> even at this late stage, appeal to the Minister to accept this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just circulated further amendments to show that I am not being unreasonable.  I went into this amendment at some length last night and the more I looked at it the more convinced I became that I am right.  I will try to explain it as simply as possible.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with an infinite variety of matters including conditions of service, welfare, health, education, housing, recreation facilities, amenities, credit facilities etc.  There are more that I have not thought of and in the future more will emerge if the representative bodies do their work properly in accordance with the changes that take place. This is an area that should be left open as long as there is freedom to incorporate items by regulation starting with regulations agreed now which will be reviewed and amended as the years go on.  This is particularly a matter for incorporation regulations.  If we start tricking around now what we propose will not be exhaustive.  Let us, therefore, leave it open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I considered that my instinct in regard to the phrase &ldquo;if any&rdquo; was right.  It should go and it is being deleted because it carried an implication that there might not be such matters.  I totally disagree with that implication because I consider that there will be innumerable matters.  That is why I want it to be as flexible as possible. That is why I believe the phrase &ldquo;their remuneration and such other matters as the Minister may specify in the regulations&rdquo; gives a completely open ended and flexible framework.  The amendments put down by the Deputies indicate goodwill on their part in wanting to have certain things incorporated in the legislation, but they are not exhaustive. If we were to have an exhaustive section covering all aspects of welfare we could be here all night with our dictionaries out to ensure that everything was included, and we probably still would not have everything included.  Let us, therefore, leave the section open ended and flexible to enable the men themselves to include <Col N="1911" /> what they want in the initial regulations. We should leave it open to whatever may arise in future to be included also.  With the best will in the world we cannot do better than that.</P>
    <P>Remuneration is so important that we cannot just leave it open.  That is why it is defined specifically.  Remuneration is remuneration and is defined there just as it is defined in the definition section under the various financial payments and allowances that come under the heading of remuneration.  If one were to start defining welfare and so on in legislation one would end up doing a disservice to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to press that point of view, having listened to the various points that were made here.  I also looked at what Deputy McCartan mentioned about welfare and efficiency being a code phrase which had been incorporated in previous Garda legislation.  I found out that there is nothing very sacrosanct about that. They are having difficulty in the Garda in interpreting that because that was just a phrase that was loosely borrowed from earlier British legislation, not that there is anything wrong with British legislation. Section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act used those words just because they appeared in the 1924 Act, and the 1924 Act merely borrowed the phrase from the Constabulary and Police (Ireland) Act, 1919, which borrowed the phrase from an earlier constabulary Act back in the last century.  It was just a phrase that was in use over the last century and when examined it was found not to have meant anything in particular.</P>
    <P>Efficiency is a dangerous concept to incorporate in this because efficiency in the military sense has connotations of command and discipline which is precisely the area that everybody agrees should be excluded from this legislation. In military matters efficiency has a far different connotation than it has in Garda terminology.</P>
    <P>Conditions of service also has connotations of command and discipline.  It is therefore preferable to leave the delineation of the welfare area to the more <Col N="1912" /> flexible regulations which will be brought in after consultation with the men themselves who know what they want in regard to welfare and conditions of service and what they want may be different from what we are saying.  We have probably touched on other points in which they are interested but there may be points which they may wish to have incorporated in a certain way.  It is altogether an area that is very particular to their well being.</P>
    <P>I respect what has been said here but this, after all, is an enabling Bill.  We are establishing a legislative framework within which all these relevant matters can be accommodated.  When one considers all aspects one sees the wisdom of having an enabling Bill.  Many of these sensitive areas are not incorporated in legislation in the Oireachtas.  A fair amount of common sense is incorporated here.  Many of our suggestions, I am sure, will be taken on board in the composition of the regulations.  But, broadly speaking, this is an area where the Oireachtas provides the overall legislative coverage which we are doing in an enabling Bill and allows the representatives of the men to fill in the details under the umbrella we are providing.</P>
    <P>The whole emphasis in the earlier contributions to this debate in the Dáil and outside it was on consultation.  As the net result of a consultation process we will incorporate in regulations the various forms of welfare and benefit, of which the men themselves will be the best judges in the last analysis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would merely reiterate the point that history and practice in discussions and negotiations in other employments suggest that far from having the boundaries set in legislation there is freedom in discussion to push the boundaries as far as possible.  The whole history of the negotiating agenda in other employments shows that it expands and expands and does not need legislation for that purpose.  It is very important to leave the initiative with both sides but particularly with the representatives of the new associations to determine what would go into the regulations.  I feel quite confident <Col N="1913" /> that this will accord with their hopes and aspirations and there are boundless examples in practice in other relationships and employments to justify this stance.</P>

      <P>Last night Deputy McCartan mentioned welfare and efficiency but given that there is a different connotation between constabulary efficiency and efficiency in the Army, it would not be an improvement.  The dropping of the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; indicate that the points made last night are taken on board.  The deletion of the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; as proposed in amendment No. 4 would have a potentially negative effect. There is not much point in covering ground which we covered in detail yesterday. The Minister has made the point that what we are achieving here is flexibility rather than inflexibility.  By not putting further words after &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; I do not think we are disimproving the Bill.  I would make the point that it is not simply a one item list but a list which incorporates remuneration and other matters.  The flexible approach being adopted by the Minister has most to commend it.</P>

I join with other Deputies on this side of the House in expressing extreme dismay and disappointment at the inflexible attitude on the part of the Government in regard to serious and reasoned amendments advanced by the Opposition in attempting to improve and in some way reflect the views of this House in this important legislation.</P>
      <P>It was a very good exercise on our part to put in an amendment which would not have impacted in any substantial way upon the meaning or intentions of this Bill.  The amendment has begun to draw out in clearer relief what I believe to be the makings of a massive con trick on the soldiers for whom this scheme is being devised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1977 Garda Síochána Act has been quoted as a precedent on Second Stage and on numerous occasions during Committee Stage.  It was borrowed upon when we were told it was a good idea to have enabling legislation. We all agree with that idea and nobody tabling amendments has suggested that an enabling Bill is not the best vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of negotiation and consideration of the views of the members of the Defence Forces we have sought to write into the Bill some of the representations they asked us to make on their behalf.  On each of those items we received no co-operation from Government on Committee Stage.  On this amendment, borrowing from the great precedent of the 1977 Act, we again find no co-operation.  That precedent was also <Col N="1915" /> borrowed when we talked about regulations. When we dealt with negotiations we were told it was best to set up enabling structures as under the 1977 Act and do the talking elsewhere.  During the short debate on whether we should use the mandatory &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or the permissive &ldquo;may&rdquo;, again the 1977 Act was trotted out as the precedent, the thing we should work to.</P>
    <P>When we tried to expand on a very limited wording on this section once again we were not successful.  I take the wording to mean remuneration and nothing else.  I have no doubt that in the negotiations which will come after this every effort will be made by generals, armchair located or otherwise, seeking to restrict and do down what we as parliamentarians have been striving to put in place today, a broad ranging all-embracing representative association with powers plenipotentiary to deal with all matters which may emerge.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned at the intractable, unreasonable attitude of the Minister in not even conceding that the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;, which he admits is superfluous, could be removed from the section.  If he is correct in his proposition, there is absolutely no need for the word there.  If my suspicion has any foundation &mdash; and it is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; then it does have an ominous consequence since a judicial interpretation will link in other matters to the existing word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;.  It will be claimed that the representative associations envisaged under this legislation are wage negotiating authorities and nothing else.</P>

      <P>Coming to nonsense, and I thank the Minister for leading me <Col N="1916" /> into it, is this suggestion that he has looked at it again and again and spent long hours doing so with the aid of his negotiators in the background.  What looking at it was there?  Not one further idea or reason was advanced here that was not advanced on Committee Stage as to why we could not expand on the limited word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;.  What reason have we been given?  None whatsoever. The Minister introduces it all by saying there is an infinite variety, and makes an effort to identify those to illustrate just how difficult it is to reach infinity. We all know that, but does the clause &ldquo;all other matters&rdquo; not deal with the infinity of the issues?  Why introduce a suggestion that by broadening or seeking to broaden beyond &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo;, as we are seeking to do, in some way we are doing down the infinitesimal issues that may arise when the expression &ldquo;all other matters&rdquo; already exists there?  We are told we might be tricking around with the section.  Legislators are now being reduced to tricksters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that tricking is not at this side of the House but at the other side.  The suggestion is that what is there is open-ended and should be left that way.  How can putting in one or two other items in any way begin to close that open-endedness?  It could not, if the formula in its general proposition is still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that the phrase &rdquo;welfare and efficiency&rdquo; came from the 1919 Act and previous Acts, and by some process of &ldquo;by the way, no one ever really bothered about them because they mean nothing anyway&rdquo; it was put into the Act of 1977.  That is nonsense.  I made the point on Committee Stage and I make it very briefly and succinctly here.  Look at the lead in to the 1977 Act.  Because the Garda representative associations were not able to work efficiently and effectively under the 1924 Act we have the 1977 Act.  There was agitation over the <Col N="1917" /> workings of the 1924 Act which required all representations to go to the Commissioner of the Garda and the Minister and there was no one outside the chain of command.  The whole purpose of the 1977 Act was to devise a formula that would work efficiently for the Garda. One thing they did not throw out was the wording &ldquo;welfare and efficiency&rdquo;.  To suggest that the wording was just a matter of pedestrian concern at the time ignores completely what the 1977 Act was about and the long agitation, debate and negotiations the Minister, Deputy Collins, talked about in the lead in to that Act. That is a disingenuous argument and it is treating us with contempt to suggest that this has been looked at carefully last night and then to come in and misrepresent fact and history in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>The next argument advanced is that of efficiency, that in some way this is going to open the door, that the soldiers might be consulted about something the Minister does not want to talk to them about, or the armchair, or otherwise, generals will not want to countenance.  There is exactly the same chain of command, structure and need for discipline and command within the Garda Síochána as there is in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way the job of the Garda Síochána can be done without them being subject to discipline, to a chain of command.  That is an essential ingredient of the whole area of discipline and responsibility on the part of the Garda member.  You can talk about efficiency and not interfere with their <Col N="1918" /> chain of command, but when it comes to soldiers the concept of efficiency and discussion of it within the Defence Forces is inappropriate.  That begins to smack of what we have argued against from the inception of his debate, that soldiers, as civilians and as tradespeople in their job, have the right to be treated on an equal footing with those other agencies working in the security field, be they prison officers or members of An Garda Síochána. This unfortunate remark of the Minister that the concept of efficiency might lead to some breach of the command idea in the Defence Forces begins to raise the spectre again that soldiers are to be treated differently from members of An Garda Síochána or other people working in the security area.</P>
      <P>I regret the very impractical attitude taken by Government on Report Stage of not recognising the constructive contributions that have been made by us on this side which should not have caused acrimony.  I regret that I now see clearly the makings of a scenario that will lead to much more conflict not only on Report Stage but outside when this Bill comes to be implemented by people whose motives are not in line with what we here are trying to establish.</P>

      <P>In page 2, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  An association shall represent its members through the agreed process of negotiation, conciliation and arbitration schemes.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment we are coming back to what was considered on Committee Stage by Deputies on this side as an important and fundamental proposition, the writing into enabling legislation of the principle that arbitration, conciliation and negotiation should be a central feature of the regulations once established.  We had advanced the cause so forcibly that, of all the items we deliberated on Committee Stage, the Minister indicated this was one he would have a look at.  He said it was the one matter he felt strongly about.  He had proposed it on his own initiative and he wanted to ensure it would be included eventually. In that spirit the amendments put down on Committee Stage by Deputies Nealon, Ryan and myself were withdrawn in the hope that these matters would be fairly addressed.  The Minister has suggested, in amendment No. 12a, a formula which unfortunately amounts to nothing.  Not only can I hear an echo from the Government benches but I almost anticipate an echo at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment indicates that he may provide by regulations for the establishment of a system of conciliation and arbitration in respect of such matters as the Minister may specify in the regulations in relation to which an association represents members.  I remember a Deputy saying that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; appeared three separate times in the original Bill and he got an acknowledgment of recognition from the Government benches.  I regret to say that this amendment is drafted in much the same way.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister, if it has taxed him to the extent that he has shown to draft the amendment, for the effort he has made and for the response in seeking to meet the views of this side but, without annoying him unduly, I will tell him why I think his amendment does not improve the matter.  The Minister's amendment does not write anything into the Bill on this issue; he may as well have left it on the basis that it would be dealt with in the regulations.  He pointed out, and it is written into the record, that he would take on board many of the things we had talked about but we will have to wait and see.  He said these matters should not be written into the legislation which should be as flexible as possible.</P>
      <P>Our view is that there are some issues of fundamental importance that should be written into the enabling legislation. We have already debated that there be a broader definition of the terms of reference, we have discussed more of the fundamental principles on Committee Stage and we will deal with them when we talk about the right of access to the media, the right to raise funds, the right to have premises and staff, exterior to the military chain of command.  These issues are so fundamental to the whole idea that we argued that the principles should be written into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were also arguing that conciliation, arbitration and negotiation should be incorporated as a positive statement in the legislation &mdash; a single line would do. Does the Minister remember us talking on Committee Stage about nothing more than a single line stating the principle &mdash;<Col N="1923" /> nothing more &mdash; so that it will be there for whatever Minister, Department officials, representative associations or soldiers who would address the grounding legislation? They would have the guiding words of the supreme authority the Minister spoke about, the supreme authority of Parliament.  The principle of conciliation, arbitration and negotiation can be written in a single line so that it becomes an indelible feature of the representative process.  That is all we ask for.</P>
    <P>The formula of the double &ldquo;may&rdquo;, that the Minister may prescribe the regulations whenever he is of that view, does not in any way address what we understood we were talking about on Committee Stage &mdash; the notion of writing in the principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had tabled this amendment on Committee Stage.  Deputy McCartan supports me on this Stage and, from his contribution on Committee Stage, it also represents the thinking of Deputy Ryan.  I tabled this amendment and we all spoke on it because it is of absolute importance to the kernel of conciliation, arbitration and negotiation as far as the whole future of the associations was concerned.  I wanted a cleancut positive statement in the Bill similar to that outlined in my amendment, or words to that effect.  The Minister responded positively and he gave us the impression &mdash; I certainly got the impression &mdash; that he was taking this on board.  I was very pleased about this and thought it was a progression that we had made in the course of a very long discussion.  But then we see his amendment 12a, which is a perfect classical example of how a Minister can fulfil his promises of taking something on board without taking it on board at all but simply giving the impression of doing something while doing nothing.  This amendment is destined for the political textbooks.  I have no doubt that, if Deputy Roche still lectures, as he did so excellently in the past, on political matters, he will be using this as an example of how a Minister can <Col N="1924" /> promise to do one thing and then come along with an amendment which gives the impression of doing that while doing nothing.  The drafting of the amendment is so good in this respect that I fully subscribe to what the Minister has said &mdash; that he drafted it himself.  I do not believe there is any man among the Members and the draftsmen capable of drafting it.  If it was drafted by a draftsman and if there were Oscars for a good screenplay by a draftsman for the Minister, then that draftsman is my nominee for an Oscar.  It is brilliant in reflecting the entire attitude of the Minister throughout the course of the Bill.</P>
      <P>To refer back to what I and Deputies McCartan and Ryan said during the course of Committee Stage, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; appears again and obviously we are not going to make any progress as far as that word is concerned.  Let us remember that we were not satisfied with regulations.  We wanted to have it written straight into the Bill because we did not want to trust the regulations, but now the Minister has provided in the Bill for a regulation about a regulation.  Figure that one out.</P>
      <P>There is one other important point that I want to comment on before I conclude:</P>
      <P>The Minister may provide by regulations for the establishment of a system of conciliation and arbitration in respect of such matters as the Minister may specify in regulations in relation to which an association represents members.</P>
      <P>That clearly indicates to me that the Minister does not intend to have conciliation and arbitration available on all issues that may arise.  I believed that when the Minister spoke about conciliation and arbitration it would cover the entire scope of the Bill, but now we find it covers only those areas that he may specify in the regulations.  Perhaps he may allow it in all cases, but the fact is that he seems to be putting in a constraint.  That may not be intended.  I hope it certainly is not, but if is was not &mdash; I know he will not give way to us now &mdash; I expect him to take a serious look at this issue in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> We believed the Minister was positive yesterday.  We thought this was being taken on board and we were delighted. But I am afraid what we have here does not advance the case other than mentioning the words &ldquo;conciliation and arbitration&rdquo; in the Bill.  I am very disappointed that he has not been able to have a cleancut positive statement in some section of the Bill on conciliation and arbitration as a means of progress as far as the associations are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we tried to enshrine in the legislation a Civil Service system of conciliation and arbitration. The Minister expressed in very clear terms that what we really wanted was a conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Defence Forces and that he was going to take the issue on board.  On that basis we decided to withdraw our amendments so that we could make progress. However, I felt it necessary to specifically enshrine in legislation the whole concept of conciliation and arbitration.  While the Minister has brought forward this amendment, it does not take cognisance of what we said yesterday and what we know the people in the Defence Forces would like to see enshrined in the legislation.  While the Minister has provided for the establishment of a system of conciliation and arbitration in the regulations, this does not go anywhere near what we are looking for.  We would like to see the right for the establishment of conciliation and arbitration enshrined in the legislation and not provided for by way of regulation. I hope the Minister will take on board what we have been saying this evening.</P>

      <P>I am indebted to Deputy Nealon, because it had not struck me to use this debate; but I will certainly use it now to show how otherwise intelligent people can be so foolish.  Here we have an example of how foolish people can be. <Col N="1926" /> We are having a theological debate on the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; versus the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  In all enabling legislation that we can go back over the appropriate word is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>

We also know that he is a sufficiently clever man to have jumped in and dominated the debate to try to claim credit for the achievements of the other two spokespersons, but that is their problem.  He referred to &ldquo;our side of the House&rdquo; as if he was speaking for everybody on the Opposition side.  He allocates to himself the position of spokesperson not just for The Workers' Party but for the Labour and Fine Gael parties.  That is a matter for the Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan should be the last in the world to draw the attention of the Chair to anything like this.  There are times when he does not appear to be speaking to an amendment or a section when he is setting up the basis for his argument. Deputy Roche has been in possession for <Col N="1927" /> just two minutes and Deputy McCartan should be as patient with him as Deputy Roche has been with him.  I will decide whether Deputy Roche is relevant or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that we have been engaged in this debate for almost one hour and thirty minutes and 80 per cent of that time has been taken up by superfluous verbiage by Deputy McCartan.  I have never come across a man who can stretch one word as long as he can.  I have never come across a Deputy who can stretch a simple thing as long as he can.  Deputies on the opposite benches know I speak the truth in regard to this.  Deputy McCartan's contribution on the last amendment was incredible and his contribution on this amendment is a case study on how one can waste parliamentary time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If his contribution was as bad as the Deputy suggests please do not take his standards. Will the Deputy return to the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a commitment throughout the debate to provide a conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Does any Deputy seriously suggest that in one month's time or three months' time the Minister will go back on that commitment?  Obviously, the answer to that is no.  He will not go back on it because he is an honourable man but, more importantly, because he is an astute enough politician to know that the roof would come down about his head if he did.  What is this nonsense about the use of the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; being the imperative and &ldquo;may&rdquo; giving the Minister power?  It is interesting to note that a conciliation arbitration scheme was not provided for in the PDFORA constitution.  I am not suggesting that we should not provide it but I mention that as an interesting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the amendment introduced by the Minister the Defence Forces are assured that they will have their own conciliation and arbitration scheme and <Col N="1928" /> that it will operate much on the same basis as that in the Civil Service, for the teachers, local government and health boards.  What more assurance does the House need than that?  We could waste time discussing the theology of &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and I do not think we would reach any conclusion.  That is the sort of thing that parliamentary draftmen have debated for the last 150 to 200 years. However, we can come to a conclusion that the Minister, having given those commitments and incorporated his commitment in the amendment, will ensure that a conciliation and arbitration scheme will be appropriately provided for in the regulations.  What more can any reasonable person want than that?</P>
    <P>This gives Deputy McCartan the opportunity to indulge in cleverness but in doing so he is talking out the debate to the point where important issues, and other concessions which the Minister is giving as a result of the arguments put forward by Deputies Ryan and Nealon, will not be reached.  At the end of the day this type of arrogance does not cause any concern to this side of the House. Members will be aware that all the amendments in the Minister's name will be carried.  I should like to point out to Deputies Ryan and Nealon that any chance of concessions on points which they wish to raise will be denied them because of the extraordinary capacity of Deputy McCartan to self-indulge.  The amendment put forward in the name of the Minister more than adequately takes care of this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Nealon and others in what they said on the amendment from this side of the House. I have no doubt that the Minister is a reasonable man and that he does not intend that anything should go wrong.  I agree that the roof would come down about a person who would deviate from the promises made in regard to this section. However, it is important to point out that we are debating this Bill because of the need to introduce a provision similar to that contained in our amendment. If there was latitude for the Army, <Col N="1929" /> if the members of the Defence Forces were made aware that a conciliation and arbitration scheme would be written into the legislation they would have aodpted a different attitude.  If that promise had been made they would not have been expressing such concern in the last 12 months.  In my view we would not have had the altercation we had earlier this year as they tried to highlight their grievances. I appeal to the Minister to consider taking on board the reasonable amendments from this side of the House, even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister should take our amendments on board on the basis that if the conciliation and arbitration scheme is written into the legislation there will not be any reference from now on to the Minister's regulations.  I am worried about the Minister's regulations. I am worried about the Minister's amendment. We have all found that in all regulations a certain amount of discretion is left to the Minister and in some cases that has led to aggravation.  The Minister's amendment is ambivalent and leaves the issue open.  The Minister should accept our valid amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some reservations about the Minister's amendment.  The booklet published by the Minister contains a declaration that is more positive than the wording in the Minister's amendment. The document states that a system of conciliation and arbitration will be established.  That is a simple, straightforward and uncomplicated statement. Yesterday I suggested that those words should be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a parliamentary draftsman but such a simple statement would suffice if it was included in the Bill.  I can understand the reason for including the words, &ldquo;and such matters as the Minister may specify in the regulations&rdquo;.  I would assume that that would then have been subject to negotiations and discussions with the representative body or with the Army authorities, as the case might be, <Col N="1930" /> follwing the passing of the Bill.  The first annex is equally specific and it would appear to me that that would also have met the point.  Nobody is doubting the sincerity of the Minister &mdash; I would be the last to do so &mdash; in this regard.  As I said on Second Stage, he has gone much further than anyone on either side of this House anticipated and certainly further than the Army had anticipated.  That is a fact.  It is also envisaged that the Minister could very well be the commander-in-chief before the end of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and might be replaced by another Minister who may not be as understanding as he is, and I may not have the same confidence in the gentleman who may take his place.  Having dealt with many Ministers for Defence, I can assure the House that I found it much easier to deal with this Minister than I did with his predecessors on both sides of the House.  It is not a question of this side of the House not recognising the fact that the Minister has made an attempt to try to bridge the gap between what his advice and his opinion would be and what is contained in the section and in the annex.  There is a fear in the minds of Members here and also in the minds of members of the Defence Forces that we will not always have the Minister, someone who understands what is contained in this legislation and who knows what is meant by what is contained in that amendment.  It is not a question of distrust of the present Minister but perhaps a fear of what may follow.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Deputy Bell, for your remarks.  I appreciate everybody in the House is trying to help.  The difficulty is &mdash; and this always arises when one is putting down amendments on Committee and Report Stage, especially in enabling legislation &mdash; that the draftsman's words in legislation of this kind have to be carefully drafted in order to follow precedent and in legal language of their own in order to effect implementation. All parliamentarians share this <Col N="1931" /> concern &mdash; we like to have language that is plain and can be easily understood. Naturally, I agree with what Deputy Bell has said: that the simpler a political message can be got over the better.  When I wrote that letter and signed it I was getting across a basic political message to the soldiers on the ground.  I said simply that a system of conciliation and arbitration will be established.  That is where I still stand.  Legal people draft Bills and we have to live by precedent, but we have to have enabling legislation of this kind incorporated in legal language.  All a Minister can do is get the sense of what is being put to him in the House, as I got the sense of this yesterday, and ask the draftsman to put it into legal language that fits into an enabling Bill.  That follows precedent and that does not in any way distort matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first road block I came up against here is that heretofore all systems of conciliation and arbitration &mdash; we are all aware of the number that exists for teachers, the Garda, the public service and so on &mdash; are not based on statute.  They are all based on contractual arrangements between the employers in the particular Department, the Department of Education and the teachers, the Department of Justice and the Garda and so on, none of which are enshrined in statutes.  This is the first time it has ever been written into statute.  I thought, and I still think, that the sense of what was said here yesterday is so important because we are setting up a system of conciliation and arbitration which undoubtedly will be a major part of the regulation or regulations to be agreed upon with the representatives of the men.  That system of conciliation and arbitration will be the real bones of the regulations, one that will be proper to the circumstances of the Defence Forces personnel.  That will be the real operation as far as conciliation and arbitration is concerned and what was required was a commitment to it in statutory form.  This is what I have done in the amendment, short of this theological argument, which, as Deputy Roche said, is the difference between the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo;. <Col N="1932" /> The reason for that is that it is not mandatory legislation in the sense of directive legislation.  This is enabling legislation.</P>
    <P>Again, the legal people advised me that in all enabling Bills over a number of years it has been the practice to use the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  That is for legal reasons, for reasons of interpretation in the courts. This regulation may end up in court at some stage.  What they are seeking to establish now is a set pattern of words that are hallowed by precedent, by practice and by interpretation on the part of the courts.  For enabling legislation &ldquo;may&rdquo; is now the word used.  There is nothing more suspicious or deep in it than just that.</P>
    <P>For God's sake, would Deputy McCartan get rid of his paranoia that there is something underlying in this legislation, as Deputy Nealon has said, that I was being super cute in some way in all of this matter.  I can assure the Deputies that there is nothing like that in this Bill.  This is simply a mattter of my trying to take the sense of the debate yesterday on Committee Stage, putting that before the draftsman and saying: &ldquo;The principle of conciliation and arbitration should be incorporated in the amendment.  Can you come up with a form of words?&rdquo;  We had a long debate on this matter.  This was not something I accepted automatically.  The officials of the draftsman's office, the Attorney General's office, my officials and myself argued about it most of today.  This is the only way in which a Minister can operate. This is how Committee and Report Stages are conducted.  On Report Stage the Minister comes back, after considering the sense of what has been put on Committee Stage, and devises the formula.  Usually that formula is accepted.  We cannot go back on it.  We cannot bring the draftsman's office or the Attorney General's office in here and start into a long legal and constitutional argument.  At the end of the day that is what the courts are for.</P>
    <P>The legal people say that the form which I have quoted here is the one that would be most acceptable on an interpretation basis by the courts.  That is <Col N="1933" /> their job.  There must be give and take in any parliamentary discussion of this kind.  That is all I am trying to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the contributors to this debate.  A number of points have been made which must be addressed.  From the point of view of the House what we were talking about yesterday and what we were attempting to do was to encapsulate a principle into a Bill.  The Minister has acknowledged that that is what we were attempting to do.  I do not have to remind him of the exchanges that took place about getting a single line expression of what was important.  What has been produced by the drafting people is not that.  If the Minister is telling us that it is not possible to draft it, then we will have to accept his words.  What is wrong with the words drafted by Deputy Nealon?  Where is there any potential problem with courts, lawyers, negotiators or with anyone in the words which Deputy Nealon drafted for Committee Stage and which I borrowed and attempted to ensure that they would be back here lest we were presented with something similar to what the Minister has presented, which is not adequate?  In all of the propositions he has put forward at least the precedent is accurate.  Deputy Roche could not recall the precedent I quoted to him in the 1924 Act and he repeated, incorrectly, tonight that there are no precedents &mdash; there are precedents.  The precedent in recent times has been to introduce clauses similar to this one.  Of course, every Minister who legislates for anything would like to be able to couch it in the terms in which the Minister's amendment is couched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bring me to my second point.  As I have said, the Minister has failed to include a simple statement of principle in the Bill. Unfortunately he has not told us what would be wrong in doing this or the problems which were envisaged by the parliamentary draftsman when he looked at the wording of the amendment put forward by Deputy Nealon on Committee Stage.  We do not exist in so far as <Col N="1934" /> the Minister's considerations are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has constantly made the point that we are not legislating for this House or a Minister but for the soldiers.  I want to refer to what I regard as the insulting suggestion that what Deputy Nealon, Deputy Ryan and I are involved in is some form of esoteric or theological debate on the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I want to explain why these are real considerations from the point of view of the soldiers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has established the conciliation and arbitration process but suppose another Minister comes along and says, &ldquo;I do not think the conciliation and arbitration process is working&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we will not, because the amendment puts no obligation on him.  If soldiers are doing well, are beginning to catch up on the Garda Síochána and prison officers in regard to pay and conditions and they begin to exert pressure, the Minister of the day may say, &ldquo;These guys are getting on top of us so we had better take out the process&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1935" /> What avenue will be open to a soldier, the person we are legislating for, in those circumstances?  He will have to go to court and ask a judge to stop him by way of an injunction, or force him by way of a declaration from doing this.  The judge may say, &ldquo;I am sorry but in law there is no obligation on the Minister to maintain and put in place a process of conciliation and arbitration because the Act says the Minister &lsquo;may&rsquo; and not &lsquo;shall&lsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If, for whatever reason, the scheme never comes into being and the Minister does not meet the commitments he has given here &mdash; I am not taking away from his or the Government's word but neither he nor the Government will be here forever, if we can help it &mdash; a soldier will have no redress if the Minister's amendment is included in the Bill.  He will not be able to go to a court, the Government, a court of law, a Minister or an officer in command and ask them to look at the section.  They would simply say that it is permissive legislation which puts no onus or obligation on the Minister and consequently the decision will depend on the whim of the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>This legislation which we are seeking to put in place for soldiers represents nothing in this context.  That is why I object to the repeated suggestion about our amendments.  While our arguments have concentrated on a very minute word in the English language, I object to the disingenuous suggestions that we are about some esoteric or theological exercise.</P>

      <P>We are trying to give soldiers a right in law but they will be given nothing if the Minister's amendment is included in the Bill, and the Minister knows that.  The Minister should not suggest that the argument about what is <Col N="1936" /> or is not permissable and mandatory is not relevant.  The Minister has suggested that there is no way out of this.  The parliamentary draftsman has warned him against going beyond the formula because the matter may end up in the courts.  I think that is basically what is behind all of this.  The Minister is afraid to give a legal right of claim to members of the Defence Forces to establish and put in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that is what the Minister said, but if it is not what he intended to say I will not dwell on it.  I am merely making the point that the amendment offers no legal remedy to soldiers, which is what we are trying to provide.  The previous speaker on the Government side, Deputy Roche, suggested that the commitment given by the Minister was as much as any reasonable person could expect in the context of this Bill.  I do not know why points like that are made, beyond the wish to irritate. Perhaps that is Deputy Roche's function in this debate.  The point has to be made that we are seeking to legislate for and on behalf of soldiers.  Commitments written into the record are only as good as the man or woman who delivered them, in this instance the Minister for Defence. These commitments will not exist for any longer than the Minister is in office and the production of the written record of tonight and last night's debates will not be one jot of help to a soldier or a representative association seeking to pursue the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why Deputy Nealon, Deputy Ryan and I pursued our request to the Minister to include a single line in the Bill which would recognise this principle and borrow on the words he wrote in his letter.  We thought the Minister had agreed to look at this proposal but he handed it over lock, stock and barrel to the parliamentary draftsman who told him that it was not advisable to include it in the Bill.  What we have heard here <Col N="1937" /> are the views of people whose job is to ensure that they never get anyone on their side into trouble at any stage.  That is the regrettable fact.  I will be pressing my amendment because not one word of criticism was made by anybody on that side about the unworkability or unacceptability of the simple but effective wording of the amendment put forward by Deputy Nealon on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As was correctly said last night, we are dealing with items which are of fundamental importance to the debate.  The issue is encapsulated in Deputy Nealon's Committee Stage amendment which he has repeated on Report Stage.  I have combined the wording in Deputy Nealon's amendment and that in the Minister's own communication to get what must be a formula acceptable to the Minister. Deputy Nealon's amendment reads: &ldquo;An association shall have the <Col N="1938" /> right of free access to the media by means of spokespersons nominated by the association.&rdquo;  In reply to that amendment the Minister spoke about the need to specify matters, to be able to lay down a specified schedule or to underline the fact that those specified matters should be related to issues that come within the scope of the representative groups.  My amendment for Report Stage reads: &ldquo;An association shall have the right of free access to the news media on matters which fall within the scope of the association by means of spokespersons nominated by the association&rdquo;.  This amendment is a marriage of the two ideas.  It is an effort to take on board the views expressed by the Minister in his covering letter.  The principle is accepted on both sides of the House.  It is acknowledged that it will be respected and will meet all the arguments advanced for ensuring that we should have the opportunity of incorporating basic principles.  I hope this amendment will be acceptable to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I have amendment, No. 6a, down also.  I will not delay the House long.  I made the case very strongly yesterday.  Unfortunately, there was no favourable reaction from the Minister.  I do not expect that there will be on this occasion either.  I would ask the Minister to give an undertaking that the spokespersons of the various associations would be freely nominated by them and that there will be no attempt to confine it to Defence Force headquarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there is no contest between us as to the content of these amendments.  The only question is whether they should be incorporated in legislation.  On 20 February I proposed in my covering letter that spokespersons will be permitted access to the news media on specified matters which fall within the scope of the representative groups and that is the spirit of the two amendments put down by Deputies McCartan and Nealon.  I feel strongly that that is better dealt with by regulations. The working out of the details, <Col N="1939" /> the manner in which spokespersons will be nominated and what they will be allowed to communicate about are all matters on which the representatives of the men will have much to say.  I agree with the principle.  Such a right cannot be taken from any such body once it is established.  They have, under our Constitution, the right to free access to the media.  The details are a matter for them. They will have their own views on how they should present their point of view. The only difference between us is that I feel this can be properly incorporated in regulations after discussion and consultation with the men.</P>
      <P>I want to take up Deputy Nealon's point.  It is a valid one.  He wants an assurance that the representatives of the men will have absolute freedom to nominate their spokespersons and can nominate whom they wish to speak on their behalf and that the person they select may not necessarily be a member of the Defence Forces but may be a member of their secretariat, a consultant that they employ, a public relations firm or any one of a number of people.  I can assure the Deputy that I would welcome that practice. It would add to their expertise in negotiating and would be a forward and constructive step.  It would not cause any dispute at the consultation stage if representatives of the men want to have a guarantee of that kind written into the regulations.  If they require it, it would show common sense and maturity.  The more access they have to good advice and the more they are trained in the ways of negotiation which will be new to them under these bodies, the better they can present their case in a way acceptable to them and the country at large.  They are, after all, an integral part of our society representing our State and in that capacity they will be conscious that their role will require whatever advice they consider necessary to put their case in a proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution of 1937 recognises the right to freedom of speech and information and, as I am sure <Col N="1940" /> everyone would agree, the unwritten right of access to the media as the people who convey information; but it also provides for the delineation and delimitation of that right in certain circumstances &ldquo;in the interests of the common good&rdquo;.  It is one of the features of the 1937 Constitution that de Valera gave with one hand and very cleverly took away every one of those rights with the other by way of saving clauses; and freedom of expression is no different from any of the others.  My concern &mdash; illustrated by recent events which are <i>sub judice</i>&mdash; is that there is a tradition against freedom of speech in the Defence Forces.  Soldiers have been utterly gagged to this date and we are breaking new ground on this issue. It is possible that there will be a strong inclination, despite the Minister's good wishes, on the part of the command and departmental authorities to limit this right to a minimum so that we in the community will be kept as uninformed as possible, as has been the case until now.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons things have been so bad within the Defence Forces in regard to conditions and pay is that they simply could not tell us and it was impossible for us to learn because access to information on the one hand and freedom to speak on the other hand virtually did not exist. These conditions were very convenient for the powers that be who had the responsibility of keeping the budget to the lowest, discipline to the highest and nosy parkers, as some Members would describe those of us who campaigned on this issue, out of the affairs of the Defence Forces.  I have a great fear that it will take a lot of persuasion to break down those traditions and inclinations and that all the good wishes expressed by the Minister and other Members may not be enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any delimiting of the right would then have to be agitated before a court in the context of this saving clause of the Constitution.  Any such agitation or litigation would be greatly helped by the writing into this Bill of the principle of freedom of access to the media.  We have passed from arbitration and conciliation Those matters would not worry me as <Col N="1941" /> much as this.  Here there is a strong tradition against free speech and strong vested interests in having little known and less said about what goes on in the Defence Forces.  This saving clause in the Constitution will be in aid of anyone seeking to break the shackles which have existed on the right to freedom of speech. We are breaking entirely new ground and it would have been entirely appropriate for this House to have written in that freedom of speech and access to the media are an indelible part of the order of things for which we are legislating. I regret that the Minister will not agree to include it.  It is a matter which should be put to a vote.</P>

    <P>We debated this matter at length on Committee Stage and I am not required to go over all the points at the same length.  Nonetheless, it is important to put on the record the objection of The Workers' Party to the obnoxious idea of putting into enabling and fundamental legislation of this sort, establishing for the first time representatives' associations within the Defence Forces, a provision that the association shall not be associated or affiliated to any other trade union or other body without the consent of the Minister.  We object to that proposition because we borrow from the praise that is showered on the Defence Forces and their representatives as being honourable, responsible and loyal as men and force.  Nothing whatever can be said of them in their practice and history to date that would indicate anything but the highest of honour and dignity by them in <Col N="1943" /> the carrying out of their duties.  Why, then, when it comes to allowing them to establish a trade or representative association within their body does the Minister have to step in to say &ldquo;I will adjudicate as to whom they will associate with, whom they work with and whom they are affiliated to.&rdquo;?  There is no need for this provision as it is insulting to the Defence Forces and to their representative associations &mdash; when they are established &mdash; and I urge the Minister to delete that subsection.  The Minister will not encounter difficulties in dealing with the Defence Forces in the future and there is no need for this provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon put in another concept if the idea of the consent of the Minister to which I am fundamentally opposed is to remain.  I have no objection to supporting his proposition that any dispute which might arise in such an issue should be referred to the conciliation and arbitration process.  However, this obnoxious provision should be deleted from the legislation.</P>

      <P>Despite my inclination to do so I did not call a vote on the previous amendment in the interest of making progress. Parts of this Bill, because of the outrageous guillotine, will not be discussed even though they are very important. I will not delay long on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he will allow the associations to become members of various other larger bodies but that they will require the consent of the Minister. I have suggested a way which would be acceptable all round, that this should be submitted to conciliation and arbitration resulting in a binding decision which would ensure that we will not have difficulties along the line.  It would be of major benefit at a future stage to the Minister because he would not have to make a decision on a delicate matter. Conciliation and arbitration would be totally acceptable to the association and the military command.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this as a way of easing the situation.  This would lead to a happier <Col N="1944" /> relationship between all concerned and far fewer areas would be exposed to the possibility of conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Nealon for not calling a vote on his amendment. Indeed, if Deputy McCartan's leader had been in the House he would have called a vote, resulting in more waste of time. However, he is in Brussels.</P>
      <P>If we go along the lines proposed in Deputy McCartan's amendment we will achieve an extraordinary &mdash; indeed a unique &mdash; result which I would not like to see.  We would delete from the Bill the statutory reference to the independence of the associations.  I see Deputy Bell nodding his head, I think he made a similar point earlier.  One of the most important things in the Bill is that the independence of the associations is enshrined at line 35 and it is that independence which Deputy McCartan seeks to extinguish.  So much for his support.</P>
      <P>Throughout the night, Deputy McCartan has been referring to the situation in the Garda Síochána but it is worth pointing out that the Garda associations also require the permission of the Minister for Justice for any such affiliation. Deputy McCartan suggested that he speaks on behalf of all personnel in the Defence Forces.  It is worth pointing out that the draft constitution which has been circulated by some members of PDFORRA provides that the association shall be a non-political organisation and &ldquo;shall not be aligned to any other organisation whatsoever&rdquo;.  I see nothing to commend the suggestions put forward in Deputy McCartan's amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Nealon's amendment because it presents an ideal means whereby difficulties which might arise in the future could be referred to a final arbitrator whose decision would be binding on both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not referring to the Minister but perhaps in the future a Minister might not be ready or willing to listen and in that event it would be very beneficial, from the point of view of the Army and their associations, to be able to refer a <Col N="1945" /> matter further in the knowledge that the decision would be final and binding.  That has applied in other areas and has worked very successfully.  Given a different set of circumstances, management or labour in other areas might not be very happy with the outcome but in this instance it would provide the ideal machinery.  I fully support the amendment.</P>

      <P>In relation to the votes yesterday and this morning I particularly referred to a guillotine in the House in relation to the Bill, the lack of progress and the work which we had to get through in four hours.  Lest a wrong interpretation be made, I did not call for a vote on the last occasion, a most important provision about free access to the media, because I accepted that it would be defeated.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I spoke about the necessity to insert a subsection stating that nothing would prohibit the associations from affiliating to the Congress of Trade Unions and an international body.  However, I did not follow up this matter because I knew I would not get the support, notwithstanding the fact that I felt it was needed.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Nealon's amendment but I am not in favour of the deletion which Deputy McCartan wants.  We wanted a subsection which would identify particular areas but I am not in favour of the deletion of the third section.</P>

      <P>It would create all sorts of problems if amendment No. 7 was accepted although I know that is not the intention of the mover.  In general terms I do not disagree with the thrust of amendment No. 8 but I should like to point out to Deputy Nealon that the wording &ldquo;shall be referred to conciliation and arbitration and a decision shall be binding on both parties&rdquo; is acceptable to me.  Obviously that was the guarantee given by the Minister yesterday in relation to the word &ldquo;arbitration&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be that a problem would be dealt with at unit level first, perhaps at command level, brigade level or GHQ level, and could be resolved before it would get to that stage.  If it then went to <Col N="1946" /> conciliation it could be agreed there.  I suggest that the wording could mean that a decision after a conciliation conference could be deemed to be binding and obviously that would not be acceptable. The word &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo; would mean that it would have to be agreed by the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder are we slightly at cross-purposes here.  When I look at amendment No. 8 from Deputy Nealon I am reading it in the context of section 2 (3) as it relates to the independence of the association, in association with or affiliated to any other trade union or any other body.  On the other hand, Deputy Durkan was talking about the suitability of conciliation and arbitration in the case of an industrial relations dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of industrial relations problems would be solved through direct discussion and negotiation in any event.  It would be appropriate then to go to conciliation and arbitration which is seen as additional machinery as and when necessary.  No doubt the Minister will give us a comprehensive reply.  If we read this in the context of section 2 (3) we are getting into a policy area which is entirely inappropriate to conciliation and arbitration.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I disagree with Deputy Roche in what he said about the lack of necessity to go along with amendment No. 7 on the grounds that PDFORRA are not being set up at the moment as a body with the intention of affiliating to a trade union but nevertheless they must have the right to do so.  They have asked me to support this amendment and I am very pleased to do so.  I would also support Deputy Nealon's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night Deputy Bell dealt very effectively with the first amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan. There is a basic principle that our <Col N="1947" /> Defence Forces have their own independent body or bodies.  That is what the men want and that is what we are talking about giving them.  To delete the phraseology &ldquo;shall be independent&rdquo; is of course out of the question because it is very important.  It is also very important that their association with or affiliation to any other body, either internal or external, is fundamentally within the policy area.  On behalf of this House, I, or whoever is here after me as Minister for Defence, have, under the Constitution and the law, responsibility to ensure that our Defence Forces operate in accordance with the law and the Constitution.  That is a basic policy matter that cannot be hived off to conciliation and arbitration or to anybody else.  We are talking about the fundamental law of the country.  We are talking about an armed force carrying arms in the interests of the State.  We are talking about our civil authority in this House, acting through a Government elected by this House.</P>
      <P>In that situation it is very important that I advocate, as I have done on all Stages of this debate, the right of our Defence Forces to have their own independent body representing their point of view on the various issues we have been discussing.  That is the basic purpose of this Bill.  It is of fundamental importance that we in this House, through the Minister for Defence, write into legislation the policy reservation that any association with any outside body should have the consent of the Minister.  That is a reasonable precaution and is the minimum precaution having regard to the important central role the Defence Forces play in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously there could be contact or affiliation with a body such as I mentioned yesterday, the Conference of Professional and Services Association, specialised bodies such as engineering unions, or organisations of that kind and the Minister would obviously consent to such an association or affiliation.  That is why the requirement is there and the Minister would, of course, do the reasonable thing in that respect.  Ultimately he <Col N="1948" /> must have an authority in regard to the free and independent association that is being established by this legislation to which we want to give proper statutory protection by way of regulation and legislation. We want to ensure that they maintain their independence and do not get involved against the interests of this State.  I am not just splitting hairs.  This is what you might call a residual protection written into this section in the interests of the common good, the public and the security forces themselves.  It has regard to the fundamental fact that an army is an army, an airforce is an airforce and a navy is a navy.  They are armed forces designed for the protection of the State, and that is written into the Constitution, in regard to which we have overall control and responsibility.  That is fundamental and cannot be gainsaid.  That is why that requirement is there.  It is a policy matter.</P>
    <P>Of course, conciliation and arbitration covers the whole area that we are talking about.  That is proper and appropriate to conciliation and arbitration but this is not a conciliation and arbitration matter.  It is a major political-constitutional matter and that is why the requirement is there. It is the only place it appears in the whole Bill, in that precise form, and for the very good reason that I have just given.  It astounds me that members of the Fine Gael Party in particular, who are so concerned about and so involved in the structures of the State, see otherwise than what I am saying, which is fundamental to the security and the continued establishment of the State and the forces raised by the democratic Government of this country on behalf of the State.  This is a very basic political and constitutional argument.  That is why the requirement is there and as far as I am concerned it will stay there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On each occasion one comes to reply on Report Stage one has to correct a misleading statement by Deputy Roche.  There is no principle of independence written into the subsection borrowing or seeking to use the first five words &ldquo;an association shall be independent&rdquo; as a declaration.  That is not <Col N="1949" /> what the section is all about.  It states that an association shall be independent of any trade union or any other body.  There is no principle of independence written in there.  I do not think Deputy Roche has yet made a contribution that is in any way accurate or to the point.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Garland to the debate at this stage and thank him for his support for the proposition advanced by The Workers' Party.  I commend him for putting his finger on the issue and it has to be repeated, even for the benefit of the Labour Party, whom I am very saddened to see taking the position that they have taken here tonight.  I want to put this in context.</P>
      <P>We are establishing a representative association on behalf of the Defence Forces to represent their interests in their trade, work conditions, and remuneration.  That is all that section 2 (1) allows.  We tried to widen the scope of remuneration to include welfare, health, housing and education but we were defeated on the issue by the Government. Consequently how can it be suggested that the interests of the State might, in any way, be prejudiced, challenged, undermined or compromised? Deputy Colonel Bell referred to neutrality in this context.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is that under section 2 (1) the representative association are clearly demarked as an association that deal with remuneration and any other matters that the Minister may allow them deal with in the future.  They are specifically excluded from dealing with matters relating to the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces under the principal Act.  Therefore, they have no function in the area of command and military operation. They are a trade representative association dealing so far with wages. How can anyone suggest that their association with a like organisation either at <Col N="1951" /> home or abroad could represent a potential compromise of State interests or Government policies?  I simply want to make that point.  I am disappointed with the position taken by the Labour Party who think that the association must be controlled ministerially now.</P>

      <P>In page 2, after line 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) An association shall be entitled to establish offices and maintain a permanent staff, exterior to the military chain of command.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a fundamental, vital proposition and I ask the Minister to allow it stand in the context of the Bill. He indicated on Committee Stage that he agreed with it in principle.  But for all the reasons I have advanced about previous amendments dealing with these important items, the House should have the opportunity of recording its views on the matter.  It is equally important when one considers the extent to which the Chief of Staff and the Government have <Col N="1952" /> recorded their views as encapsulated in the Defence Forces representative group being an entirely internal operation and organisation.  I concede that they have departed from the view and agree with the idea of the association having an independent existance exterior to the military chain of command.  This is a very important point.  In the context of the Bill there are propositions relating to persons being put on active duty or where circumstances arise where the association can be dissolved.  I accept that the Minister now agrees that the association should not be dissolved but suspended.  Nonethelesss the only way you can maintain the continuity of an organisation is to allow it the opportunity to maintain a permanent staff and office, exterior to the military chain of command exactly as the Garda Representative Body have offices, staff and a general secretary drawn from the ranks of the men.  The amendment does not intend to restrict and sets down in the broadest possible terms a principle that should be a feature of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan knows, I totally agree with the principle of what he suggests here.  I can guarantee that that will be incorporated in the regulations after discussion with the representatives of the men when it comes to devising the appropriate regulation to govern the situation.  As the Deputy has rightly stated, this is a feature of the Garda Representative Body and is incorporated in regulation under the Garda Síochána Act.  I envisage that the association shall be entitled to establish offices and maintain a permanent staff, exterior to the military chain of command which is exactly on the lines of Deputy McCartan's amendment.  The only difference between us is whether that is incorporated in legislation or, on the basis of my assurances, incorporated in regulations. It is very pertinent to the men and to their representative associations as to how this should be incorporated in the regulations.  There may be variations on the principle but of course I agree with the concept of maintaining offices and <Col N="1953" /> staff exterior to the military chain of command. If they are going to be an independent body they must adopt those principles.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier this is a matter that is appropriate to regulation and the best I can do is to guarantee that the very principles adumbrated by Deputy McCartan will be included in the regulations after due consultation with the representatives of the men when they have been elected.</P>

      <P>I would prefer if this was left to regulations.  In the course of the debate we have again and again referred to the appropriateness of doing certain things under regulations so that the amendments will shape the arrangements that will develop in due course.  When we raise doubts about the competence and ability of members to do something in the absence of legislation, we underestimate the wit and intelligence of those who will take up the positions on the employee or staff side.  The history of public service representation shows that the associations representing the Garda and others are highly effective in terms of what they have achieved for their members.  They have been very successful in terms of attracting a very high membership.</P>
      <P>We are talking about Army personnel who have proved their worth here and abroad.  It is not for us to say that they will not have the competence, the will and the wherewithal to fight their corner. I am certain that they will be able to fight their corner.  The input they can make in their negotiations for facilities will reach anybody's expectations.  What they achieve will be at least comparable to what has been achieved by employees under other public service schemes.</P>

I recognise that the Minister has given strong commitments to this process and that is as much as one could hope to achieve at this late hour.  As a result, I do not propose to press the matter further and I should like to thank the Minister for his generous response.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 1 to 4.</P>
      <P>At last we have reached ground that was not touched on during the debate on Committee Stage.  It is wrong to impose a guillotine on the debate on the Bill because we will not have an opportunity to discuss many sections.  We have approached the first of several provisions which would prove, if tested, to be unconstitutional. We have other objections to the section.  We have been told time and again that this is an enabling Bill but if this section is passed the Bill will turn out to be a prohibiting Bill.  It introduces in a big way many restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this occasion the Minister has gone too far in saying that members of the association cannot belong to another organisation irrespective of how reasonable that organisation may be or how moderate its constitution is.  The Minister has exceeded what is allowed under our Constitution.  I understand that the legal opinion on this section agrees with that <Col N="1955" /> conclusion.  I should like to give the Minister a practical example of the effect of the provision.  If the section is passed Army engineers will lose their right to belong to the Institute of Engineers of Ireland which regulates the standards of their professional education and which has negotiating rights on their behalf. That is a serious difficulty and is an indication of how far the Minister has gone.</P>
    <P>What will be the position of members of the FCA, if they are eligible to join the new associations, who are also members of other organisations?  The section prevents a member of the Defence Forces becoming a member of any other association, irrespective of how moderate it is.  The proposal is to establish two associations, one for NCOs and privates, and the other for officers, but what will be the position if at a future date the privates decide that the new association was not to their satisfaction? Under the section they cannot go about forming another association to represent them.  The Minister should give serious thought to this position.  I have no doubt that he would not like to be embarrassed if a constitutional challenge to this provision prove successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am joint sponsor of the amendment but I do not think I can put the case for its acceptance any stronger than Deputy Nealon.  The section represents a very objectionable proposition. There is no doubt that the object of the proposal was to get at PDFORRA.  The Bill is being rushed through both Houses of the Oireachtas before Easter so that the elections can take place.  The idea was that once the Bill is passed PDFORRA would be illegal under this section.  As a result it would no longer be possible for any member of the Defence Forces to be a member of PDFORRA.  Now that PDFORRA have agreed to defer their elections and have given an indication that once a negotiating structure is put in place they will cease to exist and be subsumed into whatever is put in place through negotiation, the section is unnecessary.  It should not be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> The reason I am convinced that the objective was to get rid of PDFORRA once and for all is that in the previous provision, which deals with the right of association with organisations, will be subjected to ministerial consent.  Under that section the elected representative bodies can associate with other bodies, subject to the approval of the Minister. There is no provision in the subsection under discussion for the Minister to say who can or cannot join another body.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that when the Minister was speaking to subsection (3) he made reference to bodies such as the Institute of Engineers.  I did not seek to interrupt then but I believe that those remarks would have been appropriate to subsection (4).  Under the provisions of subsection (4) there is no room for the Minister to act.  There is no provision there except the words &ldquo;without the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  Once this Bill is enacted in this form, the shutters come down irrevocably and although the Minister might wish to allow the engineers maintain their associations and membership of the trade unions or organisations and even though he might wish the doctors to stay on as members of the medical professions in which they have qualified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister thinks there is a remedy there well and good.  I am not getting away from the fundamental point made by Deputy Nealon that it is wrong in principle.  I think he is right in saying that constitutionally the Minister will have a job on his hands. There is no capacity for the Minister to act to give consent.  Subsection (5) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall determine any question that arises as to whether any trade union or any other body is a trade union or body to which subsection (4) of this section applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my reading of the section it is designed for the Minister to say: &ldquo;yes, <Col N="1957" /> that body is a trade union, is an association or whatever, contemplated under subsection (4)&rdquo;.  It does not give him the power to say that so and so is entitled to join a certain association or maintain membership of it.  I think this is flawed drafting and the way it should have been dealt with was to put in something on the lines of subsection (3), that a person shall not become a member without the consent of the Minister.  I do not believe the other subsections will get over the problem I speak about.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the soldiers in the Defence Forces having a very wide range of trade, expertise and of professionalism. Many of them come to the Defence Forces through the trades and professions and many maintain expertise and interests based on that expertise in organisations and associations outside. We also recognise the undivided loyalties of these men.  I cannot understand why we have to seek to regulate this issue in this way.  I urge the Minister to take on board what is proposed and to delete subsection (4).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Deputy Nealon because the way he put his argument was very provocative and had me thinking for a few minutes.  The point about subsection (4) is that it is designed to protect the associations and its removal could cause dangers to the associations that will be set up in that it would lead to a splintering or a multiplicity of associations and the very things we do not want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Nealon in relation to professional bodies is a concern. The Minister has made the point that if you read this subsection in conjunction with subsection (5) and (6) it will be clearly seen in subsection (5) that the professional associations, such as the Institute of Engineers or whatever would certainly not be put outside the pale. That is an important point and I can see Deputy Nealon's concern. If Deputy Nealon goes back and looks at it again in the context of the explanation given by the Minister he will see that that concern <Col N="1958" /> is taken care of.  I would be very concerned if subsection (4) in its entirety, were to be deleted that it would not serve the interests of the associations. Deputy Nealon put the provocative thought that the section could be open to challenge on constitutional grounds. Ultimately any Bill could be open to challenge on constitutional grounds.  I do not share his view about the danger of a constitutional infirmity on this subsection. His other concern was a more realistic one and the Minister's reply has provided us with the response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support amendment No. 10 and to speak on amendment No. 11 in my own name.  It is now 10.25 p.m. and in 35 minutes the guillotine will come down on this Bill.  Considering that we are still dealing with section 2 it brings home very clearly the major problems and the danger for this Bill in the way the Government have dealt with it.  I said earlier that we had spent too much time on some of the amendments but in respect of amendments Nos. 1 to 10 we had teased out the defects and it is to the credit of the Minister that he came back with certain improvements even if he did not go as far as I would have wished.  For the first time, after all these hours of debating and teasing out, we are now coming to a most fundamental part of the Bill, a section which deals with the strength and the constitutionality of the Bill.  There is another serious question mark about subsection (6) in regard to constitutionality.</P>
      <P>In relation to his amendment and, given the numbers game, we felt we should incorporate an amendment as follows:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent members from retaining membership or from becoming members of trade unions or other bodies for the purpose of further developing the trade or profession in which the member is qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout our Defence Forces there are members from 18 years of age up to the time of retirement who have various <Col N="1959" /> skills and professions &mdash; motor mechanics, carpenters, engineers, doctors and so on.  These people, under our Constitution, have a right to retain membership of the association of which they were originally a member prior to joining the Army.  Many of them, after giving the necessary service, will, when they leave the Army, need to return to the area of work for which they are qualified.  Then they will need a trade union card.  There is no point in telling people, whether they are tradesmen or professionals that they must relinquish all connections with other bodies for the duration of their period in the Army.  That is why we are saying this is a dangerous section and one that is not protecting the normal rights of the individuals.  It brings home very clearly the irresponsibility of the Government in bringing down the guillotine at the various stages because we could have teased out this issue.  The Minister and the Fianna Fáil spokesperson have said: &ldquo;Yes, is that not a valid point?  Perhaps in certain ways it might be unconstitutional. Perhaps there are aspects of it we did not consider&rdquo;.  It is a bit late to be saying this when the guillotine will come down at 11 p.m.  Because this Bill is so fundamental we need to consider every aspect of it in detail, but regrettably we will not be able to do this.  If the Minister cannot take amendment No. 10 on board I will press amendment No. 11 at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make a number of points but because it is getting late I will just make two brief points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A trade union is defined very specifically in law.  A trade union can only act as a trade union if it receives a negotiating licence and is registered as a trade union. There is no question about members of the Defence Forces joining an organisation which is not defined as a trade union.  Therefore, the Minister should have no difficulty in defining what is a trade union.  It is defined in another Act. Deputy Hillery should know that better than I because he deals with trade unions. I could pick up the phone and get a copy <Col N="1960" /> of all the registered trade unions within half an hour.  Trade unions have to renew their licences.  There are very stringent conditions attached to the setting up of a trade union, and the present Act contains much more stringent conditions than the earlier Act.  I have no worries in this respect.</P>
    <P>However, I would be very worried if, for example, the Curragh Command decided to join the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland or SIPTU, Collins Barracks decided to join the National Engineering and Electrical Trade Union, and Dundalk Military Barracks decided to join the Amalgamated Transport Union in Dundalk.  I have dealt with national groups for most of my life where a multiplicity of trade unions are involved and I certainly would not like to see a multiplicity of trades unions, or organisations based on the concept of trade unions, within the Defence Forces of this State. That would give rise to chaos.  The whole idea behind the Defence Forces is that they will move in one cohesive unit.  That is the way the military are trained and taught to act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one commander in chief, one Chief of Staff and one command post in our Defence Forces so that orders can be handed down.  If we provide in an Act of the Oireachtas that everyone has the right to join any organisation they want our Defence Forces would cease to exist.  We should consider carefully where we are going in relation to this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points before the Minister replies comprehensively. I agree entirely with Deputy Bell about the necessity, if at all possible, to avoid splintering and having a multiplicity of associations.  Indeed, it is already evident from what the Minister has said, and from what we know even at this early stage, that the Defence Forces would like to rationalise and keep the number of trades unions as small as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1961" /> I do not see a problem if a member of the Defence Forces is a member of the new associations and also a member of a professional association, which enhances the profession or relates to a professional practice.  The Institution of Engineers of Ireland have a whole range of regulations and services which are designed to enhance the profession; they do not deal only with remuneration as such.  A member of the Defence Forces can be a member of an association dealing with remuneration and also a member of a professional body which enhances either a trade or profession.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any difficulty for people with a trade who are, as Deputy Ryan said, members of the association which caters for NCOs and men because their needs will be reflected in the claims made by that organisation. The leadership of an association dealing with NCOs and men, including trades people will, as day follows night, reflect in a democratic way the needs of their members in the claims which are made and the negotiations which are conducted. I do not think there will be any difficulty about the needs of the members being catered for under the provisions set out in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we get embedded in the minutiae, I should like to point out that the purpose of section 2 (4), (5) and (6) is to protect the associations we are establishing.  That is the first and fundamental point I want to make.  If these subsections were not incorporated in the Bill we would be leaving the whole matter unregulated and open to chaotic splintering and a multitude of associations. This is precisely what nobody wants.  It is in the interests of everybody concerned that we have one independent association for the NCOs and men.  In fact, this was the very factor which prompted the representatives of PDFORRA to express their view point, to which I have acceded, to me.  I was originally of the view that there should be two bodies for other ranks, one to cover NCOs and one for privates.  The PDFORRA representatives and the people concerned about having a proper association argued that to have two organisations, one for the NCOs and one for the privates, would be detrimental.  They wanted as far as possible to have, as Deputy Bell said, one cohesive representative body representing all the non-officer men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They made the case very positively to me that, irrespective of whether they were members of trade unions, privates or NCOs, there was a commonality of interest between them all.  Irrespective of whether they were tradesmen, ordinary Army personnel, electricians, carpenters or members of the various branches of the Defence Forces their strong view &mdash; I am serious about this &mdash; was that they wanted one free independent organisation along the lines of the one which will be established.  They felt there was freedom of movement within the category which justified the setting up of one cohesive organisation and that the promotions up and down the line were <Col N="1963" /> among people who understood each other and who had a common interest.</P>
    <P>I have come around to that point of view.  These subsections (4), (5) and (6) to which the amendments relate are there precisely to protect this single cohesive organisation which will be established. Once it is established this gives them real strength.  It is like Connolly's old idea of one big association catering for all the requirements of the men irrespective of where they are.  This is good.  I do not want to see a degeneration into anarchy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add to what Deputy Bell has said about this.  This is designed to prevent the break up of that single cohesive approach at some future date.  We want to make sure that what emerges out of this is safeguarded and that there will not be a multitude of bodies, resulting in animosity among personnel. It would have major implications for the cohesion, comradeship and discipline that is so necessary in military forces.  I cannot think of anything more daft, particularly in a disciplined organisation, than to have such proliferation. We want to protect whatever association emerges after this Bill becomes law.  It does not in any way prohibit the men from being involved in any other bodies such as the Institute of Engineers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant, trades or bodies.  There is no conflict here.  Under subsections (5) and (6) the Minister shall determine any question that arises as to whether any trade union or any other body is a trade union or body to which subsection (4) of this section applies.  Obviously, there will be no conflict if a man wants to belong to a particular association or body by reason of his profession or trade; but his primary spokesman will be in his own cohesive group within the Army who will be well able to argue his case.  A member of the Army, whether in a profession or in a <Col N="1964" /> trade, will have his advocates in the spokespersons of this new organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  It is commonsense. For example, electricians already have specific rates which relate to the rates outside and the spokesmen who will be sitting down in negotiation on their remuneration and conditions will be able to advocate their case in line with what they would get outside in civilian employment as mechanics, electricians and so on.  The same applies to the professions. All of this is so much commonsense that I do not know why I have to say it here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us he would take our suggestions on board but he produced a formula which simply shrugged them off.  I will accept the fact that subsection (5) is pertinent as far as <Col N="1966" /> subsection (4) is concerned.  Deputy Bell says it is a clearcut definition of what a trade union is.  I would be afraid that at some stage the Minister would seek to declare a trade union not to be a trade union for the purposes of this Act.  We know how important a union card is as far as future employment is concerned. I know the Minister would not like to jeopardise the future employment of a person joining the Army, especially a tradesman who would be a very valuable addition as there is a scarcity from time to time.  I thought we were making progress when the Minister spoke about the possibility of holding on to those things.  He should seriously consider the possibility of at least suspending this and not doing away with it.  There may be some scope for progress there.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he would explain if members of the FCA were members of the Defence Forces for the purposes of this Bill and if they can join associations. I understand a member of the FCA is a member of the non-regular Defence Forces.  Are they members for the purposes of this Bill?  Members are defined as members of the Defence Forces and I understand that would include the FCA. There are very serious implications, particularly where they are already members of a trade union.</P>

I was keen that the Committee Stage, following the exploratory work on Second Stage, should have been postponed until after the recess so that we could tease out the Bill further.  The Minister as a young man had experience of the Succession Bill being fully teased out over a long recess, with the resulting improvements which stopped the Government making some major mistakes. I appeal to the Minister to have a close look at the Bill before it moves to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Because of the very limited time available, I will not press the amendments in my name but I would ask the Minister in the interests of getting the thing right to be extremely careful on this section.  All the speakers have shown the potential for difficulty.  The Minister may say there are no difficulties and he may be correct in the long run.  It may not be unconstitutional but other important people, other legal minds which have studied this in detail, have said that the Minister has gone that bit too far in declaring that a member cannot be a member of any other organisation, however benign its articles of constitution.</P>

He should consider framing amendments to take account of all these matters.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Barrett gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the decision of the Minister for Education to reduce by half the intake to St. Catherine's College, Sion Hill, in advance of the completion of the review on higher education places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter of concern about the rumours of the possible closure of St. Catherine's College in Sion Hill, Blackrock.  This has been brought about by the recent instruction that the intake into the college this year will be reduced by half, from approximately 40 students to 20.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about any possible phasing out of St. Catherine's College, Sion Hill, as a teacher training college, particularly in view of the fact that Blackrock has already lost a very valuable institution, Carysfort College.  The Minister will recall that strenuous efforts were made by her in Opposition and by us to retain that worthwhile facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that St. Catherine's College dates back to 1931 and that 1,500 students have graduated from it since its foundation.  It is an obviously popular choice among students who wish to study for this degree course because over 100 students sought to attend this college in Blackrock, whereas only 20 students sought places in St. Angela's College, Sligo.  We can see the same trend in 1988 and 1987.  Students who wish to study for this degree course have a clear preference <Col N="1974" /> to do it in St. Catherine's College, Blackrock.</P>
    <P>The students who complete their course obtain a B.ED Degree in Home Economics from Trinity College, Dublin. Obviously the advantage of Sion Hill, Blackrock, is that it is near Trinity College and students can avail of all of the facilities in Trinity College.  Blackrock has all the facilities, restaurants, accommodation and so on, and the college is about a five minutes walk from the DART station.  Easy access to a college is an essential element in education today.</P>
    <P>It would be a terrible shame if we were to lose this worthwhile facility.  I would like to see St. Catherine's College, Sion Hill, being retained as a teacher training college.  I know the Minister will probably tell us, and we are all realistic, that the drop in numbers attending secondary school means that fewer teachers will be required.  However, home economics has not been made a popular subject in schools because of the limited number of teaching posts in the home economics area.  When we consider the growth in tourism which will increase our national economic growth, it would be a shame that a valuable facility like this, providing teaching skills, could be lost.  I realise that home economics is not directly related to tourism but a number of lecturers in our third level colleges teaching tourism subjects, such as hotel and catering management, do not have teaching skills. There are excellent chefs and accountants lecturing in our third level colleges who have not had teacher training.  If we find that there are not sufficient jobs in schools for qualified home economics teachers then we should look at alternative uses for these facilities.  I accept that we might have to reduce the number of training places for teachers but we must ask how we can use the facilities to improve the industry that we have identified as being a natural growth area. I am asking the Minister to consider the possibility of extending the use of St. Catherine's College into the field of teacher training and the provision of teaching skills, and that those who are presently lecturing in third level colleges <Col N="1975" /> who have not had teacher training could avail of the services of St. Catherine's College.</P>
    <P>Very often the teachers who replace home economics teachers when they are sick are not qualified home economics teachers.  I think we have to take the subject more seriously.  I ask the Minister to re-assure us this evening that there is no possibility of St. Catherine's College, Sion Hill, Blackrock, closing and that the 40 available places in the college will be utilised to the maximum.  I suggest that we should look at the possibility of talking to the principal of the college with a view to finding alternative uses for those excellent facilities which may improve employment opportunities in the tourism industry in particular.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for allowing me to share his time.  I also thank the Minister for being present.  I will not go over the ground Deputy Barrett has covered but I will raise points that I know are dear to the Minister's heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I spent many hours together on the first Women's Rights Committee.  Our very first report was on education.  The third recommendation of the report, which we recommended very strongly, was that there should be a programme to teach basic skills for living, embracing social and political science, to be introduced in all post-primary schools. I know the new junior certificate, which I hope will be very successful, focuses very much on the living and social skills. However, the great difficulty is that this subject is not a core subject at either junior certificate or leaving certificate level.  If it were seen as the central important subject, which it is, for boys and girls, it would be a core subject, and there would be a great need for the excellent teachers graduating from St. Catherine's College.  If we are talking about expanding any programme in our second level schools it must be a programme to teach basic living skills.  If we treated this subject with the seriousness it deserves, it would become a core subject and this <Col N="1976" /> would require a great number of teachers in our schools.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will agree that there could be a great input from qualified home economics teachers in the area of adult education, particularly for the disadvantaged.  There would be a great demand for those teaching skills during day time adult education and I do not think I need tell the Minister something she knows so much about.</P>
    <P>With all the strength we can muster, Deputy Barrett and I are telling the Minister that there is a real and continuing need for St. Catherine's College, Sion Hill, to be retained and there will be a future demand for the skills of these qualified teachers.  There is a need to expand the provision of the subject in schools and in adult day time education. I ask the Minister to look seriously at the future planning for education to ensure that this subject fits very much within it. I cannot sit down without repeating what Deputy Barrett said, that we suffered a massive loss in Blackrock with the closure of Carysfort College.  I ask the Minister not to add St. Catherine's College to the list or diminish it in any way when there is such a need for the skills of qualified home economics teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the principal and manager of St. Catherine's in my office by appointment and we had a full and frank discussion about the issue. Deputy Barrett was incorrect in saying <Col N="1977" /> that the college has been given details of numbers.  They have been consulted about numbers but they have not been given a final allocation of numbers.  The secretary of my Department has had telephone conversations with those involved and I understand that it is his intention to meet them next week.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that there will be a reduction in the intake in both colleges. My discussion with the people concerned was very interesting.  Deputy Barrett accepts that we must recognise the fall in pupil numbers in our schools.  At one time we thought that we would not have a fall in the birth rate but that has changed.  I asked the principal and manager why they were concentrating on being a teacher training college for home economics teachers only.  I asked if they had considered food technology, nutrition and catering for those who are interested in fresh foods and products that do not contain additives.  It must be remembered that there is a greater awareness about the latter; they are assuming greater importance in our daily lives.  I suggested that this matter should be the subject of a discussion between the management and the staff of the school.</P>
      <P>The intake to teacher training colleges has been halved since we took office. Carysfort has closed and St. Patrick's, the Church of Ireland College and the Limerick College have had a reduction in their intake.  We await the production of the Murphy report to get a true picture of the position.  There are other disciplines that the college could turn its mind towards.  We will have to go into this in great detail with the management and see if we can shape the course to include innovations in society.  The Deputies will be aware that many supermarkets employ people who advise customers on food preparation and so on.  There is a concentration on organic farming and that could be part of a course run by the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I undertook to meet the management of the college at a later stage.  I do not have anything to hide in regard to this but it is my belief that we must talk through all issues.  However, the intake <Col N="1978" /> of trainee teachers to St. Catherine's and St. Angela's at Lough Gill will be reduced.  The colleges will be notified, following consultations, of their intake for the forthcoming academic year. When we reach agreement in regard to the intake we will embark on discussions about the details of the courses.  I share the concern of the Deputies about this issue.  Indeed, Deputy Hillery has had talks with me about the matter.  It is natural that the Deputies should be concerned about a college in their constituency bearing in mind that they lost another fine facility in recent years.  I want the best for St. Catherine's.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that the link with Trinity College is very appropriate and that it gives them a firm professional basis for what they are doing.</P>
    <P>I must tell the Deputies that the intake will be reduced and the college has been informally consulted about that.  It is my intention to get my Department to enter into discussions with the authorities about the course they should offer.  We want the staff utilised in the best way possible but we must accept that the food industry, and tourism, have changed direction.  Perhaps a change of emphasis in the teaching programme will lead to a widening of the base and as a result an opening up of employment possibilities for the graduates of the college.  The principal and the sister-in-charge have been told that I am prepared to meet them quite soon.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ferris gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the need for speech therapists at Scoil Cormac and Scoil Aonghusa, Cashel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the <Col N="1979" /> Chair for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  For the schools in Cashel this is an important matter because there is an urgent need for additional speech therapists.  The number of speech therapists required is usually determined by screening or assessment which is carried out on the prevalence rate of need according to the level of handicap.  There are certain critera laid down which state that in mildly handicapped people the prevalence rate is about 87 per cent, in moderately handicapped people it is 94 per cent and in severe or profound cases it is 100 per cent.  Nationwide, the number of handicapped in the special schools is about 22,000, leaving about 19,000 or 20,000 requiring intervention by speech therapists. Those figures were used in determining the needs in the three schools in Cashel, Scoil Cormac, which has 127 pupils, 122 of whom need the special attention of a speech therapist; Scoil Aonghusa which has 40 students all of whom need intervention and the special day care centre, which has been the subject of urgent attention by Ministers and others because of the staffing crisis there, which has 28 children all of whom need attention.</P>
      <P>In all, 190 pupils in those three schools are in need of intervention and assistance by speech therapists.  Those figures do not take into account the other needs of handicapped people in the county, particularly those attending workshops like the Dan Breen Workshop in Clonmel and the Tipperary Workshop for the Handicapped in Tipperary town.  However, I shall confine my remarks to the schools I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these schools there are people with mental handicap and communication disorder. Research has shown that in the three schools mentioned they are receiving only 10 per cent of the professional's opinion as to their requirements to give them a proper service of speech therapy. That leaves a deficiency of 90 per cent in the service.  In other words, they have a half day per school per week, or one and a half day's between the three schools <Col N="1980" /> which gives them three sessions, that is 27 sessions short in the working week in which they should be receiving attention, care and training from speech therapists if they were available.</P>
    <P>These figures have been given to me by the representatives of the parents.  They have indicated that, on all the figures available throughout the country, there is a need for three full-time speech therapists to give 30 sessions to the three schools over a five-day period; 15 sessions in the mornings and 15 in the afternoons. These parents represent families from all over the county; 14 families from Tipperary Town, nine families from Fethard, 13 families from Cashel, 22 families from Clonmel, six families from Cahir, 35 families from Thurles, six families from Mullinahone, seven families from Ballylanders &mdash; on the boundary of Counties Tipperary and Limerick and in the catchment area of Cashel &mdash; and ten other families from other parts of County Tipperary.  Some of these families &mdash; there are 122 families involved in that survey &mdash; have two or more children attending these special schools.  In the area of capitation grants these children are discriminated against <i>vis-á-vis</i> the capitation grant paid to normal children of £1,400.  When a child is handicapped the capitation grant is £1,200.</P>
    <P>We have tried to establish, through parliamentary questions and otherwise, the need for speech therapy in the south-east region generally.  In reply to a parliamentary question on 13 March 1990 the Minister indicated that this was a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board.  We pursued it at that level and they have communicated to us that the Minister has recently made funding available for additional speech therapists for services for the mentally handicapped. This funding will enable the health board to provide an additional 20 sessions per week, which is equivalent to two full-time speech therapists for the south-east region which consists of five counties, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford an south Tipperary.  The funding which the Minister has made available through <Col N="1981" /> his Department allows only for two additional speech therapists in the South-Eastern Health Board region when, in fact, these two speech therapists are required for Cashel alone, to give the service that is identified by experts, following assessment, as being the need of these pupils professionally and medically. we have vacancies throughout the country for 370 speech therapists.  In Cashel we need three speech therapists; we would need two to bring us up to any standard, yet the Minister has made funds available for only two speech therapists for the whole south-east region.</P>
    <P>These children are being neglected at a time when speech therapy could make all the difference to their being able to carry out any semblance of normal life, to be able to communicate with their parents and the other members of their family.  These are special children.  They are the children of special families who have special responsibilities.  They are a category of children whom the Minister said would have his priority.  In all the health board cutbacks he indicated that he wanted the mentally handicapped category not be included in any cutbacks. Unfortunately, they suffer because, as is the case with every other group, they have to fight for their cause within the overall funding available.  This is an urgent and serious matter.  The Minister and the Department have not addressed the problem properly.  I hope that having raised the matter in this way the Minister can assist us in alleviating some of the problems as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the concerns which have been expressed regarding the need to increase the provision of speech therapy for people with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made to both the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, and I in this regard, by several Members in general and by Deputy Davern on behalf of the Cashel schools in particular.  These representations have arisen largely from the publication of a <Col N="1982" /> discussion document entitled &ldquo;Communication Needs&rdquo;, which was produced by the special interest group of speech therapists in mental handicap, with the help of a special grant from my Department. That document recommended an increase in the number of speech therapists in the mental handicap services, as well as improvements in the organisation of services.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Government and the Minister for Health have accorded a special status to services for the mentally handicapped in the allocation of funds and a special allocation of £2 million extra was made available in the current year to develop these services. As a result of this additional budgetary allocation, 15 extra residential places, 15 extra day places and two extra respite care places have been allocated to the South-Eastern Health Board, the board in whose area these two special schools are located.  The additional allocation also includes the employment of two extra speech therapists, specifically for mental handicap, within the South-Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has also reconstituted the co-ordinating committees in each health board area to ensure that resources are deployed in the most efficient manner and each of the committees has been asked to prepare a five year plan to meet existing and emerging needs in a systematic planned and prioritised way.</P>
    <P>In advance of these plans the co-ordinating commitees identified the immediate priority needs to cater for people who have either no service or a completely inadequate one and the special provision of £2 million extra provided in the 1990 Budget has been allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I know that the South Eastern Health Board, following consultation with the co-ordinating committee, has identified the need for speech therapy as one of its priorities in mental handicap.  Their recent budget allocation included a sum of £20,000 specifically for this purpose. The full-year cost of this extra provision has been estimated at £30,000 and I <Col N="1983" /> would emphasise that this is only one element in a total package of developments in mental handicap in the region totalling £270,000 extra in a full year.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board are now in the process of deciding how best to allocate the additional speech therapy provision in the region.</P>
    <P>Scoil Cormac and Scoil Aonghusa, which are both located in Cashel, are two of the schools to be catered for.  The South Eastern Health Board has offered considerable support to these schools by way of financial contribution towards non-teaching staff and the preparation of school meals.  In addition, the health board has succeeded in providing further supports, including a psychological service and a physiotheraphy service, at these schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to speech therapy, I am aware that there has been a particular problem at these two schools arising from the temporary absence of the health board's speech therapist.  However, I am pleased to be able to inform the House that as from this week Scoil Cormac, which has 121 mildly mentally handicapped children, will have four speech therapy sessions per week and that three sessions per week will be provided at Scoil Aonghusa, which caters for 43 children, who have a moderate mental handicap. I am confident that this will bring about a significant improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's contribution, I should say to him that capitation grants are a matter for the <Col N="1984" /> Department of Education.  I want to state categorically that the extra funds in the budget being transferred to the South Eastern Health Board will allow for the employment of two extra speech therapists in that region.  This is in addition to the existing complement of staff.  I should further point out that our total expenditure for health in 1990 is projected at £1.408 million or 21.7 per cent of our budgetary provision this year.  This is proof positive of the Government's total contribution to providing services for all our people especially the handicapped.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure today to be in the South Eastern Health Board region to open two new excellent facilities in Waterford for mentally handicapped people.  I trust this is to the satisfaction of Deputy Ferris and to his colleagues, particularly Deputy Davern, who made incessant and consistent representations on this matter, and indeed to all the people involved with the mentally handicapped in County Tipperary and throughout the South Eastern Health Board region.  The Government, the Minister for Health and I deeply appreciate the commitment and the concern of so many people working professionally with the mentally handicapped and the people who work on a voluntary basis with them. We will do what we can at all times to have the necessary resources in place in order to ensure that an adequate level of service is available for this special group.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12 midnight until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 30 March 1990.</P>

      <P>Given the current level of expenditure on unemployment payments a redundancy involving 100 jobs would lead to an additional expenditure of some £0.3 million in unemployment payments in a full year.  In addition there would be a loss of social insurance income which would amount to some £227,000 if it were assumed that the 100 redundant workers had been employed at the male industrial wage.  There would also be a tax revenue and levies etc. loss to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It may be anticipated that the level of redundancies and the expenditure on unemployment payments, to which they give rise, will decline.  There has already been substantial improvement in this regard.  Notified redundancies fell by over 40 per cent in 1989, and new claims for unemployment benefit have fallen by some 14 per cent in the last year.  These trends will be reinforced by the progressive improvement in the employment situation anticipated for 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>There were four main recommendations in the report in the Commission on Social Welfare and action has been taken on all of these These are improvement in basic payments; improved child income support; broadening the insurance base; and improvement in delivery of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In approaching the social welfare improvements in this budget, I was very much aware of the submissions I received from Deputies and various organisations. Most of these referred to the increases recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I trust that the House will agree that the increases now being provided represent substantial progress in this regard.  The 1990 equivalent of the priority rate recommended by the commission is £53 and this has now been achieved in the case of all old age and lone parent's pensions and almost to £52, in the case of the long-term unemployment assistance and disabled persons maintenance allowance.  The following is an indication of the improvements in the <Col N="1794" /> four priority areas referred to by the commission.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in improving the basic levels of long-term unemployment assistance, with an 11 per cent increase in July 1988, a 12 per cent increase in July 1989 and a further 10.6 per cent increase this July.  Last year's budget also included the abolition of the urban/rural unemployment assistance differential, which resulted in higher increases for some recipients.  This year's budget also increased the unemployment/ supplementary welfare allowance adult dependant payments to £31, which, together with the increases in respect of children, gives significant increases for families.</P>
    <P>Child income support has been improved substantially in recent years. As well as general increases in line with inflation, a minimum child dependant allowance of £10 was introduced last July and this is being increased to £11 this July.  In the last three years the number of child dependant allowance rates has been streamlined from 36 originally to six rates from next July.  Child dependant allowances have been extended from age 18 to 19 in July 1989 and to age 20 next July in respect of children of long-term recipients who remain in full-time education. Child benefit will be increased by 5 per cent from next October, which indicates the Government's commitment to this universal payment, which is made in the main to mothers.</P>
    <P>Another major development, in line with the Commission's recommendations, was the extension with effect from April 1988 of social insurance cover for pensions to the self-employed, including farmers.  As announced in last year's budget, the Government have decided in principle to extend the social insurance cover to public sector workers currently on the modified rate of contribution. My colleague the Minister for Finance and myself have commenced discussions on this matter with the interests concerned.  Although the issues involved are necessarily complex, we are hopeful of arriving at a mutually satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> The major and ongoing improvements which are being made in the quality, efficiency and delivery of social welfare services are in line with specific recommendations made by the commission in this area.  A new Social Welfare Appeals Office is being established and details of this have been given in the Social Welfare Bill.  There are also proposals for the regionalisation and localisation of my Department's services.  More specifically, there is an employment exchange building programme with an allocation of £4.2 million this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to these general improvements, I would also like to refer to the introduction of an assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands with children last October, and the introduction of a lone parent's allowance later this year; the introduction of a clothing allowance for school-going children this September and a carer's allowance to replace the existing prescribed relative's allowance later in the year.  In addition, the free schemes and the national fuel scheme are being further extended. These improvements, which are along the lines recommended by the commission, achieve a significant degree of streamlining of schemes.</P>
    <P>The application of a single means test for all social welfare schemes as recommended by the commission would have significant costs.  First, rationalisation could involve modifying some of the concessionary features of the means test which apply in some schemes.  Secondly, rationalisation could require easing the more restrictive features of certain other schemes.  Nevertheless, a start has been made on the process of rationalisation and simplifying the procedures.</P>
    <P>Previously, in many cases applicants were paid SWA while awaiting decisions on their UA applications.  This led to delays at local level while an applicant's means were being assessed and, when UA was eventually put into payment, there was the question of recouping the SWA paid from the arrears of UA.  Certain categories have now been identified to whom UA may be put into payment <Col N="1796" /> without the need for an immediate means test.  In general there are persons for whom home visits are not considered necessary.  For these people this initiative has greatly reduced delays and speeded up payments as well as reducing duplications of work.</P>
    <P>I am involved in the development of &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; for social welfare services. The personnel involved include social welfare officers who investigate means and community welfare officers who decide on entitlements to supplementary welfare allowance.  The objective here is to allow for the services provided at local level to be co-ordinated so that, <i>inter alia,</i> duplication of procedures such as means tests for UA and SWA can be eliminated.  The &ldquo;One Stop Shop&rdquo; concept or variations of it are now operating in over 100 locations countrywide (Kilbarrack is the most recent new office).  It is planned to progressively expand this facility to other offices throughout the country as accommodation and resources permit so that an integrated local service may be provided to social welfare clients.</P>
    <P>The process of review of the social welfare system is a continuing one.  In formulating further proposals for reform and development of the system I will be taking account of the recommendations and views of the commission.  I can assure the House that any measures which can be taken to reform and develop the social welfare system within the financial constraints which exist will be undertaken.</P>

      <P>My Department have a network of 130 offices throughout the country at which claimants sign the unemployed register.  Fifty-one of these offices are <Col N="1797" /> staffed by a total of 1,400 officials.  The other 79 offices are operated by branch managers who are employed under a contract for service, and there are some 300 staff in these offices.  These staff are engaged in the full range of duties concerned with the operation and control of unemployment payments, such as accepting processing and deciding claims, making payments, and providing other essential services: Signing on is just one aspect of this range of duties.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, has been advised by the Garda Authorities that some 1,800 man hours per week are taken up in the certification by the Garda of Social Welfare claims in rural areas and that a further 100 hours are involved in travel by gardaí to outlying signing centes to certify such claims. In most cases members who are engaged in certification duty at a Garda station would also be engaged in station duties as well.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the signing and certification process with a view towards a relaxation of weekly signing in appropriate categories.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended in 1986 the establishment of an advisory body to advise the Minister for Social Welfare on any aspect of the system either on its own initative or at the request of the Minister. Since that report in 1986 the Combat Poverty Agency was established to among other things advise me on all aspects of economic and social policy. The National Pensions Board also operates under the aegis of my Department and advises me on pensions policy generally. <Col N="1798" /> In addition, my Department are represented on the National Social Service Board and on the National Council for the Aged.  I do not consider that there is a need at this stage for a further advisory body given the wide range of sources of advice that are currently available to me.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the important contribution voluntary organisations make in the field of social services, a firm commitment was given in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to take measures to ensure a closer liaison with such organisations in the preparation and implementation of policies in the social welfare area.  In 1988, in line with that commitment, I initiated the pre-budget forum with voluntary organisations representative of each of the main categories of social welfare recipients.  That forum gave them the opportunity to discuss with me what the priority areas should be in formulating my budgetary proposals for consideration by the Government.  It was a very successful innovation which I continued prior to this year's budget.  On 27 November last I met 11 voluntary organisations and the forum was equally successful and informative.  Like last year, I followed up the meeting with a briefing for voluntary organisations on budget day.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> The report <i>Poverty, Income and Social Welfare in Ireland</i> presented the results from a large-scale national household survey on poverty, income distribution and the usage of State services, carried out by the ESRI in 1986 and early 1987. The study was jointly sponsored by the Combat Poverty Agency, the EC Commission and the ESRI itself at the request of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The study found that only 3.1 per cent of benefit units appeared to be entitled to some form of payment but did not claim.  The payments to which these people appeared to be entitled included unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and family income supplement.  The take-up rate of family income supplement was estimated at between 13 per cent and 22 per cent of the families eligible, and between 14 per cent and 40 per cent of the amounts of money payable under the scheme.  One of the aspects of studies such as this is that it can be difficult to get reliable estimates of income from respondents. Thus, some of those whom the survey identified as eligible for payments might not, in fact, be eligible.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the initial findings of the survey, additional funding was made available to the ESRI, through the Combat Poverty Agency, to undertake research into the question of non take-up of social welfare payments, as part of a second phase of the study.  This research involved re-interviewing a proportion of the original sample to identify those whose incomes were still below the level of payments to which they may be entitled, and then returning to the households in question to explore the reasons for non take-up of benefits.  The fieldwork for this study was carried out last year. The results are currently being processed and a final report should be ready before the end of the year.  When I have this information on the reasons for non take-up of benefits, I will consider further the measures which need to be taken to address the problem.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report makes specific reference to the low take-up rate of family <Col N="1800" /> income supplement.  In the last year my Department have intensified their efforts to improve the take-up of this scheme.  An advertising campaign to promote family income supplement started at the end of last June.  The campaign set out to make information on family income supplement much more widely available. Fact-packs were distributed to people who work in a professional or voluntary capacity with families in low paid jobs.  As well as extensive advertising, information leaflets and claim forms are widely available through local social welfare offices and post offices.</P>
    <P>In the weeks following the campaign family income supplement applications were more than double their previous levels.  Cases in payment increased from 5,159 at the end of 1988 to over 6,000 at the end of 1989.</P>
    <P>The advertising campaign was followed in November with a mailshot to families on low wages in the north-west of the country.  Further mailshots in other regions are planned, and it is proposed to use a number of different mailshots to test the impact on the response rate.  I will also be arranging for research into the reasons why many people who appear to be eligible for family income supplement are still not applying for the scheme.</P>
    <P>Families on low incomes who are exempt from income tax could also be entitled to family income supplement. In notifying low-paid taxpayers of the increased tax exemption limits, announced in the 1990 budget, the Revenue Commissioners also alerted such taxpayers this year to their possible entitlement to family income supplement.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for low take-up has been the fear among potential recipients that family income supplement payments will result in loss of entitlement to the medical card.  The Government are taking steps to ensure that no person will lose the medical card as a result of claiming family income supplement.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be announcing improvements in the levels of family income supplement payments to apply from July and <Col N="1801" /> I will be giving particular consideration in this context to the need to improve the level of take-up under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another reason for low take-up of family income supplement, which has been identified by research, is that some persons may have low entitlements and are discouraged from claiming because of the time and inconvenience involved, relative to the value of supplement.  I am giving consideration to the possibility of determining a minimum payment under family income supplement, which would give such persons an incentive to take up their entitlement.  This will be in addition to general increases in family income supplement rates, which will also serve to increase the value of family income supplement to those who have currently a low entitlement.</P>

      <P>There is a continuous monitoring of all aspects of the disability benefit system.  Arising from this monitoring 36 doctors were subjected to extensive investigations with a view to establishing whether a serious irregularity as regards certification of claimants had occurred.</P>
      <P>In 17 cases the investigations resulted in the position being accepted as bona fide.  In nine cases irregularities of a relatively minor nature were established and the doctors concerned received a formal warning.  In ten cases more serious irregularities were proven and fines were imposed.  In two of these cases there is an appeal pending.</P>
      <P>The year by year position is set out in the form of a tabular statement which I am including in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the activities during the Irish Presidency I am hosting an Informal Council of EC Ministers for Social Security at the end of April to consider a strategy for the convergence of social protection objectives and policies in the member states of the Community. The need to improve in certain areas the existing arrangements for the protection of the social security entitlements of migrant workers will also be discussed at the meeting.</P>
      <P>I consider that it is of primary importance to ensure that completion of the internal market results in a real improvement in living standards and social protection for citizens of the Community. Convergence of social protection objectives and policies in the member states could make a major contribution towards achieving this.</P>
      <P>All member states face similar problems in the field of social protection which include unemployment, the ageing of the population and changing family structures. Completion of the internal market will greatly increase the need for countries within the Community to enhance their economic competitiveness and there is the danger that in endeavouring to do so levels of social protection may be reduced in real terms.  It is also important to ensure that completion of the internal market does not widen the disparities that exist in the area of social protection between different regions of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> The main aim of a policy of convergence would be to promote, as far as possible, convergent solutions to the common problems faced by all member states in the area of social protection with a view to ensuring that existing levels of social protection are at least maintained in real terms and, where possible, improved, having regard to economic circumstances. Such a policy would also aim to ensure that the future development of social protection systems in the Community contributes to its economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The informal meeting will provide Ministers with an opportunity to have an exchange of views on the overall aims of a policy of convergence and, in particular, on the most effective strategy to bring it about.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market will most probably lead to greater mobility of workers in the Community. Many highly skilled workers such as executives, research workers and teachers depend to a significant degree on occupational pension schemes for their pension cover.  The EC Regulations which provide for the protection of the social security entitlements of workers who move to other member states to take up employment do not apply to occupational schemes.  The protection afforded by these regulations to the unemployed, in particular those unemployed for long periods, is also unduly restrictive.</P>
    <P>I consider that priority needs to be given to the development of appropriate arrangements to afford adequate protection to migrant workers in the area of occupational pensions and unemployment benefits.  The purpose of the discussions would be to identify priorities for action in this regard and the type of measures which are likely to obtain the general agreement of member states.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am confident that the discussions at the Informal Council will give clear guidelines to the Commission in framing proposals in these areas for submission to the Council of Ministers, <Col N="1804" /> thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of their adoption by the Council.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he will outline the extent to which low-paid employment is a factor in the prevalence of poverty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute, in their research on poverty, have emphasised that there is no single &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; dividing those in poverty from those who are not.  Rather, the institute favour the use of a number of thresholds such as 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 60 per cent of average income. Similarly, there is no universally agreed definition of &ldquo;low pay&rdquo;&mdash; a number of different low pay thresholds can be used.</P>
      <P>The ESRI have studied the relationship between low pay and poverty, using a range of thresholds and income data collected in a nation-wide survey.  The institute's researchers concluded that the overlap between low pay and poverty is very limited.  Very few of the low paid, less than 4 per cent, were found to be in households below the 40 per cent threshold line, fewer than one in ten were in households below the 50 per cent line, and about 20 per cent were in households below the 60 per cent line.</P>
      <P>The main reason for this finding is that the majority of the poorest households do not contain an employee, but are composed of people dependent on social welfare payments.  Other reasons include the fact that many of the low paid are in households which are above the poverty line because there is more than one income in the household.</P>
      <P>The risk of poverty is greatest if the low-paid employee is the only earner in the household, and if the family has children; low-paid employees who do not have any dependants are less likely to be found to be in poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This limited overlap between low pay and poverty is not specifically an Irish <Col N="1805" /> phenomenon; similar findings have emerged from studies in other countries.</P>
    <P>Although the overlap between low pay and poverty is limited, the Government are committed to helping those on low earnings.  This year's budget contained a number of measures aimed at helping those on low pay and at risk of poverty. We have increased the tax exemption limit for low-paid workers to £3,250 for a single person and £6,500 for a married couple.  The special child addition introduced last year is being increased to £300 per child.  We have provided an additional £1 million to increase family income supplement payments.  And in order to help those on very low earnings we have introduced an exemption from employee PRSI contributions for workers earning £60 a week or less.</P>
    <P>We will continue to take the measures necessary to address this problem.</P>

      <P>During 1989 my Department prosecuted 43 employers for various offences under the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations.  These ranged from failure to maintain proper wages records, failure to produce records, obstruction of inspectors and offences of aiding and abetting their employees to fraudulently draw social welfare payments.  Of the 43, two were limited companies, one was trading as a partnership and the remainder of the prosecutions were in respect of individual employers.</P>
      <P>It is my policy to prosecute employers who contravene the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations where the evidence and circumstances justify it.  Special emphasis is now placed on the failure by employers and sub-contractors in the prescribed industries to notify details of new employees to my Department.  Failure to make these notifications is regarded as a serious matter in view of the potential for fraudulent claims to evade detection in those cases.</P>
      <P>Six employers were prosecuted for aiding and abetting their employees to fraudulently draw social welfare payments. Four received fines of up to £1,000.  Two were sentenced to two terms each of six months in prison, the sentences to run concurrently.  Employers not operating the full system are reported to the Revenue Commissioners for appropriate action by them.</P>

      <P>From time to time, to facilitate administration, guidelines in relation to various schemes are consolidated.  The guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation had been consolidated in 1977. As is the normal practice, these were supplemented by circular letters which had been issued over the years to deal with issues as they arose.  In June 1988 the existing guidelines together with the supplementary circular letters were consolidated into a single document.  The consolidated guidelines were more explicit than the old guidelines, with a view to achieving greater uniformity in their application throughout the country.</P>
      <P>These were modified by a circular letter last year which notified the minimum rent contribution fixed by regulations and the new threshold &mdash; £30 &mdash; above which departmental sanction to the payment of supplements would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, a person can receive assistance in the form of a <Col N="1809" /> weekly supplement to help meet the cost of rent.  Under these arrangements a payment can be granted where the rent exceeds £3.20 per week.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to supplements is determined by the health boards and, in general, they are calculated so as to leave the client with a disposable income, after payment of his rent, which is equivalent to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to his family circumstances, less £3.20.  Other factors, such as possible over-accommodation, whether there are other non-dependent adults living in the household who could reasonably be expected to contribute towards the rent, would also be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>A detailed leaflet giving general information on the types of assistance which can be provided under the scheme is available from information offices of the Department around the country and from the health boards.  A separate leaflet on rent and mortgage supplementation is available from the same sources.  I am making copies of these leaflets available to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>This year a total of £1,850,000 is being provided in the Estimates for my Department in respect of grants to voluntary organisations.  This includes a provision of £750,000 for once-off grants to voluntary organisations in the social services area, £350,000 in respect of grants for locally based women's groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development, £525,000 for community development projects and special grants of £150,000 to the Rape Crisis <Col N="1810" /> Centre and £50,000 for the Simon Community for community enterprise projects involving the homeless</P>
      <P>Under the voluntary work option, unemployed people may become involved in voluntary work without losing their unemployment payments, provided that they continue to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking, but unable to obtain, employment.

A total of 72 unemployed persons were approved to participate in the voluntary work option. At present 35 persons are availing of this option.</P>

My Department have, however, already taken up this matter with the British Department, who have indicated that they will review the effect of their postal arrangements on their pensioners in this country.  My Department will keep in touch with the situation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the earnings disregarded for means tests have remained at £6 for over ten years; whether he has any plans to update this to a more realistic figure of £30; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present claimants with means of up to £6 a week can qualify for the maximum old age or widow's pension. However, if the claimant has a job and dependants the weekly amount of his earnings which can be disregarded is much higher.  This also applies in the case of allowances for deserted wives, prisoners' wives, unmarried mothers and the new schemes for widowers and deserted husbands.  There is no disregard of this kind under the unemployment assistance <Col N="1813" /> or supplementary welfare allowance schemes.</P>
      <P>Only a minority of recipients are adversely affected by the present levels of disregards.  For example, at the end of February 1990, 70 per cent of old age pensioners, 64 per cent of widows and about 78 per cent of claimants receiving allowances as deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers were in receipt of maximum payments.</P>
      <P>The Government, while maintaining the overall value of social welfare payments, have made significant additional resources available to increase the payments to those on the lowest levels, particularly the long-term unemployed. The policy of using any resources available to provide increases in basic rates of payment ensures these resources are chanelled to all recipients.  On the other hand, increasing the levels of disregards would mean channelling resources specifically to those recipients who already have means.</P>
      <P>The question of a change in the levels of disregards would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation a prisoner's wife allowance may be payable if the spouse has been sentenced for a period of at least six months.  The allowance is at present paid by means of a pension book.  Typically, pension and other allowance books are issued for periods of six to 12 months and are renewed in bulk once or twice a year as appropriate. Accordingly, the payment book is not suitable for short duration entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The needs of the spouses of short-term prisoners are catered for by supplementary welfare allowance or unemployment assistance.  Due to the short-term nature of the payments involved, <Col N="1814" /> this is considered to be the most effective method of meeting their needs.</P>

      <P>As part of my Presidency of Social Affairs Ministers I have undertaken to promote the convergence of objectives and policies in the social welfare systems of the various member states of the Community.  This will be one of the main subjects for discussion at an informal meeting of Ministers for Social Security to be held by me under the Irish Presidency on 26 and 27 April next.  The exchange of information and experiences on the effectiveness of social protection systems in the various member states is an essential element of such a strategy.</P>
      <P>Information is already available on the social welfare systems of the Community countries in the comparative tables of the social security schemes in the member states of the European Communities which is published by the European Commission every two years.  These tables constitute a source of very useful information which permits a comparison to be made between the essential components of the various systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although these tables have been regarded as a considerable success, the European Commission has recently concluded that the range of information available in them is too limited and that they need to be updated more frequently. The Commission is making arrangements to devise a new and more detailed analysis of the social welfare systems throughout the Community.  My Department are co-operating actively with the Commission in this initiative.  The new system in this regard being developed on behalf <Col N="1815" /> of the Commission is likely to be discussed by Ministers in the context of our meeting in April.</P>

They do not, therefore, include certain categories of employees which do not come within the scope of the Redundancy Payments Acts, employees with less than two years' eligible service with an employer, who are under 16 years of age, who have reached the qualifying age of old age pension or who work less than 18 hours per week.</P>

      <P>Under the redundancy payments legislation, it is a matter for the employer to decide in the first instance whether or not an employee has been dismissed by reason of redundancy.  If the employee is not satisfied with the decision of the employer, he/she may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An employee may be entitled to a redundancy payment if he/she has been laid off for four consecutive weeks or for a broken series of six weeks where all six fall within a 13-week period.  The employee, if he/she then wishes to claim redundancy payment, must serve a written notice of intention to claim because of lay-off, or give the employer notice <Col N="1822" /> in writing termininating the contract of employment.  The employee must, of course, also satisfy the basic conditions for entitlement to redundancy payment, as regards insurability, length of service etc.</P>
    <P>With regard to entitlement to holiday pay, the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, provides that an employee who works at least 1,400 hours (1,300 hours if under 18) in a leave year, i.e. 1 April to 31 March, is entitled to three weeks' paid leave, unless he/she changed his/her employment during that year.  An employee who has not worked the required total hours in the leave year, or who changed his/her employment in that year, is entitled instead to paid leave at the rate of ¼ of a week for each calendar month during which he/she worked at least 120 hours (110 hours if under 18). The Act also provides for entitlement to eight public holidays.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to have my Department write to the person concerned explaining the position fully to her and forwarding the necessary forms to assist her in taking appropriate action.</P>

      <P>Payments under the family income supplement scheme are calculated by reference to the claimant's gross weekly income.  This gross income is deducted from the relevant weekly income limit and payment is calculated at 60 per cent of the difference.  Allowance for deductions or expenses from gross salary, such as travel expenses, are not made.  To do so would serve to increase the payments to recipients and this result can be more simply effected by raising the income limits and maximum payment levels for family income supplement as is usually done each year.  I will announce shortly substantial increases in both the income limits and maximum payments which will represent <Col N="1824" /> a significant increase in family income supplement payments with effect from July of this year.</P>
