      <P>D'fhoilsigh Meitheal Oibre a bhunaigh na hAirí Gaeltachta agus Cumarsáide tuarascáil maidir le ceist na teilifíse trí Ghaeilge i mBealtaine 1987 agus tá moltaí eile faighte ag mo Roinnse ó dhreamanna éagsúla a bhfuil suim acu sa cheist seo.  Tá tuairimí nochtaithe freisin faoin ábhar ag daoine aonaracha agus tá na moltaí go léir, mar aon leis na moltaí sa tuarascáil a d'ullmhaigh Údarás na Gaeltachta, á meas againn.</P>

Ach nílimid ag dul ag glacadh cinnidh ar son cinneadh a ghlacadh os rud é go bhfuil brú ag teacht ó dhaoine istigh san Teach. Caithfimidne san Rialtas an rud ceart a dhéanamh.  Cé go raibh RTÉ ag plé le Údarás na Gaeltachta go dtí seo, beimidne agus an Roinn Cumarsáide i gcomhairle le RTÉ os rud é go bhfuil an saineolas acusan.  Beidh roghanna éags-úla ansin agus beimid ag cur na roghanna sin faoi bhráid an Rialtais nuair a bheimid réidh.</P>

Tá 80,000 daoine sa Ghaeltacht. Tá níos mó na milliún daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, agus caithfimidne freastal ar an tír go léir.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the call made by the chairperson of the Garda Complaints Board on 15 December 1989; and the number of tribunals of hearing convened in the past year.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, aware of the statement referred to by the Deputy.  On 9 November 1989 I set out in some considerable detail, in reply to questions tabled by Deputies McCartan and O'Keeffe, the position in relation to the staffing and workload of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board.  I do not propose to go over the entire ground again but rather to confine my remarks to a few essential points.</P>
      <P>The board's staffing complement was, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, increased from six to ten in July last and all the extra staff were assigned to the board by December last.  I consider that this allocation of four additional staff to the board, which was found possible only with the greatest degree of difficulty given the constraints which apply to all areas of public expenditure at the present time, should help to ease their difficulties considerably.  I am continuing to have the impact of the extra staff on the board's workload monitored.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that 14 disciplinary cases were heard by the tribunal in the year 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says 14 were heard, could he indicate whether they involved extensive assembly of witnesses, or were matters <Col N="542" /> that were simply determined by the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They were cases in the tribunal in the normal way as in previous years.  There has been no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the information of the chairman as issued in his communiqué of December, in his address to the Irish Association of Civil Liberties annual general meeting, that there were 250 new cases alone received by the board between August when he agreed to appoint the new staff, and December when the statement was made, and that none of these has progressed beyond an acknowledgement slip?  Can the Minister indicate what he proposes, if anything, to relieve that situation?</P>

      <P>Let us have the utmost brevity in dealing with these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional staff were made available to the board.  I accept that the situation in relation to this board is not as it was envisaged when it was originally established in 1986.  At that time the Government of the day envisaged about 400 cases coming before the board.  There are now nearly 1,000.  It was with that in mind that the Government decided to provide the additional staffing resources. The matter is being kept under careful consideration by my Department and the workload is being monitored.  If additional staff are required I will do what I can within the limits laid down having regard to the constraints on public expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

The tribunal deals with disciplinary cases and there were 14 of those dealt with.  They are not held in every case.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Flanagan</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice,</askee>
      <Quest>having regard to the content of the recently published annual report of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, if he will accept that delays in both registries are chronic and unacceptable; and if he will outline positive proposals to address these matters.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As a preliminary matter I must point out that in accordance with normal procedures the annual report in question has not been published and I can only conclude that it has come into the Deputy's possession improperly.  As I indicated to this House in the course of the debate on the Private Members' motion on 14 November last, I am concerned at the level of delays in the service being provided by the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  These delays are due mainly to an increase in the intake of <Col N="549" /> work and a shortage of staff.  Indeed, there has been an increase of 18.7 per cent in 1989 over 1988 in applications which comprise the bulk of Land Registry work.</P>
      <P>Shortly after taking up office I initiated a general review of the operations of the registries and while I have not completed my review I have taken some steps to alleviate the situation.  I have obtained sanction for an additional 35 staff for the Land Registry in 1990.  Eleven of these have already been recruited and taken up duty.  Every effort is being made to have the remaining staff recruited as quickly as possible.  As a short term measure, some senior staff have been diverted from other work to help deal with the kind of cases where the worst delays are occurring.</P>
      <P>I have also made arrangements for the filling of the post of Registrar of Deeds and Titles and I have obtained agreement from the Minister for Finance for the appointment of a number of staff at senior level.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have provided for an increase in computerisation expenditure of the order of 32 per cent over 1989. A programme of computerisation of the abstracts in the Registry of Deeds will start early this year and the computerisation programme in the Land Registry, which is already well under way, will be extended further.</P>
      <P>The measures I have outlined are the initial steps which I have taken in tackling the problem of delays in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  I am continuing to review the operations of the registries and I will take whatever steps are necessary to resolve the problems there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not come to grips with this problem.  Is he aware of the fact that the average delay has increased since the Minister took office last July?  Indeed, there is an average delay of eight and a half months in a simple dealing.  Will the Minister accept that the average delay for section 49 dealings is 20 months?  Will he accept that the average delay in the case of Land <Col N="550" /> Commission registrations is six and a half years?  Is the Minister aware that the total arrears of dealings increased from 32,332 at the end of 1988 to a staggering 51,145 at the end of 1989?  In spite of what the Minister said about staffing, will he accept the fact that due to intervening losses the number of staff serving in the registry at the end of December was 413&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to numbers and one of the problems in relation to the backlog is that there has been an 18.7 per cent increase in 1989 over 1988 in dealing applications. However, I share the Deputy's concern and I have said this in the House in relation to the backlog.  Everything that can be done is being done.  The authorised staff level on 23 February 1990 was 519.  I must admit that the number is not at that level, we are recruiting but we have not reached the figure of 519, the figure in 1986.  From all the examinations <Col N="551" /> I have carried out on this matter, including visits to the registry, my own feeling is that a programme of computerisation will have to be speeded up to come to grips with the backlog, otherwise it will be an ongoing problem.  It is not just the numbers of staff, it is a question of work practices and systems.  The filling of the post of Registrar of Deeds and Titles will improve the situation from a management point of view.  As I said, I share the Deputy's concern in relation to the backlog because it is affecting development in farming and other areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the 52,000 dealings to which I referred, is the Minister prepared to recommend a general amnesty in the Land Registry for the safe passage of all dealings which have been lodged, especially those which have been there for the past six or eight years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That could not be done because many of the dealings are under query.  About 8,200 of the backlog in dealings are subject to query by solicitors as they are found to be incorrect when they reach the Land Registry.  An amnesty would further exacerbate an already difficult situation.  I appreciate that the Deputy's proposal is made in good faith, but it is not feasible.</P>

I do not envisage any further increases in postal or telephone charges in 1990.  In fact, Telecom Éireann have announced major reductions in national and cross-channel private circuits, varying from 20 per cent to over 70 per cent, which will be of great benefit to Irish business customers in reducing their costs.</P>

      <Quest>in relation to his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 24 of 13 December 1989 in which he stated that he was satisfied that the mechanisms which are already in place in regard to broadcasts originating in Ireland obviate the need for a broadcasting standards council, if he will outline the mechanisms which are in place; and the necessary safeguards which exist under the EC Directive on Broadcasting Activities and the Council of Europe Convention on Transfrontier Television.</Quest>

      <P>It is the statutory responsibility of the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission to ensure that the programming standards laid down in the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1979, in relation to RTE services and in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, in relation to independent services are adhered to.  Complaints against the programmes broadcast by RTE can be investigated by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and I have power to direct that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission investigate complaints against the independent broadcasting services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Europe Convention on Transfrontier Television and the EC <Col N="554" /> Directive on Broadcasting Activities provide that certain minimum standards in important aspects of broadcasting across frontiers must be met.  The onus will be on each State where a broadcast originates to ensure that these standards are met.  If they fail to do this it will be possible to inhibit the retransmission of the offending services by cable and MMDS franchisees.</P>

Both companies are required to earn sufficient revenues for current and capital purposes, and RTE are similarly statutorily required.  That is as far as I can go on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the terms of Telecom Éireann's most recent proposals for early retirement and voluntary redundancy. The proposals were approved by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not propose to enter into a debate on the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> I would simply remind the Deputy that an objective of that programme is to actively encourage State-sponsored bodies to develop and diversify economic employment creating activities.  Technological developments in the telecommunications field have <Col N="560" /> resulted in operations which were formerly carried out manually now being done automatically by computer.  The introduction of digital switchboard operation is a good example of this type of development.</P>
    <P>For the above reasons, Telecom Éireann have a serious over-staffing problem and the need to reduce staff levels has been referred to in successive annual reports and accounts which have been laid before the House.  As a commercial company with a policy of keeping tariffs below the rate of inflation, of improving the competitiveness of Irish international call charges and of maintaining the competitiveness of tariffs for business services, the situation could not be allowed to exist whereby staff for whom no viable job existed, would be retained.</P>
    <P>All these considerations were taken into account before approval was given for the current Telecom Éireann early retirement and voluntary redundancy plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the definite and stated resistance by union leaders representing Telecom Éireann workers against the proposals? Is he aware that they hold the view that the scheme is totally contrary to the spirit of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which is about job creation?  How does the Minister marry that aspiration in the programme to the proposal to shed more than 700 workers in Telecom Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> states that State-sponsored bodies will be actively encouraged and facilitated to develop and diversify their economic employment creating activities.  It states that the State-sponsored bodies which provide utilities and services must, through greater efficiency and cost containment measures, bring down the high cost environment now affecting the competitiveness of our economy and the growth of employment. One area relates to telephone charges. The company have a major over-staffing problem, to the tune of about 1,500, and <Col N="561" /> that figure is likely to rise due to the introduction of digital switchboard operations in the company's audio-manual telephone exchanges.  It is due to technological developments in general.  Telecom Éireann have been doing everything possible to provide alternative employment. For example, they have got involved in contract work with British Telecom and about 500 staff are employed in helping British Telecom to update and upgrade their system.  The management of Telecom are very conscious of the need to take every opportunity to create employment, but that has to be balanced with the overall situation where, if no work is available for staff, they cannot be, on an economic basis, carried in the company to the cost of the user of the service.</P>

      <P>Given that Bord Telecom's profits have trebled in the year ended 30 March 1989, from £17 million to over £50 million, surely, there is scope for the expansion and diversification of Telecom into other areas?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In an ideal world what the Deputy is suggesting would be correct. There would be enough additional employment to absorb those who are being made redundant because of changes in technology.  Unfortunately, that is not the case and the board and management of Telecom are well aware of the Government's view that they should diversify into other areas.  They have provided additional services, for example, Eirpage and other services. They have TEIS into the whole downstream side of business.  They are looking <Col N="562" /> at other opportunities for employment and wealth creation but it is, unfortunately, a difficult area.

      <P>I am aware of the concept of tele-cottage and of the various other developments taking place in expanding access to information technology in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the EC STAR Programme, the telecommunications network needed to support such developments, has been put in place in this country.  A number of research projects are also in progress to assess the demand for advanced telecommunications services in rural areas. A total of 16 information technology service centres have been established to promote the demand for such services.</P>
      <P>It is too early to say what the results of these projects will be, but they may develop along the lines of the tele-cottage model, and may lead to increased employment opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that various tests on possible adverse effects of exposure to radio frequency radiation have been and are being carried out in a number of different countries.  Indeed, much of this work was considered by the International Radiation Protection Association when drawing up the guidelines for exposure to radio frequency radiation to which MMDS operators must adhere.</P>
      <P>A recent independent examination of the proposals to establish an MMDS transmitter of the highest power permitted by my Department has indicated that even when making the most pessimistic assumptions, the maximum exposure by the general public will be 230 times lower than the limits considered safe by the IRPA.</P>
      <P>While I cannot be sure which specific experiments the Deputy has in mind.  I understand from the expert opinion available to me that experiments with animals and with biological cells that show adverse effects and which have been reliably replicated require specific energy absorption rates about 6,700 times greater than the average value of the most exposed members of the public to the radio frequency radiation from the transmitter in question.</P>
      <P>For the sake of completeness I refer the Deputy to my replies to previous questions on this topic, in particular at columns 992-993 of Volume 381 of the Official Report of 1 June 1988 and columns 1034-1035 of Volume 393, of the Official Report on 21 November 1989.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they have no evidence of an increase in the supply of heroin in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the Central Drug Unit in Harcourt Square is 29 members.  In addition, there are ten members in local units based at Store Street, Santry and Crumlin stations who are engaged full-time on anti-drugs work. More than 3,200 other members of the force have been trained in anti-drugs work to equip them to deal with aspects of the drug problem which they may encounter in the course of their duties.</P>

      <P>It does not, it varies from time to time.

More than 3,200 members of the force have undergone specialist training to equip <Col N="569" /> them to deal with aspects of drug abuse, to make them aware of preventive measures and of the special skills needed in investigations.  The present number is the one required by the Garda authorities which they consider to be the appropriate level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On 7 February 1990 I made an order under the Aliens Act, 1935 for the deportation and return to his own country of the person named by the Deputy.  That order was carried out on 8 February 1990.</P>
      <P>When I made that order I was satisfied, as I must be by law, that the continued presence in Ireland of the alien in question was not conducive to the public good.  I remain satisfied that deportation was necessary and that failure on my part to act would have been irresponsible.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to disclose the reasons for my action in relation to this individual or indeed any individual whose deportation I may find it necessary to order in the future.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the public statement made by him in this matter contains a number of errors and makes a number of false assumptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> As regards the final part of the Deputy's question, I have no proposals to amend the Aliens Act, 1935.  Any proposals I might have would, of course, be announced in the usual way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome the Minister responding either now or in writing later to my statement which I stand over.  How can the Minister suggest to the House that the presence of a qualified doctor who previously was given a residency permit and a work visa and who had been interviewed by the Medical Council and deemed fit to work and study as a surgeon, which is what he was doing very satisfactorily for a long number of months at University College Hospital, Galway, could be considered to be not conducive to the public good?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am reluctant to disclose the reasons for the deportation of any individual as I do not think the individual is allowed to make a statement or enter into public discussion on his position.  However, the Deputy has made a public statement much of which he has reiterated.  Therefore, even though I am reluctant to disclose information on the individual and because the Deputy seems to be persisting and repeating his mistakes, I think I can make the following brief comments on it.  First, the alien involved did not have a work permit or permission to be in this country and the Aliens Section of my Department did not cancel without notice or explanation either the work permit or permission to reside.  In relation to the work permit, as the Deputy will be aware having experience of these matters, under the law work permits are the responsibility of the Department of Labour and therefore their issue, renewal or withdrawal are not my responsibility.  In the event, as I said, the work permit or permission to reside were not cancelled by anybody.  They expired on 31 March and contrary to what the Deputy said in his statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, on 31 December. Therefore, contrary to what the Deputy said in his statement, there was never any question of, and here I will quote from the Deputy's statement, &ldquo;the sudden withdrawal of his visa or work permit&rdquo;.  The Deputy also raised in his statement the refusal of entry to the United Kingdom in 1987.  It is true that the individual was refused entry there in 1987.  It is equally true that the individual is known to have had three passports in his possession and it is also the case that a letter written to confirm the bona fides of the individual, purporting to be on behalf of the high commissioner of his country, is not on the record of that high commission and that the high commission does not stand over that letter.  The Deputy in his statement claims that the individual in question was continually in contact with the Aliens Section of my Department in January seeking to have, as his statement puts it &ldquo;some administrative error rectified&rdquo; but this is not true either.  I hope I have said enough now to show that the Deputy has taken one fact, the deportation, and used his imagination in an ill-judged attempt to attack the officials &mdash; I do not mind him attacking me &mdash; of my Department.</P>

      <P>I make no apology for making the statement I made.  If the Minister was prepared to instruct his staff, as I requested last Thursday week, to meet with me to discuss the facts or indeed to convey to his secretary the reasons for the deportation of the doctor we might not now have these unseemly accusations and counter accusations.</P>

I sought a meeting with the Department and information through the Minister's secretary as he was engaged abroad but they were not in a position to help as the Aliens Section refused.  I would more <Col N="572" /> than welcome the opportunity, if the Minister thinks the matter could be helped by having my facts straightened out, to have a meeting with his office and the Aliens Section to have the matter corrected from my or the Minister's point of view.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the role he has in ensuring that there are long-term detention places available for both male and female juveniles after they have been through the judicial system for which he has responsibility.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The institutions for young offenders operated by my Department cater for male young offenders aged 16 years and over and female offenders aged 17 years and over.  In addition young offenders aged 15 and 16 may be committed to prison in accordance with the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
      <P>While it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail on the circumstances of an individual case, it is, I feel, understandable, in view of concerns which have been widely expressed, that Deputies would expect that I should comment generally on the subject of detention facilities for young girls coming before the courts, where the court considers that a girl should be securely detained, though not in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the comments reportedly <Col N="574" /> made on this subject in recent days have focused on the issue that no secure unit is available for young girls similar to that provided by the Department of Education for young boys at Trinity House.</P>
    <P>The lack of this facility was considered by the Interdepartmental Group on the Administration of Justice and their report, which I expect will be submitted to Government in the coming week, makes a recommendation that such a facility should be made available as soon as possible.  I can announce here and now that the Government, in advance of consideration of the full report, have given approval for the provision, as a matter of urgency, of a special centre for 20-25 girls which will (a) take up to eight girls for remand and assessment; (b) provide long-stay accommodation for 12 girls and (c) contain a small number of places, not more than five, for secure use if and as needed.</P>
    <P>Acquisition of the necessary site and planning work will commence immediately and building will be put in hand at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The point may of course be made that this issue has been around for some time and has been the subject of detailed consideration by various groups in the past. That is certainly true.  However, I am not sure that it would be in any way helpful, now, if I were to proceed to outline what has been said by these groups on the subject of departmental responsibility.  I consider it best that I simply acknowledge that the matter of departmental responsibility clearly must be settled once and for all and that this should be done without delay; the process of doing so is well under way.</P>
    <P>It is only fair, however, that I should point out that where differences of opinion exist on the subject of departmental responsibility, these differences are not, as some have suggested, simply a matter of buck-passing.  There are genuine differences of opinion among the many professional, administrative, social and care agencies who have responsibility in this area as to whether provision for children who find themselves in difficulty with the law should be made within an <Col N="575" /> educational, health, or law and order setting. Nor is it simply a matter of interpreting existing legal provisions on the subject &mdash; these provisions are not exactly clear-cut and different interpretations are possible.  In my view, the core issue is what type of setting best meets the needs of the difficult child in each particular set of circumstances and the understandable concerns of the community in general about such children. Facilities are necessary to cater for a wide variety of different cases and, as I have said, steps have now been taken to fill a very long existing deficiency in the system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the need for interim arrangements to deal with the particular case which has been the subject of publicity, the position is that the resolution of that case is now a matter for the court and the assessment as to what interim arrangements will provide a basis for its satisfactory resolution is obviously a matter for that court.  Discussions are taking place between officials of my Department, Health and Education as to what options may be open and the intention is that the health board representative will advise the court, without delay, as to what arrangements are possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I had a Private Notice Question in relation to an individual case.  Your office advised me to take it with this matter and it was disallowed on the grounds of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of that, I would ask the Minister, in relation to the 15 year old girl who has been remanded on ten occasions to Dún Laoghaire District Court, what arrangements will now be made to find a suitable place, other than bed and breakfast facilities for this girl?  In view of the fact that it will take some time before the new centre of which the Minister speaks is put in place, will the Minister arrange as a matter of urgency, in view of the statements of the District Justice for particular provisions to be put in place for this girl?  Will the Minister now admit <Col N="576" /> that this matter has been grossly mishandled by being shuffled between three different Departments?  Will the Minister now tell us which Department are taking responsibility for the care of such girls who are under 16 years of age?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Kennedy report proposed the establishment as far back as 1969 of a centre such as I have announced here today.  I want to reiterate what has been done.  On each occasion that this unfortunate girl has been before the court the District Justice referred to the need for a special centre.  There will be a centre for between 20 and 25 girls.  It will take up to eight girls on remand for assessment, provide long stay accommodation for 12 girls and contain a small number of places, not more than five, for secure use when needed.</P>
      <P>As far as the particular case is concerned the intention is that the health board representative will attend the court on Thursday next and will advise as to what arrangements are possible at that stage.  As to which of the agencies or Departments are responsible, there can be many views.  It is not just a buck-passing exercise as the Deputy seems to suggest.  There are many points of view among those professionals dealing with disturbed children as to whether they should be catered for by the educational, health or law and order areas.  The important thing, however, is to come to grips with the situation and that is what the Government are doing.  The whole area of responsibility has to and will be decided as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There were Private Notice Questions down for my Department.  I want to ask the Minister two questions arising out of his reply to the supplementary. The first is in relation to departmental responsibility.  It seems that if this individual girl had a health problem and was in hospital it would clearly be a matter for the health authorities. Likewise if she had an educational difficulty and was in breach of educational codes it would be a matter for the educational authority.  Would the <Col N="577" /> Minister not agree, therefore, as she has been before a court ten times now, that the matter is clearly one for the Department of Justice?  If the Minister accepts that, could he indicate to the House what the response will be next week of the official from the health authority in court to the predicament of the court in relation to the custodial location of this person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as responsibility is concerned, I do not want to go into this matter because it would not benefit this child or advance this situation one iota. Enough has been said about it already. The situation we have to come to grips with is the obligation to care for this child and to see that society meets its obligation to this child and to others in the future.  That will be handled by the professionals who are the health workers. The health board representative will be in the court on Thursday and will at that stage, we hope, be able to meet the requirements of the court.  It is, however, strictly a matter for the court at the end of the day as to whether it is satisfied.  On the question of who is responsible, I do not want to go into that.  The important thing is to see that this child and other children in similar circumstances are looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get this tied down, I tabled three Private Notice Questions to each of the Ministers who have been passing this matter among themselves for the last while.  I am happy that at least Deputy Owen's question was reached.  How long does the Minister anticipate it will take to provide this unit? Is he building a unit from the ground up? Has he any indication where it will be sited?  Will it be in Dublin or, like Loughan House, as far removed from the community as possible?  Could the Minister advise the House as to the interim arrangements for the young person at the centre of all of this while this unit is being built?  Would the Minister agree with me that while there are different professional views about how to address young people in difficult situations the common thread running right <Col N="578" /> through back to the Kennedy report of two decades ago is the need for a secure unit where containment will allow for whatever other needs there are to be professionally addressed, and that it is time to get off the fence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will welcome the announcement I have made today that such a secure unit is to be built as a matter of urgency.  The unit will be in Finglas.  It will be a brand new unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do.  The important thing is that after many generations of talking about it something is being done and we are to have a unit now.</P>
      <P>In regard to the individual case, as I said in the reply, discussions are taking place between officials of my own Department, Health and Education as to what options may be open.  The intention is that in relation to this young girl, the health board representative will advise the court on Thursday as to what arrangements are possible, and I do not want to anticipate what they will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister specify what arrangements will be available for that person at the end of this week in anticipation of an order of the court?  Will appropriate and adequate facilities be available to house the individual?  More generally, in view of the fact that the special inter-departmental committee are going to report next week as the Minister stated, does he accept that it is of paramount importance in the context of public confidence in the Government? Having regard to the fact that he and the Ministers for Education and Health are <Col N="579" /> reported as denying responsibility in this matter, when can we expect an unambiguous statement of clarification as to whose direct responsibility this is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked for brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the important thing is that we sort out and resolve this situation in a proper manner for this child, and the health board representatives will advise the court on Thursday as to the arrangements that will be arrived at.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the inter-departmental group and they were referred to in the court and elsewhere.  It has been inferred that this inter-departmental group in the administration of justice, who were established last October and have been operating under the aegis of my Department, have some direct responsibility for this case.  I want to clarify the position in this regard.  The group in question were set up to meet concerns about the prevalence of crime and vandalism and their impact in particular on older people and on tourists. The group are representative of all the agencies concerned with the administration of justice, the Garda, the courts, the prison service, the Attorney General's Office and the Departments of Education and Health, in view of their responsibilities in relation to juvenile offenders.  The task given to the group was to examine the efficiency of the structures and procedures of each of these agencies and the way these related to each other, with a view to producing a more effective and streamlined response to the concern I have referred to.  The group were given no role in relation to individual cases such as the one in question here today, nor have they a role in relieving any of the agencies represented of responsibilities which already rested with them.  It is not correct, therefore, to conclude that this group were given responsibility in relation to the present case, or, indeed, other similar cases, which they failed to discharge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Referral to Northern Ireland will not take place.  As to the options generally that are open, I do not want to anticipate at this stage what will be arrived at by the officials of the three Departments, but I can assure the Deputy that the health board representative will advise the court on Thursday without delay as to what arrangements are possible for this child.  It is in all our interests and the interest of society generally that this case be resolved.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of the inquiry which has been held into the circumstances of the death on 26 December 1989 of a person (details supplied) in Mountjoy Prison; the total number of prisoners who died in (a) prison and (b) Garda stations during 1989; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The prison authorities and the Garda have investigated the circumstances surrounding the death referred to by the Deputy.  As an inquest is to be held I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to make any further comment on this matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>There were four deaths in prisons and three deaths in Garda stations during 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to Question No. 39 of 13 <Col N="581" /> December 1989 I informed the House of the establishment of an advisory group &mdash; comprised of representatives of various disciplines involved with the care of prisoners &mdash; to specifically examine the issue of deaths in prisons and to make recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply, but I am very sad to learn that the matter is investigated by prison officers and gardaí alone.  Will the Minister agree in regard to that death that there were at the trial of the person very strong indications of suicidal potential and that it appears to be another of these cases of people who perhaps should not be in the prison environment but in some other caring environment being lost because of inadequate response to existing recommendations such as are contained in the Whitaker report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I share his concern.  Any death in custody has to be a matter of concern.  That is why the advisory group who involve the various disciplines involving care of prisoners has been established.  Various riders to inquest jury verdicts have been examined carefully by the prison authorities and implemented when considered appropriate and practical.  For example, a self-call system to enable offenders to contact staff is being put in place in a rewiring of Mountjoy. However, I feel I should not comment at this stage as there is to be an inquest on this matter and it would be quite improper for me to comment when an inquest is to be held.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked them as a matter of urgency to report.  I have also <Col N="582" /> asked them to take observations and comments from any group or individual who feel they have something to add to their report.  I am looking forward to receiving their report at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Health Boards (Amendment) Regulations, 1989.</P>
      <P>A copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 10th April, 1989.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been considering for some time the question of appropriate representation on the Western Health Board arising from the revised local administrative arrangements in Galway.  It is now proposed to amend the present statutory provisions to enable Galway Borough Council to appoint two members to the Western Health Board. To amend the relevant legislation the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required.  The Seanad <Col N="730" /> passed a resolution approving these draft regulations on 14 December 1989.</P>
    <P>Galway city was up-graded to county borough status with effect from 1 January 1986 and became a separate administrative unit distinct from the county.  At present the Western Health Board comprise nominees as follows: Three nominees of the Minister for Health; six nominees of Galway Councy Council; five nominees of Mayo County Council; four nominees of Roscommon County Council; seven nominee members elected by registered medical practitioners; and one nominee each of registered pharmacists, registered dentists, registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses.  These provisions are specified in the Health Board Regulations, 1970, but to date they contain no legal basis for representation on the Western Health Board of members of the new Galway Borough Council.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government now propose to proceed with the statutory arrangements necessary to enable Galway Borough Council to be represented on the board.  The legal provision takes the form of an amendment to the Health Board Regulations, 1970, which, before promulgation, requires a positive motion from both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Agreement has been reached with Galway Borough Council, Galway County Council and the Western Health Board that the borough council will be empowered to appoint two members to the Western Health Board.  The amendment of the regulations, therefore increases the number of health board representatives from 29 to 31 and specifies that the two extra members will be drawn from Galway Borough Council.</P>
    <P>Since the Commission on Health Funding reported in October 1989, the Government have been considering the most appropriate means of administering health services at local level.  The Minister is anxious to ensure that the mechanism for planning, organising and delivering health services is thorougly efficient and responsive to the needs of a <Col N="731" /> complex health care system.  He is, therefore, considering the whole administrative structure to ensure that it will perform in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible and the views of a wide variety of interests have been sought on the Commission's proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have not yet completed this examination, but have decided that there is no reason in the meantime for not granting Galway Borough Council representation on the Western Health Board.  Under the existing administrative arrangements it is only proper that the borough council should have an adequate input into the local health structure.</P>
    <P>The amendment is, of course, without prejudice to any future proposals on the reorganisation of the health system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Motion for Approval of the Health Boards (Amendment) Regulations, 1989, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to allot most of my time to the local Deputy, Deputy McCormack.  My party will not oppose this move.  We regret that it has taken so long for the borough council of Galway city to be recognised in this way.  It is long overdue.  I hope this change will mark an improvement in the hospital services in Galway which have been a matter of great concern in recent times.  A report has been compiled by consultants regarding the regional hospital which is of great concern.</P>
      <P>Our view on this is without prejudice to our belief that health boards are not the most appropriate bodies to deliver health care services in future.  As this is principally a local matter, I propose to allocate the rest of my five minutes to Deputy McCormack.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that because I was informed by my Whip that this arrangement could be entered into. There seems to be some breakdown in communications.  The loss is not mine but that of Deputy McCormack.  He has been pressing this matter for some years and it is of particular concern to him that the Government have dragged their feet in bringing this forward.  The likelihood of the two representatives of Galway Borough Council being of the principal Government party is very improbable. Our suspicion is that the reason for delaying this matter is tied into that fact and the forthcoming local elections.  Overall we will not be opposed to it.  I hope this will mark a point at which we will see that adequate beds will be made available in the regional hospital, that services there will be built up and that the services at Merlin Park Hospital will not be neglected.  These matters were highlighted in the post-Christmas period when members of the staff of those hospitals spoke out openly about the horrendous overcrowding and the premature discharging of patients.  All of this is quite unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I hope this will mark a turning point and that Galway can look forward to a proper level of hospital services.  We will therefore not be opposing the appointment of two further members to the Western Health Board from Galway Borough Council.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, with whom I have discussed this issue, is very much in support of the amendment and has sought it for a long time.  Had he not been absent on parliamentary business, he would have been the spokesman for the Labour Party today.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal which has finally come before the House to extend democracy in the Western Health Board region by the inclusion of two extra members from Galway Borough Council. It is my firm view that local democracy is the bedrock of the operation of all our services.  I approach this matter on the basis of what needs to be centralised&mdash; everything else should be decentralised. Local members are most in touch with local needs.  They can best define the requirements of their own administrative areas.  They are the people answerable to the local community at election times. Any broadening of franchise and the inclusion of extra representation of elected members is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I also hope that this extension of democracy to the borough of Galway will act as an extra pressure on the Western Health Board and on the Department of Health to fund services adequately which are clearly inadequately funded in that region, as we have seen in the past three months when a calamitous situation arose at Galway Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an interesting extension of local democracy in one health board area.  My view is that it is welcome but the Government's view is not clear.  The Minister says he has received the report of the Commission on Health Funding.  He received that report last summer and <Col N="736" /> has had umpteen other reports for longer periods.  While this Minister is very good at commissioning reports and establishing review committees he is very poor at acting upon their recommendations or taking actions of any description other than cutting back on expenditure and budgets.  What are the Minister's views in relation to the future structure of health boards?  When we are dealing with this legislation which will impact on the structure of health boards, it is incumbent on the Minister to acknowledge at least that he and the Government have a view on it.  When will this Minister and Government make a decision?  They are forever seeking views, and the Minister has come into this Chamber again today and said that more views are being sought.  We are a population of 3.5 million people.  Before this Minister makes a decision he obviously wants to consult all 3.5 million people.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are statutorily charged with administering the health services.  They have made a bad job of it for three years now.  The people gave their verdict on the performance of the Minister in a recent opinion poll and the least this House and the country deserve now is a clear indication of what structural changes the Minister and the Government propose, if any, in the administration of the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party welcome this motion to extend the membership of the Western Health Board to facilitate the appointment of two representatives from Galway Corporation. Indeed, The Workers' Party members of Galway Corporation spearheaded this campaign for representation of the authority on the Western Health Board.  It is most unsatisfactory that it has taken the Government four years to implement this measure.  The Minister could have made this order at any time since January 1986.  The fact that the Minister decided not to do so until now has meant that the city with the biggest hospital and the biggest urban area in <Col N="737" /> the west was without representation on the Western Health Board.  Clearly the Fianna Fáil Government considered that the political complexion of Galway Corporation made it undesirable to extend their democratic rights to the people of the city.  Of course many things were changed with the political marriage of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, and this is one of the changes.</P>
      <P>The health board have been criticised recently, sometimes justifiably.  The health boards provide the only area of democratic control over our health services and the health services are a matter of concern to the vast majority of people. The right of the democratically elected representatives of the people to have an input into health policy matters is a principle that should be defended.  The Government seem determined to restrict that input as much as possible. The decision to effectively abolish the health advisory committees was just one example of this.  In 1987 a directive issued to the health boards that the functions of health advisory committees would be taken over by the health boards.  This was when financial constraints were being imposed on the health boards and these constraints have continued to be imposed.  I would remind the Minister that health committees were established under section 7 (2) of the 1970 Health Act and they have statutory authority to advise the health boards of the functions in the area that require the attention of the health board.  That function has been completely abolished.  The democratic right of the people to have that representation has been taken away.  I would call on the Minister to have that restored as well.</P>

      <P>A review of the health board structures was in train when the new Galway Borough Council was established and the request for representation was made.  The review was made redundant by the establishment of the Commission on Health Funding.  The commission were asked to review the efficiency of the delivery of the health services including the local administrative structure.  This review has been going on for the past two years.  The commission's report was only published in October last.  Thereafter, we took this motion before Seanad Éireann where it was unanimously agreed.  I am very pleased, as a person living in the Western Health Board area and recognising the rights of Galway Borough Council, to be represented on the board, as a member for that area, and as a junior Minister in the Department of Health, to maximise the representation on the board.  I look forward to the contributions that will be made by those members and I hope they will be very postive.  I am confident that the health board will continue to discharge and deliver the health care services in the western region as they have done so well for so long.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Relations Bill, 1989: Second    Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Industrial Relations Bill, 1989 is to put in place an improved framework for the conduct of industrial relations and for the resolution of trade disputes, with the aim of maintaining a stable and orderly industrial relations climate.</P>
      <P>I can hardly over-emphasise the importance of the contribution which good industrial relations can make in helping Irish industry to avail of the opportunities and to meet the challenges presented by improving economic conditions and the completion of the internal market.  We are now in a period of relative industrial relations peace.  The figures for strikes and days lost are at their lowest levels for decades.  There is no better advertisement for this country as a location for investment than the fact that in 1989 we had the lowest number of strikes since 1922 when our statistics began.  In addition, it is important to note that in the last quarter of 1989 we did not have even one strike about pay.  The present climate of industrial peace and calm provides the ideal opportunity to put workable structures and procedures in place.  We must ensure that, should industrial relations tensions resurface in the future, disputes can be processed in an orderly way and with the minimum of disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the importance of industrial relations and the disruptive effect which industrial disputes can have, it is not surprising that industrial relations reform has been on the agenda of the Department of Labour ever since their establishment in 1966.  A number of very important pieces of legislation have been enacted in the intervening years but these have, in the main, dealt with the employment rights of individual workers.  The <Col N="740" /> two fundamental statutes in the area of trade disputes and industrial relations, namely the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, and the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, have remained largely unaltered.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the Bill before the House have their immediate origin in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The programme committed me to holding discussions with the social partners about changes in industrial relations which, in the words of the programme, &ldquo;would provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement and help to create conditions for employment-generating investment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In entering the discussions I was aware that many unsuccessful attempts have been made in the past to secure consensus on fundamental changes in trade dispute and industrial relations law.  It was my view that a further attempt to pursue this goal of consensus was unlikely to lead anywhere, given that the respective positions and interests of both sides meant that a true meeting of minds on many specific issues would not be possible. My approach was to identify a number of key areas which I considered needed attention and, having done this, I developed a package of proposals which addressed the major issues.  The detailed discussions which I subsequently held on the proposals with the social partners confirmed my view that this was the only basis on which progress was likely to be made.</P>
    <P>Reaction to the Bill since its publication suggests that while there are certain aspects on which one side or the other would have reservations, the Bill as a whole contains a workable package of measures capable of providing a sound framework for the orderly conduct of industrial relations in the future.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations in practical terms is not some abstract concept but rather the interaction of management, trade unions and employees.  This interaction reflects the interests of both sides but it must also take account of the rights and obligations of both sides and the rights of <Col N="741" /> third parties.  No Government can legislate for industrial relations peace but the existence of a legislative arrangement can provide a framework within which the interaction of the social partners can take place in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>For such a framework to be effective on an ongoing basis it must contain a fair balance, protecting the rights and interests of both sides on the one hand, while at the same time imposing certain constraints and obligations on them.  In a system such as ours, which is based on the concept of voluntarism and free collective bargaining, the success of industrial relations procedures and institutions is ultimately dependent on the commitment of both sides and on the willingness of both sides to use them.  The measures provided for in the Bill contain a balance and I will be looking to both sides for their fullest co-operation and commitment to making them work.  I would like to place on record my appreciation of the spirit in which both sides engaged in the discussions on my proposals and I am confident that with similar goodwill the arrangements provided for will operate successfully and make an important contribution to ongoing industrial relations stability.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the provisions of the Bill.  These range over a number of areas and can be divided broadly between trade union and industrial relations law.  Under the broad heading of trade union law there are provisions to reform trade dispute law, to introduce pre-strike secret ballots, restrict the use of injunctions in trade disputes and to facilitate the further rationalisation of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Under the broad heading of industrial relations law I propose to establish a new labour relations commission which will have responsibility for a comprehensive range of functions, including the provision of conciliation and advisory services and the drawing up of codes of practice.  There are also provisions to amend and improve the procedures governing the establishment and operation of joint labour committees and <Col N="742" /> technical provisions to enable more effective enforcement of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  I will now deal with each of these areas in turn.</P>
    <P>The statute law in relation to striking and picketing is primarily contained in the five section Trade Disputes Act, 1906, with a number of further provisions in the Trade Union Act, 1941, and the Trade Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1982. The law in this area is not as simple, however, as a reading of the Acts might suggest.  Since 1906 there has been a considerable volume of case law arising from the interpretation by the courts of the provisions of the Trade Disputes Act with the result that the law in this area has become extraordinarily complex and its precise limits vague and confusing.  As a result the usefulness of the statute law in providing a guide to conduct is diminishing and it is increasingly necessary to look to the case law.  However, as far as possible, statute law should provide a clear indicator as to the boundaries of what is permissible in trade disputes.</P>
    <P>My approach in the area of trade dispute law is to repeal the Trade Disputes Acts of 1906 and 1982 and to reintroduce the main provisions of these Acts with amendments.  An important by-product of this approach is to give the legislation a clear presumption of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>Taken in the order in which they appear in the Bill, the main features of the provision relating to trade disputes are as follows: The definition of trade dispute is being amended to exclude worker versus worker disputes.  The immunities will no longer apply to disputes involving one worker where procedures have not been followed.  Picketing will be confined to an employer's place of business and the present wording whereby picketing can take place &ldquo;at or near&rdquo; a particular location will be changed to &ldquo;at or where that is not practicable at the approaches to&rdquo;.  Secondary picketing will be permissible only in situations where workers have a reasonable belief that the second employer has acted in a way calculated to frustrate a strike or other industrial action by directly <Col N="743" /> assisting their employer.  An anomaly whereby organising a strike is protected by the immunities but threatening to organise or take part in a strike would appear not to be protected is being cleared up.  In future the immunity enjoyed by trade unions in respect of tortious acts shall apply only in the case of acts committed in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  Unions will be required to have a rule in their rule books providing for the holding of secret ballots before engaging in or supporting a strike or other industrial action.  In trade disputes where a secret ballot has been held and notice given, the granting of injunctions, particularly <i>ex-parte</i> injunctions, will be restricted.</P>
    <P>I would like to go into a number of these proposed changes in some more detail.</P>
    <P>The proposal in relation to secondary picketing has generated a certain amount of misunderstanding based on the complexity of the law in this area and the corresponding uncertainty of all those concerned.  Let me be very clear about what is being provided for in the Bill. Secondary picketing &mdash; that is picketing at the place of business of an employer other than an employer involved in a trade dispute &mdash; will be permissible only where the workers in dispute have a reasonable belief that the second employer has involved himself in the dispute by directly assisting the employer who is party to the dispute for the purpose of frustrating the strike or other industrial action.  This provision defines secondary picketing in clearly understood industrial relations terms and clarifies the existing confused legal position.  There have been strong demands from the employers' side for the total outlawing of secondary picketing but to do so would tilt the balance unfairly to the benefit of employers.</P>
    <P>The secret ballot provisions will require every union to have a pre-strike secret ballot rule in their rule book within two years of the passing of the Bill. Among other things the rule will require that all union members, whom it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for <Col N="744" /> the union concerned to believe will be called on to engage in a strike or other industrial action, be entitled to vote, without interference, on whether to engage in industrial action.  It should be remembered that many of the larger unions already have pre-strike ballot rules and the holding of secret ballots is normal good practice.  The provisions in the Bill are designed to ensure that this good practice is extended to all unions, thus promoting greater order in the conduct of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The provisions on injunctions are closely linked to those on secret ballots. Where a secret ballot has been held and at least one week's notice of industrial action has been given the employer will not be entitled to seek an injunction without giving notice to the union.  The granting of <i>ex-parte</i> injunctions, often in a judge's home outside court hours, has been a matter of considerable concern to trade unions for a long time.  The Bill also provides that interlocutory injunctions will not be granted in situations where, in addition to having a secret ballot and giving notice, the union establishes a fair case that they were acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. These restrictions on the granting of injunctions will not apply in the case of trespass or action likely to cause death or personal injury.</P>
    <P>Injunctions are often sought by employers as a bargaining tool and not for the purpose for which they were intended, namely to maintain the <i>status quo</i> pending a full court hearing.  Trade dispute cases rarely come to a full hearing. The changes being provided for are designed to reduce recourse to the law courts in industrial relations disputes, while permitting injunctive relief in cases involving trespass, obstruction and so on, thus ensuring that injunctions are still available in genuinely serious situations. The new arrangements will also provide a strong incentive to trade unions to hold secret ballots and give appropriate notice of proposed industrial action to employers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> I would like to turn now to the provisions in relation to trade union rationalisation. It has long been a policy of Ministers for Labour to encourage the rationalisation of the trade union movement. Some progress has been made in reducing the number of unions from 95 in 1970 to 69 today.  A feature hidden by the global figure is the very high number of small unions.  Some indication of the multiplicity of small unions can be gathered from the following statistics; 18 unions have fewer than 500 members and between them account for a mere 3,400 members, less than one per cent of the total membership.  There are as many as 51 unions with memberships of fewer than 5,000, accounting for 70,000 members or a mere 15 per cent of the total membership.  It is obvious that despite the rationalisation which has taken place in recent years there are still far too many unions in Ireland.  This is bad for industrial relations as it gives rise to inter-union rivalry, a multiplicity of bargaining units and demarcation disputes. The multiplicity of small unions is also bad for members as such unions cannot provide the services required in today's complex working environment.</P>
    <P>The amendments to trade union law provided for in the Bill have the complementary goals of further encouraging mergers between unions and discouraging the formation of new or breakaway unions.  The Trade Union Act, 1975, permitted the introduction of a system of grants towards expenses incurred by unions in a successful merger. As the prospect of a merger attempt being unsuccessful and the associated expenses can deter smaller unions from attempting mergers, I am providing that unions which attempt a merger, but which fail in the attempt, may claim expenses relating to the two year period prior to the failure.</P>
    <P>A further proposed change involves the doubling of the membership requirement for a new union seeking a negotiation licence from 500 to 1,000 members and a substantial increase in the level of the High Court deposit required by such a union.  While the present membership <Col N="746" /> and deposit requirements which were provided for in the Trade Unions Act, 1971, have worked well to forestall the establishment of small, poorly financed or breakaway unions in areas already serviced or capable of being serviced by existing unions, experience in recent years suggests that some tightening of the requirements is necessary.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with industrial relations law and the Labour Relations Commission.  I would now like to turn my attention to the other major part of this Bill, particularly to the provisions dealing with the machinery for the resolution of disputes.  The major institution in this area is the Labour Court which was established by Seán Lemass in 1946 and has served Irish industrial relations well in the intervening years.  When the court was established the country was emerging from the constraints imposed by a world war.  Large scale industrial development had not yet begun.  We now have large industrial and service sectors and are part of the biggest trading bloc in the world, moving towards greater integration in the context of the single market.</P>
    <P>Since their establishment the Labour Court have successfully adapted to numerous changes from decentralised to centralised pay bargaining and back again.  They have also been called on to deal with a wide and ever changing range of issues which have varied in line with economic and work place developments generally.  The court have been responsible for resolving countless disputes thus ensuring enormous savings to the economy in terms of production and exports.</P>
    <P>All structures need to be assessed and re-examined from time to time and to say that there is a need for change in the dispute resolution structures is not to take from the major contribution which the court have made.  What are provided for in the Bill are measures designed to enhance the contribution which the State machinery can make to the resolution of disputes and to the overall improvement of industrial relations.  In particular, the proposals recognise the great contribution which the Labour Court have <Col N="747" /> made and aim at improving and enhancing their status.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a change in the structure and approach of our industrial relations institutions in order to place primary emphasis on the promotion of good industrial relations and the development of improved industrial relations procedures.  There is a need also to shift the main responsibility for dispute prevention and resolution back where it properly belongs &mdash; that is, with the parties themselves.  The Labour Court have become a court of first resort rather than as the final, authoritive tribunal in industrial relations matters which they should be and which it has always been intended that they should be.</P>
    <P>The changes which the Bill provides for in relation to the dispute resolution machinery have four principal objectives: to give a new general responsibility for the promotion of better industrial relations to an appropriate body; to encourage and facilitate a more active approach to dispute prevention and resolution; to restore the original purpose and status of Labour Court investigation and recommendations and to make provision for a number of new functions and services.</P>
    <P>The major change provided for is the establishment of a new Labour Relations Commission guided by a tripartite council, with employer, trade union and independent representation.  In addition to the overall responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations, the commission will have a wide range of functions, including the provision of conciliation and advisory services and the development of codes of practice.  The equality service and the Rights Commissioner service will in future act as independent units of the commission.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for establishing the commission is to have a body with primary responsibility for the promotion of better industrial relations. The commission will be well placed to make public pronouncements on industrial relations practices and procedures which need to be changed and to call for <Col N="748" /> legislative or other changes if necessary. The commission will also be able to highlight examples of good practice and encourage others to adopt similar practices. Their pronouncements will carry the authority of a tripartite body and the collective experience of respected experts drawn from the industrial relations field.  This promotion of good industrial relations will also be advanced through many of the commission's activities, such as the provision of an advisory service, the preparation of codes of practice and the offering of guidance on such codes, conducting and commissioning research and reviewing and monitoring developments.</P>
    <P>A second major objective in establishing the commission is to encourage and facilitate a more active approach to dispute prevention and resolution.  A previous attempt to do this within the structure of the court by broadening the statutory terms of reference of conciliation officers and renaming them industrial relations officers had little effect.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence now that the parties are showing a greater willingness to settle disputes at an earlier stage but many minor issues are still being referred to the court for a full hearing.  The commission will strive to build on this desirable trend to settle disputes earlier by attempting to bring about a change in attitudes so that the responsibility for dispute resolution is shifted back to the parties themselves where is primarily belongs.  The attainment of this end will entail a reappraisal by trade unions and employers, especially those who are still attracted to the option of adjudication, of their attitude towards dispute resolution. If a dispute cannot be resolved at the workplace then an industrial relations officer of the commission will facilitate the parties to reach a settlement on their own terms.  The parties should be more committed to an agreement that they have worked out together through negotiation than to an adjudication handed down by a third party.  The advisory service of the commission will also have an important role to play in the <Col N="749" /> prevention of disputes, but I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, one major objective in establishing the commission is to restore the original purpose and status of Labour Court investigation and recommendations.  Up to the end of the sixties the Labour Court issued about 100 recommendations each year.  Over the years since then there has been a dramatic rise in the number of recommendations issued.  The figure reached a peak of 1,045 in 1983, declining to 708 in 1988 and 646 in 1989.  Part of the explanation for the large increase in the number of recommendations issued by the Labour Court, particularly during the 1970s can be attributed to the central role provided for the court in the resolution of issues which arose in the context of the various national wage agreements.</P>
    <P>It would appear that having developed the habit of referring matters to the court for adjudication, the parties to disputes have found it difficult to revert back to settling their own problems.  While the decline in the number of issues being referred to the court in recent years is to be welcomed, there are still too many recommendations being issued by the court on relatively trivial matters.  This can only damage the status and ultimately the acceptability of Labour Court recommendations.</P>
    <P>The increased emphasis given to conciliation through the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission should ensure that more cases are settled at conciliation and that fewer cases are heard by the court.  Ultimately, as the parties take more responsibility for their own disputes, there should be a decline in the number of conciliation cases.  The intention is that only after exhaustive efforts at conciliation have failed, or in the most exceptional circumstances where the commission waive conciliation, will a dispute be referred to the court.  The court will then become a genuine court of last resort in industrial relations rather than a court of almost automatic recourse as at present.</P>
    <P>A further major objective in establishing the Labour Relations Commission <Col N="750" /> is to make provision for a number of new functions and services.  I have referred already to the fact that the commission will undertake research and will review and monitor developments in the industrial relations area.  The commission will also provide an advisory service.  Too easy access to the Labour Court in the past has meant that in some cases there has been no examination of underlying problems at workplace level which can give rise to frequent disputes.  The conciliation service has found itself in a continous firefighting role.  As a result even where an industrial relations officer came to know through frequent contact with an organisation that there were serious deficiencies in workplace industrial relations, pressure of work prevented the officer from giving more than limited attention to advising on how such deficiencies might be dealt with.  It is the intention that where such organisations come to the attention of an industrial relations officer in future the officer will be able to suggest that the parties seek the help of the advisory service to be provided by the commission.  The advisory service will be in a position to help management and unions in individual employments to examine and review some or all of their industrial relations practices.</P>
    <P>The commission will also be charged with drawing up codes of practice in consultation with trade unions, employers and other interested parties.  I see this as being a very important task for the commission and it is my intention that codes of practice should provide a valuable source of guidance for employers and trade unions on particular issues.  The drawing up of codes is closely related to the commission's function of promoting good industrial relations and improving industrial relations practices.  Codes can be a means of highlighting and encouraging the adoption of good practices generally in a particular area.  The commission will be able to formulate codes on particular subjects chosen by itself or at my request.  It is my intention as soon as the Commission is established to draw a number of areas to its attention <Col N="751" /> which I feel should be given priority as areas where codes of practice would be particularly appropriate.  These areas include: a dispute procedure which would set out the procedural stages to be followed before industrial action is taken; provision of information to and consultation with employees on the activities of the undertaking and on decisions likely to affect employees; levels of cover to be provided in the case of disputes in essential services and protection and facilities for workers' representatives in the company.  At a later stage I believe the commission could usefully turn its attention to codes on individual grievance procedures and disciplinary procedures.  This list is not exhaustive and the commission will, I am sure, have its own ideas on areas where codes could usefully be formulated.</P>
    <P>When a code has been drawn up I will be empowered to promulgate it in a statutory instrument.  A code can be taken into account in any proceedings before industrial relations bodies and the law courts where it is relevant.  Failure to follow a code will not in itself render anyone liable to proceedings.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour one often hears the case being made that given the voluntarist nature of our industrial relations system legislation on particular issues affecting the interests of employers or trade unions would be inappropriate. Giving the commission responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations presents a challenge to the social partners to show that voluntarism can work.  The commission will give the social partners the opportunity to take action together in promoting good industrial relations in constructive and imaginative ways, in particular through the formation of codes of good practice.</P>
    <P>Over the years there have been complaints in relation to the operation of a small number of joint labour committees. The Bill contains provisions to improve the procedures governing the operation <Col N="752" /> and establishment of joint labour committees. There are also a number of technical provisions to improve the enforcement of the terms of employment regulations orders and registered employment agreements.  I would hope that the improvements in relation to joint labour committees and employment regulations orders will make the committees more effective.  They will also make it easier and more attractive for low paid workers to seek to have new committees established or to seek the registration of agreements.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the range of measures provided for in this Bill will make an important contribution to industrial relations in this country.  As I said at the outset a stable industrial relations environment is crucial if this country is to realise its full economic and employment potential.  The creation of new employment and the preservation of existing jobs remains the number one priority.  The experience of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> shows how successful an approach based on consensus and with the commitment of all sides to the attainment of common goals can be.  The agreements on pay associated with the programme have resulted in a period of stability in pay bargaining and an almost total absence of major industrial disputes related to pay issues.  I am confident that with the commitment and goodwill of all sides a further programme can be put in place which together with the measures provided for in this Bill will ensure the continuation of industrial relations peace for the foreseeable future.  It is now clear that we can parallel the enviable industrial relations performance of some of our most successful partners in the European Community such as West Germany.  That must continue to be our objective.  It is obvious that consensus and partnership must replace conflict.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to be here today and to be able to welcome this legislation which I hope will go a long way towards filling some of the gaps in this area and the whole important area of industrial <Col N="753" /> relations, which is human relations and the valuing of people at work, by their work and through their work.  I would also like to think that it is one of a package of measures which the Minister for Labour will be introducing in this session. Before commenting on this Bill I would like to say we on this side of the House are looking forward to the introduction of the legislation regarding part-time workers and also to the legislation which will come about as a result of the discussions by the Minister and his Department with the various agencies regarding the strengthening of the equality laws.  I, and I am sure my colleagues on this side of the House, hope that this legislation will not just involve job creation, which is most urgent and essential politically and industrially, but will provide job satisfaction for management, employers and employees.</P>
      <P>In the evolution of work, particularly since the industrial revolution, one of the great causes of conflict and enormous injustice has been the concept, which I hope this legislation and new thinking on work and training and the value of work and workers will put an end to and which has created a firm divide between management and worker, that, management, being paternalistically disposed to give a job to workers, they should be eternally grateful and accept whatever conditions pertain to that job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a long and painful history of industrial relations and of lack of industrial relations regarding attitudes and the devaluing of work done by workers who are the productive unit of all industry and all business.  This legislation has come about as a result of agreement and discussion and with the support of employers and employees represented by their trade unions.  This has got to be the consensus for the future in regard to justice and productivity and even the basic pragmatism of knowing that it is only through good industrial relations that we get the best from all our workers, also bearing in mind that we are entering an age of enlightenment in civilization regarding work, the concept of work and even the changing structures of work <Col N="754" /> which will add a quality of life not previously enjoyed.  That is one of the most exciting prospects and, indeed, the speed at which the change is coming about not only regarding the structures of work but people's attitude to work has got to be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that in the Labour Relations Commission being set up by the Minister all the changes which must take place and which are occurring at such a fast rate will be brought about satisfactorily so that work will be enjoyable, productive, satisfying, and, above all, valuable not only for the sake of profit but for the person actually involved in the work.  That is the most important aspect.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the Minister that one of the matters discussed and debated at the recent three day conference under the auspices of the Presidency which he hosted at Dublin Castle was the need for flexibility and what this would entail.  It has been described as a double-edged sword.  If we had the confidence to structure the boundaries of work in such a way that this would be taken into consideration we would have a valuable work-sharing experience. However, in this challenge we could be dealt a devastating blow.  If we find that traditional industries are disappearing, that people are being made redundant, that we are not taking on board very quickly technological changes, providing the necessary skills and training and putting in place a proper industrial relations structure we could be faced with a double-edged sword.  On the one had it could cut a bright and shiny future for us with ample job opportunities but, on the other, so many people could be cut down and consigned to the scrap heap where they would end up disillusioned and depressed, which is what is being experienced by many of our unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>Our codes of practice, the recommendations the Labour Relations Commission will make and the negotiations between all sides to a conflict or dispute must recognise the need for information.  As my colleagues would agree, very often it <Col N="755" /> emerges following the escalation of a dispute, long after both parties negotiate in a civilised and courteous way, that the right information was not available at the right time.  The commission must strive, and I welcome their terms of reference, to develop the best code of practice possible. It worries me that much of the data and information garnered by commissions, committees and managements, not because of a lack of goodwill or a wish to deny it to the people who most need it, is not passed on in the most effective, efficient and clearcut way.</P>
    <P>Let me introduce at this stage one of the ingredients needed to keep the structures strong and flourishing, and that is educational training.  I remind the Minister that many fine reports, some carried out under the aegis of his own Department, have been issued on this topic.  The advisory committee on worker participation in their report to the Department of Labour in October 1986 highlighted the educational aspects and the benefits which would accure from having good industrial relations procedures. Our object must be to remove fears. There is no doubt that people react in an illogical way when they feel threatened or when denied information on the true position.</P>
    <P>I intend to refer to the importance of worker participation in industrial relations at a later stage but the advisory committee on worker participation in their report pointed out that because of the change in structures there is now a great need to steer managements towards a new style of management, towards forward planning and enduring growth rather than short-term profit.  All of us would echo that point.  We need to place tremendous emphasis on management training.  Old-style management is as out-of-date as the dinosaur and could have disastrous consequences similar to those that would be experienced if very large dinosaurs were to trample our territory.</P>
    <P>Aligned with the need for forward <Col N="756" /> planning and the need for management training &mdash; this relates to the importance of educational training for all those at work &mdash; is the need to use our educational institutions.  The advisory committee on worker participation in their report state that a variety of third level educational institutions might be encouraged to develop short course modules on participation for inclusion in economics, social studies and related disciplines. They go on to state that at second level the new transition year programme would seem to be well suited to a special module on the operational merits of participation. We would like to see an expansion of this course in second level schools in a positive, practical and exciting way.</P>
    <P>The fact that we do not prepare our young people at second level not alone for the practicalities of work but for the satisfaction of work, disturbs all of us and leads to huge misunderstandings and lack of information which again leads to fear and lack of confidence in one's work management structures.  They will have satisfaction and confidence at work if we introduce it at that level and integrate it as a normal part of the development of young people so that they will see work not as some kind of extra layer, without which they are devalued and useless in the community, but as an extension and part of the whole development of themselves as people.  It should take on that concept rather than its present negative one.  I believe the thinking on the Industrial Relations Bill as introduced, is toward creating not just a structure but a climate in which this type of behaviour, this type of negotiation, this type of understanding could be developed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the Labour Relations Commission.  I note that it will consist of a chairman and six ordinary members &mdash; two to be appointed by the Minister, two to be nominated by trade unions and two by employers.  In the nineties, on the eve of the great breakthrough I believe will happen in the structures of work, one of the most positive things would be to ensure an equality of representation as between men and women <Col N="757" /> on that board.  I would like to think that the trade unions, the Minister and other nominating bodies would ensure an integrated and equal participation by women not alone on this new Labour Relations Commission but on the FÁS training board, at decision making levels in trade unions, and in management.  I am not saying this just from the point of view of figures, that because there are so many men, there should be so many women, but there is a far more practical reason based on research into the emerging concept of work, management and human relations that make good industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It has been discovered, by enlightened management &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;, that, where positive training and action promotion programmes have been offered to women, many take the opportunity to leave the factory floor where the majority still work, train in management, negotiation, and supervision, where the results have been incredibly good, not just from the point of view of role models being offered to other women and industrial relations in general, but because of the kind of contribution that was made.  In the area of good industrial relations it is now recognised that the very characteristics that carried women through negotiating and conciliation &mdash; unfortunately there was a lot of passivity in it as well in the past &mdash; the assertive conciliation as practised by women, would go a long way.  I do not want to take up the time of the Chamber today but I can furnish details of such management initiatives that have had the most tremendous results.  Again, this is the result of a balancing of contributions and skills of male and female.</P>
    <P>Certainly I am making a special plea for women workers because of the low position from which they start.  It is absolutely essential that the Industrial Relations Bill be given the resources through the various commissions and structures being set up, to enlighten, train and develop skills in management and workers.  Some of the skills I am talking about are new found skills in the area of technology where people are being edged <Col N="758" /> out and made redundant.  We must ensure that those people get an opportunity to be part of the new future.</P>
    <P>An essential part of our education, from second level through the various training structures we have at the moment, is the concept of conflict resolution.  Within this concept of conflict resolution, people can be taught to negotiate not manipulatively but skilfully. This has worked with the most astonishing results where it has been an integral part of the programme where people did not start off from a stand off position but listened to each other, giving themselves time to evaluate what the other person said.  This skill does not come easily because our first conditioned reflex as human beings, is to defend our position to the death and not listen to the other side.  The skill of conflict resolution can be learned and can bring the most incredible and positive results.  I would like to think that our training programmes would have to provide for this.</P>
    <P>As regards letting off steam and not allowing grievances to build up to the extent that they become misunderstood, distorted and destructive, as happens in so many cases, should the commission not think of introducing into the workplace during working hours a certain time each week or month for people to come together without fear of intimidation or a feeling of being threatened and, in a positive way, let the other side know what is annoying them, what is bugging them, before it ever gets to the stage where it is so much more difficult to draw back, and the grievance is not really fundamental?</P>
    <P>Let me give just one small example: I believe human relations are basic.  Some years ago an industry in Britain was suffering a tremendous amount of bad industrial relations and they did not believe they could continue to operate profitably. They brought in a group of consultants who worked in the background and observed the structures of the workplace over a six month period.  That was important because people forgot they were there and were able to study what happened as it happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> There was a continuous and continuing breakdown in industrial relations where the workers always negotiated across the table for better pay and demarcation and made many contentious and divisive demands.  When the final report issued after six months they discovered that the only power the workers perceived themselves to have was the one to bargain for money and demarcation; they saw themselves totally powerless in other areas.</P>
    <P>Let me give two examples of what can give rise to grievance and divisiveness. They discovered that the parking facilities allocated to workers and management were commandeered totally by management.  Management came in maybe two days a week in their large cars and would leave early but had a very large parking area marked off for them, for the managing director, executive director and so on.  Half the time those parking areas were not used. At the same time in this company there was a great need for the plumbers, electricians and other skilled trades' people to be on emergency because of machines breaking down and so on.  They had a few subsidiary companies.  When the workmen and craftsmen &mdash; at that stage they were men so I do not have to make a point here &mdash; sought parking space to enable them to carry out emergency work they found it was not available.  The demarcation areas were not being used effectively and efficiently by workers who needed them.</P>
    <P>The second area of contention was two different places for eating.  There was a management restaurant and a workers' canteen.  The food on offer in both places may have been pretty much the same but there was a tremendous sense of grievance on the part of workers who felt that their work and need to socialise were regarded as of diminished importance.</P>
    <P>All that was taken on board.  The demarcation was eliminated.  The need of each worker within his section was taken into account and the result was a productive and highly satisfied work <Col N="760" /> team.  Some kind of grievance structure was also set up to deal with complaints and prevent them from accumulating in a destructive way that was totally unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Strikes help nobody but their greatest victims are the workers who go on strike. Nobody wants to do so.  We must set up a climate of conciliation and negotiation so that people are not pushed into feeling that strike is their only recourse.  We all know people who have been on strike for a month or two only but as a result they can be in debt for so long that the striker and his family lose out fundamentally and it takes them two or three years to recover.  No little increase in their pay over a short period can recompense them.  Consider also the blow to industry and to our highly industrialised and competitive society.</P>
    <P>This industrial relations legislation is urgent and necessary and I hope the new Labour Relations Commission will meet the needs.</P>
    <P>I am speaking to the principle of the Bill and Deputy Jim Mitchell will concentrate on details.  I would like to see the Labour Relations Commission being involved here.  The legislation as drafted, gives responsibility to the commission to highlight examples of good practice, to provide an advisory service, to prepare codes of practice and offer guidance on such codes, to conduct and commission research and review and monitor developments.  We welcome the report that will emerge from that.  Not alone the commission but all of us on all sides as legislators and workers, will be able to learn much from the monitoring and reports that will be published as a result of this legislation.  I hope the resources will be made available &mdash; and maybe I am insulting the Minister by suggesting they are not going to be available &mdash; for a proper database and bank where all information can be co-ordinated and disseminated, not just in this country but to enable us to stay closely in touch particularly with European performance and European models so that we will have access to the best of all <Col N="761" /> that is available.  I hope that we will not necessarily have to learn from our mistakes, but, that through that database and resources used properly, we will have access to well tried models that can work or be adapted for this country. I am a great believer in not having to go out and experiment and explore it all for ourselves.  If something good is working that can be adapted to Irish conditions we should use it as effectively as possible. Very often we find ourselves doing very indepth work and thinking we have discovered the wheel, only to find it has been working much more efficiently and effectively in some other area and we just did not know about it.  It is important that we use accessibility to information to its fullest.  I know the Minister will agree that resources into that exercise will effect a saving.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the commission can undertake research.  Without research we are going nowhere.  It is the foundation stone of all our action.  I would like to think that the codes of practice being worked out are not merely to be handed down like the Ten Commandments to Moses but are seen to be good, just, rightful, appropriate and above all fair to both sides, and that both sides know them fully and will accept them.  Impositions can lead to much bad human and industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the legislation regarding joint labour committees. If it were not for the work of joint labour committees in the past and even now, the lowest paid, least organised workers would be even lower paid and in a worse position.  I would like to see the joint labour committees extended and expanded to take in all areas of work.  In legislation relating to part-time workers this must be taken into consideration. The committees must expand to include certain areas of work where, particularly, women and young people are being exploited, which is immoral and with which, none of us can feel comfortable. We all deplore the high unemployment rate and we should work on all sides to create jobs and decrease unemployment. <Col N="762" /> Regardless of the climate of high unemployment, it is absolutely immoral and unacceptable that young people and others who desperately need a job should be exploited and badly paid.  Employers can simply say that if a person does not want a job there are a hundred others who will take it.  The lack of morality and justice is enough to make one breathless.  We cannot hold ourselves up as a just society as long as that pertains.  Change in behavioural attitudes can only be brought about by changes in codes of practice and the introduction of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that joint labour committees will deal with such matters as conditions of work.  Fundamentally we need a minimum basic wage for all workers and all work, rather than joint labour committees setting out terms of income.  I do not believe the necessary improvements for workers will be achieved without the setting of a statutory minimum wage.  I see a place for joint labour committees in regard to conditions of work, perhaps concentrating on certain categories of work which require a certain knowledge and expertise. Certainly the joint labour committees should not be the only mechanism for preventing the exploitation of cheap labour.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the appointment of equality officers who will operate as an independent service of the commission. I hope the equality legislation will be strengthened to enable these officers to play a strong role.</P>
    <P>Women at the trade union conference last weekend referred to the fact that 15 years after the introduction of equality legislation women in industry earn only 67 per cent or 68 per cent of the average hourly earnings of men.  This was referred to also at the seminar on the EC presidency. The gap is not narrowing.  Training is not focused to ensure that women are brought into the mainstream where they can earn the same industrial wage as men through training and apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>Worker satisfaction and confidence in the value of the work being done is very <Col N="763" /> relevant.  I will keep my recommendations in this area until we debate other legislation.  I hope that no legislation will emerge from the Department of Labour in which this point will not be central.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between unions and management should be continued and expanded.  We must also consider flexible patterns of working time.  Ways must be found to encourage, train and include people.  Basic to good industrial relations is the valued, skilled, satisfied and productive worker who does not feel that he or she is an element to produce profit for somebody else but is an integral part of the workforce and part of a satisfying human experience.  I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the establishment of a comprehensive industrial relations service envisaged in the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission.  Our major reservations on the Bill are basically as follows.  We believe that the inalienable right to strike should replace the immunities from prosecution for trade unions in the 1906 Trade Disputes Act.  The restrictions envisaged on picketing which do not take account of modern commercial realities worsen the right of workers to take effective industrial action in the case of primary and secondary picketing.  We believe that the extention of the secret ballot requirement to cover forms of industrial action other than strikes could prove cumbersome and ignore situations where workers take retaliatory action against what is seen as a blatant injustice by an employer.  We believe that the provisions restraining employers from unjustified recourse to injunctions will be easily avoided in practice through third party actions.  The removal of the right of the Labour Court to intervene in various industrial disputes on its own intiative or at the request of just one party to a dispute is unnecessary and will undermine the authority of the court.  We believe that the power conferred on the Minister for Labour to <Col N="764" /> direct the Labour Court to become involved in a dispute could prove counter-productive despite the best intentions of the Minister of the day.  We shall table amendments on these matters on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As the Bill proposes the establishment of a new body to enhance the industrial relations machinery which has evolved over the past 44 years since the establishment of the Labour Court, I will deal first with the Labour Relations Commission. The functions of the commission which add to existing services are an advisory service, the preparation of codes of practice, research and the commissioning of research.  The other functions are in practice exercised by the Department of Labour or the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>Of practical concern is the transfer of the conciliation service from the Labour Court to the commission.  I would expect that the Minister wants to see a close and effective working relationship between the conciliation service and the court.  In practice the commission are to be given the power to decide when the court should intervene in a dispute.</P>
      <P>Unless I am misreading the situation, the commission will tend to expand their caseload and attempt to resolve cases to avoid reference to the court.  That would be the test of an effective chief executive and I suggest it would depend largely on the personality and ability of the chief executive.</P>
      <P>What appears essential to me is a practical step which will link both the commission and the Labour Court in a manner which avoids friction.  That would be achieved by nominating the Chairman of the Labour Court as chairman of the new commission.  While there is a provision that the chairman and chief executive of the new body can be the same person, that could prove an obstacle to the integration of the commission and the court.  In order to prevent any friction from day one, I would suggest that the Minister acknowledge the practical requirement for strong consultation between the court and the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> In terms of the new services to be supplied I want to know what level of resources will be put in place behind the commission, if the services are to contribute to better industrial relations.  I would ask the Minister to examine the budget and staffing structure of the Northern Ireland Labour Relations Agency who I am told provide the kind of active advisory services in terms of manpower and publications which section 25 proposes.  This body is relevant because despite the changes in law in the United Kingdom, industrial relations practice in Northern Ireland remains closer to the position that prevails in this country than in the UK mainland.</P>
    <P>The development of an effective industrial relations service would seem to me to require the reassessment of the rôle of the Irish Productivity Centre.  It is envisaged that the labour management advisory unit will be transferred to the commission.  Is this the extent of the advisory and research service envisaged by the Minister?  While I understand the Irish Productivity Centre have provided services of an industrial relations nature, they are also involved in the promotion of employee participation on an active basis.  I think a clarification of roles is required and in particular the nature of the advisory service which the commission is to provide &mdash; will it be active or simply circulate reports?</P>
    <P>When my colleague, Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Labour, proposed the adoption of a right in law to strike to replace the existing immunities from prosecution for trade unions under the Trades Disputes Act, 1906, it appeared to be a controversial proposal.  I know some trade union members were concerned that in practical terms any positive right in law to strike would in practice involve a reduction in their capacity to function effectively.  The Labour Party believe that it is only a matter of time before successful third party cases for damages could arise from the effects of industrial disputes and once that is established, the position of trade unions and their members would at best be doubtful in this regard and at worst open to the threat <Col N="766" /> of substantial financial loss in the case of protracted disputes.</P>
    <P>A majority of unofficial strikes result from some arbitrary action taken by the employer.  This emerged from a study of unofficial strikes carried out by the staff of the University of Limerick.  While unofficial strikes are indicative of bad industrial relations practices, it is a mistake to point the finger at workers who may be acting in response to what they feel at the time is unreasonable behaviour on the part of the employer.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill while extending the immunities in the Trades Disputes Act, 1906, to cover situations where an action could be taken against an individual worker for threatening to break his contract of employment do not provide immunity from tort or from the actual breaking of the employment contract itself.  What these issues indicate to me is that despite the difficulties involved in framing a positive right to strike, trade unions and their members will be under some doubt about their own liability to tort until such a right is specified and in wide terms to cover possible actions by third parties affected by industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>The section on the rights of workers to conduct peaceful picketing is a step backwards from the present situation.  It confines picketing to the premises of the employer in dispute and, because of the limited definition of employer in the Bill, does not guarantee a right to picket where an employer may form a new company to circumvent a strike.  This problem arises from a court case in 1959 of the &ldquo;Roundabout Limited <i>v.</i> Beirne&rdquo; where the owners of a pub in dispute formed a new company and successfully sought an injunction in the High Court against the union, which ruled that the new company was not an employer.</P>
    <P>The question of secondary picketing of employers not directly involved in a dispute but frustrating a strike is obviously one where a balance has to be decided.  I know that employer organisations are totally opposed to secondary picketing but in practice industrial and commercial groupings, and particularly <Col N="767" /> those who have related business activities and functions, mean that employers themselves take secondary action in the case of some trade disputes.</P>
    <P>I accept that trade unions cannot have an unlimited right to carry out secondary picketing and I completely accept that the health services, in respect of life-preserving services should be exempted from secondary picketing of the premises during a dispute.  However, if the right to secondary picketing is to be a real right, it will require a less restrictive interpretation of what constitutes assistance from one employer to another affected by a trade dispute.  This is particularly important in the case of disputes where trade union recognition is at issue.  Assistance of an indirect nature will enable an employer to ignore Labour Court recommendations and continue in business.  I am not suggesting that picketing should be without restriction in such cases but, in practice, trade unions should have the right to supplement pickets of those directly involved with persons authorised in writing by the trade union to take part and who are themselves members of that union.  In order to establish the right of employees to take secondary action, it should be sufficient for employees to establish that a company is in the same beneficial ownership as the company in dispute or where relevant, commercial relationships exist between one company and another.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that confining picketing to those employed by an employer is unfair, considering the removal of immunities from those who take unofficial action after a majority have voted to reject a strike.  If a majority of employees vote for a strike then their union, or unions if there are more than one, should be allowed to augment the picket line with their members.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with secret ballots. The requirement for trade unions to carry out secret ballots before strike action is a reasonable proposal in so far as strikes involve disruption of normal business and a loss of wages to employees.  This applies whether the strike is of a limited or <Col N="768" /> extended duration.  I have deliberately referred to strikes because, before a strike develops, there may well be more limited forms of industrial action which can avoid a strike.  If the intention behind this provision is to reduce the incidence of strikes, then the practical realities of industrial relations need to be considered.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose an employer changes a condition of employment which affects only a section of his workforce, the workers affected contact the union and demand that action be taken.  The employer may refuse to discuss the issue with the trade union official and a work to rule is called by the union to bring the employer to the negotiating table.  Such action will not be possible without a secret ballot of all the workers employed in the company and not those affected by the change in their conditions of employment. I suggest that by denying the discretionary powers of unions to instruct their members following consultations, the Minister is making it unnecessarily difficult for trade unions to respond quickly to situations without having to resort to a secret ballot.  What I have in mind is that a limited form of industrial action, excluding strikes, should be possible provided a secret ballot is conducted within seven days of the commencement of the action.  Effectively this gives a reasonable and limited discretionary power to trade unions to take reasonable action.</P>
    <P>On the proposals in section 19 to limit the employer's use of <i>ex parte</i> and interlocutory injuctions, the Labour Party welcome this initiative as overdue. However, we believe it has to be amended to cover third parties seeking injunctions and not just to employers who are a party to a dispute.</P>
    <P>We have major reservations on two points with respect to the provisions relating to the Labour Court.  First, the repeal of section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 takes away the Labour Court's right to intervene on its own initiative in industrial disputes.  The court can then only intervene after the commission has <Col N="769" /> requested it to do so, though if both parties request it can still intervene under section 20 of the 1969 Act.  I understand that the Labour Court has seldom intervened in disputes on its own initiative and has done so effectively when it has invoked this power.  Section 18 of the 1969 Act should be retained.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is to be given the power to require the Labour Court to intervene at his request.  This power also extends to the commission.  While it is reasonable that the Minister can either ask the commission or a third party to investigate a trade dispute and report to him, it is not a useful power for the Minister to have unless he wishes to be seen to intervene in industrial disputes.  I am not trying to score points off the present Minister and I think his intervention on many occasions has been extremely helpful; in particular, he intervened very effectively in the ESB dispute.  The Minister has been quite effective and I give him due credit for that.  However, if he wishes to retain this discretionary power, it should be balanced by at least one of the parties to the dispute indicating they would welcome the intervention of the commission or the court.  Otherwise there is a real danger that expectations will be built up that it is the Minister for Labour's job and not that of the commission to monitor industrial relations developments. I am sure the Minister is aware of the dangers involved &mdash; that if conciliation talks fail one or more parties to the dispute may turn to the Minister to intervene directly.  That would undermine much of what is hoped to be achieved through the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section on codes of practice. We all know that in well run employments, agreements are honoured.  What I would like the commission to do is pioneer &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; codes which would have industry-wide acceptance.  In a number of spheres of employment, statutory codes of practice may prove essential, not only for the protection of the employee concerned, and here I am <Col N="770" /> thinking of the case of the contract-cleaning workers, but also for the employer who honours agreements.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments of Deputy Barnes.  It is very heartening to see the definite shift of the Fine Gael Front Bench in this regard.  It is pre-Tallaght. We have in Deputy Barnes the remnants of the Just Society.  I do not use the word &ldquo;remnants&rdquo; in a derisory sense.</P>
    <P>The provision for issuing a ministerial order on a code of practice does not amount to an enabling provision for the Minister to issue a statutory code of practice.</P>
    <P>I suggest that where a voluntary code of practice has been agreed by a majority of employers and unions in an industry but is completely ignored by a minority of employers, then the businesses and pay and conditions of the majority should not be undermined by the minority.</P>
    <P>A reserve power to issue statutory codes of practice is necessary, and its very existence could prove a useful stimulus for voluntary codes to be observed.  I sincerely hope the Minister will take into consideration some of the points I have made and will take the initiative and introduce them by way of amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a good deal of philosophy and theory about industrial relations and I, too, hope to engage in some philosophising.  Of course, industrial relations do not necessarily always follow the theory, and disputes occur or are threatened for a range of reasons ranging from bugging devices being found behind the radiators in a workplace to the very isolated case of the trade union boss who cannot resist an employer's bottle of wine and promises more than he can deliver.  That is not to say that it is not necessary to look at the theory that supports the framework the Minister is trying to advance in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I start my assessment of the Bill from the recognition that conflicts of interest between workers and employers are inevitable but, unlike Deputy Barnes I believe that conflicts do not necessarily <Col N="771" /> manifest themselves in the form of industrial disputes.  Conflicts of interest between employer and employee are often no more than symptoms of deeper conflicts which arise from many injustices caused by the inadequacies of our economic and social structures.  Often the collective bargaining system becomes the battle ground where inadequacies in our social and economic systems are fought out or where they erupt into open warfare. It is often our outdated social and economic structures which generate conflict in the workplace and which continue to make industrial disputes inevitable. Thus, we can see the importance of industrial relations procedures and practices for the economic and social development of the country and for the welfare of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Even in the changing work environment of today workers generally have only their labour with which to bargain. Any further shift in the balance of power in favour of employers would only foment unrest and lead to greater frustration and alienation.  Any increase in restrictive legislation will only lead to a deterioration in industrial relations.  Therefore, reform of our industrial relations system must be accompanied by a genuine commitment to real changes in the power structures of our economy.  As Deputy O'Sullivan remarked, there is a remarkable degree of convergence between Deputy Barnes and myself on that.</P>
    <P>Why should workers who are over taxed and underpaid believe that reform of industrial relations procedures arises from a genuine concern for the economic and social development of the country and the welfare of the community as a whole?  Even benign reform will probably mean more strictures, more tightening of procedures, more rules and regulations and perhaps a diminution of traditional rights and entitlements.  In return, will they be given some say in decision making in the workplace?  Will they be allowed share in expanded profits?  Will their pay restraint be translated into jobs for their unemployed brothers and sisters?  How <Col N="772" /> do they know that their co-operation will be for the welfare of the community?  Will the broad culture of our society begin to reflect more accurately the reality of working life so that we can begin to tackle more effectively the inevitable problems associated with it?  Are these all matters that we can put on the back burner once the trade union leaders' assent to certain reforms has been secured?</P>
    <P>Not even the union leaders in a static society can guarantee the continuation of the unprecedented period of industrial peace now on record, which we all welcome. Workers are not fools.  They know that we have been through a horrific recession.  They also know that while workers and their families endured cutbacks and sacrifices, others got wealthy over the same period and that we are now witnessing an unprecedented profits boom.  Where are the jobs the union leaders told them &mdash; and I include myself here &mdash; would be created in return for wage moderation?  It would be foolish to think that such unrequited selflessness will continue for another three years.  Therefore, we need more than reform of our industrial relations system to win the voluntary allegiance of trade unionists.  The outdated social and economic structures which generate conflict in the workplace and which continue to make industrial disputes inevitable must be tackled as well.  All in this House, without exception, would like to see industrial conflict minimised.  Even those of us who refuse to believe that all our interests are identical or that we are all in this together, or that the earth is flat, believe that the political rather than the industrial arena is the place to contest differences.  I am in this House because I realise that the trade union movement alone cannot deliver political change but I recognise the importance of good industrial relations for wealth generation and, I hope, a better standard of living for all our people.  I recognise the positive contribution collective bargaining makes to the resolution of most industrial relations problems and I believe that any strengthening of the cornerstone of our industrial relations system is to be welcomed.  Does <Col N="773" /> this Bill achieve that objective?  I intend to return to this.</P>
    <P>Our complex system of collective bargaining and trade union organisation has developed as a response to a variety of political and social economic forces over which we have had little control.  Since the traditional role of our trade unions has been defensive, our bargaining systems reflect, more a reaction to our uneven economic development than any deliberately created bargaining system. This was recognised as far back as 1975 in a Johannes Schregle report, which an ILO consultant, was required by Congress to prepare for them.  In the report Schregle said, in talking about our industrial relations system in this country.</P>
    <P>It is not the result of a deliberate decision, nor is it the result of a logically and rationally thought out plan. It is rather the fruit of a long struggle among different forces, some of which were purely political and some of which had their origins outside this country.</P>
    <P>Of course the law and the Constitution provide the general framework within which our system functions but, in reality, the usual practices of employers and trade unions have developed more from the practical local needs than from any central guidelines.  Indeed many existing practices and written agreements have grown out of dispute settlements and reflect all the unique circumstances of particular disputes.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to repeal in its entirety the Trades Dispute Act, 1906. Tens of thousands of trade unionists in this country want the law to intrude as little as possible into the collective bargaining system.  This attitude undoubtedly has its origins in the days when the law was used to persecute trade unionists and prevent them joining trade unions. As my former ITGWU colleague, Naomi Wayne, remarks in her book <i>Labour Law in Ireland:</i></P>
    <P>The early unions had to face attacks from all sides.  They were subjected to a stream of anti-union legislation, first from the Irish Parliaments and, from <Col N="774" /> 1800 onwards, from the British Parliament. Meanwhile, the judges, in addition to enforcing these anti-union acts developed their own common law prohibitions on union activity.  Trade unions, by their mere existence, were declared to be common law criminal conspiracies.</P>
    <P>At the cost of considerable sacrifice and with great personal courage workers eventually won the right to join unions as a result of the Trade Union Act, 1871. However, this was not the same as conferring the right to strike.  Subsequent to the 1871 Act, workers were still convicted of the common law crime of simple conspiracy. This meant that they committed a crime simply by combining to take strike action.  Workers won from Parliament in 1875 a limited freedom to strike in the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act which abolished the common law crime of simple conspiracy. A strike thereafter would only be a criminal conspiracy if the participants committed acts which would individually have been unlawful.  Not for the first time the Judiciary continued for a quarter of a century thereafter, notwithstanding the 1875 Act, to find ways to penalise trade unionists.  Probably the 1901 judgment in the Taff Vale case is the most celebrated. The employees of the railway company went on strike against the victimisation of a colleague.  The company were awarded damages but the judges declared that an employer injured by industrial action was not restricted to suing his workers &mdash; who had no money anyway &mdash; but that they could instead seek damages from the union.  In other words, the judges handed the employers a legal method of breaking a trade union which was far more effective than jailing a few of their members. The ensuing outcry eventually lead in 1906 to the enactment of the Trade Disputes Act.  In the election which preceded that either the newly born Labour Party or the Liberal Party had a poster which showed a judge handing a whip to an employer which pretty much summed up the climate of that time.</P>
    <P>If we intend to buy the Trade Disputes <Col N="775" /> Act a great many trade unionists throughout the country would want us to bury it with some ceremony because, despite its restrictions, it has served them well. Indeed millions of trade unionists in Britain, for example, would hold a similar view; of course that was before the advent of Thatcher.</P>
    <P>The Trade Disputes Act removed a number of obstacles in the way of lawful strikes, among them simple civil conspiracies, which was a new method devised in the Quinn -v- Heatham case to circumvent the previous 1875 Act.  It made it easier to picket lawfully and it provided that, where it could still be shown that the law had been broken, an employer could only sue the workers or union official involved, thereafter it would be impossible to sue a trade union for calling or supporting a strike or any other form of industrial action.</P>
    <P>It is sufficient tribute to the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, to note that despite its shortcomings, three quarters of a century later, no parliament including this one has made any significant improvement on the rights it conferred on working people. I do not believe &mdash; and I will argue this later &mdash; that the 1989 Industrial Relations Bill brings such improvements.  Of course in Britain the arrival of Thatcher and Tebbit has brought only restrictions and regression.  There have been only two developments in this area in Irish law since then; the right of workers to form trade unions was written into the Constitution in 1937 and that has since had implications for the legality of the closed shop.  The Trade Union Act, 1941, as amended in 1971, restricted the right to negotiate wages and conditions to two types of organisations, authorised unions and accepted bodies.</P>
    <P>These Acts have the effect of limiting most of the protections of the Trade Disputes Act to authorised unions and their members only.  I conclude, therefore, that it was the intended effect of the Trade Disputes Act to keep the law and the judges out of industrial relations.  Use of the law in the preceding century had failed to prevent workers joining unions <Col N="776" /> and indeed use of the law against workers often inflamed rather than resolved disputes. It is worth making a relevant quote from Wedderburn &ldquo;The Worker and the Law&rdquo; in support of that argument.  He said that most workers want nothing more of the law than that it should leave them alone.</P>
    <P>To what extent, therefore, will the Bill we are considering today, which is designed according to the explanatory memorandum &ldquo;to bring about a better framework for collective bargaining and disputes settlement&rdquo; contribute to keeping the law and the Judiciary out of industrial relations?  I do not anticipate any real improvement although, like all trade union officials, I welcome section 90 of the Bill which terminates the ability of employers, so disgracefully abused in the past, to approach judges over the corn-flakes to get <i>ex parte</i> injunctions.</P>
    <P>First, it is evident that since the enactment of the Trade Disputes Act there has been far less use of the law against strikers.  However, it is also true that the law continues to be an important feature of Irish industrial relations.  In my view there are two reasons for that.  The first is that there are deficiencies in the 1875 and 1906 Acts and, secondly, there is a residual lack of sympathy on the part of judges with the spirit of those Acts, Neither the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act or the Trade Disputes Act gives any positive right to strike. Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan referred to that in his contribution.  We are all aware that the notion of enshrining a positive right to strike was contemplated during the long period the Bill was in gestation.  Why we did not get such a commitment I am not sure and the Minister did not address that issue.  I should like to ask him to do so when replying.  I have an open mind on the question.  I can see the undoubted benefits that would derive from having a positive right to strike enshrined in legislation. However, it would also depend on how it would be circumscribed in terms of whether from the point of view of working people it would be an advantage.</P>
    <P>The 1875 and 1906 Acts provide that <Col N="777" /> so long as a person can bring himself or herself within the rules they lay down one is protected from liability in common law. Once outside those Acts it is extremely difficult to conduct a strike or picket without falling foul of the old common law prohibition on industrial action.  I should like to quote what my former colleague, Naomi Wayne said in the book I referred to in regard to this.  She said:</P>
    <P>Since the judiciary tend to adopt a narrower rather than a broader interpretation of the statutory rules, it can, even today be difficult to conduct a lawful strike or picket.  It can also be difficult simply to know whether your industrial action is lawful or not.  Predicting what view of the law a judge will take, and how he will apply the law to the facts of your case, is, in the realm of strikes and picketing, little more than guesswork.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces more, not less, uncertainty and in important respects diminishes the rights of trade unionists. It is a characterisation of the Bill that it imposes additional statutory responsibility on workers where there is no corresponding statutory obligation on employers.  There is also evidence of confusion and inability to decide what the objectives are in terms of institutional reform.  As a result it is by no means evident to me that the new institutional arrangements will be any more effective as handmaidens of industrial peace. Indeed, I submit that precisely because of the confusion and lack of clarity contained in the new proposals, and the restrictions imposed on the Labour Court, in all probability the new arrangements, if proceeded with, will be less efficient, less effective, more vulnerable to political intervention and more susceptible to internal disputes within the industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity of the publication of the Bill to say some positive things about its general thrust.  Many of my colleagues in the trade union movement made similar statements at that time.  It is true of that response of the trade union movement, and my response, <Col N="778" /> that they were as much motivated by the success of the trade union movement in keeping certain matters out of the Bill as they were motivated by what is in the Bill.  It is not that I consider that the Bill does not contain measures that I welcome. I commented on them previously but I am availing of this opportunity to comment on the small print of the Bill. On reading that one finds that the Bill is not the benign instrument from the point of view of trade unionists that one might have been led to believe initially.</P>
    <P>The repeal of the Trade Disputes Act, and the re-enacting of the basic formula in that Act where immunities are restricted to persons acting in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute, is generally not surprising and is welcome. However, the courts, as has happened since the 1906 Act, will play a major role in determining the legality of particular disputes.  The courts have taken the view that the immunities conferred ought to be construed in reasonable strictness and given no wider scope than the terms clearly provide.</P>
    <P>It is safe to presume that the courts would demonstrate a similar approach to the provisions of the Bill but there is a number of very different provisions which, regrettably, will invite the intervention of the courts to a far greater extent than has been the position up to now.  Those new provisions, principally in the area of picketing and secret ballots, will broaden the invitation that exists for the courts to intervene.  In that sense, rather than limiting the uncertainty that exists, the Bill increases it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to comment on the fact that the definition of a worker is different in section 8 from the definition set out at greater length in section 23.  I presume that that is not accidental but nonetheless it is central to the Bill for a number of reasons which I am sure the Minister understands.  I should like to refer to the definition of an employer.  The usual definition of an employer is given but added to it are the words, &ldquo;having previously worked for that person&rdquo;.  The Bill states that an employer means:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> ...a person for whom one or more workers work or have worked or normally work or seek to work having previously worked for that person;</P>
    <P>Why is that last clause included since the Bill is, naturally enough, about the relationship between employers and workers?  What happened in the dispute in which I was involved at University College Dublin?  In that dispute the employer was a contract cleaning company. The contractor concerned was undercut in the marketplace &mdash; fairly or unfairly it makes little difference to the argument &mdash; by another contractor who came in and took over the work.</P>
    <P>He refused to employ the people who had been working for the previous contract cleaner.  There ensued a trade dispute, the purpose of which legitimately under the 1906 Act, was to secure employment for those people, and pickets were placed at UCD in pursuit of employment from the new contractor.  In that situation one could not say the people concerned had previously worked for that person.</P>
    <P>As I read this Bill, that kind of dispute would now be illegal.  That raises the broadest possible questions because the whole trend in many areas has been a proliferation of contracting, contractors and contract labour.  On more occasions than I care to recall I was in a situation &mdash; especially in the area of contract security and contract cleaning but in other areas as well &mdash; where all the workers were dismissed because a particular contractor lost the contract and the new employer may have employed only some of that workforce.</P>
    <P>So far as the trade union movement is concerned, people who were working for years at UCD were doing no more than following their work and were entitled to continued employment at UCD, as happened in the case I have instanced, and in several other examples throughout the country.  Contract cleaners come and go.  Contract security companies are undercut by other contract security companies, and it is imperative that the <Col N="780" /> workers, who have been employed there over a long period, would have the right, if necessary, to prosecute a trade dispute to retain that employment.</P>
    <P>What is the position of a prospective employer where somebody takes over a particular enterprise but does not have any employees?  Is he similarly excluded from the terms of the Bill?  Deputy O'Sullivan referred earlier to the Roundabout Limited v. Beirne case where, by taking a lease on the pub the employer could circumvent the terms of the legislation as it applied to them.  I am not exactly clear what the situation is in terms of the categories excluded.  The Bill states that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;worker&rdquo; means any person who is or was employed whether or not in the employment of the employer with whom a trade dispute arises but does not include a member of the Defence Forces or of the Garda Síochána or a person who under a contract for services personally does not work to provide services for another;</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the Defence Forces is a very topical one.  I do not know what discussions may have taken place late at night between the Minister and his colleague the Minister for Defence, but seeing that the existing organisation for the Defence Forces are arguing that 75 per cent of enlisted personnel are now in the <i>de facto</i> organisation, is there any reason they could not have been included within the ambit of this Bill?  On the question of the contract for service, as distinct from somebody employed in the normal contract, I am not sure about the intent here and I confess to not being certain at this stage what is desirable.</P>
    <P>If I look to an authority which I quoted earlier, referring to the old term of &ldquo;master and servant&rdquo; he says that modern usage has gradually replaced the terms master and servant with the more egalitarian employer and employee.  The latter's contract is still usually referred to as a contract of service.  As such it is distinguished from other contracts, such as one of partnership or one in which an employer has work done by an independent contractor.  The difference <Col N="781" /> between the contract of service and contract for services has taxed the ingenuity of judges.  It is often easy to recognise a contract of service where you see it, but difficult to say wherein the difference lies. That is exactly how I feel about it.  On occasion it is quite difficult to make that distinction.  I will be coming back to that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Bill be amended to provide for the situation where a person requires an undertaking, or where an enterprise which had previously been the place of employment, will be deemed to be an employer for the purposes of this legislation.  There is one distinction between the new definition of a trade dispute and the previous definition, which referred to a dispute between a worker and employer or between worker and worker &mdash; the reference to worker and worker has been excised.  If that is motivated by what I think, it is probably a good thing; presumably it relates to the old demarcation disputes. That is the kind of dispute we could well avoid and I would not shed any tears if it were removed.  However, I am less happy about the definition which I think should include a person who does work or provides services for another.  That could be a dubious area of exclusion.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the definition of industrial action.  I do not think there is any set of circumstances where the current definition of industrial action as proposed in the Bill could be allowed stand.  One of the reasons the trade union movement initially welcomed the thrust of the Bill is that there will be a requirement to hold a secret ballot.  No one could take any serious objection to a requirement to hold a secret ballot before a strike is called.  Indeed, this has been the practice of the major trade unions for many years.  The problem is that the definition of industrial action goes far wider than just requiring the holding of a secret ballot before workers can withdraw their labour and go on strike.</P>
    <P>There are many forms of industrial action which fall under the colloquial definition of that term and which are endemic to the way business is carried <Col N="782" /> out each day of the week.  It is my experience that workers have sometimes engaged themselves in some form of restrictive practice which has resulted in a speedy and satisfactory resolution rather than in a full-scale withdrawal of labour. Such workers will now be required to hold a secret ballot which, in the nature of things, is entirely in conflict with what I am talking about.  It is just not on that workers with a grievance, motivated by the neglect Deputy Barnes spoke about, should find themselves in a position where rather than engaging in some modest restrictive practice which would result in a speedy and satisfactory resolution they will be required to hold a secret ballot which will come under the definition of industrial action.  What I am referring to here is an overtime ban, a work to rule, a refusal to undertake certain duties or to handle certain goods which have been blacked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  That happens in the normal course of events. I am not sure from whom the Minister has taken advice on this one but he can have my advice free for what it is worth. All he is doing is inviting a rash of unofficial disputes.  That would be the outcome if this definition of industrial action is enshrined in the law.  If a requirement to hold a secret ballot is imposed, then the inevitable result will be unofficial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one studies the nitty-gritty of the Bill one finds it is a lot less favourable from the trade union point of view than first thought.  For example, in a trade dispute is it contemplated to outlaw the normal solidarity action of another group of workers who refuse to handle blacked goods?  That would represent a serious diminution of the right of working people and would be a serious adverse reflection on the principle of solidarity which exists among trade unionists.  In my view such a provision would prove unworkable.  This matter will obviously feature on Committee Stage.  The last thing that one <Col N="783" /> wants to be seen doing is opposing the desirability of holding secret ballots but if the holding of a secret ballot is required to meet every grievance which manifests itself in the workplace we will be inviting unofficial action.</P>
    <P>The effect of the section on picketing will also be quite different from what one might have first thought.  We might as well call a spade a spade and concede that the trade union movement heaved a sigh of relief when they discovered we would not be going down the Thatcher-Tebbitt road in terms of secondary picketing. I concur that this would seem to be, at an initial glance, a far more benign construction and does not absolutely rule out that possibility but when we study it the position does not turn out quite like that.  Secondary picketing will be allowed in the circumstances set out in section 11 (2) which refers to a case where the secondary employer has acted in a way calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting the employer who is a party to the trade dispute.  We should note it does not say it will be legitimate in a case where an employer has acted in a way calculated to frustrate the strike which alone would invite the intervention of the courts in terms of what could reasonably be construed as an action by another employer calculated to frustrate the strike but it is all the one phrase.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;by directly assisting&rdquo; I suggest will be a lawyer's paradise.  When the trade union movement realise exactly what is intended, they will adopt a very different view from the one of &ldquo;how fortunate we were to escape the Tebbitt solution&rdquo;.  Apart from the difficulty in interpreting the wording and the fact that so many disputes will end up in the courts, it will be a requirement not only to show that an employer is out to undermine the strike but also that he is doing so by directly assisting the employer who is a party to the dispute.</P>
    <P>For example, let me go back to the UCD case.  What is the situation there? An employer went in there and did fundamental irreparable damage to the <Col N="784" /> strike and was obviously undermining the strike but was not assisting the other employer directly or indirectly.  There is any number of such examples of that kind of thing.  He was not calculating to frustrate the strike by directly assisting the other employer.  He did not give a damn about the other employer; he wanted the business for himself.  That is a major alteration in the law on picketing. What, for example, would be the circumstances if we had another postal strike which, I hasten to say, I am not advocating?  If we have another postal strike and one of the private courier services decides to deliver the packages or post around the city, they are certainly undermining the strike but they are not assisting An Post directly or indirectly.  I do not know whether this is because it has been inadequately thought out or because there is a calculated attempt by the Minister to impose on the trade union movement shackles that they may not initially have seen.  Certainly it amounts to serious restrictions on the right to picket.  The two examples I have given are of cases that have actually happened and in future it is probable that in the event of such a dispute in An Post one would have more competition from the private courier service or, in the case of a dispute in CIE, one might well have PAMBO or the private hauliers coming to take the opportunity to get a slice of the action and in that case one could hardly say that they are assisting CIE or Iarnród Éireann, but they are most emphatically undermining the strike.  In those circumstances there is a very serious restriction in the law on picketing.</P>
    <P>There was no restriction on the premises which could be picketed nor was there any restriction on who could make up the picket under existing law and, in the nature and structure of a modern economy, this question of the place of picketing is likely to become more contentious. I must say I am alarmed that it should be sought to impose greater restrictions on who may make up a picket line than has been the practice or than has been imposed by the courts.  There have been no such restrictions within <Col N="785" /> reason in the existing situation and, where the courts have seemed to regulate it, it has been because of isolated incidents of alleged violence on the picket line or harassment or nuisance, or whatever and the courts have regulated it in a reasonable manner, confined it to a reasonable number of picketers at any given time, conducting themselves in a certain fashion, peacefully picketing and so on; but there have been no restrictions as is envisaged here.</P>
    <P>Let me ask the Minister, for example, what would be the situation as it refers to the Dunne's Stores disputes.  There was a dispute which all parties in this House have lauded from time to time, an unselfish action taken by a small number of workers on a principle they deeply held.  It is a principle that recommended itself to all sides of this House and many of us found ourselves on Saturdays picketing with these workers outside the local Dunne's Stores.  What would be the situation here?  As I read it, the picket line may not be augmented by employees or workers other than employees of the employer with whom the dispute exists. I consider that is a completely unreasonable curtailment of trade union rights. There are several examples of where that provision would impose unreasonable restrictions.  In the case of Dunne's Stores there would be a public outcry if a bloody-minded employer, as very well could happen in that particular case, found now that he had the protection of the law and could have recourse to the courts to restrict that picket line to four, five or six employees directly employed by Dunne's Stores.  There would be a public outcry in this city if such a legal imposition was acted upon.  It would be completely unacceptable.  What, for example, would be the case in the kind of dispute we saw a few years ago against McDonald's hamburger joints?  In that situation the issue in dispute was effectively the right to join a union.  I do not know how McDonald's are going to get on in Moscow, but around the rest of the world they are notorious for their anti-union disposition.  In that case unreasonable pressure was mounted on the workforce <Col N="786" /> to dissuade them from joining a trade union of their choice.  In fact it amounted to very ugly pressure on occasions.  A small number of the workers concerned did proceed however to join the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union as it was then.  There is no conceivable way that a dispute could be prosecuted effectively if the picket line was to be confined to the workers of that particular enterprise; it simply would not be possible. Even as it was, where there is, for example, more than one outlet, where it is open for about 16 hours a day, there is no way that a small number of workers could man the picket line except in unreasonable stints.  It has been traditional in the trade union movement, for as long as there has been a trade union movement, that colleagues in the trade union movement would show solidarity in that situation and would share the picketing duties.  That happened in the case of McDonalds.  It happened to no good effect as it turned out but that is not the point.  Other trade unionists manned the picket lines with the workers of McDonalds in their fight to effectively have acknowledged a right they have under the Constitution to join the trade union of their choice.</P>
    <P>This seems completely unreasonable and unnecessary.  Where have the great difficulties been?  It is unnecessary to restrict the picketing to employees of the enterprise directly concerned.  Why do a couple of celebrated cases in the history of our industrial development have to determine the norm of the kind of industrial relations we are going to have? Everybody can remember the handful of bad experiences we have had, but what about all the hundreds of disputes that have happened and have been resolved quickly and peacefully without difficulty? Why should it be necessary to contemplate such a change as is being suggested here?</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose will now be the situation in terms of tradition in certain industries?  It is just part of the industrial landscape that in the building industrial landscape that in the building employer to cause him to employ trade <Col N="787" /> union labour for employment perhaps manned by unemployed building workers.  It has been tested, it is perfectly legal, it happens every day &mdash; let me not exaggerate, it happens frequently &mdash; so is that practice that has become part of industrial relations culture to be outlawed because of this unreasonable restriction? For example, it may be necessary for workers to take such action to ensure that an employer will stay within the terms of an industry-wide agreement, and in such circumstances the picket will of necessity be made up of workers who are not employees of the employer in question. I cannot envisage in the building industry how it will now be possible to prosecute effectively a trade dispute against a contractor or building employer, having regard to the multiplicity of associate companies, subsidiary companies, subcontracting on sites, work at a host of different sites going at the one time and so on.  How is it proposed to be within the capacity of a trade union to prosecute peacefully a trade dispute in such circumstances without being able to enlist the support of other trade unionists, former employees, unemployed building workers or whoever?  It simply would not be possible, and I do not think it has yet dawned what a restriction this would be.  The provisions on picketing here go much further than anything that has been imposed or contemplated by the courts to date.</P>
    <P>As the legislation is currently drafted it will be relatively easy for an employer to defeat a strike by forming a new company and transferring the premises being picketed to that new company.  Because of the definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; referred to earlier the new company might not be regarded as an employer capable of being a party to the trade dispute.  In any event, surely it follows that the workers would no longer be picketing, according to the Bill, &ldquo;a place where their employer works or carries on business&rdquo;.  What is the position of an employer merely abandoning a business, ceasing to trade temporarily or whatever?  I am not plucking all these things out of the air or thinking <Col N="788" /> them up; they are not fantasies.  They have all happened.  I have experienced personally each of the kind of incidents I am postulating here.  I cannot see what is preventing an employer from simply abandoning the business, when the picket could then be stopped by injunction on the basis that the employer no longer carries on business at that premises.</P>
    <P>The wording of this section would also prevent the extension of strike across a number of companies who operate as part of the overall group unless the workers could bring themselves within the ambit of section 11 (2), which relates to secondary picketing, by demonstrating that the other companies within the group were assisting the company with whom the dispute arose.  I believe section 11 (2) will turn out to be a lawyers' paradise.  It provides that: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for one or more persons acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union in comtemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at, or where that is not practicable, at the approaches to, a place where an employer who is not party to the trade dispute works or carries on business if, but only if, it is reasonable for those who are so attending to believe at the commencement of their attendance and throughout the continuance of their attendance...&rdquo;.  Who is to be arbiter of whether the workers concerned had reason to believe at the commencement of the dispute or the continuation of the dispute that that employer has acted in a way calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their own employer?  Sometimes in the nature of things we all know that this is the purpose of the action by the other employer, but some objective yardstick is going to be required by the courts to establish it, and in some cases it can be very difficult to prove.  Workers instinctively know that that is what the other employer is trying to do, and when that employer resorts to the courts that it is going to be a very expensive business.  Of course it will have the effect of trade unions tip-toeing through the tulips very carefully.  Maybe that is the purpose of it and what is behind it, because trade union <Col N="789" /> executives will now have to be very careful indeed about sanctioning disputes and especially about sanctioning disputes in the circumstances envisaged by section 11 (2).  The ability to prove in all cases that the second employer is working to frustrate the strike is going to be extremely difficult.  The court will clearly demand some reasonable yardstick.  We have all heard the classic definition of the reasonable man as being the man on the Clapham omnibus; it can be very difficult and very expensive in a situation like this for the reasonable man to persuade the judge to accept his word but this is the case.  It may well be that this matter &mdash; and I am not committing myself at this stage &mdash; could be dealt with by amending it to read &ldquo;directly or indirectly assisting or taking any action calculated to undermine the dispute&rdquo;.  However, that is something I will come back to on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (3) deals with a situation in the health services.  I do not know why they should have been singled out; all reasonable people would agree that disputes in the health services are, at the very least, undesirable.  Why should it be necessary to insert a subsection that allows for a situation that</P>
    <P>any action taken by an employer in the health services to maintain life-preserving services during a strike or other industrial action shall not constitute action calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action for the purposes of subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister and his advisers why it was necessary to put in that clause? Trade unions voluntarily agree in all situations in my memory to ensure that essential services are maintained in such a dispute.  I look forward to the Minister enlightening me to the contrary, and I wonder why it could not be dealt with under one of the codes of good practice rather than putting in such a clause here? I can see it raising unnecessary problems. For instance, I can see an unreasonable chief executive of a health board or an unreasonable hospital manager using subsection (3) to almost outlaw any given <Col N="790" /> situation.  Indeed, it is very easy in the management of the health services to claim that almost any situation that one finds oneself in is life-threatening or necessary to maintain life-preserving services. There have been some examples in my experience that would not give me any reason for complacency that that will not be the case.</P>
    <P>Rather than inserting such a clause, may I suggest that the Minister drafts a requirement in such a way that the parties, in the event of such a dispute being contemplated, be required to sit down and negotiate the kind of practice that presumably motivated the subsection and would guarantee the provision of essential services during the course of such a dispute and that the outcome of such negotiations between the parties directly concerned be required to go to the Minister for approval.  Where the collective bargaining system is working well, and generally speaking it is working well, the law ought not to intrude unreasonably and the Minister should encourage, with all the means open to him, voluntary agreement between the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>As a result of the situation in the health services over recent years the trade unions themselves have initiated discussions about a situation where it could be contemplated that a no-strike clause could be agreed with the employers in the health services precisely because of the motivation presumably behind this subsection.  Nobody wants to see a strike in a hospital.  There have been disputes which have not exactly been a cup of tea for the trade unions dealing with them but it does presume a number of other things.  I think the way this clause is worded invites difficulties.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (4) states: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for a trade union official to accompany any member of his union whom he represents ...&rdquo;.  If the term &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; is intended to mean what is normally meant, that is, a full-time employee of a trade union, I think it is completely unnecessary.  It is simply not practicable in the world of industrial relations, especially for smaller trade unions, for example <Col N="791" /> who have a great many voluntary officials, to police, administer and run a trade dispute through the use of full-time personnel.  I cannot see any reason that the term &ldquo;trade union official&rdquo; cannot be broadened to include full-time or part-time voluntary activists acting on behalf of the trade union and not give them the same facilities.</P>
    <P>I think I understand why section 13 has been included.  It presumably relates to the contemplated High Court action which never actually took place, but had it taken place I have been advised that in certain circumstances the rights conferred would be unconstitutional.  In that sense I welcome its inclusion.</P>
    <P>If I may, I will deal with the question of the definition of a worker that I referred to earlier, and specifically in relation to section 23.  As I have said, there is a difference in the definition of worker in sections 8 and 23.  Basically, in 1990 it is proposed to reiterate the old definition of worker as enshrined in section 23 and exclude all of the categories listed from (a) to (f).  I wonder if the Minister has given any consideration, seeing that we are engaged in major reform of the industrial relations scene, to querying whether it is not time to make a clean break with the anachronistic paternalism of the conciliation and arbitration schemes of the 1930s.  If we are engaged in major industrial relations reform, why should we seek to deliberately exclude up to 400,000 workers from the terms of the Bill?  Why, for example, could they not be given the option to avail of the rights conferred by this Bill?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with concern the extensive damage caused to public and private property, and the <Col N="792" /> grave hardship inflicted on many families both urban and rural by recent storms, and aware of the failure of Government Departments and local authorities to finance the work needed to protect the communities involved against further storm and flooding damage and coastal erosion, calls on the Government to immediately initiate a programme of action to prevent further damages, and provide the resources to carry out the necessary repair works.</P>
    <P>This motion is tabled in the names of all the Fine Gael Deputies because of the seriousness with which we view this problem and the extent to which people are affected across the country.  Every Deputy is directly affected by flooding and storm damage.  I note there are two amendments tabled to the motion, one from the Minister for the Environment and the other from The Workers' Party in the names of Deputies Gilmore, De Rossa and others.  We do not have any particular difficulty with the second amendment, which is quite acceptable to us.  I will have something to say in relation to the Government amendment at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Since 16-17 December last this country has been besieged by storms and subsequently by flooding.  The result is that extensive damage has been done around the country.  There has been extensive erosion of the coastline and extreme damage in the south and southeast, particularly in Wicklow, Wexford and Waterford.  Substantial erosion has occurred in those areas which calls for immediate remedial action.  The damage in Courtown and Tramore could have serious effects on the tourism industry in the coming season and corrective action must be taken urgently.</P>
    <P>Substantial damage has been done to harbours and piers, especially at Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Union Hall, Ballycotton and Sligo.  The fleets are unable to operate from some of these ports and the boats are tied up in other <Col N="793" /> harbours.  Fishermen are in serious difficulties. Many of them have not fished since the middle of December and are experiencing severe financial hardship. They have all purchased their boats and are unable to meet their major repayments to BIM and other lending institutions.  They are also unable to meet insurance premiums, not to talk about providing a livelihood for themselves and their families.  Extensive hardship is being experienced among the fishing community, which the Government do not seem to recognise.</P>
    <P>There has been flooding in many areas across the country and thousands of acres are under water.  It would do the Minister and his colleagues much good if they were to use the Government jet to fly at low altitude across the country and find out what proportion of it is under water.  A conservative estimate is that about 60 per cent of the country is under water.  Towns are flooded which were never flooded in the past.</P>
    <P>I should have said at the outset that I would like to share my time with Deputies Deasy, McGinley and Nealon, if that is in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Deputy.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Rural dwellings are under water which never before experienced flooding and the extent of storm damage in rural areas is very significant. Extreme hardship is being experienced by rural communities and residents of some smaller towns and villages. To date the Government have not responded or shown any recognition of these problems.</P>
      <P>Due to the extensive flooding of land farmers will have to keep stock housed for much longer than anticipated and they have not the fodder and the preparations made to meet this crisis.  Extensive areas of the midlands are flooded, as are areas in the Barrow and Blackwater valleys. There is no recognition of the hardship people are experiencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the Government's response to date.  They have allocated £1 <Col N="794" /> million to local authorities for damage to roads and bridges as a result of the storm on 16-17 December.  The Minister for Finance announced the allocation of £900,000 to be used on the north beach at Arklow, but the local authority must match that money pound for pound.  They are finding it very difficult to raise the money.  The interest on the loan they would have to raise is far beyond their capability to meet.  The allocation is of little use to the local authority in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>During his budget speech the Minister for Finance announced £100,000 for the repair of damage at Kilmore Quay.  This is chicken feed and will not cover costs arising from the damage there.</P>
    <P>The biggest laugh of the lot was the cynicism of the EC Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry, in stating that he would give £120,000 to help defray the cost of agricultural damage as a result of the storms and flooding.  That was an insult to the entire agricultural community.  The Commissioner, as a former Minister for Agriculture, should know better than to insult the Irish people by such a mean offering.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a ministerial committee was announced in this House about two weeks ago.  The committee are to examine the problem and decide what needs to be done.  We on this side of the House can clearly identify where the damage is and have a fair idea of its effect, yet four or five Ministers with the backup of their respective Departments are still assessing the damage and what needs to be done.  The Minister has an opportunity to announce tonight what the committee have established and what positive action they intend to take.</P>
    <P>The Government failed abysmally in their application for EC Structural Funds to make any application for funding in respect of coastal erosion.  That was remiss and inept of the Government and very unfortunate for people living along the coastline whose livelihoods and homes are under constant threat.  The Government failed to recognise that fact and ought to make a submission to <Col N="795" /> Europe in that respect.  The Government must act responsibly.</P>
    <P>I am taking this opportunity to ask the Government to recognise and tackle the extensive damage caused to public and private property and to recognise the hardship caused.  The setting up of a Ministerial committee to judge this situation is not sufficient.  What is needed is constructive action to alleviate the hardship and to provide protection against additional damage.  I call on the Minister to provide funding for urgent repairs to protect our coastline in vulnerable areas and to keep harbours and piers operable so that the fishing fleet, if these storms abate, will be able to operate from their respective harbours.  The Government must prepare a national strategy for coastal and inland waterways protection works.  The Government must anticipate and plan for a recurrence of these disasters. We need a long-term action plan. The Government must provide for emergencies such as those we have witnessed in recent months.  The 1963 Act is totally out-dated.  In the case of an emergency, under this Act the Department of Finance can provide 50 per cent of the money needed but the local authority has to match that.  However, all local authorities are operating on a shoestring and cannot match any funding.  The Government must present a well documented case to Europe for Structural Funds from the £3.5 billion which has not yet been allocated.</P>
    <P>The Government should, with insurance bodies, the local authorities and the EC provide national insurance cover for storm and flood damage and for other natural disasters.  This has not been seriously examined by Government in the past but we as an island nation have a responsibility to protect our people as far as possible.  We need some type of insurance funding.  In certain circumstances private enterprise could be included in this insurance scheme.  Such schemes exist in other countries.  In the US, in Florida, for instance, there is an insurance scheme to cover tornadoes and in California there is one for earthquakes. <Col N="796" /> The insurance stocks change in the Wall Street market from time to time given the disasters that occur.  We should seriously consider a move in that direction.</P>
    <P>The homes and properties of many vulnerable people have been seriously affected by storm and flood damage. More vulnerable people should be compensated so that they can at least make their homes habitable.  I am referring to people who cannot afford insurance to meet natural disasters.  Farmers have been seriously affected and farmers particularly in the disadvantaged areas whose lands have been extensively flooded should be provided with fodder for stock.  When we were in Government and Deputy Deasy was Minister he provided a fodder scheme in difficult times. The present Minister should immediately introduce such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister arrange with the EC for an extension of the closing dates for the various fishing species to give fishermen an opportunity to make up for lost time when, due to storms they have been unable to earn money and are not in a position to meet repayments.  I also call on the Minister to put in place a proper air-sea search and rescue service.  Storms and flooding can result in loss of life and we should do everything to protect life. Now that the European Commissioner has indicated his willingness to locate such a service in Ireland it is opportune for the Minister to extend the hand of goodwill and co-operate with the commissioner in arranging to have that service located here.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>It is important for the Government to take my proposals on board as our economy is at risk and the long-term effect of the storms will be increasingly evident later on in agricultural output, in tourism, in fish catches and so on.  The overall loss to the country could be quite substantial.  The Government can take protective action.  Many will say that it will cost a lot, and I estimate that it will cost in the region of £40 million to take corrective action, but a stitch in time saves nine and unless preventive and corrective action is taken, in a year or two <Col N="797" /> from now, we will be in a worse position and perhaps unable to meet the difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The scope of the motion before us has increased considerably since I originally tabled a motion together with some of my colleagues early in January. That motion alluded to the damage to the coastal installations of the south coast and the south-east coast.  However, because of subsequent storms there has been damage to virtually all our coastline, particularly the south-west and the north-west and there has been serious inland flooding.  Rivers like the Shannon and the Blackwater have overflowed and caused tremendous damage.</P>
      <P>I am extremely alarmed at the indifference of the Government.  They ignored the fact that a serious problem existed for over two months.  The first acknowledgment we have had that there is a problem was when the Government announced the setting up of an all-Cabinet sub-committee last week, two months after that devastating storm on the night of 16-17 December.  I would go so far as to say that somebody will have to die before the Government will take decisive action.  They seem to think that by ignoring the problem it will go away.  Well, it will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said here before and was ejected from the House for it, that the sea defences on the south coast and on the south-east coast are ruined.  They are shattered and if there is one further south-easterly storm we will have a catastrophe on our hands.  There could well be serious loss of life because in some areas there is no protection left at all for villages and towns.  Bulwarks, sea walls, piers, promenades, sandhills and so on which were protecting some areas up to 16 December, have been decimated.  The only bit of luck we have had is that there has not been a further south-easterly gale since 16 December.  That is extraordinary because, on average, there is at least one such gale every month, indeed may be one every week.  We have not had one since 16 December but when we do have a bad one everybody in this House &mdash; and <Col N="798" /> in the country &mdash; will know all about it because in some areas there are no defences left.  There have been breaches in embankments and sand dunes and it is only a matter of time before the sea breaks through with &mdash; I hope I am wrong &mdash; catastrophic results.  In 1953, England, in East Anglia, people did not have adequate protection; they did not think they needed it, but 400 people were drowned in one night when the seas broke through the embankment.</P>
    <P>The seas have breached the embankment in my constituency and in neighbouring Counties Wexford and Cork.  It is only a matter of time until we have follow-up storms which will cause massive damage.  Towns like Tramore and Dungarvan and villages like Ballycotton, Ardmore and Bunmahon are extremely vulnerable and the Government will have to take action.  I do not know where the money will come from but I hope the Minister for the Marine will tell us.  It will have to be a significant amount.  The Waterford county engineer estimates that it will cost £11.5 million to do a reasonable job to protect the coastal community.  If you include Kerry, Cork, Wexford and Wicklow, you are probably talking in terms of £50 million.  I know the Government cannot produce that much money out of a hat overnight but they must recognise the seriousness of the problem and make plans to see that money is provided from the EC or the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Coastal Protection Act, 1963, is not worth the paper it is written on because it demands that the local authority put up 50 per cent of the cost of coastal protection work.  As we know, local authorities and county councils do not have any money of significance; they can mend a few potholes and cut a few briars but they do not have the money to do what is needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an extraordinary statement in the House last week in answer to Dáil questions.  In answer to one question he said he knew that the 1963 Act did not fit the bill, in other words, that it is useless.  However, in the next sentence he said he did not propose <Col N="799" /> to change existing procedures.  The Minister admitted that the Act is useless but then said he does not intend to do anything about it.  For God's sake, let us have an admission that there is a massive problem.  Let us have an admission that the Act, which is supposed to help us solve it, is useless.  Let there be an initiative to see that it is replaced by something worthwhile and which we can use to protect our communities.  That is all we ask.</P>
    <P>There have been all sorts of statements from various Ministers, even one from the Taoiseach.  Three weeks ago the Minister for Tourism and Transport washed his hands of the whole matter.  I could not elicit a reply from him in the House. Last week I had a question tabled to the Taoiseach and it was not answered.  I was told it had something to do with a printer's error and that it could not be answered.  Nobody wants to say who will provide the money and when.  Everybody is running away from the problem.  Will someone tell us what is happening?  The Minister for Finance cut loose in Cork the weekend before last.  We all heard about his Kanturk statement.  A headline in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> told its readers that the Minister for Finance had said there would be plenty of money available from the EC or the Exchequer to deal with the problem but nothing has been said since.  There has been a deafening silence on the issue of the damage done on 16 and 17 December and the Government have collective responsibility in this matter to see that the money is provided. When we had Hurricane Charlie about four years ago Government Ministers were queuing up to have their photographs taken and to be seen on television.</P>
    <P>When we had Hurricane Charlie about O'Leary's snow blizzard in 1982 we had the same masquerade, purely because those events happened in or around Dublin.  However, if anything happens in Waterford, Cork, Kerry or the west coast the authorities in Dublin do not want to know about it.  It is a disgrace.  Central Government, my eye.  As far as I can see, all that central Government means is that <Col N="800" /> if it does not happen in Dublin it has not happened.</P>
    <P>If there is a catastrophe or a disaster of the type to which I referred earlier it will be the fault of Government because we have had two months inaction.  The people in my constituency are outraged at the lack of action on the part of any Minister or the Government.  These are not people directly in the firing line but they all know what happened.  We did not even have one Government Minister in County Waterford to see the damage. They are expected to run the country by remote control.  I doubt if a Minister has visited Cork or Kerry either.  Perhaps they went as far as Arklow or Courtown.</P>
    <P>We want answers here tonight and tomorrow night as the public and our constituents are entitled to them.  I hope the Minister for the Marine will tell us if the Government have any plans in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for giving me some of her limited allocation of time.  It is appropriate that we debate this matter in the House because, even as I speak, 20,000 homes in south-west Donegal are still without electricity.  When I left at 6.30 a.m. a blizzard was raging in south-west Donegal and all those homes were cut off.  That is not an isolated incident, it has happened half a dozen times since the beginning of the year.  Indeed, I must compliment the ESB crews who are out morning, noon and night carrying out repairs in spite of all the hazards.  Unfortunately, no sooner are the repairs carried out than the gales or lightning again strike and they are as badly off as ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today 1,000 islanders &mdash; the inhabitants of four islands in Donegal &mdash; have been cut off from the mainland.  We are used to Tory Island being cut off but Aranmore, where they have a fine ferry which makes six or seven trips every day to and from the island, has been cut off all day.  I was in touch with both islands this evening and the situation has not changed from early this morning.  A mail-boat is scheduled to go to Tory Island twice a week but since last Christmas it <Col N="801" /> has succeeded in going there only twice. I know that people on that island depend on social welfare and unemployment assistance and some of them have been waiting four, five and six weeks for their money.  Indeed, I understand that arrangements were made yesterday to have the Army helicopter go to Tory this afternoon but, due to the gales and storms, they could not manage it.  The inhabitants of the island are running out to basic foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to recent storms and Deputy Deasy recalled the storms that occurred last December.  I should like to tell the House that the storms that have hit the north west were as bad as the storms that hit that area on 16 and 17 December.  I should like to refer to another problem facing those living on Tory Island.  It concerns the storms and coastal erosion.  From the reaction of the Government one would imagine that the island was a solid rock in the ocean and that coastal erosion would not take place. In the past the inhabitants of Tory Island got their domestic water supply from the south lake on the island but over the years, particularly in the last three years, the salt water has succeeded in getting into the lake.  The result is that the water of the lake cannot be used for domestic purpose.  Pipes, electrical appliances and other utensils corrode in no time through the use of the water from the lake.  The people of the island must look for a domestic water supply elsewhere on the island.  They have directed their attention to the north lake, but, unfortunately, that goes dry every summer.  The only solution is to construct a proper reservoir on the island.  It is important that the people of the island get an adequate supply of domestic water.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn highlighted the plight of fishermen in recent weeks.  Due to the storms in recent months fishermen have been unable to get to sea.  We are almost into the third month of 1990 and the fishermen of Bunbeg, Burtonport and other ports, have been unable to get to sea.  Some of the big trawlers operating out of Killybegs have succeeded in going to sea but those in other areas have been <Col N="802" /> unable to do so to earn their livelihood. In the past when farmers and others suffered heavy losses successive Governments went to their rescue.  There was national and EC assistance for those farmers.  They deserved that assistance and the grants made available to them kept them going.  I wonder why fishermen are not assisted when they suffer heavy losses.  Why is it that the Government, and the EC, do not come to the assistance of fishermen, their crews and those employed in the processing factories on the mainland?  Those people are finding it impossible to make ends meet.  They do not have any income and have not had any since the beginning of the year.  If we can help other sections of the community when they are in trouble I do not see why we cannot help fishermen and those who work in processing factories.  Fishermen are often forgotten.  They are constrained and restricted by quotas, the price they must pay for fuel for their boats and so on.  We should produce a package of assistance for them because they must meet repayments on their boats.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion is galloping in Donegal. We have heard of it creeping in other areas but that is not the position in my county.  I was on the golf course on Cruit island in the parish of The Rosses on Saturday week and I noticed that due to coastal erosion one of the greens is ready to fall into the Atlantic.  That is one of the most spectacular courses in the country, work on which was completed in the last two years.  Adjacent to the green is the slipway that serves Owey Island. The road to that slipway which was used by tractors and cars has fallen into the sea.  One can only approach that slipway from the sea or by walking.  It is useless and I have written to the Minister and the Office of Public Works asking them to repair that road.</P>

      <P>I note that £1 million was made available to deal with coastal erosion and the protection of sea walls in <Col N="803" /> the south east.  I do not begrudge them that money and I accept that they have problems but people in other parts of the country have problems, particularly those in the north west.  I suggest that an immediate survey be carried out in Donegal to ascertain where the most serious damage has occurred.  Whatever money is available should be earmarked for that work because if things continue as they have been going our coastal protection will be swept away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Deputy Taylor-Quinn for giving me some of the time allocated to her.  She feels passionately about this subject and she could have used all the time allocated to her but she has given me an opportunity to bring home to the Minister, and the ministerial committee, with all the emphasis at my command, the desperate plight of the people living around the Sligo coastline.  Damage there was not only caused by the recent storms, bad and all as they were, but was the cumulative result of successive pounding of the coastline in recent years.  I am now talking of one area, or of a section of the coastline.  From Enniscrone away to the west, an area that the Minister knows well, on to Mullaghmore in the north, there have been many disasters.  The latest occurred yesterday at Gibraltar, near Strandhill.  The sea has swept away the natural and man-made defences along that coastline.  The result is that when a moderate storm blows up those areas are subject to flooding from the sea.  Severe damage is caused when storms blow from the west or north west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often in a county like mine fields along the coast are the most fertile of all but fields that were once the best in the country have disappeared entirely under water or under tonnes of stones swept in by the sea.  A couple of weeks ago I inspected one of those fields in Pully-heeny, a 28 acre field.  It is now a vast lake, beautiful to look at, and, perhaps, to fish in but it is not suitable for cattle grazing.  The approach road to Pully-heeny pier has been covered by tonnes <Col N="804" /> of stone and rubble from the sea.  That pier used to cater for 15 boats during the fishing season.</P>
    <P>On Sunday last I went to Raghly and discovered that the peninsula would have become an island were it not for the preemptive action of Sligo County Council. I inspected the work with local county councillor, Joe Leonard.  Sligo County Council, who are responsible for a small area of coastline, spent in the region of £30,000 to prevent a disaster.  I do not know where they got the money from but their action was essential.  That is an indication of the amount of money that is needed to help coastal areas.  I accept that it will be difficult for the Minister, or any local authority, to find the necessary finance but, as Deputies Taylor-Quinn, Deasy and McGinley have said, the money will have to be found.  The problem will not go away.  Sligo County Council, and other local authorities, cannot cope with coastal erosion or storm damage.</P>
    <P>I accept that under the 1963 Act local authorities must provide half of the necessary finance but I should like to ask the Minister where would Sligo County Council get £10 million, or £5 million or £1 million.  That type of money is not available to local authorities to do other work.  We must take action to compensate farmers who have lost their land. In that respect I should like to remind the Minister that Deputy Deasy, when he was Minister for Agriculture, made such areas eligible for what was described as dry land reclamation under which farmers were given grants to remove the stones from their land.  That was an imaginative scheme and the Minister should consider re-introducing it.  I understand that £120,000 has been given by the EC Commission but that would not pay for the cleaning up after all the damage that was done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn has outlined very cogently the steps the Government should be taking to compensate farmers and others who have suffered losses as a result of storms.  There must be fire brigade action to help the people.  It is important that there should be a coastal and <Col N="805" /> headland strategy.  I should like to remind the Minister of the problems that have arisen along the Owenmore and Arrow rivers.  In good times those rivers cause extensive flooding.  When in Government I tried to have those rivers attended to under the arterial drainage scheme but I failed.  I approached the Government about the matter but they postponed the issue.  I appeal to the Minister to remind his colleague who is responsible in that area.</P>

      <P>First, I reject the suggestion of complacency or neglect on the part of the Government with regard to the damage that has been sustained in the storms.  Second, I want to state that those of us who are involved in this area accept full responsibility, do not want to slough responsibility, accept it fully and will act upon it.  I thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for some constructive ideas in her contribution. I am sorry to hear that Tory has been isolated for six weeks and I hope that relief will be available to Tory and Aranmore very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have taken over responsibility for coast protection from <Col N="806" /> the Office of Public Works since 1 January last &mdash; less than two months ago. The Office of Public Works had a budget for that purpose of between £100,000 and £150,000.  The large figures that have been bandied about here were not available to OPW and are not available, as of now, to me to deal with this particular situation.  I accept what the Deputies have said that the damage caused on 16 and 17 December was massive but the House knows very well that since then, that has been added to considerably and we are still not free or clear of the storms.</P>
    <P>I went to Bray and to Arklow and the Minister of State at my Department went to Kilmore Quay as a result of what happened in mid-December.  We did not have any cameras.  King Canute was trying to keep the sea back in a rather helpless way, but King Alan Dukes obviously wanted to keep it back with cameras.  There were no cameras on my parade but Deputies from all parties helped me to see what was wrong particularly in the Arklow, Bray and Wexford areas.  A 50 per cent grant to Wexford County Council for the pier at Kilmore Quay was the immediate result of those inspections, and that was given within 24 hours of the inspection.</P>
    <P>As has already been acknowledged by Members from the opposite side of the House, the Minister for Finance provided £950,000 assistance for coast protection for the north beach at Arklow.  I inspected that area and saw there was grave danger to industrial plants and to dwellinghouses and, as Deputy Deasy stated in other connections, the total defences had been wiped out by the 16-17 December storm.  As well as that, I indicated that £100,000 would be available for boat repairs at Kilmore Quay.  I should also like to put on the record that the people who are replacing boats there may very well be able to get Economic Community aid as well in that regard.</P>
    <P>As I said the storms continued throughout February and we then had to take further action.  A ministerial committee &mdash; a crisis committee &mdash; was set up.  There was no neglect, there was no delay and there was no lack of realisation of the <Col N="807" /> seriousness of these storms in my Department or in the other Departments involved.  Because there were so many Departments involved, a committee comprising the Departments of the Marine, the Environment, Agriculture and Food and Finance was set up.  Our brief from Government was to report urgently.  That has been adumbrated by what I said in my amendment.</P>
    <P>Prioritisation of schemes also has to be determined.  In order to do that we have set in train a comprehensive report on what has happened around the coast.  I utterly reject any suggestion that we have neglected any of the coastal areas that are affected and for which I have responsibility.  For example, in the Wicklow area a survey was done by a combination of local authority engineers and engineers from the Department of the Marine of Bray, Kilcoole, Dunmurray, Wicklow, north beach Arklow, Arklow, south beach.  In Wexford the following areas were surveyed: Courtown, Ardamine, Cahore Beach, Cahore Harbour, Ballyconnigar, Ballinesker, Coolrainey, Rosslare Strand, Ballytra, Kilmore Quay, Ballyteigue Burrow, Cullenstown and Fethard.  We have a comprehensive report and figures for all those areas. That is the kind of raw material we are putting together and every one of the places in Sligo that Deputy Nealon mentioned have been covered in that report.</P>

      <P>It is important to distinguish between coastal erosion from storm damage and coastal erosion which is an ongoing concern of anybody charged with this responsibility.  So far as storm damage is concerned that is quite a distinct thing and most of that report is concerned with storm damage.  We have already indicated that £950,000 have been made available for works on the north beach &mdash; that is to deal with coastal erosion which is an ongoing problem in that part of the country, in Wicklow and Wexford in particular.  So far as the storm damage is concerned, we are covering piers and harbours for repairs, small scale remedial works on walls and coastal defences.  The coastal protection is on a larger scale and is a different proposition altogether and that is the one for which some money has been made available. Coastal protection is a highly skilled <Col N="809" /> engineering job; it cannot be done by the seat of his pants, so to speak.  Structures are important.</P>

      <P>Civil engineers who are practised in coastal erosion erect certain types of structures on the coast.  Beach nourishment is another method, and this has been used at Rosslare for many years in what is a very highly specialised engineering activity.  There was a lot of caterwauling here about local authorities but the primary responsibility is still on local authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the 1963 Act.  I agreed with him already in the House that it is not a very useful weapon but it was the only weapon available since 1963 for the purposes of coastal protection. It is a complex Act but I am sure the people at Rosslare Strand; at the Murrough, County Wicklow, at Moville, at Strandhill &mdash; in Deputy Nealon's constituency &mdash; in Youghal, in Rossnowlagh and Enniscrone who had substantial works done under that Act would agree that it was useful as far as they were concerned but the problem is that it is a long drawn out process.  It takes too long and therefore is not really suitable for emergencies, as I have said.  If Deputy Deasy thinks that, since taking responsibility for this area on 1 January this year I could have put new legislation on the Statute Book he is not as shrewd a man as I used to think he was though I still think he is a shrewd man.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to EC funding. Arising out of the damage done in December, very early in January I made application to three different sources in the EC.  Somehow or other I find it difficult to understand how scorn can be poured over the £120,000 which the Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, has made available.  I do not know if more money will be made available from the EC for this purpose but I hope there will.  I do not consider it right that the sum of £120,000 amounts to an insult.  I know the Deputy was only repeating what the Leader of her party said in that regard but Pooh-Bah was the kind of person who accepted that kind of insult.</P>

Secondly, with regard to herring, the Celtic Sea fishery has been closed because they have caught a huge amount for which they got very high prices.

      <P>I join with the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, in rejecting the assertion from the other side of the House that the Government are not doing what they should be doing in relation to the problems which exist at present.  I am sure the Deputies on the Opposition benches realise and fully appreciate that wind storms and flood damage are a hazard during most of our winters to a greater or lesser extent.  If we look back over the pages of history and in particular over the past ten years, we will find that there has been the odd winter when we had severe flooding and wind storms when damage was done but we must realise that the location of dwelling houses and farm buildings in vulnerable areas exacerbates that problem.</P>
      <P>Various reports have indicated that farm houses and outhouses in the basins of a number of rivers have been affected by the storms between the end of 1989 up to the present.  There is no doubt that the reports in many instances have not been as accurate as they might have been in relation to the extent of the damage caused.  The reality is that farm dwellings and outhouses and other dwellings adjacent to river basins have to put up with the problems of flooding and wind storms. Farmers in these areas have had to learn to live with these problems.  Inevitably there will be exceptional years when they will be overwhelmed.  We all dearly wish to be in a position where we can exert absolute and complete control over flooding and wind storms but the reality is that that is not possible.</P>

    <P>On Saturday last I had the opportunity to travel from literally one end of the country to the other, from Dundalk to Cork.

      <P>I am not saying that problems do not exist in either County Donegal or County Waterford but we have to put this matter into context.  I am talking tonight from an agricultural perspective. The reality is that our farmers realise that adequate and quality housing is of the utmost importance.  There has been considerable investment in proper housing for stock during the winter months. However in different parts of the country farmers for one reason or another did not make the investment in quality housing for stock which is so necessary.  On farms where stock roam across the grazing lands and where grass growth is retarded subsequently in the following spring, a very strong argument can be advanced that the economic damage done in those circumstances is far greater than the damage that will be done over the shorter period because of flooding.  While I am on this point let me also say that quite generous grants are available to farmers to invest in farm out-offices and farm buildings to house their stock during the winter.  I take this opportunity of exhorting them to consider immediately making investments in this most important of areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that there are a number around the country who have not realised the importance of making this investment.  Subsequently, the management of their farms and the grazing routine in the subsequent spring, summer and autumn is adversely affected because the stock are free to roam over the lands. I am looking forward to the investment that is needed in this area being made to come to terms with the problem.</P>
      <P>The Deputies on the other side of the House can rest assured that the Government are concerned about the problems arising from the recent bad weather which has been unusually wet with persistent windy conditions over the past month in many parts of the country.  As an expression of that concern, the Taoiseach recently announced the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee consisting of the Ministers for Finance, the Marine, the Environment and Agriculture and Food to examine and report on the extent of the impact of the recent storm and flood damage as a matter of urgency.  We can all appreciate the problems caused by the recent flooding and, as a Government, we are anxious to help. The various Departments have the appropriate expertise to assess the different types of damage as well as considering means of alleviating the hardship caused.  My Department are carrying out an extensive examination of the situation in the agricultural sector.  This is being updated on a daily basis and we also have the benefit of an input from farmers and other interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest reports indicate that there is no serious widespread damage in so far as crops and livestock are concerned.  As far as can be judged, the only significant stock loss to date has occurred in the north-west.  There are severe cases of isolated flooding in parts of the country, particularly in the midlands, the south-east, the south-west and the north-west. It will not be possible, however, to assess the extent of the damage in the agricultural sector until there is some abatement in the present climatic conditions. Certainly there has been some loss of fodder and some farm buildings have <Col N="815" /> been damaged, particularly in parts of the west and midlands, but it does not appear that the damage is widespread even in the regions I have mentioned. That is not to say that the losses may not be serious for certain individuals.  In a situation like that there will always be individual cases where the losses will be much more severe than for others.  Even where there is not significant damage, having to live in an isolated area confronted by widespread flooding can be an extremely traumatic experience.</P>
    <P>I am certainly not trying to minimise the seriousness of the situation in which many farm families and others in rural Ireland find themselves.  What I am saying is that the extent of the damage to fodder supplies and buildings cannot be fully assessed at this stage.  The evidence so far is that the damage is not widespread, while livestock losses have been small.  I stress this is on the evidence so far but the situation is changing by the day as the stormy wet weather continues. It is, therefore, essential that the extent and nature of the damage be quantified and this can best be done by utilising all relevant State Departments and agencies as well as local authorities.  Voluntary organisations and bodies representing the various interests affected have scope for an input into central planning.  In addition, they are using their skills, resources and local knowledge to cope with these serious weather problems.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems do not involve significant long or short-term damage but rather the practical difficulties of coping with widespread flooding and disruption. This is where co-operation between the public and the voluntary agencies on the ground is essential.  The House can be assured that the Cabinet sub-committee are actively applying their mind to the problem as it exists and as it is unfolding. This debate is being held at a time when we cannot anticipate when the storm will abate but we will endeavour to help as best we can in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I feel there is a certain whingeing from the Opposition benches who are effectively using the misfortune of those <Col N="816" /> affected to make cheap political points&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Ferris, O'Shea and Howlin.</P>
      <P>The recent disastrous storms which brought severe flooding to many parts of the country, particularly the southern, south-eastern and western areas also brought with them a taste of future weather patterns if we are to believe our weather experts for now it seems that in this part of Europe we are in the path of future storms which will inevitably bring gale force winds, driving rain and consequent flooding and high tides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent storms hit people very badly.  Not alone did they do damage to farmlands and the agricultural sector but they have had a devastating effect on urban areas, on our coastal communities, and have caused massive problems for local authorities throughout the country. County council officials are still counting the cost and there is still the possibility <Col N="817" /> of severe weather to come which makes the coming weeks a matter of serious concern for both the public and private sectors.  In the agricultural sector experts believe that over 3,000 families in the catchment area of the Shannon are affected, with disastrous consequences. In Cork the River Lee has overflown its banks and has caused severe hardship for many.  It is the same picture throughout the country; in Tipperary and Carlow rivers have burst their banks and have flooded land and high winds have damaged property and machinery.</P>
    <P>While some of these losses may be recouped from insurance sources, it is the owners who will have to pay in the long run through higher insurance premia.  If the meteorologists are correct in their predictions, it is quite on the cards that insurance premia will sharply increase in the coming years and this will have a serious effect on those struggling to make a living at present.  While this damage is considered very serious, and in some quarters insurance assessors are considering themselves very lucky that it is not more serious, it is to the local authorities, the ESB and Telecom Éireann that the most serious damage has been done.</P>
    <P>Cork city and county estimate £5 million in infrastructural damage including damage to sewage pumping stations, sea walls, roads, piers and coastal defences. In Waterford coastline damage is reckoned at £11 million.  It is safe to say that from Galway to Wexford, from Waterford to the Dingle Penninsula and from Cork to Donegal serious damage has been inflicted on private and public property.</P>
    <P>While some may shrug off this disastrous situation as an act of God which could not be helped, someone somewhere must pick up the tab.  Local authorities already experiencing severe financial constraints in their everyday operations cannot foot such a massive bill.  Already many local authorities have cut back on necessary roadworks.  Our roads are a mass of potholes.  Dykes remain choked and overgrown and the <Col N="818" /> road surfaces in many cases leave a great deal to be desired, to say the least.</P>
    <P>The long hot summer, which was very welcome, also had its effect on our roads. Tarmacadam melted and in many cases the recent severe rains washed any temporary improvements away.  It is now accepted that on very many of our secondary roads and even on our main roads there are treacherous stretches which are terribly dangerous to everyday users. While we heard much emphasis placed by Government on bringing our roads up to European standards, the fact remains that for many motorists the recent storms and flooding mean that our roads have taken on a prehistoric image.</P>
    <P>Ireland, being an island nation, should have a more positive attitude to coastal protection and Government should have a comprehensive policy to see that our fishing ports and harbours are properly protected and that damage done by recent storms is not a burden on local ratepayers.  The bill for such damages should be paid from Community funding. It is ridiculous and disgraceful to suggest that just over £120,000 was all Ireland was entitled to under these circumstances. Our fishing industry is now at a standstill with hundreds of boats tied up around our coast.  Since last November the fishing industry has been devastated with losses estimated at between £10 million and £15 million.  A knock-on effect of such a serious situation is that something like 4,000 families have been without a regular income for nearly 12 weeks. When one considers that bills and rising mortgages have to be paid and loans have to be met, surely for many thousands affected this terrible weather and its aftermath constitutes a disaster.</P>
    <P>Ballycotton pier in County Cork is in a collapsable condition.  Renard pier in County Kerry has been declared unsafe due to storm damage.  Union Hall, one of the main fishing ports in the south, has suffered over £200,000 worth of damage and serious damage was done to other coastal protection works in the region &mdash; Tragumna, Bantry.  Castletownsend, the list goes on.  The overall damage to fishery harbours is estimated at around <Col N="819" /> £3 million in south and south-west Cork alone, and there is no possibility whatsoever of Cork County Council, already starved of finance, footing this bill.</P>
    <P>Holiday resorts around the south-east, south and south-west coasts have been seriously damaged and will cost thousands of pounds to rectify, yet what we are offered is a pittance considering the damage done.  One can only wonder if, in the event of Dublin sustaining the same type of damage, Government Ministers would be so lackadaisical in demanding aid from European funding.  The Government have targeted the tourist industry as a prime area for job creation and possibly with our scenery and much publicised clean environment we can attract into this country many thousands of people who would give the economy a much needed boost, but what will we have to offer them this year?  Potholed roads, washed out bridges and derelict harbours, certainly not the image we would like to portray to our potential visitors. There is now an urgency that remedial work be carried out so that the disastrous effects of recent storms and the hardship many thousands of our people are experiencing be alleviated.  Ireland's position on the periphery of Europe means we are probably more prone to this type of storm damage than most other countries in the Community, and if the forecasting experts are right provision must be made so that Community funds are made available in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated recently that special funding would be available from Europe only in the event of a major disaster such as an earthquake or a hurricane. I suggest respectfully to the Minister that for many people, including local authorities, the recent storms have had a similar effect.  The tenants of the Riverview Estate in Blarney in my constituency had flood water flowing in through the front doors and out the back doors destroying carpets, furnishings and electrical fittings.  Now these tenants, many of them unemployed, are taking the council to court seeking to recover some of their losses.  For them and many <Col N="820" /> like them the recent storms have had disastrous consequences.  Their houses are devalued and their contents ruined.</P>
    <P>This motion before the House will have my support because if nothing else it will highlight the plight of many thousands of our citizens who through no fault of their own have suffered severely.  It would appear at this time that the Coalition Government have no interest in seeking finance or aid from the Community to try to help them through a very difficult period.</P>
    <P>It is important in this debate to pay tribute to the many workers &mdash; local authority, ESB, Telecom Éireann, the fire service, ambulance crews, gas workers, search and rescue, the lifeboat service, our Naval Service, the Army, the Air Force and the many voluntary organisations &mdash; who worked, very often in appalling conditions, to save lives, rescue the injured and restore services.  The country is indebted to them.  Often the heroic efforts of these people go unnoticed.  Is it too much to ask that their efforts be complemented by adequate resources from either national or European funds?  This country in the last few weeks has been buffeted, battered and beaten.  Serious damage has been done to our roads network.  Our land is completely waterlogged, our coastal defences have been breached and major repairs are needed to our harbours.  The Government must act now to tackle this disastrous situation because for many people time has run out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to share time with my colleague.  Most of the debate has concentrated on coastal regions as mentioned in the Fine Gael motion.  Whereas we all agree that our coastal regions suffered tremendous buffeting damage affecting fishing and ports and the livelihood of fishermen, tremendous damage has been done throughout the country, right down through the heart of Ireland.  I was surprised to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, say tonight that in his pleasant travel from Dundalk to Cork he <Col N="821" /> passed through Tipperary and saw no sign of damage.  He is like any fine weather politican.  If you come out when the floods are over you will not see what happened, but I wish that on 8 and 9 February he had visited any part of South Tipperary and see at first hand the damage done to the heart of County Tipperary, the Golden Vale, the heart of our agricultural land, the mountain region of the Galtees, the basin of the rivers Arra, Aherlow and Suir, culminating in flooding stretching from Bansha to Clonmel such as had not been seen by anybody, engineers or others, for the past 20 years.  Cars were submerged, as was seen on the national TV network, to such an extent that there was loss of life, limb and property. Tremendous damage was done throughout the region.  On the night we mentioned the matter here on the Adjournment &mdash; the Leader of Fine Gael had a further Adjournment debate a week afterwards &mdash; we itemised and spelled out for the Government what they should do in response to a demand for urgent funding.  On that night the Minister fot the Environment said the funding he had made available was as a result of damage done in October 1989 and December 1989 and the only hope he could hold out for us was that the additional funding he had already indicated to local authorities could be used in the interim.  Immediately I contacted my local authority in South Tipperary and notified them that they could start to spend some of the money that was intended to be spent throughout the full year of 1990.  I was told it would not suffice to take account of some of the damage done.  We identified ten days ago that £300,000 worth of damage was done in the South Riding area.  Since that figure was submitted at the request of the Department a similar amount of damage has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have set up a special committee to examine what they should do to address the problem, but committees are no good unless they come forward with reassurances to county managers, members of local authorities, county councils and <Col N="822" /> urban district councils that specific funding will be earmarked to address the problem of storm damage whether on agricultural land, to business property, private property or private dwellings or particularly dwellings where old people are incapable of meeting the demands that will be made on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to the Adjournment Debate on that night said &ldquo;There are of course, as the Deputies fully appreciate, limits to the area of my responsibility and to the funds at my disposal...&rdquo;. Our problem with the Minister's response is that he has said there is a limit to the funds available to him. The Minister said in column 1229, volume 395 of the Official Report that &ldquo;there are no funds available to me to compensate for any damage caused by the storms to private properties&rdquo;.  The Minister expected that everybody would be insured for this catastrophe, which may well be the case for business premises but may not be the case for poorer people. Again I quote the Minister from column 1232, Volume 295, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>In the EC there is such a thing as disaster funding but it was never intended to be used for localised disruption of this kind.  It is for disasters such as earthquakes and avalanches or disasters of that dimension.  The amount of the fund is very small but if I thought there was a bob to be got for this kind of damage I would look for it.</P>
    <P>Tonight the Minister for the Marine has said that Commissioner MacSharry has been generous.  We have been told by one Minister that there is no funding from Europe, yet another tells us there is.  Will the Minister come clean and say whether the Government or the Community will put up the funding to meet this problem. We, as local authority members want to know how we can address the problem. If a tree on private property falls on to the public roadway who is responsible for the damage to property or the unfortunate loss of life?  At present the local authorities are identifying the trees which <Col N="823" /> in their opinion, on the advice of the forestry section of the Department, are dangerous, and the trees are then marked and the landowner informed that the marked trees are dangerous.  If such a tree were to fall from private property on to the public roadway and damage property or kill a person, will the Government say who is responsible?  It is a straightforward question we need a straightforward answer.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the flood, storm, wind damage where signs and roads are damaged, we at least want to know who is responsible when a tree falls from the constitutionally protected private property on to a public road for which we all feel a responsibility.</P>
    <P>With your permission, Sir, I would like to share the balance of my time with my colleagues, Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Howlin, who both represent coastal regions.  However, I wanted to put on record that the heart of Ireland suffered during these storms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this problem tonight, I would like to refer to the national plan for increased Structural Funds which was submitted by the Government to Brussels for approval. One remarkable feature of the proposal was that there was very scant provision for coastal erosion.  In the south-eastern region, from Wicklow Head down to Wexford and into County Waterford there is an ongoing and dramatic problem with coastal erosion, yet there was very little provision made for it in the submissions to Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst of the damage to the coastal regions happened in mid-December.  It took six weeks before the Cabinet sub-committee was set up.  We welcome the fact that some action is being taken but we want more than just an appraisal, we want money to carry out the work.  One of the major problems is what has happened to the local authorities over the past three years.  They have been denied £160 million which was due to them and as a result the local authorities are in no position to respond to this kind of <Col N="824" /> problem.  For instance, in County Waterford, a sum of £20,000 was provided for coastal erosion this year, but the mop-up operation in the aftermath of the storm cost £60,000.  I come from one of the towns most affected, Tramore.  The storm wall is very badly damaged and will cost at least £65,000 to repair, that is if it is not damaged to an even greater extent in the weeks ahead while we await Government action.  However there is an ongoing and more serious problem in Tramore, that is the problem with the sand dunes.  At the neck of the sand dunes nearest to the town of Tramore, there are only 70 metres between the high water mark on the front and back strands. If on the night of 16 and 17 December the high spring tide had concided with a northerly rather than a south-easterly gale, the water would have broken through from the back strand to the front strand, rendering the sand dunes an island.  They would have been eroded quickly and we would then have had the problem of the sea attacking towards the town.  If this had occurred the whole area would have been destablised.  The slob lands on the back strand of Tramore are of national importance as a bird sanctuary. If the mud flats were covered over by sand the feeding ground for the birds would have disappeared and a very important asset for tourism in the area would have been lost.  There is a major problem, as I found out when people came to me in the aftermath of the storms of 16 and 17 December.  Years ago when there was a wreck on the strand of Tramore I found out that when it comes to the removal of wrecks no one is responsible and we face the very same problem now.  Constant coastal erosion is now the problem of the Department of the Marine since 1 January 1990.  However, no major coastal erosion project was carried out since 1981 while responsibility rested with the Office of Public Works. The problem is that the Government did not view coastal erosion seriously.  As I said this was proven earlier when they submitted their plans to Brussels to avail of the increased Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> They have now set up a Cabinet sub-committee but one of the best ways of kicking a problem to touch is to set up a committee to discuss it.  Nobody on the Government side has said that money will actually be provided and that there will be real money on the table to tackle the problem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, talked about the effects on the farming community.  In fact there is a farm of 180 acres adjoining the back strand of Tramore where the dyke was breached and the land is now completely and totally flooded by salt water.  A great deal of money has been spent on reclaiming this land.  If the money needed to repair the breach in the dyke had been available to the local authority, the problem could have been dealt with at a much earlier stage.</P>
    <P>Before I give way to my colleague, Deputy Howlin, I will conclude on this point.  Tourism in Tramore, Bunmahon, Ardmore or other places in County Waterford are very much contingent on immediate funds being made available. The Government can have all the subcommittees they like and discuss the problem all they like but it is action and the allocation of money that we need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I had skipped to section 23 of the Bill and I appreciate that some of my colleagues have indicated they would wish me to be as brief as possible.  I will try to comply with that wish.</P>
      <P>Section 23 sets out the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; and more specifically it deals with the categories of employment that are exempted.  I was querying the Minister as to whether in the context of such major industrial relations reform he had given any thought to the desirability of rationalising this matter once and for all by including these workers within the remit of the various C and A schemes, or at least giving these workers the option of access to the machinery this Bill puts in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is divided counsel within the public service unions on this question but more and more the view is emerging that at least they ought to be given the option of availing of the machinery &mdash; the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and very specifically the Rights Commissioner.  This view has accelerated since the Government now seem to believe that they can take action if necessary to abrogate awards under the arbitration scheme by bringing legislation into this House to set aside such awards or delay their implementation.  Many workers now covered by the conciliation and arbitration schemes see little point if Governments can take that action.  It certainly highlights the unfairness of the view on the street that there is some special arrangement for public servants because of the existence of the C and A scheme which gives them some kind of unfair advantage.  If the Government want to create a de-industrial zone around the public service they ought at least to provide public servants with the procedures that could facilitate that objective.  I would especially make a plea to the Minister to give access to the rights commissioners to this category of worker.  It is a major bugbear.  I cannot conceive of any reason for opposition to it.  The rights commissioner is a sensible, flexible institution that has done untold good in industrial relations.  I do not <Col N="827" /> believe people other than practitioners of industrial relations appreciate the good work and the record of rights commissioners. Endless disputes have been resolved in an amicable fashion through the sensible approach of competent rights commissioners.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that section 23 names psychiatric nurses as a category to which the Bill will apply but excludes general trained nurses.  I know the background and why that is the case, but I suggest it is entirely anomalous in 1990 that we should have one provision for psychiatric nurses and a different one for general trained nurses, especially in an era when the traditional distinction between the two categories of public servant is being blurred.  The anomaly is even more crazy in that it perpetuates a distinction between nurses who are employees of a health board hospital and nurses who are employees of a voluntary hospital or hospitals in the private sector. It is unsustainable to continue that kind of distinction.  I will try to communicate to the Minister the urgency and desirability at a time of such friction in the health services of giving access to general trained nurses, at a minimum, to the rights commissioners.</P>
    <P>General trained nurses are now joining trade unions in their thousands.  Traditionally they had a staff association, a matron dominated, inhouse arrangement. That very staff association, the INO, has been accepted into the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  If it had not been accepted, its declining base would have declined further as SIPTU and the LGPSU recruit more and more general trained nurses.  It is such an irritant in the system that no matter how minor or petty the grievance of a general nurse on the wards, there is no machinery to enable here to have her grievance dealt with in a fair fashion.  Matrons are the last remnants of an authoritarian style of management which has died out elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that if there is one single category of worker in the health services who is stretched to the limits of human endurance and bears <Col N="828" /> more than her fair share, it is the general trained nurse.  I am not making a party political point about cutbacks.  I am talking about the daily task of the general trained nurse.  I do not know how many of us would be able to perform those duties.  We owe a great debt to general trained nurses and the least we should be prepared to do is give them access to a rights commissioner.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point before Committee Stage, when I intend to put down an amendment to give them such access.</P>
    <P>We have a very good example of extending the rights commissioner facility outside the particular category of general trained nurses.  Let me refer to the ushers' dispute in this House recently. What better example could have fallen into my lap?  Here we had a disciplinary dispute but there was no access to any machinery to resolve it.  Eventually common sense prevailed and the dispute ended up being resolved at precisely the kind of forum that would have resolved it initially or would have never allowed it to happen if the ushers had access to a rights commissioner.  The rights commissioner system is invaluable and the ushers' dispute in microcosm demonstrates the importance and value of that institution and why the scope of those who may resort to it ought to be broadened and why public servants generally ought to be given access to a rights commissioner.  Sometimes these disputes can become intractable as a result of not having access to that kind of machinery and sometimes the more intractable they become the more they become a vicious circle.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>I would also query, although the Minister says that further legislation is contemplated on this, whether it might not have been useful to include a reference to part-time workers in section 23 (1). I referred earlier to the desirability of perhaps now addressing the topical question of the Defence Forces, and I will let the point rest at that.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the setting up of an industrial relations commission and <Col N="829" /> this is fast acquiring the status of something like Knock Shrine and one dare not even question anything that might arise about it and about its contribution.  We are all in favour of good and against evil and it is apparently not proper to even suggest that this might be less than the ideal solution or that it is not quite as thought out as it might be.</P>
    <P>I noticed that in the functions of the labour relations commission, A, B and D are functions that will be directly carried out by the staff.  That presumably means that C, E, F, G, H and I will be done by someone other than the commission staff.  Does it mean that the commission will carry out these functions, some of which are very onerous?  I ask that question very deliberately because my understanding is that the commission will effectively be made up of six part-timers and a full-time chief executive cum chairman, at least initially and perhaps permanently. We have six part-timers taking on what seem to be very onerous duties indeed.  It will certainly not be a situation where the appointment of jaded industrialists or retired trade union officials will be called for.  A retired trade union official deserves his retirement and ought to be left rest in peace.  Certainly, having regard to the parameters of this labour relations commission I do not see how part-timers with a full-time chief executive can carry out all these duties.  I am sure the Minister agrees that if the labour relations commission is to realise its objectives, it is imperative that it comprise the most dynamic personnel that can be secured &mdash; people of calibre and experience in the business of industrial relations who will break new ground, who will be pioneers expected to take innovative measures and set out policy, because the Bill does not make any provision that I can see, on how the commission will function in paractice or set out any circumstances in which they may or may not intervene in disputes.  Will this be decided by the commission itself? Are the commission expected to set down these guidelines and this policy?  That would seem to be extremely onerous.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the aspirations <Col N="830" /> that the trade union movement have for this labour relations commission will be entrusted effectively to two part-time trade union nominees who in the normal course of events will already have onerous responsibilities within their trade unions.  I cannot readily see how part-time, busy trade union and business nominees who have other major and primary duties will take this commission by the scruff of the neck and improve on the performance of our existing institutions. Not everything that the Labour Court do is not to be commended.  The Labour Court have acquired a lot of expertise and experience and have full-time personnel and it is not readily apparent to me how a commission of part-timers will improve on the years of expertise and experience accumulated by members of the Labour Court.  It will be necessary for the Minister to change his mind on the question of nominating, in addition to the chairman and a chief executive, two independent members.  It is imperative that the membership be drawn equally from the trade union movement and the employer nominating bodies, with the Minister nominating the chairman.  I cannot see the trade union movement being willing to entrust such a range of responsibilities to two part-time nominees.</P>
    <P>The provision with regard to the Labour Court is interesting, the more one reads it.  There are three instances where the Labour Court may intervene: under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, where the court is asked to make a report by the Minister for Labour of the day on the conditions of employment in a particular industry; under section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, where the court may in exceptional circumstances intervene in a dispute on its own initiative; and of course under section 20 where the union may refer a particular issue &mdash; regardless of whether the employer attends &mdash; and are bound by the outcome of the decision.</P>
    <P>Section 26 seems to reduce the role of the Labour Court to a subordinate position.  Effectively the repeal of section 18 of the 1969 Act will weaken the right <Col N="831" /> of the court to intervene in the kind of cases I have instanced.  Section 26 also provides that, subject to a number of exceptions, the court may not investigate a trade dispute unless it receives a report from the commission stating that the commission are satisfied that no further effort on their part will advance the resolution of the dispute and that the parties to the dispute have requested the court to investigate.  I would be very unhappy with that because I cannot readily envisage a situation where the commission would waive their function of conciliation, say that they have reached the end of the road and that the parties to the dispute should request the court to investigate.  There are &mdash; and will be &mdash; circumstances where the parties will not agree to the matter going to the Labour Court.  It will have gone to the conciliation stage and so on and in a good number of cases the employer would be quite happy to say that he would not agree to the matter going to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act is repealed and the Labour Court will, therefore, no longer be empowered to investigate a trade dispute on their own initiative in the absence of a request from both parties.  I can only conclude that the rôle of the Labour Court will be weakened, certainly in respect of their right to intervene in cases where an employer is not prepared to attend a labour court.  More important, from my point of view, the trade unions will be forced in that circumstance to rely on section 20 in order to get access to the Labour Court with all that that implies. It is an unacceptable situation to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I know that the industrial relations committee are empowered to offer a conciliation service on their own initiative but there is no mechanism whereby an employer who is willing to go to the Labour Court can be forced to do so other than under section 20.  That is an important area which we must address.</P>
    <P>I intend to come back to this point on Committee Stage because some kind of <Col N="832" /> amendment restoring the service offered by section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, in exceptional circumstances will be necessary.  This is probably connected in the Minister's mind with section 24 of the current Industrial Relations Act which gives the Minister for Labour the power to request the court to furnish him with a report on conditions prevailing in any given industry and this has frequently been used by Ministers of the day to get the court to intervene in an industrial dispute.  If anything, the Minister's right to intervene is enhanced in this Bill corresponding to the diminution of the right of the court to intervene. I am not sure if that is a good thing, I think it means that more power will be arrogated to the officials in the Minister's Department.  Undoubtedly, high as my regard is for the officials in the Department, I am not sure that it is desirable.  I know the Department of Labour have long held the view that the powers of the Minister in this regard are inadequate.  I recall that a fairly detailed submission was made to the Commission on Industrial Relations pointing out the Department's unhappiness with the powers of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court at the time opposed any change along the lines which the Department were seeking and made the point that there was no merit in a situation where the court were forced, against their better judgment, to intervene in a particular dispute.  There is a great deal to be said for that view because intervening in a dispute for the sake of intervening is not necessarily desirable. Indeed intevention at the wrong time can do more harm than good.  For example, what would happen if we had a Minister for Labour whose abilities in the industrial relations arena were less finely tuned than those of the present occupant of the office?  Not all Ministers for Labour have the beside manner of the present Minister and their clumsy intervention at the wrong time could do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording that the commission of inquiry into industrial relations agreed with the Labour Court and did <Col N="833" /> not recommend the extension of the Minister's powers.  I would not lightly throw away the accumulated wisdom of the Labour Court in expressing that view. The practise of industrial relations is one thing and the practise of politics is another.  It is not always desirable to remove the power to intervene from the Labour Court and give it to the Minister. I am not happy about that and I should like to reflect on it.  One of the difficulties about the way legislation is scheduled in the House is that although the Bill has been published for quite a while I only got down to examining it very recently, in the early hours of this morning.</P>
    <P>What about the opposite situation where the political views of the Minister were in tune with those of his opposite number in the British Cabinet and where, far from wanting to intervene, he wanted to leave workers out until hell froze over? It is not all that fantastic because if the power structure of the present Cabinet was ever reversed it could well be that one of our colleagues from the Progressive Democrats might want to espouse that view.  They might not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I am making is that it is not desirable that the powers of the Labour Court in this respect be diminished.  I am not arguing that the Minister for Labour of the day should not have a rôle but I do not think this power should be taken away from the Labour Court, or, alternatively, that something like the present section 38 should be accorded to the Labour Relations Commission.  That is an important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister when replying would refer to the purpose of section 41 which states that the Minister may amend or revoke an order made by him under section 8 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1976.  I am curious to know why that provision was included. As far as I know, it relates to the divisions of the court.  The 1976 Act it refers to empowers the Minister to make an order increasing the number of divisions of the court.  As I understand it, there is no specific provision in that Act for reducing the number of divisions of the court.  I do not know if that is what is envisaged by its inclusion in the Bill.  I do not know if the Minister will have the right to reduce <Col N="835" /> the number of divisions of the court when the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I omitted to mention an important point when dealing with the obligation for secret ballots which was to comment on all-out pickets.  All sides of the House will agree that nobody has any objection in principle to the requirement for a secret ballot.  Indeed, it is practised widely in industrial relations at the moment but the extent to which the Minister has carried the requirement for a secret ballot goes far beyond what is required.  What does the Minister consider will now be the position of the Congress all-out picket that has contributed so much to establishing good order in a climate of industrial conflict?  Following on the events of 1969 it must be admitted that the Congress all-out picket has made a major contribution to good order but now it seems to me that the all out-picket is in jeopardy as a result of the measures proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot see but that the all-out picket will become inoperable as a result of the requirements on the secret ballot.  Not only are unions required to conduct a secret ballot before a strike can be called but they must do so before any other form of industrial action.  The manner in which the all-out picket has operated up to now has been that the union seeking the all-out picket ballots its members and its executive seeks an all-out picket.  The industrial relations executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, having heard the case, may grant the all-out picket, although that decision may be opposed by some of the other unions in the employment.  That decision may be made for very good reasons in specific circumstances. However, under the Bill I do not think it will be possible for Congress to proceed to instruct any union to ensure that its members comply with the all-out picket.</P>
    <P>Any trade union official who has learned his catechism will say, when asked this question when recruiting new workers, that in no circumstances will all workers be obliged to engage in a trade dispute if they do not ballot to do so <Col N="836" /> except in the one instance of observing an all-out picket.  That is the only occasion when workers would be directed by their union to support a trade dispute.  As I read it, Congress may no longer give such an instruction.  It is fanciful to expect that Congress could say to the other unions concerned, &ldquo;ballot your members and if you get the necessary answer then they can come out as well&rdquo;.  The whole business of the all-out picket is now up for grabs and I do not think that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Times have changed and the old collective principle that governed trade unions and the strong sense of solidarity is not as strong as it was 50 years ago, or even 30 years ago.  Quite bluntly, there are circumstances where a certain type of worker can only be dragged kicking and screaming in support of an all-out picket but, nonetheless rules are rules and if people want to be members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions they accept the rules of the institution.  The rules of the institution are as I have set down. It seems to me that they will become inoperable now.</P>
    <P>I would like to have dealt with a number of other matters but my colleagues are impatient to contribute to the debate.  I should like to ask the Minister to address himself to the question of how he sees the new machinery he is putting in place operating in practice.  Who will be subordinate to whom?  Does the Minister not think it will invite friction and dispute as between the existing Labour Court, with their good track record, and the new Labour Relations Commission? It seems to me that the provisions of the Bill will diminish the rôle of the Labour Court and that is inviting internal friction. I know the Labour Relations Commission is opposed to subsuming the conciliation service but having thought about it I am not exactly clear on how it is automatically assumed that the conciliation service will perform more efficiently now that it is under the Labour Relations Commission than it did under the Labour Court.  In all fairness, I do not go along with the casual criticism of the conciliation service that seems to <Col N="837" /> have given birth to all of this.  I think the conciliation service has a very good record.  Individual industrial relations officers have applied themselves selflessly to the solution of many difficult disputes. There may well be a case for looking at an in-service training for conciliation officers or industrial relations officers but by and large they have done a very good job.  I would not like us to throw out the baby with the bathwater.</P>
    <P>Many people following this debate more closely than others will want to know, for example, how it is proposed to recruit the staff for the Labour Relations Commission.  I know it is proposed to use the Civil Service Commission but will there be an in-house competition or how widely can staff apply?</P>
    <P>I am also interested in section 33 (3) which states that:</P>
    <P>The Commission may appoint members of its staff, including industrial relations officers, to give advice on matters relating to industrial relations to management and workers or their representatives.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister if that implies a consultancy service &mdash; I am not necessarily saying a consultancy service is a bad idea &mdash; is being established to give advice on industrial relations matters? If so, will it be an industrial relations consultancy service which will charge fees to industry or to whomever for the services being supplied?  How is the budget for the Labour Relations Commission to be raised?  Is it simply through a Vote in this House or is such a clause as that envisaged as making a revenue contribution? Is that service to which the trade union movement would be expected to give its allegiance going to be provided, for example, to non-union house?  It would appear to me that the trade union movement would need to consider carefully the implications of present developments in industrial relations where the entire climate has changed, where the Industrial Development Authority at one time cautioned employers that they were effectively <Col N="838" /> expected to have their workers in membership of trade unions but have now switched the shoe to the other foot and are saying to employers: &ldquo;We will tell you what the situation is in Ireland but whether your workers end up in a trade union has nothing to do with us.&rdquo;  I am not complaining about that.  I do not think it is necessarily the job of an industrial relations authority to perform the functions of the trade union movement for the trade unions but it typifies the change in the climate, where all kinds of new style American fads about human resources and management, open door policy and all that kind of jargon is becoming the norm.  An open door policy, in my experience, often means precisely that: workers who do not like it are shown the open door and they have very little recourse to any remedy.  Are we setting up an institution here that will supply Texan-style union busters with advice on how they can duck their human resources policy and are trade unions expected to give direction on how this can be done most efficiently?  I have some reservations about that and about the implications it will have for the trade union movement in this country in the longer term.</P>
    <P>In approaching this Bill I have taken the old maxim that any good trade union official would take, that when employers start praising you it is time you looked to your laurels.  When the employers made a benign response to the publication of this Bill and I looked at my own similarly benign response, I thought it was time to have another look at it and at the smaller print.  The general thrust of the Bill is positive.  I welcome things which I have not had the time to refer to, for example, the commitment to cause good standards of performance to be coded and to become the norm and which might be availed of in free collective bargaining and so on.  That kind of development is positive.  However, when one gets down to examining the provisions of the Bill in detail any mood of complacency very suddenly disappears.  As I have said, the relatively neutral response of the trade union movement was motivated initially <Col N="839" /> by the general thrust of the Bill, not so much by what is in the Bill but in what they believe they were successful in keeping out of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister on his painstaking approach to ensuring that there was full consulation.  I trust he is not saying to me that the outline of the Bill was made available to the trade unions before it was published.  My understanding and my information is that it was not but that the general concepts &mdash; which I think we would all welcome &mdash; were discussed.  I think also that the trade unions could very easily mislead themselves on the critical question of secondary picketing.  The situation is not as it might appear at first glance.  I have dealt with that at some length.  I do not propose to come back to it now but I will come back to it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned that the Bill goes out of its way to impose new obligations and responsibilities on trade unionists but there is no corresponding obligation or imposition on employers.  Even in so far as the codes of practice, to which I have referred, under section 25 might create obligations on employers they are entirely voluntary, but in the trade union case they are statutorily enforceable. That is a shift in the balance of power and it is an undesirable shift since trade unionists have nothing to trade with except their labour.  I regret that kind of development and the confusion I have talked about in relation to picketing and balloting in particular is likely to invite the involvement of the courts to an extent that is not desirable.  In fairness to my many impatient colleagues I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which I believe is designed to provide a better framework for collective bargaining and <Col N="840" /> dispute settlement.  Indeed it does contain a number of important provisions by way of change in trade union law and industrial relations law generally.  At the outset one might ask why change and reform at all at this time; after all, strikes are at an all time low and industrial peace is the norm.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has led to an unprecedented level of co-operation and consensus at national level.  An argument could be made therefore to leave things alone and stick with the <i>status quo.</i> Incidentally, this is not a view I share.  The Bill before us is designed to make improvements in the law to facilitate the better operation of our industrial relations system through the nineties and beyond.  The prospects for acceptance of these legislative changes is all the better at a time when consensus prevails.  Furthermore, and this is a point the Minister made a few moments ago, the Bill was preceded by exhaustive discussions between the Department of Labour on the one hand and the ICTU and the Federation of Irish Industries on the other.</P>
      <P>Before referring very briefly to the specifics of the Bill I would like to make some comments on the rôle of trade union law in industrial relations.  The present law relating to trade unions is mainly that enacted in the early years of the century at Westminster.  It is in need of review and change.  The Trade Disputes Act, 1906 which was very important in its time provided a framework which allowed trade unions to grow and develop.  However the 1906 Act is still the definitive piece of trade union legislation which governs trade disputes in this country.  The Act as it stands affords legal protection to almost any industrial action taken by a group in a trade dispute and also the funds of a trade union are protected from all actions for damages in tort, a matter which is addressed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be said that time and circumstances have changed since the &ldquo;Strumpet City&rdquo; days.  Today trade unions are relatively secure and are among the more important pressure groups in society.  We live in a highly <Col N="841" /> interdependent society where the degree of industrial interdependence continues to increase.  All this leaves not only the State but also the individual citizen more vulnerable to the actions of trade unions. There are, however, some arguments against substantial changes in the law. Tradition is a powerful force and the traditional relationship between trade unions and the law has been mainly one of non-intervention.  It is claimed that the law, which normally involves penalties for those who do not obey the legal rules, is an unsuitable instrument for resolving the human problems at the heart of industrial relations practice.  There is a lot in this.  In essence we are talking at base about human relations and problems.  I can speak from some personal experience here having been involved in direct negotiations and in particular having been a mediator and arbitrator in labour disputes over many years.</P>
    <P>Trade unions are very suspicious of the law.  Their attitudes have been influenced by the struggle which characterised the days of their emergence in both Britain and Ireland.  In the first instance they had to persuade Parliament to give them legal recognition which they secured as recently as 1871.  Second, they had to cope with a prejudiced Judiciary who chose not to disguise their dislike of trade unions and strike action.  As a result of that early experience trade unions view the law as oppressive and penal.  Trade unions then are against the application of the law to industrial relations partly for historical reasons.  Trade union confidence in the law has also been adversely affected by what trade unions view as the misuse of injunctions in trade disputes by employers supported by court decisions. I am referring of course to <i>ex parte</i> injunctions in particular.  This problem is specifically addressed in the Bill before us but as matters stand legitimate picketing can be halted by the grant of an <i>ex parte</i> injunction.</P>
    <P>It is important to draw a distinction here between trade union attitudes to the law on individual rights as opposed to collective rights.  The individual rights <Col N="842" /> legislation, for example, the Unfair Dismissals' Act, 1977, does not affect the basic principle of voluntarism which underlines our industrial relations system.  Unions therefore are quite prepared to accept a rôle for the law in the case of individual rights but are suspicious for the reasons I mentioned of far reaching legal changes where collective rights are involved.</P>
    <P>Those who would argue for stronger laws than the ones contained in the Bill should be reminded that the vast majority of industrial disputes are settled under the existing system of free collective bargaining by direct negotiation between the parties themselves.  It has to be said that successive Governments have seen their rôle as providing supportive machinery, like the Labour Court, to help the parties resolve their problems when conflict cannot be contained within the voluntary collective bargaining system.  The overriding objective of this Bill as I see it is to effect changes which will improve aspects of our industrial relations systems.  That is what we are at.</P>
    <P>Law is a technique for the regulation of social power but power is unevenly distributed in all societies, not alone in market economies but in all societies. I instance the recent developments in Eastern Europe.  Central to the system of collective bargaining in this country is the balance of power between employers and unionised workers.  The policy of the Legislature over many decades has been to maintain this balance between the collective strength of the two sides.  That was the task which faced the Minister in formulating this Bill.  It is abuses by a minority of either employers or employees or trade unions which can lead to changes in legislation.  The changes in trade dispute law proposed in the Bill are designed to curb the risk of certain abuses.  The Bill in addition aims to expand good industrial relations practices.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the Bill itself and I will be very brief as I want to get stuck into it on Committee Stage.  Let me deal first with the question of the one man picket. The one man picket where it is in breach <Col N="843" /> of agreed procedures and where other workers will not cross epitomises the abuse of power I suggest.  Section 9 of the Bill tackles this problem by providing that immunities will no longer apply to disputes concerning one worker where procedures have not been followed.</P>
    <P>No doubt we will have a detailed debate on secondary picketing on Commitee Stage.  Section 1 tackles the unsatisfactory existing position concerning secondary picketing.  It is my belief that the reason the Minister and the Government had to tackle this problem is that a clearer definition than that provided by the courts is necessary.  Under the Bill the picketing of a second employer will be legal only where that employer assists in frustrating a primary strike.  We can have a more detailed discussion on this matter on Commitee Stage.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Rabbitte, I too welcome the provision on worker versus worker disputes.  As I see it, it does refer to inter-union disputes and demarcation issues. One of the most delicate problems in the area of industrial relations is that of inter-union disputes which I often encountered in my days as an arbitrator.  Right now worker versus worker disputes enjoy legal protection under the 1906 Act. While inter-union disputes have been relatively few in number they can prove very disruptive and costly in financial terms.  They can also act as a disincentive to investment in this country for badly needed jobs.  The ICTU do have internal machinery and do the best they can in the circumstances to help resolve inter-union disputes but of course they are not always successful, not least because one or both parties can reject the congress decision.  Furthermore, there is the additional complication of non-congress unions who are not party to congress machinery.  The Bill addresses this problem by removing immunity from worker versus worker disputes.  I think this is a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the influence of <i>ex parte</i> injunctions in undermining the confidence of trade unions in the law on a historical basis.  The Bill restricts the <Col N="844" /> granting of injunctions in trade disputes. As I said, trade unions have viewed the misuse of law in the case of <i>ex parte</i> injunctions.  Section 19 of the Bill provides that if a secret ballot favours industrial action and the trade union gives at least one week's notice to the employer concerned the employer may not apply to any court for an <i>ex parte</i> injunction without giving notice to the union.  A further merit of this section is that it underlines the desirability &mdash; in this instance the necessity &mdash; of a secret ballot which I believe to be both a democratic and a worthwhile practice.  Overall it seems that this section will redress the justifiable concerns of trade unions over a long period about their grievance in respect of the one-sided <i>ex parte</i> injunction.</P>
    <P>On the question of balloting procedures Deputy Rabbitte correctly pointed out that large unions in particular have secret ballot provisions and exercise them.  The point is that it is not universal practice and it does not apply at all times, but I believe this practice is desirable.</P>
    <P>Again, this is more a committee point that I want to make here but, if I understood Deputy Rabbitte, he raised the question of secret ballots before strikes but disagreed with such ballots before industrial action.  It seems that what the Minister is faced with here is striking a balance between the two sides, the two major interest groups, and that in fact this is a restriction of a type.  It is, however, intended to extend good practice and the law has to be seen to cut both ways, because there are points in this Bill that employers are unhappy with as well.  The Minister is in the middle, acting in the public interest, to strike the best balance he can; and I think he has achieved that. Trade unions, as the Minister outlined, will have two years to give effect to the secret ballot requirement in their rule books and, as far as enforcement is concerned, a union who fails to comply with the requirement of the secret ballot will lose their negotiating rights; this, of course, is a hefty penalty but it is intended to ensure that the secret ballot provision will actually get into the rule books.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> More generally in the area of secret ballots, for which I have long since had a personal preference, secret ballots remove the moral pressure that can be placed on workers when voting by a show of hands.  The balloting procedures in the Bill should act as a stimulus to extending good industrial relations practice and, importantly, will help to ensure that trade union members can vote without interference and be given a fair opportunity of voting, which is a highly democractically desirable thing.</P>
    <P>Turning then to Part III of the Bill on industrial relations generally I think it is worth noting that successive Governments have considered it the job of employers and trade unions to regulate wages, salaries and conditions of employment through collective bargaining and to resolve the differences between themselves. Disputes obviously can arise which are not solved through the collective bargaining process and it would be unrealistic &mdash; here I am echoing something that Deputy Rabbitte said &mdash; not to expect any dispute.  That would be too idealistic as seen.  It was precisely for that reason that the late Seán Lemass, with extensive consultation with both sides of industry, spearheaded the 1946 Act which introduced the Labour Court.  The Labour Court was established in 1946 and the primary intention behind it was to help industry to help itself, not to supplant the negotiating function of either side.  In line with the voluntarism which characterises the Irish industrial relations system, the parties are free to accept or reject the Labour Court recommendations; that is the intention of both parties and that should be continued.  The Labour Court as we know it, despite the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; in its title &mdash; which I think in retrospect may be a bit regretable &mdash; does not enforce law.  Its recommendations are not legally binding, unlike the position in some countries in continental Europe, and it cannot enforce penalties for failure to comply with its recommendations.  What it does have, however, is very considerable moral authority and the combined efforts of its conciliation service.  The court <Col N="846" /> proper has succeeded in setting four out of every five disputes since it was founded in 1946.  Here I would like to join with the Minister in commending and congratulating successive officers of the court since its foundation for the informality and for the sense of humanity and understanding of human relations they have brought to their work.</P>
    <P>Turning to the court's more recent experience, in the seventies there was a significant increase in the number of disputes handled by the court.  The terms of the national pay agreements and national understandings which specifically provided for reference to the court in the case of difficulty contributed to this increased load.  This practice, however, of referring cases to the Labour Court continued into the eighties and there is an obvious need for the parties in dispute to settle their differences directly rather than relying unduly on third party machinery.  The Labour Court, as originally envisaged, was to be a court of last resort and it was assumed that every effort would be made by the parties to resolve their differences through free collective bargaining.  For many years past, however, disputes of a trivial character have been referred to the court for adjudication.  In other words, they get that far, to the ultimate in machinery, which was never intended when the Act was passed in 1946.  The disputes settling machinery provided by the State, therefore, needs to emphasise the responsibility of the parties to make every effort to resolve their differences directly.  This the Bill deliberately sets out to do.  Furthermore, the machinery should assist with dispute prevention as well as dispute resolution and this, too, the Bill sets out to do.  If this can be achieved in our institutional framework, practice and I hope it can, the court's status as a court of last resort will be reinforced.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, in the context of the institutional changes the main proposal obviously is the transfer of existing conciliation services from the Labour Court to the new Labour Relations Commission. This transfer should enhance the authority of the court proper and help to <Col N="847" /> make it a court of last resort.  The main purpose of the commission, however, as the Minister has underlined, will be the promotion of good industrial relations. There is no existing body which has as its main purpose the promotion of good management and trade union practices and which, on a permanent basis, reviews and monitors developments in the area of industrial relations.  Furthermore it will have a research function which obviously, given my professional work in UCD, I welcome in the sense that I believe that research and data collection and so on is a prerequisite for informed policy formulation.</P>
    <P>The new advisory service of the Labour relations commission is a particularly interesting idea and one that I advocated myself in some published work as far back as a decade ago.  It is a fact that both trade unions and employers already receive advice from their national federations, namely the Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers and other employer organisations. What is being proposed in the Bill is the provision of a neutral advisory service which will earn, we hope, the trust of both employers and employees. Another layer of bureaucracy, however, should be avoided and this is a marker I would like to put down at this stage.  It is worth highlighting, however, that in Britain the conciliation and arbitration service ACAS and the labour relations agency in Northern Ireland regard their advisory service as key elements in promoting good industrial relations.  With regard to the reference to other jurisdictions, I do not want to make too big a deal of it, but I think where we can learn from experience elsewhere we should, and adapt where appropriate to our own system, especially now that we are in this review stage.  I feel, however, that it will be very important in our case that this advisory service should be small, and flexible, and complementary to the existing institutions, and that will have to be monitored.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about the codes of practice.  They will of course set <Col N="848" /> out specific guidelines on an agreed basis between employers and unions.  Again, these are common in Britain and in Northern Ireland but they do not exist here at all in the field of industrial relations for all practical purposes.  The Bill assigns responsibility to the new Labour Relations Commission for the preparation of draft codes of practice which will be worked out after consultation with the relevant parties.  It is not intended obviously, as I read the Bill, that such codes would be legally enforceable. Nonetheless every effort will need to be made to underline their standing and to ensure that their terms are upheld.</P>
    <P>Among the areas to which these codes lend themselves would be an area of growing importance like disclosure of information.  Quite clearly that is an area for the future; it is an employee need. Not alone that, it makes excellent management sense and I myself have observed companies on both sides of the Atlantic where a conscious policy of disclosing information to employees has led to an understanding and a commitment of what the business or organisation is trying to do.  Furthermore, it is worth making the point that the most important stakeholders in any organisation are its employees.  They have most to lose in a shut down.  Therefore, not alone should they have a right to information but the ideas they have, especially in addressing problems facing companies, should be invited and adopted if appropriate. Far from being secretive, management should be more open in the interest of all concerned in the enterprise. Other examples of codes of practice could be in the area of disputes, procedures and grievances in disciplinary matters.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on the question of trade union rationalisation and amalgamations. The multiplicity of trade unions in the Republic is a legacy of our history and the way trade unions grew, but it has been a source of considerable concern to Government and employers but especially to the trade union movement itself over the years.  The trade union movement has made numerous <Col N="849" /> attempts voluntarily to rationalise the movement but even to this day, despite the fact that the number of unions has dropped in the recent past, structural diversity characterises the Irish trade union movement.  This, in turn, obviously leads to a multiplicity of unions, often with overlapping jurisdiction in the same industry or firm.  As a result, competition among unions is common and inter-union rivalry is also evident.  Despite several efforts by the trade union movement to rationalise its structures, the results have been modest enough.  Not until recently, indeed very recently, has there been some significant progress in the area of rationalisation.  The amalgamation of the ITGWU and the FWUI on 1 January this year to form SIPTU is a major step and I hope will act as a stimulus to other trade unions to consider and perhaps get down to negotiate mergers.  A number of other amalgamations now have either been decided upon or are under examination.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the change in the Bill where the Trade Union Act, 1975 provided grants towards expenses incurred by unions in the course of merger talks, but the money was paid only where a successful merger took place.  Section 22 of this Bill goes further in that the Minister will be able to make grants to those unions who attempt to merge but who may fail in that attempt. Such unions may claim expenses relating to the two-year period prior to the failure. It seems this is a very sensible, rather enlightened step by the Minister and should help smaller unions in particular, who are very often working on the very edge of their resources, to survive.  This will be an aid to them to contemplate more merger activity.</P>
    <P>An unprecedented consensus has been achieved at national level through the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> and it is most desirable that this consensus reaches down to the enterprise, which has not yet happened in many organisations. It is at the level of the workplace that co-operation between management and employees and their representatives is most important, not alone in relation to jobs but in achieving a competitive <Col N="850" /> edge as we face 1992 and beyond.  Success in future will be strongly influenced by the capacity of organisations to formulate long-range policies, to devote attention to people policies and industrial relations policies that are now commonplace in the area of finance, production, technology and so on and to deal with change on a pro-active basis rather than waiting to react.  Pro-active industrial relations strategies, which may not indeed be in any way threatening to employees or their unions, although evident in some companies are not yet the norm in Irish industry. The management of change and adaptation and the effective contribution of people in organisations will be a prerequisite for survival and growth in the future.  Increased co-operation between employers and employees will call for an abandonment of the old authoritarian style of management and for a more participative style where information will become the norm rather than a secretive approach to the affairs of organisations and where management will be open and honest and upfront with their employees and adopt a genuinely caring approach.</P>
    <P>The other side of what I am saying is that the traditional adversarial approach will need to be examined.  Very often both sides are prisoners of past experience, of mistrust and maybe of abuse over a period which is only fuelling mistrust and working against change in the best interest of the enterprise.  Therefore, increased trust and co-operation between management and employees must be attained in the interests of both.  Here I am not talking for a one-sided achievement on the side of management; I am making a plea for co-operation, an increase of the cake and a sharing of the increased cake.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to legislation more generally. It can have a significant impact on the conduct of collective bargaining and this Bill will have such an impact, but law on its own is no answer to our industrial relations problems.  It is not a panacea. The development of good industrial relations at the level of the workplace depends on the knowledge, skill and commitment of management and employees <Col N="851" /> and their trade unions.  Our task here, a rather limited one really, is to ensure that as far as possible the legislative framework is designed to make the collective bargaining system work better with the over-riding objective of minimising conflict and maximising co-operation.  I said there were exhaustive discussions with both sides and the Minister took great care to engage in such discussions, as did his officials who have considerable experience in this area.</P>
    <P>Complete agreement by all concerned in the area of legal change in the field of industrial relations is impossible to achieve. However, the Bill before us is a compromise.  By that I mean the Minister has to steer a middle course between two powerful interest groups, and it seems to me he has held centre stage in the public interest between the two sides.  The Bill should make a positive contribution to improving our industrial relations and I hope it does so.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the patience and skill he has shown in bringing the Bill before the House.  I look forward to a detailed discussion on it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a reasonable attempt to update the legislation relating to labour and industrial relations, and I hope when put into effect it proves to be satisfactory.  As previous speakers have said, we are in a time of change in Europe generally and 1992 and all its implications must be taken into account now.  Our legislation in this area needs to be updated simply because it has been quite some time since any major overhaul has been made.  In that sense I welcome the Bill in the knowledge that it is a step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, In order to achieve industrial peace it requires the co-operation of the two sides.  There are two sides to every story.  One would hope that the parties concerned, the Government, the unions and the employers, would all have regard to their various responsibilities under the various Acts governing their operation.  I say so in the hope &mdash; I make no political <Col N="852" /> point in this &mdash; that we do not have situations like the one a couple of years ago when we had an agreement entered into by the trade unions, the employers and the Government.  Scarcely was the ink dry on that agreement than there were obvious signs &mdash; whether the trade unions were hoodwinked I do not know &mdash; that somebody somewhere was welshing on the agreement.  That was borne out by the numbers of people who came to attend our clinics.  Whether they were in the health care areas, members of the teaching unions or whatever, there were obvious signs that an arrangement entered into, I presume in good faith by all parties, was fragmenting at a very early stage.  It then seemed to fall on the politicians and the Members of this House to try to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>Such agreements should be entered into in the knowledge that all parties participating have a fairly important rôle to play.  That applies equally to Government, employers and unions.  On that occasion I do not think the employers, the Government in this case, were entirely fair to the people with whom they entered into an agreement.  I am not going to labour that issue tonight because a number of other speakers also wish to be involved.  However, I listened with considerable interest to the dissertation from Deputy Rabbitte who is obviously an expert in negotiations &mdash; I congratulate him on his speech &mdash; but it would not be in the interests of the Government, unions or employers to allow a repetition of that type of situation. It would have a serious and dangerous destabilising effect on the country generally. These are not my views alone but the views of trade unionists, politicians and employers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to an interesting scenario in the dispute over the cleaning contract at UCD.  I can understand and accept one situation he portrayed where a contractor wins the contract and displaces the existing contractor and his workers.  In the case of both contractors having employees on their pay roll at the time, they are two equal competitors in a race for the contract, and competition must <Col N="853" /> prevail.  If contractor A had employees and contractor B had employees, both tendering for the same contract, then it is for management to decide who gets the contract.  If one person loses the contract, obviously his or her employees will suffer, but I do not think we should involve ourselves in confrontation in that type of situation.  If, on the other hand, a contractor with no employees wins the contract and displaces a contractor with employees, that is slightly different and I agree with the reservations expressed by Deputy Rabbitte.  As we all know, that type of situation is open to all kinds of abuse where individuals can set about displacing another from a contract to the detriment of the contractor and his employees.  I am sure the Minister and Deputy Rabbitte know the way that situation can be catered for, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The situation emerging in Eastern Europe can present either a threat or a challenge depending on how we respond to it.  It is essential to have updated industrial relations, so that employees and management can respond quickly and effectively to the challenge which will come as Eastern Europe is democratised. Nobody should shirk from this challenge. It is open and fair competition in the market-place for which we have to be prepared.  We have to encourage it, yet we have to complete, and there is a responsibility on unions and management equally and without exception to respond to it.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody has had experience in his constituency of disputes between unions and management. People can say that the unions were wrong, while others will say management was wrong.  However, where there is a degree of co-operation between the unions and management, particularly in the larger industries, one sees that dialogue and negotiation reap the rewards, which are enjoyed by both parties, not just by one.</P>
    <P>By the same token I can think of an industry which employed over 2,000 people when I was a younger man; it is no longer there.  There were those who <Col N="854" /> said it had gone because the unions got their way, the unions were too strong and so on and so forth.  That may well be up to a point, but I do not think that is necessarily a criticism of the unions.  I would regard it more so as a criticism of management.  Management have a rôle to play in the bargaining process.  I have seen that process operate as, I am sure, have most Members of the House.  It is ironic that, in the aftermath of the closure, it was not uncommon to hear union negotiators, and particularly the union members, state that the union were doing their job, which they were quite entitled to do, but that they were negotiating on a one sided basis.  There appeared to be no willingness on the part of management to do anything other than to concede everything that was requested.  Obviously that was a union negotiator's paradise but even the union negotiators recognised that it was ridiculous that such a situation should develop.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to arrive at confrontation where both sides are at sword point on every occasion.  I believe there should be a high degree of dialogue, rapport and good relations but not to the extent that a decision taken by one side or the other is to the detriment of the firm or the employees.  Most people in this House would agree with that.  There are employees and I am sure employers who have outdated attitudes to ironing out disputes and resolving problems.  In the so called enlightened era in which we live, it is not unreasonable to expect an evolution of the situation so that industrial disputes do not become the object of fire brigade action.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes some way towards that, particularly the setting up of the Labour Relations Commission.  If that commission do the job which is intended, they will serve a useful purpose as a trouble shooter by identifying situations and establishing a liaison in difficult areas and providing accord before a problem gets out of hand.  That type of progress is in the interests of everybody concerned, certainly in the interests of Government which need good industrial relations for very good reasons.  It is in the interests of <Col N="855" /> the employer, even though he may not like it at the time, and in the interests of employees to get the best possible deal in terms of pay and working conditions, while at the same time having regard to the need to continue employment which is essential for the well being of everybody.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will eliminate petty differences. Deputy Hillery has already referred to the one man picket.  I know that in some situations right could be on the side of the man or woman who goes on the one man picket, but for one reason or another he or she cannot get the support of his colleagues, but generally speaking the interests of one person should not predominate over the interests of all others to the extent that the employees of a firm find that their future employment is in doubt.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the possibility of An Post being replaced by contract workers in the event of a strike.  I would blame management in such a situation. Management is there to compete and in the open market which we are entering with gusto in 1992 we will have to expect that management will compete in a fashion in which they have never competed before.  They must recognise that somebody else could be in a position to provide an alternative service.</P>
    <P>Employees are involved in both types of situation, whether the service is provided by A or by B.  All contracts are fulfilled by employees.  In the open and harder competition we will have to face in coming years, management will have to be far sharper than in the past and must have regard to the need for good industrial relations if they expect to remain in business and maintain their labour force.</P>
    <P>The Rights Commission has and will have a useful role to play in the future both in the case of employers with a large labour force and in the case of small industries and businesses where there is no union involved.  That rôle is important and should not be lost sight of, even in the case of increased competition.  People <Col N="856" /> can be squeezed unnecessarily and it is important to retain this type of structure.</P>
    <P>Section 14 proposes that no strike or industrial action should take place without a secret ballot.  That is progressive and fair to all.  It is fair to the employee who wants to make up his or her mind without pressure and it is fair to the employer who will know that the decision arrived at is by way of secret ballot and free from the type of pressures which can exist without such a ballot.  It must be better than any other system, although I know there have been situations where it has not been possible to have the ideal secret ballot.  It will pull management and unions into line in that they will have a better understanding of each other's position and will have greater respect for the decision than would be the case if there were something ambiguous about it or suspicious of excessive influence being brought to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>It is opportune to inform our industrial relations system now that we are fast approaching 1992 and the nation is preparing for an assault on all commercial opportunities that are there for the taking.  We cannot expect sympathy, concessions or protection when the floodgates open, affecting our whole commercial life.</P>
      <P>No one can deny that our industrial relations in the past were disastrous for workers and employers and that they severely jeopardised the hope of foreign investment.  We were plagued by industrial unrest and many unnecessary strikes which could have been avoided if common sense and understanding had prevailed on both sides.  We have learned a lot and any reformed structure must reflect on the anomolies and the weakness which became apparent in our industrial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are preparing new industrial relations legislation must be prepared to be positive and determined to find solutions and agreement on both sides, difficult though it may be but essential for our economy in the years ahead. Industrial peace can only become a reality when trade unions, employers and <Col N="857" /> employees are convinced that our industrial relations structure is fair, efficient and above suspicion.  It must have the utmost support from all sides to ensure the implementation of the principles enshrined in the new structure.</P>
    <P>Labour relations must be seen as a very sensitive area, but there must be an authoritative status to its rulings, otherwise it will become something to be juggled around to satisfy the desire of one side or the other.  This would be disastrous and a perpetuation of labour unrest in industry.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to highlight existing anomalies in our labour relations system and the causes of strikes, so that we can all understand the magnitude of the task of establishing once and for all a workable structure.  Only then can the effectiveness of the structure be seen and respected by all.</P>
    <P>Unofficial strikes must be outlawed since such strikes flout the authority of trade unions and show complete disregard for the majority of workers who are not involved but must bear the brunt of loss of salary for a period.  Workers and employers must be protected against such action and those responsible should be liable for suspension or dismissal from the union concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe that personnel officers without the necessary experience are appointed by management.  Such people should have available to them training courses and the means to secure a diploma in that field.  They play a vital rôle in industry, yet they are not mentioned in the Bill.  Company directors are far removed from the workforce and only come face to face with them during industrial disputes, at the wrong time and in the wrong atmosphere.  Industry can only thrive successfully when barriers and distinctions are removed and the attitude of shared responsibility is given full recognition in the office and on the factory floor.</P>
    <P>The picketing of private residences has recently become a feature of strike action.  This is deplorable and must be condemned by all fair minded people.  A family are not responsible for board of <Col N="858" /> directors or trade union decisions in matters in dispute.  Such a practice should be illegal.  The right to strike must always be observed and respected but must always be subject to certain requirements.  No one has a divine right to strike without first consulting and using the agreed machinery set up by the Government to adjudicate on the merits and demerits of disputes.</P>
    <P>Simple unfair dismissal procedures must be established.  I am talking about instant dismissal.  Discrimination and blackmail are often used in dismissing a worker.  The action may or may not be justified but it will cause anxiety among the workforce and that will be detrimental to good relations in the industry.</P>
    <P>Agreements within industry where management and trade unions work out conditions of employment and procedures to be adopted in the case of disputes should be encouraged.  There could be a legal agreement between all parties involved in that industry to that effect.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to produce a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement by making a number of important changes in trade union and industrial relations law.  The law on trade unions and trade disputes applying here has developed from the establishment of statutory immunities against various common law liabilities.  These were accomplished in a series of Acts passed between 1871 and 1906.  The Trade Union Act, 1871, relieved trade unions of some of the criminal and civil disabilities they suffered as a result of the doctrine of restraint trade.  Section 2 of that Act stated that the purpose of any trade union shall not, by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be deemed to be unlawful so as to render any member of such trade union liable to criminal prosecution, conspiracy or otherwise.</P>
    <P>As case law developed in Britain, other statutes were necessary to protect workers from charges of conspiracy under common law.  The Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, was enacted to nullify the effects of some of this case law.  Section 3 of this Act stated <Col N="859" /> that an agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be indictable as a conspiracy, if such acts committed by one person would not be punishable as a crime.  This Act also repealed the Master and Servants Act, 1867, and other statutes which made it a criminal offence for workers to break their contracts of employment in certain circumstances.  While the Acts of 1871 and 1875 removed the law of criminal conspiracy from trade disputes, the development of liability conspiracy at civil law subsequently imposed an equal threat to trade unions.  This threat to the trade union movement was again highlighted in British case law and was not completely removed until the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, was enacted.  Proposals before the House for legal change concern primarily the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, the principal statute dealing with liabilities and civil law.  I welcome the repeal of this Act as a starting point in any attempt to establish a more rational legal basis for the conduct of industrial relations.  The Act was introduced when the trade union movement was numerically, organisationally, financially and politically weak and when its existence had been threatened by a number of common law judicial decisions.  This is no longer the case.  Other changes since then have been equally marked, such as, units of employment, for example, where smaller public ownership was not nearly so significant as it is now.  The Act has now outlived its usefulness.  It is clearly out of step with contemporary needs and conditions.</P>
    <P>Other changes in this Bill to be welcomed are changes to amend the Trade Union Act, 1941, to amend the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 and 1969, the Trade Union Act, 1971, and the Industrial Relations Act, 1976.  I also welcome the repeal of the entire Trade Disputes (Amendment) Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>I now wish to make a special appeal to all employers, to all workers and to all <Col N="860" /> trade union activists.  As the Irish economy slowly recovers from the effects of prolonged recession, organisations are eagerly looking for means of establishing competitive advantage.  The demands of the 1990s with more intense international competition and a more rapid pace of change, especially technological change, will highlight the need for a better trained and more flexible workforce.  Tomorrow's needs, especially the technical, technological and white collar skills in new developing products and services will be greater than ever.</P>
    <P>As our economy improves much ground has to be made up if we are to have the skills and a flexible labour force which we will need in the 1990s.  By any measure there is a need for a radical reform of our industrial relations system. This Bill does not go far enough and I will outline my reasons later.  The world of the 1990s and particularily as we approach 1992 will be one of increasingly rapid change, technological change, changing market opportunities and changing skill requirements.  If we are to cope with these changes we must increase the flexibility with which industry, commerce and individuals respond.  We must break down the barriers which inhibit progress and which hold back employment growth.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that flexible pay arrangements and excessive pay increases do not threaten jobs and growth.  We must counter out-dated attitudes and behaviour in industrial relations which can still inhibit change and constrain productivity.  We must prevent discrimination in recruitment and employment on grounds of race, sex, disability or age which hinders the best use of the country's resources at a time when the population of working age is growing. We must tap the energies and develop the talents of people who live in our inner cities.  We must further improve access to advice, information and support for people seeking to create their own jobs and businesses.  We must tackle the barriers, some real and some perceived which hinder people from moving to taking up new jobs, which policies of this <Col N="861" /> Government are geared towards generating. Above all we must invest in the skills and knowledge of our people and build up an industry skills base.  The amount of new jobs this economy would provide for its people will depend on the partnership with employers and Government.</P>

      <P>Government can set the framework for enterprise and economic progress and for the removal of impediments to job creation.  It is up to employers and individuals by their action to ensure that jobs come about.  The acknowledged deficiences in our industrial relations arrangements and the realism of our current economic situation demand an acceptance by all concerned. The promotion of improved industrial relations is a major priority and responsibility in itself.</P>
      <P>The attainment of this objection could help in overcoming current difficulties and could increase Ireland's attractiveness as a suitable location for investment in a more competitive world. Similar aspirations have been expressed in the past but exchanges of views then did not lead to the implementation of substantial reforms.  If this experience is to be avoided in the future, a level of open-mindedness from everybody involved will be required together with a willingness to compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of strikes had dropped every year since 1983; 41,000 working days were lost in 1989 compared with 130,000 days in 1983, and fewer than in the previous 25 years.  Two disputes in the public service accounted for 43 per cent of the number of days lost and this remarkable improvement in the industrial relations climate is widely attributed to the current intolerably high level of unemployment.  However, there is a new realism among the workforce.  They <Col N="862" /> know that in an open economy &mdash; with 1992 fast approaching &mdash; the real opposition is not the employer who faces them across the bargaining table but the firms of foreign competitors who will steal their market and their jobs.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems which many personnel managers and companies face today is a reduction in the working week from 40 hours to 39 hours, a move which all employers will have to make over the next three years as part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I urge all employers and employees' representatives to get together to ensure that this transition in working hours is completed in the time-scale with the minimum disruption to production and services.</P>
    <P>The present period of industrial peace has provided the Minister for Labour with a golden opportunity to reform present labour and industrial relations legislation.  I hope the Bill will start such a reform process.  The system of industrial relations is based on the principle of free collective bargaining.  In general terms this means that there has been agreement on all sides and the statute law should not affect the freedom of workers to bargain collectively with employers in order to determine their terms and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>The rôle of the State is seen primarily as one of helping the parties to resolve their problems, for providing machinery to assist in settling disputes and by encouraging the parties to use that machinery.  Legislation has also provided a floor of rights and entitlements to workers generally.  These include redundancy payments, minimum notice in terms of employment, unfair dismissal, equality, holidays, safety and health at work, collective dismissal, maternity rights and a limited form of worker participation at board and sub-board level. While most of this legislation arrives from a recognition of changed economic and social conditions, several measures owe their origin to EC directives or international obligations.  All are consistent with the tradition and promotion of free collective bargaining and none has posed <Col N="863" /> any challenges to the fundamental legislation which underpins the system.</P>
    <P>I believe that the absence of satisfactory and widely applicable dispute procedures is so fundamental an effect of current industrial relations practice as to make it necessary to introduce certain minimum changes as quickly as possible. Well defined and speedy dispute procedures are necessary to ensure that collective bargaining is conducted in an orderly manner, that claims are processed in a proper and reasonable standardised fashion, that decisions are arrived at through proper and democratic means and that unnecessary work stoppages are avoided.</P>
    <P>At a minimum the following procedural sequence should be observed before there is a stoppage of work.  I would have no hesitation in suggesting that the sequence which I am about to outline, which was contained in the commission on inquiry on industrial relations, should be embodied into positive law.  There should be direct negotiations between the parties; there should be conciliation; adjudication; a secret ballot by all its members; authorisation of industrial action by unions and management and issue of notice of industrial action.</P>
    <P>I believe that compliance with these procedures should be mandatory not only for strikes but for all types of industrial action.  These recommendations constitute the basic nucleus of the procedures which should in future govern the initiation of industrial action by an employer or a trade union.  The proposals which I have just outlined should be mandatory and incorporated in this Bill. Parties to disputes which do not get involved in direct negotiations, who are not prepared to go to conciliation and who are not prepared to have their case adjudicated upon, should not be given the right to go on strike even though they may hold a secret ballot by all of their members.  They should have to prove that there was a genuine effort on their behalf to resolve the dispute without resorting to industrial action.  The proposals which I have just outlined would have the effect <Col N="864" /> of removing the legal immunities from all unofficial disputes and from any official dispute in breach of the recommended procedure as I have just stated.</P>
    <P>In my own home city of Cork at present, Liebert, a computer components company with a total workforce of over 200 people are at present on official strike; 92 persons are affected by this dispute.  It would appear that the dispute has nothing to do with working conditions or industrial relations policies, in so far as two employees, one a supervisor and one an ordinary worker had a dispute outside normal working hours, away from the company premises, while socialising.  The action taken by management was extraordinary, to say the least.</P>
    <P>Where were the negotiations between the parties in this instance?  Was there conciliation or any other form of adjudication? I doubt it.  If there was any wrongdoing on the part of the supervisor or the employee surely, this matter could have been resolved in civil law?  The action taken by management in this case, which was subsequently responded to by the workforce with industrial action, has put the viability of this company in jeopardy and the livelihoods of those employed at risk.  In these disputes, well defined procedures should be followed with the insistence of the Department of Labour, so that industrial action is avoided at all costs.  I plead with the Minister to intervene in this case because it is unique.  I cannot recall a strike involving a difference between two employees outside the premises resulting in one of those people being victimised.  It should be dealt with forthwith to ensure that the firm remains in the city of Cork.</P>
    <P>A notable development in our industrial relations to recent years has been the enactment of various statutes which have conferred on individuals rights which were previously attainable only through the collective bargaining system. These statutes include the Redundancy Payment Act, the Industrial Relations Act, Minimun Notice and Terms of Employment Act, Holiday Employees' Act, Anti-Discrimination Pay Act, <Col N="865" /> Unfair Dismissals Act, Protection of Employment Act, Worker Participation Act and Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act.</P>
    <P>Most of the legislation lays down certain minimum standards leaving entitlements above the minimum to be obtained by collective bargaining.  Others, for example, the Anti-Discrimination Pay Act, the Employment Equality Act and the Unfair Dismissals Act, in addition to conferring certain rights, provide for independent machinery to rule in disputes concerning these rights and, where necessary, to provide redress in cases where these rights have not been granted or respected.  Where an appropriate procedure exists for an agreed person to pursue cases to a peaceful solution, such persons should not be entitled to attempt to bypass these procedures or to overturn decisions lawfully taken by having recourse to industrial action.  I would like to see in this Bill measures to prevent industrial action where workers are guaranteed certain minimum rights in positive law.  I recommend, therefore, that the statutory definition of a trade dispute should exclude disputes arising under the Anti-Discrimination Pay Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Areas of Scientific Interest.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned greatly that large areas of my constituency of west Galway are being designated areas of scientific interest.  While I may have no objection to the end result of that, like the people of the area, I have a serious objection to those areas being declared areas of scientific interest without any consultation with the land owners some of whom learned of the designation when they sought development grants for their land.  Such a move is seriously interfering with the rights of land owners in Connemara and other areas in the <Col N="866" /> country where land has been designated areas of scientific interest.  A map I have of the areas shows all the areas designated as being of scientific interest.  One-third of some regions and half of other regions have been designated areas of scientific interest.</P>
      <P>I have been seeking information about this matter for some considerable time. On 28 November last in a parliamentary question I asked the Minister for Finance about the declaring of the areas as being of scientific interest.  His Minister of State, Deputy Daly, in the course of his reply, said that grants for the development of such areas would not normally be paid from EC funds.  That is causing serious concern in the area.  It has been brought to my notice that a farmer in Moycullen who was developing some marginal land for afforestation under the guidance of the local forestry adviser, was refused a grant.  When he had planted six of the ten acres set aside for planting the forester visited him and complimented him on the great job he was doing.  He encouraged him to continue with the work and informed him that he would notify him of the amount of the grant in due course.  Subsequently, he received a letter from Coillte Teoranta which stated:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Palmer,</P>
      <P>Sorry for not contacting you sooner, However, due to some problem with your application I could not do so before now.</P>
      <P>Apparently, most of the townland of Ballyquirke falls into an area of &ldquo;scientific interest&rdquo;, ref.  No. 32 on the map, sheet 14, Galway.</P>
      <P>Under regulations which we have to adhere to, we cannot recommend any area which falls within the areas of scientific interest for grant aid.</P>
      <P>It is wholly unjust that a farmer should be allowed to proceed that far only to be told that his land was in an area of scientific interest.  He had no knowledge of that designation and had not been consulted about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I communicated with Coillte Teoranta <Col N="867" /> about that case and I received the following reply:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter of 26 January, 1990 on behalf of Mr. James Palmer, Ballyquirke, Moycullen, County Galway, who has applied for a forestry grant.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Forest Service that areas designated as areas of &ldquo;scientific interest&rdquo; are not eligible for grant aid.  I have, accordingly, referred your query to the Forest Service for their attention.</P>
    <P>I have not had a positive response to that query since.  That is an example of what is happening in Connemara.</P>
    <P>What is the position of farmers carrying on ordinary farming activities on their land?  Will they be entitled to ewe premiums, sheep headage and cattle headage payments, some of which come from the EC?  I should like to give some information concerning an application by a sheep farmer in the Kylemore area of Connemara.  He received an advance payment on his ewe premium on 29 December 1989 and he cashed the cheque in a bank in Clifden on 29 January.  On 5 February he received a letter from the bank informing him that they had received a letter from the Department to the effect that they were revoking payment on the cheque and subsequently payment was stopped on the cheque which was for more than £5,000.  That case does not relate to areas of scientific interest but it concerns the Office of Public Works who claim that the farmer's sheep strayed on to their land.  That man has more than 750 acres of his own and there was no need for his sheep to graze on any other land.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the much publicised decision of business people in Clifden to build an air strip to serve Clifden and Connemara.  Their interest in a particular site was declared in 1983. Purchase options and contracts were signed in 1987 and a planning application was filed on 6 January 1989.  The local authority were notified of the change in <Col N="868" /> the ASI boundaries in the spring of 1989. The site for the air strip was in an area of scientific interest and Galway County Council refused planning permission. Leaving aside the question of whether an airport on that site would be viable it is important to bear in mind that the people, and the county council, were not made aware of the fact that the area had been designated as an area of scientific interest until about five years after the people expressed an interest in the site, which was three months after they had applied for planning permission.</P>
    <P>Areas of scientific interest on the map, 12A and 12B, are the Inagh Valley and the Inagh Lake but on the shore of that lake Carrolls have developed a major fish farming enterprise.  They can make a major road through the wood and build a major project.  They can avail of grants despite the fact that the Inagh lake is an area of scientific interest.</P>
    <P>I would like to know why the same criteria do not apply to the ordinary person.  I am putting it to the Minister of State and to the Government that I want legislation introduced in the Dáil, if necessary, so that officers of the Office of Public Works cannot draw a circle on people's lands and declare it an area of scientific interest without consultation with the land owner and without entering into compensation agreements, as applies in other EC countries, for example, Scotland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the limited time at my disposal it is very difficult to give a comprehensive reply to this very important matter but I will endeavour to do so. Areas of scientific interest &mdash; ASIs as they are commonly known &mdash; are areas of special interest with fauna and flora, either as individual species of community ecosystems or for its geology or topography of the land form.  To expand on this definition, they are areas where rare <Col N="869" /> and often protected plants or animals occur and where many good examples of typical or a rare community of plants or animals can occur.  These areas are all of conservation interest, many are potential nature reserves or refuges for fauna and some have already been declared as such. Areas of scientific interest may be linked to national monuments or buildings of architectural or, indeed, historical interest.  They are part of the nation's natural heritage.</P>
      <P>The lists of ASIs being drawn up by the Wildlife Service have an inventory of our natural resources which, it is felt, should be conserved.  Such a list is required because these areas are under increasing threat from developments of various kinds.  Areas such as these are disappearing at an alarming rate worldwide and most countries have drawn up inventories or maps that identify the areas as a first step towards their conservation.</P>
      <P>During the fifties and sixties many European countries began to compile inventories of areas of scientific interest. In Ireland the first comprehensive survey was undertaken by An Foras Forbartha in the early seventies.  This was published in Areas of Scientific Interest in Ireland in 1981.  The Wildlife Service augmented this list from its own surveys and when the work of An Foras Forbartha was terminated, the functions were taken over by the Wildlife Service.  The surveys are not yet complete &mdash; in fact, the lists are continually under review.  In 1982 maps were compiled to show all the ASIs and these have been revised twice, in 1982 and in 1986-87.  Some sheets are currently being revised again because, as Deputies will be aware, some of these areas are continuously coming to the attention of the specialists involved in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Areas of scientific interest are identified, they are not designated, and the process is basically a statistical collection of data.  Areas of scientific interest are selected by highly qualified scientists, usually ecologists, who have a specialist knowledge of, for example, peatlands, wetlands, coastal areas, etc.  The sites are selected only after very carefuly survey and assessment.  They are classified into <Col N="870" /> four broad categories: those which would be regarded as sites of international importance, national sites, regional sites and local sites.</P>
    <P>The identification of ASIs is an integral part of the functions under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  There are about 1,600 ASIs covering approximately 400,000 hectares, including lakes and tidal mud-flats. This represents about 4 per cent of the land surface of the country, a figure which is comparable with most other EC countries.  They are widely dispersed throughout the country but tend to be concentrated in the areas of poorer quality land and are, as the Deputy pointed out, particularly abundant in the midland in the raised bogs, in Connemara, Mayo and in the blanket and peat bogs, in the Burren &mdash; in my own constituency &mdash; and in the coastal areas of Donegal and Wexford.</P>
    <P>Identification of areas of scientific interest is a requirement under a decision of the European Communities Council of Ministers adopted in June 1985.  Ireland has a remarkable heritage of historic and scientific sites varied in type and widely spread over the face of the country.  This heritage is of growing importance for the purpose of education and of recreation, not only in the daily lives of Irish people but also in the development of tourism, the pursuit of historical and scientific research.  It is, however, being steadily whittled away by neglect, by the natural forces on the one hand and by human exploitation, pollution and other aspects of modern development on the other hand.  This represents a serious loss to the nation since the heritage properly cared for and suitably developed will bring many and continuing benefits to present and future generations.</P>
    <P>Because of the time limit I would like to deal with a few specific points very quickly.  In relation to legislation the Government indicated in their environmental programme recently published that undertakings were given that these areas of scientific interest, drawn up by the Wildlife Service, would be fully publicised and an amendment to the Wildlife Act &mdash; due for introduction later this year &mdash; will deal with them further.  The Office of Public Works and the Wildlife Service <Col N="871" /> merely identify the areas and mark them out on maps which are made available to local authorities and other interested parties.  It is then up to the local authorities and the planning authorities to ensure, in the decision-making process, that account is taken of these very special and unique areas.</P>
    <P>In November last I indicated to the Deputy that if he wanted to discuss this matter I was prepared to discuss it with him and that the officials of my Department would be available to discuss it too. I believe that the preservation and protection of our national heritage is of vital importance.  It is in the interests of everybody in this House to support the Wildlife Service and the work they are doing in this regard.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Howth Fishermen.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  It is ironic that I do so because in the last few moments I have been advised that in all probability the fishermen in Howth and, indeed, those around the country, may well be able to put to sea tomorrow.  Things are looking better.  In the event that they cannot, I hope that things will, at least, be brighter for them.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Minister for Social Welfare, who is a constituency colleague, on 20 February last and I got a very detailed response indicating that share fishermen should be entitled to benefit if certain normal contributory conditions were satisfied, and if not, then unemployment assistance should be available to them.  I regret I have to pursue the matter further tonight because while those might be the views of the Minister, to date they have not been a reflection of reality on the ground because fishermen are not being assisted by his Department.  I think there is a logjam problem there that needs to be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter received very extensive and detailed coverage in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 21 <Col N="872" /> February 1990, where the problem of fishermen was coined very well in the phrase that the fishermen were caught and squeezed between the Department of Social Welfare regulations and the weather, or, proverbially, between the devil and the deep blue sea.  As share fishermen they are considered to be self-employed and consequently they are told on presentation to the Department's offices that they are not entitled to assistance. When it comes to the issue of benefit it is a question of assessment and investigation.  Invariably, when the officials call the fishermen are standing by their nets on the pier in the hope that the weather will turn and they are left in the situation where on the surface it would appear they are gainfully employed or, at least, in preparation of it, and consequently they are not facilitated.</P>
    <P>I highlight Howth because, as the second most profitable port in the country and the eighth largest, it is in my constituency. I hope that what I say tonight will be said on behalf of all fishermen. It is estimated that there are currently approximately 1,500 boats tied up in our harbours affecting the lives and incomes of 3,500 fishermen and their families, often young families.  In Howth there is a regular fleet of 35 boats, all of which are tied up at present, and between 130 and 150 regular fishermen are currently without income because of the difficulties they face.  Fishermen accept that the winter brings with it inclement weather and good fishing.  In the past during the lulls in the bad weather they had opportunities to fish but that has not proved to be the case this year.  It is estimated that they have managed to snatch ten days fishing and no more since Christmas. Each morning the boats are assembled and the nets put on board before they put out to sea in the hope that the weather will break but each time they have been beaten back.</P>
    <P>Credit must be given to the skippers both in Howth and right around the country who have on a voluntary basis provided their crews with contributions to see them through but that money has now dried up.  I ask the Minister to address the problem in a practical way.  I understand that he met a delegation of <Col N="873" /> the fishermen and their skippers this afternoon who were very pleased with his response.  I have been asked to put on record their appreciation of his willingness to meet them, even though he represents their constituency, for acknowledging the difficulties they face and promising to put matters right.  If the matter is addressed in this way I ask the Minister to put on record the resolution so that if the problem occurs again there would be no ambiguity or doubts.  I, along with the fishermen, have been standing back in the hope that the weather will break and they will not be put to the pin of their collars, a position in which they now find themselves, and that we will have on record a clear resolution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider the question of a back payment.  It is acknowledged that share fishermen have done no serious fishing or been in receipt of income since Christmas and that they have been living on borrowed money and handouts since that time.</P>
    <P>The final matter I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister who is a constituency colleague of mine, and consequently a representative of the fishermen, concerns the skippers.  If a difficulty arises in the agricultural sector, such as flooding or inclement weather which beats down hay or food stocks, there is immediately a clamour in this House for a special EC aid package.  I appeal tonight on behalf of the fishermen of Howth and the rest of the country and, in particular their skippers, for some attempt to be made to find funds to relieve the difficulties now facing fishermen and their skippers.  It was pointed out to me today that the quarterly repayments on boats amount to upwards of £10,000 and that £250 per week is needed to cover the cost of insurance and the provision of electronic equipment.  On top of this skippers have been giving handouts to their crews and families to tide them over this difficult period.  An urgent case can be made for a relief package involving EC funds or funds from the coffers of the Department of the Marine for the fishermen.  I ask the Minister to join with me in raising this matter on behalf of the fishermen of Howth and the <Col N="874" /> rest of the country with his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, to see if a special package can be provided.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for taking it so late in the evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that I am very well aware of the problems faced by our fishermen, of the very real personal dangers which they face at sea in stormy weather, of the anxieties which their families must endure at such times and of the fact that prolonged inclement weather of a type which precludes fishing in reasonable safety, can have a detrimental effect on the incomes on which they and their families depend.</P>
      <P>The special position of our fishermen is recognised under social welfare legislation. As I explained on 20 February 1990 in a written reply to a parliamentary question, a wholetime share fisherman can qualify for payment of unemployment benefit provided he satisfies the appropriate contribution conditions and can show that he is available for employment by not being engaged during the day or the days for which payment is claimed, in work associated with his fishing, e.g., maintenance of boat and/or fishing gear.  Also, part-time fishermen and whole-time share fishermen who do not qualify for unemployment benefit may claim unemployment assistance. Thus, fishermen as a group are catered for under the social welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may know, I had already arranged to meet a delegation of the Howth Fishermens' Association this afternoon to discuss the situation they are experiencing.  I was impressed by the manner in which they described their special problems and difficulties.  From my own point of view the meeting was very useful in that they provided me with a first-hand account of these difficulties. At the end of the meeting, they told me that what I had to say was of great benefit to them and would resolve their present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the meeting I learned that in general boatowners had been in a position up to last week to give assistance <Col N="875" /> to their deckhands but that, from this week, this no longer applies.  I have made arrangements for the association to supply my Department tomorrow with full particulars of deckhands with exceptional needs so that special arrangements can be made to provide immediate relief.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to advert to the PRSI contribution liability for share fishermen.  In 1986 a High Court judgement ruled, in the case of a particular fishing vessel, that share fishermen did not come within the PAYE system.  As a result, there has been some confusion about the PRSI aspect.  The legal position is, however, that share fishermen are insurable as employees under the social welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>In November last, I made regulations which introduced special procedures for the collection and recording of PRSI contributions in respect of share fishermen. At the same time my Department circularised some 2,000 boatowners-skippers concerning the arrangements and asked them to complete a questionnaire regarding their share fishing operations.  I regret to say, however, that the response so far has been very disappointing.  Only some 50 boatowners have to date responded to the effect that they engage share fishermen. An advertising compaign is underway to encourage more boatowners to respond.  An advertisement has been placed in the current issue of the <i>Irish Skipper.</i> I would urge all boatowners to respond without delay so that PRSI contributions can be collected from a current date.  It is only if the boatowners, as employers, make the appropriate PRSI payments that the ongoing entitlement of their employees to social welfare benefits, which depend on PRSI contributions, can be protected.</P>
    <P>I trust that those of our fishermen who are in need will avail of their entitlements under the social welfare system and that what I have said will have removed any <Col N="876" /> confusion that may have existed about the liability of boatowners, as employers under the social welfare Acts, to collect and return PRSI in respect of their share fishermen.  If the employers concerned now commence making these returns, share fishermen, will be able to avail of their entitlements to unemployment benefit in the future and problems of this kind will not arise again.</P>
    <P>I have noted what the Deputy has said in connection with the other difficulties facing fishermen at present, such as the repayments on heavy loans.  I gave an undertaking to the delegation I met today to refer that matter to the Minister for the Marine.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the law relating to bail has been strengthened by the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provides that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed by a person on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed or about to be passed on him for a previous offence.  The operation of the relevant provisions in the 1984 Act is being monitored and, if it is established that they are not proving to be effective, I will give further consideration to what action might be taken.</P>

      <P>Five hundred and forty-six members of the force are assigned to Garda headquarters, of whom 122 are sergeants and gardaí engaged on clerical and other administrative duties.</P>
      <P>Twenty clerical assistants from an existing Civil Service Commission panel have already taken up duty and the remainder are currently being recruited.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda authorities are totally committed to the optimum deployment of the trained membership of the force in the best interests of the community.  As I have already indicated to the House, I have secured Government approval for the recruitment of 250 additional civilian clerical staff for the Force.  This measure is intended to have a positive impact on law enforcement by releasing gardaí from office work for crime prevention and detection duties for which they were recruited and trained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 43, 61 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The major teaching input to prisons and places of detention is made by eight vocational education committees who provide 65 whole-time teachers and 68 regular part-time teachers in the 12 institutions concerned.</P>
      <P>There is a further substantial educational input from the public library services, particularly from Dublin public libraries who provide a senior librarian and a librarian full time.  The Arts' Council run writers' and artists' workshops. The Open University provides degree-level courses in nearly all prisons and places of detention and, in recent times, there has also been increased involvement in particular institutions by other third-level institutions, notably the National College of Art and Design, Thomond College, Cork Regional Technical College and University College, Dublin. A professional co-ordinator of education in my Department has overall responsibility for the development of all this educational activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most places of custody there are modern purpose-built education units designed to enable a wide range of educational activity to take place.  In some older prisons, notably Mountjoy, it has been necessary to adapt available accommodation. Where facilities allow, as they do in most places, a very broad and versatile programme of education is made available.  Given that a sizeable minority of those in prison have substantial basic education needs, this is given a high priority.  Creative activities, such as art, music, writing and drama, have worked <Col N="588" /> very well in enabling prisoners to discover constructive outlets for their talents and this sector has been greatly extended in recent times.  Physical education, examination courses, craft subjects, technology, home economics and social education all have major roles.  The increase in teacher allocation this year, which is the equivalent of 17 extra full-time teachers, will enable the range of educational provision to be significantly increased in a number of places.  Recruitment of additional teachers by the VECs concerned, in consultation with my co-ordinator, is well under way.</P>
    <P>With regard to Open University provision, this is now the sixth year in which prisoners in this jurisdiction have followed Open University courses, mainly in the facilities of social science, arts and technology.  This year some 40 prisoners are studying with the Open University, many of them men and women whose formal education had been limited but who developed themselves through the VEC provision in the prisons.  To date six prisoners have completed their full degrees while in prison, others have continued their Open University studies after release and still others have transferred, upon release, to full-time conventional universities.  I am very satisfied with the quality of the distance education provided and in particular wish to acknowledge all the assistance given by the Northern Ireland Regional Office of the Open University.</P>
    <P>About 50 per cent of the 2,000 or so in custody at any time in prisons and places of detention participate voluntarily in education.  In this jurisdiction, participation in education is credited equally with work towards payment of gratuity and remission of sentence.</P>

      <P>The programme of work of the Irish Presidency of the EC, as far as my area of responsibility is concerned, falls under the following headings &mdash; immigration, police co-operation (TREVI) and legal co-operation within the framework of <Col N="590" /> European political co-operation.  Working groups dealing with these matters will be chaired and serviced by officials of my Department and this will involve attendance at meetings in both Dublin and Brussels.  I will be chairing a meeting of the TREVI and Immigration Ministers towards the end of our Presidency.</P>
      <P>The priorities during the Irish Presidency in relation to immigration are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to finalise the draft convention determining the State responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the member states of the European Communities;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to accelerate progress on the draft convention on the crossing of the external borders of the member states of the European Communities; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;at the request of the European Council, to carry forward a number of studies relating to immigration matters such as the preparation of inventories on:</P>
      <P>(a) national positions regarding immigration, and</P>
      <P>(b) national policies on asylum.</P>
      <P>The TREVI Group deals with police co-operation in the context of the EC and the main areas of priority during the Irish Presidency are:</P>
      <P>(i) to secure agreement on a detailed list of measures to be implemented in relation to police co-operation in the context of 1992 having regard to the consequences for organised crime and the security of a Europe without internal borders; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) the continuation and further development of international police co-operation measures to combat drug trafficking.  Towards this end a special working group meeting will be held early in March on the subject of technical police co-operation between the EC member countries and producer and transit countries which are struggling against drug trafficking.  It is also <Col N="591" /> my intention to devote a special session at the meeting of Trevi Ministers in June to discussion of this topic.</P>
    <P>As regards legal co-operation, the aim during the Irish Presidency is to make the maximum progress on implementation of measures required in the context of 1992. In addition I have decided, as a particular objective, to take action to deal with the problems of drug trafficking, particularly by the implementation of measures to trace, seize and confiscate criminally obtained assets.  The Irish Presidency has tabled a paper asking the relevant group to consider legal co-operation at a Community level with regard to this issue.  On the civil side the Irish Presidency intends to progress negotiations on a convention to simplify and improve the procedures between member state for the recovery of payments due to maintenance creditors.</P>
    <P>I am confident that significant progress will be achieved in my areas of responsibility during the Presidency, particularly in relation to drug trafficking and to measures to be implemented in the context of 1992.</P>

      <P>The methods of heating used are primarily natural gas and oil.  Of the 12 institutions, ten have dual heating systems. Where this is the case, the fuel used depends on the relative fuel prices at a given time.  The details in respect of each of the prisons and places of detention are outlined in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Section 50 subsection (4) of the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended, confers on me a limited discretion to direct the release of a person arrested under Part III of that Act on foot of a warrant of arrest endorsed in accordance with that Part. That discretion is confined to the grounds set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) of section 50.  Under these provisions the Minister for Justice may issue a direction if he is of the opinion that:</P>
      <P>(a) The offence to which the warrant relates is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence, an offence under military law which is not an offence under ordinary criminal law, a revenue offence, or</P>
      <P>(b) That there are substantial reasons for believing that the person named or described in the warrant will, if removed from the State, be prosecuted or detained for a political offence or an offence under military law which is not an offence under ordinary criminal law.</P>
      <P>Section 50 confers jurisdiction on the High Court to direct a person's release on these same grounds and on a number of others as well.  It has been the view of successive Ministers for Justice, and it is my view, that decisions on such matters are best left for the courts to make on the basis of sworn evidence provided in open court.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware this post was advertised on two previous occasions but failed to attract suitably qualified people.  With this in mind the conditions of service for the post have now been revised and the salary being offered has been substantially increased.  The post is now being offered on a two year contract basis, renewable, with a salary of £43,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>I am reasonably confident that the revised terms being offered will attract suitable candidates and that, on completion of the interviews, I will be in a position to make an early appointment.</P>

      <P>Each application for temporary release on compassionate grounds is considered on its individual merits.  Regard is had to the circumstances giving rise to the application and factors such as the nature of the offence, length of sentence served, behaviour while in custody, the previous record of the offender, the possible risk which a release may pose and the likelihood of an offender returning to prison on the expiration of the period of release. I am satisfied that the present arrangements for dealing with applications for release on compassionate grounds strike the right balance between the need to attempt to respond in a humane way to such applications and at the same time minimise the risk to the community.</P>

No final decisions have yet been made but it should be borne in mind that the system required to operate instalment payments is costly and would give rise to difficulties as regards financial control.  I am also aware that such a system has been tried in other administrations and has not been found to be fully satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The ship, <i>Svea Atlantic,</i> which CONCERN had chartered from a Danish company to bring famine relief supplies to the famine stricken people of Ethiopia, was reported as having been attacked and boarded off the port of Massawa on 12 February by elements of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front.  The ship had been due to dock that same day at the <Col N="610" /> port of Massawa, which was the scene of military confrontation between the EPLF and Ethiopian Government forces in a resumption of fighting in the north of the country.  All communication with the ship was lost from 12 to 19 February when it was released by the EPLF, which admitted having off-loaded the cargo.  My latest information is that the <i>Svea Atlantic</i> is now on its return journey to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the week the ship was held, my Department sought by various means to obtain concrete information about the ship.  Exhaustive inquiries were made through the Irish embassies in Copenhagen and London and, through the Department of the Marine, with Lloyds Maritime Information Services and the International Maritime Organisation. However, none of these sources was able to provide very definite information as to <Col N="611" /> the ship's whereabouts or as to the safety of its cargo and crew.  Regular contact was also maintained with CONCERN throughout.  The ship's captain was finally able to make radio contact with the ship-owners on 19 February, when he indicated that the ship was undamaged and the crew were safe and well but that the cargo had been taken off.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Calleary, issued a statement on 13 February condemning the attack on the ship. He recalled the statement by the twelve member states of the European Community on 23 January which had strongly deplored attacks on civilian shipping in the Horn of Africa region earlier this year.  It was pointed out by the Twelve, and reiterated by the Minister that, as well as violating accepted standards of international conduct, such attacks risked undermining international efforts to relieve the threat of famine.  The Minister called for the immediate cessation of such attacks.  This statement was brought to the attention of the EPLF.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers of the Twelve meeting in Dublin on 20 February said in a statement that they were deeply disturbed by recent military confrontations in Ethiopia at a time when internationally supported peace efforts were under way and when measures to provide much needed humanitarian assistance to the stricken people of Eritrea and Tigray were well advanced.  They called on all concerned to take all necessary measures to ensure emergency aid reach the threatened populations and called once again for attacks on shipping to cease.</P>

      <Quest>the action he has taken or intends to take regarding the attack on soldiers of the Irish battalion of UNIFIL in Lebanon on 21 February 1990 by the Syrian backed Amal militia; if he will lodge a protest with the Syrian Government in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 to 87, inclusive, together.  On 21 February 1990, a patrol of the Irish batalion serving with UNIFIL was fired on near Haddathah village by members of the local Amal militia.  Three Irish soldiers suffered gunshot wounds.  The patrol showed maximum restraint, but was obliged to return fire because of the grave threat to life as their assailants continued to fire.  Two of their assailants were fatally injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediate steps were taken at every level to defuse the situation.  The soldiers' commanding officer immediately made contact locally with Amal, who promised full support in restoring the situation to normal.  The Irish battalion was put on a state of alert as a precaution against retaliatory attacks.  UNIFIL officials also met with Amal leaders, including the commander of the two who were killed. Amal stated that they regretted the incident, which was not planned or authorised, <Col N="613" /> and that their policy towards UNIFIL was unchanged.  It is clear that there is a strong desire on all sides to maintain the traditionally good relations between Amal and UNIFIL, and particularly between Amal and the Irish Battalion.</P>
    <P>Contact with the family of the two who died, who were brothers, has been established with a view to further reducing tension in the area.</P>
    <P>We are in continuous contact with the UN in New York through our mission there in order to underline our paramount concern for the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel and to express our support for any measures considered necessary to maintain and improve current levels of safety and security.  The UN Secretary General has stated his concern at the incident.  He has expressed his appreciation for the manner in which the Irish soldiers performed and for their restraint.</P>
    <P>Troubling incidents of this nature are invariably raised through diplomatic channels with the appropriate authorities. In this instance, the matter has been discussed with the Syrian authorities and the importance of ensuring the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel was underlined.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's other questions, the Government have repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, except UNIFIL, from Lebanon.  I refer the Deputy to my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 29 September 1989.  The report of the Secretary General on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for the period 22 July 1989 to 25 January 1990 contains an assessment of the situation in the UNIFIL area of operation in southern Lebanon, including reference to the activities of armed militias and foreign forces.  I have arranged for the report to be lodged in the Dáil library.  As the activities of armed militias and foreign forces in other parts of Lebanon do not affect UNIFIL, the other details requested by the Deputy are not pertinent to the continuing role of UNIFIL.</P>

    <P>The gross amounts collected from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and VHI in 1988 and 1989 were £25.12 million and £31.40 million respectively. Statistics are not available which would enable the amount of refunds of these payments to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to what the reference to &ldquo;the length of time between the first and second rebate&rdquo; mentioned in the question relates.  It is presumed, however, that what is involved is the timing of interim refunds.  Claims for interim refunds of withholding tax on professional fees are given priority in tax districts dealing with the tax affairs of professional persons and are normally processed within seven days of receipt. On submission of the F45-1 form(s) by the taxpayers, the refund claim will be processed without delay, provided the conditions necessary for payment of an interim refund are satisfied.  Subsequent claims for refunds of withholding tax within the same accounting period are also dealt with as expeditiously as possible subject to the verification of such claims by the inspector of taxes.</P>

An open competition for inspector of taxes will be advertised by the Civil Service Commission shortly but it has not yet been decided whether further open competitions for administrative officer and executive officer will be advertised in the course of 1990.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer submitted a claim for repayment of tax for the year 1988/89 to the inspector of taxes in May 1989.  The taxpayer worked for a period in the United Kingdom in that year.  The inspector advised her to obtain a statement of her final UK liability from the UK inspector of taxes so that her claim could be dealt with.  The taxpayer has experienced difficulty in obtaining this statement.  The Revenue Commissioners will take the matter up with the UK inspector on the taxpayer's behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three Commissioners of Public Works, one of whom is Chairman.  The number of Commissioners is defined by statute.  The Chairman, who is secretary rank and the Commissioners, who are assistant secretary rank are selected through the Top Level Appointments Committee from officers of principal rank and equivalent upwards.  Pay determination is in accordance with the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector (Report No. 30).  The salary of the Chairman is that of secretary (standard rate).  The Commissioners are remunerated on the pay range appropriate to assistant secretaries.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have duties imposed on them by the Minister for Finance as a matter of administrative convenience and duties and functions imposed by statute.  The latter are numerous, being contained in legislation enacted over a period of 160 years. The principal Acts include the State Property Act, the Arterial Drainage Acts, the National Monuments Acts and the Canals Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is the Government's principal agent for the provision and care of buildings for State <Col N="658" /> purposes.  It undertakes a range of engineering works as well as the upkeep of certain parks and inland waterways.  The office has central responsibility for various services and supplies to Departments through the Government Supplies Agency.  The office has central statutory functions in relation to National Monuments and Wildlife.</P>
    <P>The functional remit of the Commissioners is as decided by Government from time to time.  Their current functions can be summarised as:</P>
    <P>Property Management. Project Design and Management.</P>
    <P>Arterial drainage works mainly on a catchment basis.</P>
    <P>Waterways Conservation and Management.</P>
    <P>Heritage Conservation.</P>
    <P>Central Purchasing and Supplies.</P>
    <P>Local Loans Fund Services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance (and through him the Minister of State) is the Minister responsible for the Office of Public Works.  The Chairman is the Accounting Officer.  The Commissioners are subject to the same controls as other Departments and offices in the matter of staff and salaries and wages.  The Commissioners have certain delegated authority. They require the specific sanction of the Minister in certain areas e.g. the acquisition of sites, rental of accommodation, exhibition of a drainage scheme, acquisition of guardianship or ownership of a national monument, undertaking new works projects in excess of £2 million.  Subject to these requirements the Commissioners can incur expenditure within the limits of the provisions in the various subheads of the Vote.  Thus, in managing the Office of Public Works, the Commissioners' function is similar to that of top management in other Civil Service Departments, and offices.  In their exercise of specific statutory functions the Commissioners act corporately.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance has been assigned responsibility for the Office of Public <Col N="659" /> Works.  In managing the office, the Chairman and the Commissioners report to the Minister of State and, when exercising their statutory functions they have regard to Government policy as enunciated by him.  Certain statutory functions of the Minister for Finance in relation to the Office of Public Works have been delegated to the Minister of State and a wider range is under consideration.</P>

      <P>The Commission's proposals on agricultural prices for 1990-91. <Col N="664" /> in general, provide for a freeze in Community prices.  However, in the case of a number of member states, price increases are proposed because of &ldquo;green&rdquo; currency adjustments &mdash; in our case this would amount to 2 per cent for products other than beef.  The corresponding increase for beef was obtained last year. Furthermore there should be additional benefits to Irish producers if the rural development measures which accompany the price proposals this year are adopted. Included among these measures are proposals for the buying up and reallocation of milk quotas, extension of the suckler cow premium to smaller scale milk producers, a cash premium for small scale producers of cereals and a special ewe premium from 1991.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting that for the first time in recent years the Commission has not proposed an adjustment of intervention mechanisms, a device which in the past has served effectively to reduce support for products such as beef, cereals and milk.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should emphasise that the proposals are still under negotiation. I will, of course, be seeking the best possible outcome for Irish producers in the final decision.</P>

The position in these cases is that it is proposed to issue payments for each scheme on the animals on which grants have been claimed on the basis of administrative checks to determine eligibility.</P>

The annual level of export turnover insured under the company's policy was approximately IR£10 million in each of the years 1988 and 1989 but in neither year would maximum liability have exceeded £3.5 million at any given time.  As insurance cover relates only to the value of product exported, I cannot provide information regarding actual volumes of product involved.</P>
      <P>Insurance cover has been available to the company on a continuous basis since if first applied for it in 1983.

      <P>The means calculation in this case took into account the payment of UK retirement pensions to the person concerned and his wife.  The exchange rate used to convert the UK pension to Irish pounds was £1.15.  This rate is set by the European Commission and applied to all pensions processed in the December quarter involving a Sterling-Irish pound conversion. This rate represents an average exchange rate between the Irish pound-Sterling and obviates the need for individual conversions.  The corresponding exchange rate for the July-September quarter was £1.19 &mdash; use of this earlier exchange rate would not affect the overall amount of means assessed in this case.</P>

    <P>A social welfare officer of the Department has been asked to review the means of the person concerned.  Following the review, the most recent exchange rate of £1.11 &mdash; applicable from 1 January 1990 &mdash; will be applied to the UK pensions of the person concerned and his wife. <Col N="678" /> Providing that there has been no increase in the UK pensions in question or any other increase in means, an increase in old age non-contributory pension may be due to the person concerned.

      <P>The person concerned, who has been employed as a taxi driver for a number of years, claimed unemployment assistance on 5 January 1990.

      <P>The public area at the Navan Road office of my Department is equipped with 21 hatches of which three are specially constructed to meet the security and other requirements of cash handling. A further seven are used exclusively for claims taking and information purposes; the remaining 11 hatches are used for interview and for signing-on purposes.</P>
      <P>The physical layout of the office imposes constraints on the use to which certain hatches may be put in order to avoid the congestion which would arise from cross-queueing.  Within these constraints, signing and payment arrangements are designed to spread the daily volume of business on an efficient basis between various hatches.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the operational need to divide claimants according to type of payment, it is not possible to achieve exactly equal distribution of claimants between hatches.  A recent survey of the office shows that the deviation from the average number of persons dealt with at any one pay hatch is minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the facilities at the Navan Road office do not match the standards which have been achieved at my <Col N="682" /> Department's newest offices.  The question of providing a new office designed to the most modern standards is a high priority with my Department and is being actively pursued at present.  In the interim, my officials are reviewing the payment arrangements at this office to see whether the situation for the public can be improved in the short-term.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the claim of the Garda Commissioner that crime statistics indicate that reported crime was reduced last year compared to the year before, he will undertake a representative questionnaire in the Dublin Metropolitan Area to assess the extent to which crimes are not reported with a view to obtaining a more accurate view of crime, lawlessness and vandalism in Dublin and its suburbs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that provisional statistics for 1989 indicate that the level of recorded indictable crime decreased in comparison with 1988 by approximately 3 per cent for the country as whole and by approximately 8 per cent in the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
      <P>While I am prepared to accept that in this country &mdash; as elsewhere &mdash; there may be a certain level of unreported crime, there is no evidence that it is substantial. Moreover, the likelihood is that the level of unreported crime does not vary greatly from year to year and that the statistics relating to recorded indictable crime, therefore, give a reliable picture of crime trends.</P>
      <P>The gardai, of course, make every effort to encourage people to report crime.  The fact that there is now increased structured contact between Garda and the public through the various community-based crime prevention schemes such as neighbourhood watch and community policing ought, if anything, to have led to an increased tendency to report crime.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the Garda authorities do not consider that any real purpose would be served by undertaking a questionnaire of the nature referred to. Indeed, given that responses to such a questionnaire would be provided outside any legal framework, it is doubtful, to say the least, whether it would provide reliable statistics about the incidence of crime.</P>

      <P>Sessional supervisors employed under the community services order scheme are paid at a rate of £5 per hour.  The question of applying public service pay rises to the rate is under consideration at present and I expect to be able to announce a revised rate in the near future.</P>
      <P>Sessional supervisors are considered to be employees.  The tax arrangements applying to them have been agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not aware that the current tax arrangements, whereby end of tax year returns are made to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of each supervisor employed in the preceding year, has been a cause of concern to the supervisors employed under the scheme.  The position is that they are engaged on projects for a maximum of 14 hours per week and unless they have income from other sources are for the most part unlikely to incur a tax liability during the income tax year.  I am prepared to examine the position further in the event of any specific information about difficulties in relation to tax liability being made available to me.</P>

      <Quest>the reason purchasers, as distinct from tenant purchasers, receive a less substantial amount of grant for conversion to heating appliances to meet the requirements of the Smoke Control Zone Order in Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, especially in view of the fact that most purchasers are on a much higher mortgage and much higher monthly mortgage repayments than tenants as in the case of persons (details supplied) in Dublin 10; and if, in view of the hardship involved, he will vary the grant scheme in order that purchasers with higher mortgages will qualify for the same grant as tenant purchasers.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 166, 167 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the schemes of financial assistance made under section 45 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, in respect of special control areas, is a matter for Dublin Corporation which has full responsibility for dealing with individual applications under these schemes.  The grants schemes offer generous assistance to eligible applicants in meeting the costs of heating adaptations which are necessary in order to comply with the requirements of special control area orders and I have no proposals to vary the terms of these schemes.</P>

      <P>I assume <Col N="694" /> that the Deputy is referring to air pollution in Dublin City.  In accordance with section 54 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, monitoring of air quality and of the nature, extent and effects of emissions is a matter for individual local authorities, in performance of their functions under the Act having regard to any relevant directions from the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 97 of 14 February, 1990 for general information regarding national vehicle emissions.</P>
      <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987 provides a comprehensive statutory framework for the control of emissions from fixed sources and measures are being taken under that Act to control and limit both industrial and domestic emissions.  In addition there is a range of regulations providing for the construction, use and testing of vehicles to limit emissions, and to control the levels of particular substances in petrol and gas oils.  This legislation is being implemented as appropriate, both by relevant local authorities and my Department.  More stringent vehicle emission standards will be introduced with effect from the end of 1992.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency, which will be in operation in 1990, will have responsibilities, <i>inter alia,</i> in relation to the control and regulation of scheduled development likely to pose a major risk to environmental quality and for general monitoring of environmental quality.</P>
      <P>Air quality standards in effect in Ireland are in full accordance with the relevant EC requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no house improvement grants available to persons generally for the provision of bathrooms.  However, under the disabled persons grants scheme operated by the local authorities a grant of up to two-thirds of the cost in the case of private houses, or the full cost in the case of local authority houses, is available for the provision of bathroom facilities for disabled persons.  Up to 50 per cent of the grant paid or £2,500 whichever is the lesser, is available to the local authorities by way of recoupment from my Department. I have no proposals at present to amend this scheme.  Funding may also be made available to local authorities under the terms of the Department's remedial work scheme to assist them in providing bathroom facilities in their rented housing stock.</P>
      <P>A person whose annual income in the previous tax year is less than £10,000 may obtain an improvement loan from a local authority which may be used for the provision of bathroom or shower facilities. The loan may be up to £8,000 &mdash; £2,000 of it is not secured &mdash; and may be repaid over 15 years.</P>
      <P>Data from the 1981 census, the latest available, showed that in the County Borough of Dublin and the County of Dublin (including Dún Laoghaire) the number of houses without bathrooms was 12,302 and 4,351 respectively.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a strong imbalance between private and public transportation of passengers and goods, approximately 5 per cent to 95 per cent, in this country and that the current road development policy is likely to increase this imbalance further in favour of private transportation which is further widening the gap between Ireland and our EC partners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Roads carry over 90 per cent of <Col N="698" /> freight traffic and 96 per cent of passenger traffic in this country.  However, these figures need to be seen in context.  In the mainline rail corridors, the share of passenger and freight traffic carried by rail is significantly higher, while in Dublin rail carries 11 per cent of passengers crossing the inner cordon each morning. It is also important to realise that bus-based public transport depends on an efficient road network.</P>
      <P>The community support frame work, which the Government successfully negotiated with the EC Commission last year, identified investment in access and internal transport as contributing to a reduction in the impact of peripherality and as supporting productive investment in the industrial and tourism sectors. Under the CSF, the EC Commission has committed 700 million ECU to transport investment, of which 580 million ECU will be devoted to roads.  This reflects the reality that roads are and will continue to be the dominant mode of internal transport. Our high level of dependence on roads arises from our small size and population, our island status, the low level of urbanisation and the widely dispersed pattern of settlement.</P>

      <P>Celbridge is served by a system of non-national roads, mainly regional roads.  Primary responsibility for improvements to the network of non-national roads rests with the local authorities, the funding normally being met from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by the Department for regional and county roads.</P>
      <P>The 1990 discretionary grants for such roads notified to Kildare County Council total £2,001,000 including a supplementary grant of £700,000 for improvement works because of the special needs of the county.  The 1990 allocation compares with expenditure of £954,000 in 1989 under equivalent headings. The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>In February 1989, proposals were received in my Department from Kildare County Council for the construction of a relief road at Celbridge.  The proposed scheme would cost an estimated £1.3 million and would include a new crossing of the River Liffey.  On 14 March 1989, the Department wrote to the local authority drawing attention to the normal method of financing such works.</P>

      <Quest>the provisions, if any, which have been made for the accommodation of severely disturbed children at present accommodated at St. Paul's Special School, Dublin, in view of his promise in Dáil Éireann they they would be accommodated in Lucan or in Lusk by the end of 1989; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In my reply to a previous question put down by the Deputy (Official Report of 18 May 1989, col. 681), I indicated that the Eastern Health Board had expected that the proposed facilities to be located in the Lucan and Lusk areas would be ready by the end of 1989.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Eastern Health Board have been in discussion with the authorities of St. Paul's Hospital, Beaumont, and with representatives of the Friends of St. Paul's regarding the provision of facilities for autistic and severely disturbed people in the older age group.  A package of measures which will meet the service needs of autistics in the northern sector of the Eastern Health Board has been agreed and I am providing the necessary capital resources to enable the required facilities to be put in place.  The Eastern Health Board is at present in the course of planning the new accommodation and it is intended to finalise this process as quickly as possible so that construction work can commence at an early date.</P>
      <P>As part of the package of measures agreed, it had been the intention that a unit for disturbed autistic people would be located at Lusk.  However, accommodation chosen for this purpose is no longer available to the Eastern Health Board and an alternative property is being sought by the board as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the accommodation in the Lucan area, the Eastern Health Board's plan for this area involves the provision of alternative housing for mentally handicapped residents who are currently accommodated in the former children's unit at St. Loman's Hospital in bungalows on a site on the campus of St. Loman's Hospital.  My Department are discussing <Col N="709" /> with officials of the board how this proposal can be implemented as soon as possible. In the meantime the existing unit at St. Loman's Hospital has been renovated. The reference made to this accommodation in my previous reply was in the context of the provision of an alternative placement of a person who is at present being cared for in St. Paul's Hospital and who present particular management difficulties.</P>

      <P>The delay in making these payments at present is due to pressure of work on existing staff resources.  The maximum rate of grant payable by my Department to the voluntary groups arranging the transport services is 98 per cent of the total costs.  The balance of 2 per cent payable by local interests ensures the continued participation and responsibility of the local interests.  My Department are not aware of any instance where a voluntary group was unable to pay this 2 per cent.</P>
