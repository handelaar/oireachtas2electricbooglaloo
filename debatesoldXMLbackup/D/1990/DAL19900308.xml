      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Go dtugann Dáil Éireann Dá haire an Dara agus an Tríú Tuarascáil ón Dara Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge: Moltaí í ndáil le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus laistigh de na Páirtithe Polaitíochta; agus Suirbhé i measc na gComhaltaí de Thithe an Oireachtais i ndáil leis an nGaeilge.</P>
      <P>Is cúis sásaimh domsa, mar Chathaoirleach ar an tríú Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge, an tairiscint atá os ár gcomhair inniu a mholadh.  Ócáid ar leith atá ann inniu, ar ndóigh, ó tharla gurb é seo an chéad uair riamh a pléadh aon tuarascáil de chuid aon Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge sa Teach seo.  Mar sin, tá deis thar an gnáthach ar fáil do Theachtaí chun cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais a phlé go hoscailte agus go bríomhar.  Tá súil agam, áfach, go nglacfaidh líon mór Teachtaí páirt sa díospóireacht inniu agus nach mbeidh cúthail orthu a gcuid tuairimí macánta a nochtadh faoin gceist sin.  Muna bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa ag Teachtaí tá súil agam nach gcuirfidh sé sin cose orthu iarracht a dhéanamh chun páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht seo.</P>
      <P>Ag an bpointe seo sílim gurbh fhiú, mar áis do Theachtaí, cur síos gairid a thabhairt ar na Comhchoistí don Ghaeilge a bhí ag feidhmiú roimhe seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> Ag éirí as an bPlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge a d'ullmhaigh Bord na Gaeilge roinnt blianta ó shin cuireadh an chéad Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge ar bun i mí Bhealtaine 1985.  Is iad na hOrduithe Tagartha a tugadh don Chomhchoiste sin ná athbhreithniú agus moltaí a dhéanamh i dtaobh:</P>
    <P>(a) cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach, agus</P>
    <P>(b) cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Nuair a tháinig an comhchoiste sin le chéile shocraigh na comhaltaí go dtabharfaí aghaidh mar bheart práinneach ar an gcéad chuid dá Orduithe Tagartha.  Cé nár dúradh é go neamhbhalbh in aon áit tá sé le haithint ó thuarascálacha an Chomhchoiste sin go raibh siad den tuairim go raibh staid éigeandála i dTithe an Oireachtais chomh fada agus a bhain sé leis an nGaeilge.  Ceann de na rudaí a thóg na comhaltaí den Chomhchoiste sin faoi ndeara go han-luath ná nach raibh mórán comharthaí ginearálta ar fud Tí Laighean dátheangach, fiú, gan trácht ar iad a bheith i nGaeilge amháin.  Ní raibh an Ghaeilge le feiceáil timpeall na háite agus ní raibh sí le cloisteáil ach go hannamh.  Mhol na Comhaltaí den chomhchoiste go gcrochfaí comharthaí dátheangacha ar fud Tí Laighean agus rinneadh é sin.  Is dócha gurb é sin an chéad rud dearfach i dtaobh na Gaeilge a rinneadh le fada an lá i dTeach Laighean.</P>
    <P>Anuas ar an méid sin d'eisigh an Ceann Comhairle, ar iarratas ón gcomhchoiste, leabhar de phrásaí a úsáidtear i ngnó na dTihe agus bhí sé seo ina áis mhór do Chomhaltaí den dá Theach.  Chuir an Ceann Comhairle téipeanna teagaisc móide téipthaifeadáin ar fáil i Leabharlann an Oireachtais mar éis do Chomhaltaí chun a gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh. D'eisigh an chéad chomhchoiste trí thuarascáil ar fad agus bhain siad siúd go príomha le ceist na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Bhain an comhchoiste sin roinnt rudaí amach gan amhras ach bhí teorainn leis an méid sin.  Is dóigh liomsa gurb iad na príomh rudaí a baineadh <Col N="2025" /> amach ná gur tugadh áit níos feiceálaí don Ghaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus gur leagadh bonn láidir chun tógáil air sa todhchaí.</P>
    <P>Tháinig an dara Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge le chéile don chéad uair i mí Meán Fómhair 1987 agus bhíi na hOrduithe Tagartha céanna acu agus a bhí ag an gcéad chomhchoiste.  Shocraigh na comhaltaí den dara comhchoiste gurbh fhiú leanúint leis an obair a raibh tús curtha léi i dTithe an Oireachtais i dtaobh na Gaeilge.  Is léir nach mó ná sásta a bhí na comhaltaí le feidhmiú a lán de na moltaí a bhí déanta bag an gcomhchoiste rompu.  Cé go n-admhaíonn na comhaltaí sa dara tuarascáil &mdash; an chéad cheann a luaitear sa tairiscint inniu &mdash; go mb'fhéidir go raibh roinnt de na moltaí a rinneadh cheana ardaidhmeannach, bhí siad mí-shásta nach raibh níos móo déanta i dtaobh na dTithe.  Beidh tuilleadh le rá agam faoin gceist sin ar ball ach roimhe sin ba mhaith liom tagairt ghairid a dhéanamh do thuarascálacha eile a d'eisigh an dara comhchoiste.  Cúig thuarascáil ar fad a d'eisigh an dara comhchoiste agus anuas ar na cinn a bhain leis na Tithe tugadh aghaidh ar an bhfeachtas fógraíochta a bhí beartaithe i dtaobh na Gaeilge, an Ghaeilge san fhógraíocht agus tionchar na ríomhaireachta ar an nGaeilge.  Ábhair shuimiúla iad sin go léir agus rinneadh go leor moltaí praiticiúla i ngach cás.  Ní mór a lua go bhfuil an coiste reatha i dteagmháil le daoine agus le heagrais éagsúla maidir leis an bhfeidhm a tugadh do go leor de na moltaí sin agus go bhfuilimid ag súil le dul chun cinn fiúntach ina leith.  Anuas ar na tuarascálacha a d'eisigh an comhchoiste sin bhí go leor rudaí eile ar bun ag na comhaltaí: chun dhá shampla a lua, thosaigh an comhchoiste sin ag tabhairt cuairteanna ar an nGaeltacht chun teagmháil a dhéanamh leis na pobail ansin agus bhí fochoiste foirmiúil ag plé le ceist na dtéacsleabhar scoile i nGaeilge.  Mar sin, d'éirigh leis an dara comhchoiste dul chun cinn fiúntach a dhéanamh i go leor réimsí.</P>
    <P>Is mithid anois díriú ar na tuarascálacha a luaitear sa tairiscint atá os ár gcomhair anseo inniu.  Baineann an dá cheann acu le ceist na Gaeilge i dTithe an <Col N="2026" /> Oireachtais agus tá go leor ábhar cainte iontu.  Níl i gceist agamsa dul isteach go ró-mhion iontu &mdash; dá ndéanfainn é sin thógfadh sé i bhfad níos mó ama ná mar atá ar fáil dom &mdash; agus beidh mé ag díriú, mar sin, ar na pointí is tábhachtaí, concentrating as it were, on the more important points, in my short script.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá leath sa dara tuarascáil, is iad sin an Ghaeilge sna páirtithe polaitíochta agus an Ghaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais. Maidir leis na páirtithe polaitíochta tá moltaí ciallmhara déanta chun an Ghaeilge a cur chun cinn ag gach leibhéal dóibh.  Ó mo thaithí féin agus ó thaithí na gComhaltaí uile den dá Theach is dócha go gcaithfimid go léir a admháil go bhféadfadh an scéal a bheith níos fearr i dtaobh na Gaeilge i ngníomhaíochtaí na bpáirtithe.  Anuas ar an ngá le cumas sa teanga a fheabhsú ag na leibhéil éagsúla is gá áit níos feiceálaí a thabhairt di freisin. Baineann an méid seo le gach páirtí agus is moltaí cruthaitheacha atá á ndéanamh a chabhróidh le hoifigigh chun an áit is dual di a thabhairt don Ghaeilge.  Is rudaí bunúsacha i dtaobh na páirtithe atá á mholadh sa tuarascáil atá os ár gcomhair agus ní fheicim fáth ar bith nach féidir feidhm a thabhairt dóibh uile gan mhoill. Dá ainneoin sin is beag eolais a bhí an dara comhchoiste in ann a fháil ó na páirtithe maidir leis na pleananna a bhí acu chun feidhm a thabhairt do na moltaí sin agus chun an Ghaeilge a cur chun cinn i gcoitinne ina gcuid gníomhaíochtaí.  Tá an tríú comhchoiste i dteagmháil leis na páirtithe anois chun soiléiriú agus tuilleadh eolais a fháil uathu.  Ní mór a lua faoin méid a bhaineann leis na páirtithe gurb é seo an chéad uair do pholaiteoirí a bheith ag díriú ar an obair a bhain leo féin &mdash; the first time the politicians directed their attention to matters that concerned themselves.  Ó tharla go bhfuil tuiscint agus eolas ar leith léirithe faoi na fadhbanna a bhaineann leis na páirtithe sa chás seo táim an-dóchasach go dtabharfar feidhm d'fhormhór na moltaí atá déanta.</P>
    <P>Baineann an chuid is mó den dara tuarascáil le ceist na Gaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach.  Faoi mar a deirtear sa tuarascáil <Col N="2027" /> féin tá meascán inti de mholtaí a rinneadh cheana agus de mholtaí as an nua.  Ar go leor bealaí is trua go raibh ar an gcomhchoiste bheith ag dul siar ar mholtaí a rinneadh cheana ach is dócha nach raibh dul as nuair nach raibh feidhm tugtha dóibh.  Tá roinnt dóibh ann nach bhfuil feidhm tugtha dóibh fós, áfach, agus beidh mé ag trácht ar ball orthu siúd agus ar an méid atá beartaithe ag an tríú comhchoiste a dhéanamh ina leith.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, cad iad na príomh mholtaí a rinneadh sa dara tuarascáil faoi na Tithe agus cad atá tar éis tarlú ina leith?  I mo thuairim is é an phríomh mholadh a rinneadh ná go gcuirfí seomra ar leith ar fáil i dTeach Laighean a d'fhéadfaí úsáid a bhaint as ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge &mdash; is éileamh í seo a bhí ag an gcéad chomhchoiste freisin.  Bhí beartaithe ag an gcomhchoiste go mbeadh seomra mar seo ina áis do na Comhaltaí uile den dá Theach agus go bhféadfaidís úsáid a bhaint as chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim, an méid a bhí acu cheana a fheabhsú, seirbhísí runaíochta a fháil i nGaeilge agus chun teacht le chéile ar bhonn neamh-fhoirmeálta d'fhonn comhrá a bheith acu i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Cé gur moladh simplí a bhí anseo bhí sé deacair go leor dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ina leith.  Is easpa spáis i dTeach Laighean ba chúis leis na deacrachtaí agus, cé gur cuireadh seomra ar fáil ar bhonn páirt-aimseartha, níor leor an méid sin agus níor baineadh úsáid as ach go fíor-annamh.  De bharr an easpa dul chun cinn faoin gceist seo bhuail toscaireacht ón dara Comhchoiste leis an gCeann Comhairle ach scoir an Dáil sin sular tharla mórán eile.  Nuair a tháinig an tríú Comhchoiste le chéile ag deireadh mí Eanáir i mbliana shocraíomar go gcaithfí aghaidh a thabhairt ar an gceist seo go práinneach agus lorgaíomar cruinniú leis an gCeann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom a bheith in ann a thabhairt le fios gur thug an Ceann Comhairle scéal dúinn go raibh sé ag cur seomra ar leith sa sean-Choláiste Ealaíona, taobh le Teach Laighean, ar fáil lena hathcóiriú ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Bhí cruinniú ag an gcomhchoiste aréir le hAiltire Sinsearach de <Col N="2028" /> chuid Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí agus scrúdaíomar dréacht pleananna a d'ullmhaigh sé don seomra.  Is féidir liom a dheimhniú anois gur áis den chéad scoth a bheidh ar fáil nuair a bheidh an obair go léir déanta agus táim féin agus na comhaltaí eile den chomchoiste thar a bheith sásta leis an toradh seo.  Beidh an seomra ar fáil tar éis na Cásca, tá súil againn, agus is iad na háiseanna a bheidh ar fáil ann ná: (a) cábáin speisialta chun úsáid a bhaint as téipeanna teagaisc d'fhonn a chumasú do Chomhaltaí den dá Theach an Ghaeilge a foghlaim nó a chleachtadh; (b) leabharlann beag de leabhair agus d'irisí éagsúla i nGáeilge; agus (c) áiseanna chruinneacháin a chuirfidh ar chumas trí nó ceithre Chomhalta teacht le chéile chun comhrá a bheith acu trí Ghaeilge.  Faoi mar a dúirt mé cheana tá an-áthas ar an gcomhchoiste go bhfuil beartaithe an áis thábhachtach seo a chur ar fáil agus fáiltim roimpi go fonnmhar.</P>
    <P>Ceann eile de na héilimh a bhí ag an gcéad comhchoiste ná go gcuirfí córas aistriúcháin comhuaineach ar fáil i Seanad Éireann.  Ní dhearnadh é sin agus mhol an dara comhchoiste go ndéanfaí é mar chuid lárnach de na hoibreacha feabhsúcháin a bhí le cur i gcrích sa Teach sin.  In ainneoin gur chuir an chomhchoiste a lán brú chun an áis a fháil curtha isteach sa Teach rinneadh na hoibreacha feabhsúcháin ach fágadh an córas aistriúcháin ar lár, faraor.  Tá sé suimiúil gur pléadh go leor de ghnó an tSeanaid i nGaeilge ar an lá a athosclaíodh an Teach athcóirithe agus gur tháinig gearáin ó gach taobh toisc nach raibh córas aistriúcháin comhuaineach ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Ní dhearnadh tuilleadh faoi chóras aistriúcháin comhuaineach a chur ar fáil go dtí gur tháinig an Seanad reatha le chéile don chéad uair i mí na Samhna seo caite. Ó shin i leith tá an cheist tógtha ag Seanadóirí ó gach taobh den Teach agus ní mór a rá gur luadh an fhadhb ag an gcéad chruinniú den Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge.  Lorgaíomar cruinniú go han-luath le Cathaoirleach an tSeanaid chun a chur ina luí air cé chomh tábhachtach agus a bhí an cheist seo.  Bhuaileamar leis an gCathaoirleach agus fuaireamar scéal uaidh le déanaí go mbeidh an córas á chur <Col N="2029" /> ar fáil le linn sos an tsamhraidh.  Tá dhá rud ar leith i gceist, siad sin, cábán a chur sa Teach don aistritheoir agus breis foirne a earcú chun freastal ar an obair seo. Tuigtear dúinn nach bhfuil an fhoireann bhreise ceadaithe fós ach táim an-dóchasach nach mbeidh aon fhadhb leis sin ag féachaint don obair thábhachtach atá le déanamh.</P>
    <P>Níor mhiste, b'fhéidir, an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an gceist seo a mhíniú ó tharla nach dtuigtear go forleathan sa Teach seo na fadhbanna atá ag Seamadóirí atá ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a úsáid. Tá córas aistriúchán sa Teach seo le fada an lá agus is féidir le Teachta a rogha teanga a úsáid agus a bheith cinnte de go dtuigfidh gach duine é, cé acu teanga a roghnaíonn sé.  Níl an scéal amhlaidh sa Seanad faoi láthair agus tá aon Seanadóir a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge ag saothrú faoi mhí bhuntáiste bunúsach.  Níor cheart go mbeadh an scéal mar sin agus is áthas liom go mbeidh sé leigheasta go luath.</P>
    <P>Not only may the translation process available in this House be used for the Irish language but it can also be used for other languages when visitors come who speak neither English or Irish.  It can be used by Deputies who might have some interest in the French language.  That is the merit of the new translation service in the Seanad.  Not only will it give those Senators who feel very strongly about the Irish language the opportunity of using it but it will also give other people the opportunity to speak in whatever language they wish.  That is also the great merit of this language laboratory. It is for any language anybody wants to learn &mdash; Hindi, French or German.  This marvellous facility can be used.  We are deeply grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for treating us so civilly and putting the matter in hands so quickly.  I think it will be a tremendous boost to the Irish language and to any other language that people want to learn.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh moladh sa dara tuarascáil faoi ranganna Gaeilge a chur ar fáil do Chomhaltaí den dá Theach.  Sular scoir sé bhí an dara Comhchoiste i dteagmháil leis an gCeann Comhairle agus le Gaeleagras <Col N="2030" /> na Seirbhíse Poiblí maidir le dianchúrsaí a eagrú do Chomhaltaí sa Ghaeltacht agus ranganna a chur ar fáil ina dhiaidh sin i dTeach Laighean.  Luamar an cheist seo leis an gCeann Comhairle arís le déanaí agus tá beartaithe aige í a hathbheochan gan mhoill.</P>
    <P>Luaigh mé níos luaithe an easpa feiceálachais a bhain leis an nGaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Cé gur glacadh bearta áirithe chun an fhadhb sin a leigheas ba léir go raibh gá le tuilleadh, agus is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta ansin freisin.  Freagraítear na teileafóin i dTeach Laighean go dátheangach nóin i nGaeilge amháin nuair a bhíodh siad á bhfreagairt i mBéarla amháin roimhe seo; tá irisí Gaeilge ar fáil san fheitheamhlann agus tuigim go mbeidh fógraí á gcur ar fáil go luath sna hoifigí fáilte ag tabhairt le fios go mbeifear sásta gnó a dhéanamh i nGaeilge.  Is mion-rudaí iad seo ar fad ach tá tábhacht leo maidir le háit fheiceálach don Ghaeilge.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to Members of the committee who have been meeting once a fortnight &mdash; and will continue to meet once a fortnight during the sitting of the Dáil &mdash; to further the progress of the Irish language. I am deeply grateful to them for their attendance as it is fundamental to the continued existence of this very important committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the begining of my speech, many of us do not have the Irish language go flúirseach.  I have been out of practice for the last 30 years but I have learned more of the language in the last two months than I did in those 30 years.  It is all coming back to me.  I had it go flúirseach 30 years ago and I lost it through lack of practice.  It is about practice and I am deeply grateful for the generosity and decency of the members of Comhchoiste na Gaeilge who have elected me as chairman and have been patient with me in the context of my <Col N="2031" /> returning to a knowledge of a language which should be our first language.</P>

      <P>Sílim gur tráthúil an rud go bhfuil an dara agus an tríú tuarascáil den dara Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge á bplé ansea sa Dáil maidin inniu.  Ba mhaith liom an Chathaoirleach atá againn, an Teachta Andrews, a mholadh as an iarracht mhór atá déanta aige féin ó ceapadh é mar Chathaoirleach ar an tríú comhchoiste.  Bhí mé féin mar bhall de na trí chomhchoiste a bhí ann go dtí againn, ba é fear Gaeltachta cosúil liom féin a bhí ina Aire Stáit agus atá anois ina Chathaoirleach ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, an t-iarTheachta Denis Gallagher as Gaeltacht Mhaigh Eo, fear a bhfuil suim mhór aige sa Ghaeilge agus i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, fear a rinne obair mhór nuair a bhí sé ina Chathaoirleach ar an chéad chomhchoiste.</P>
      <P>Ba é an dara Cathaoirleach a bhí againn ná fear Gaeltachta eile, an Seanadóir Tomás Mac Gearailt as an Daingean i gContae Chiarraí, Gaeilgeoir breá a bhfuil suim aige sa Ghaeilge agus a rinne an-chuid oibre fad agus bhí sé ina Chathaoirleach.  Agus ar an tríú Comhchoiste tá mar Chathaoirleach, mar a dúirt mé, an Teachta Andrews a chuir an Tuarascáil seo i láthair na Dála ar maidin.  Tá creidiúint mhór ag dul dó. Mar a dúirt sé féin, d'fhoghlaim sé an Ghaeilge nuair a bhí sé níos óige, nuair a bhí sé ag dul chun na scoile, agus sa Ghaeltacht féin, ach, le blianta anuas ní raibh deis aige an teanga a chleachtadh. Ó rinneadh cathaoirleach de ar an chomhchoiste, sílim go bhfuil sé ag éirí níos líofa in aghaidh an lae, tá a chroí san áit cheart, agus tá an-chuid oibre déanta aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> An chéad dá choiste a bhí againn, chuir muid á lán tuarascála amach, sílim cúig cinn ar fad, mar a luaigh an Cathaoirleach, agus tá siad ansin.  Tá a lán oibre curtha isteach iontu, a lán smaointe úra, agus is é an jab, i mo thuairimse, atá le déanamh ag an chomchoiste a bhfuil muid ag feidhmiú air i láthair na huaire ná na moltaí sin a chur i bhfeidhm.  Mar a dúirt an Cathaoirleach, tá cúpla ceann acu san curtha i bhfeidhm, nó á gcur i bhfeidhm ó ceapadh an tríú comhchoiste.</P>
    <P>Rinne an cathaoirleach tagairt do sheomra na Gaeilge atá ag dul ar aghaidh go breá agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé oscailte gan mhoill i ndiaidh na Cásca. Chomh maith leis sin, rinne sé tagairt don chóras aistriúcháin atá le cur ar fáil sa Seanad.  Ba mhaith liom cuidiú go mór leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an chathaoirleach faoi do chuid iarrachtaí féin, a Cheann Comhairle.  Táimíd faoi chomaoin agat mar gheall ar an tacaíocht a bhí le fail againn aon uair dá ndeachaidh muid ar thoscaireacht nó aon uair a chás muid leat.  Bhí tú i gcónaí sásta am a thabhairt dúinn agus éisteacht linn agus comhoibriú, a thabhairt dúinn, agus táimid thar a bheith buíoch díot mar má tá comhoibriú, tacaíocht agus tuiscint mar sin le fáil ó Cheann Comhairle, beidh obair an Chomhchoiste i bhfad níos fearr agus níos fusa.  Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom thú a mholadh as an dea-shampla a thugann tú sa Teach.  Ní fearr Gaeltachta tú.  Is dócha gur fhoghlaim tú do chuid Gaeilge nuair a bhí tú ag dul ar scoil cosúil leis an chuid eile de na daoine sa Teach.  Mar sin féin, cibé deis a bhíonn agat tá tú sásta treoracha an Tí agus gnáthchaint agus gnáthorduithe an Tí a thabhairt i nGaeilge.  Sin ceann de na cuspóirí atá againn, go mbeidh atmasféar Gaeilge agus atmasféar Gaelach anseo sa Dáil, agus tá tú féin agus an Leas-Cheann Comhairle ag déanamh an-chuid oibre, agus ba mhaith liom é sin a lua.</P>
    <P>Is minic a cuireadh tuarascáil ar fáil maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa Dáil agus taobh amuigh, ach níl mé chun dul siar ar na téarmaí tagartha, tá siad sin luaite ag an cathaoirleach.  An chéad tuarascáil a cuireadh ar fáil maidir leis an <Col N="2033" /> Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht ná coimisiún na Gaeltachta sna ficheadaí.  Rinne siad sin moltaí ag an am.  Bhí coimisiún eile againn sna seascaidí, Coimisiún um Athbheochan na Gaeilge agus chuir siadsan a gcuid tuairimí i láthair an Tí i 1963. Bhí mé ag léamh na dtuairiscí sin i rith na seachtaine agus sílim go raibh ocht moltaí sa tuairisc sin a cuireadh i láthair na Dála i 1963, ocht gcinn atá an-chosúil leis an rud a bhfuil muid ag caint orthu go fóill.</P>
    <P>Dúradh gur chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge ag na daoine a bhíonn ag cur tuairisce ar imeachtaí an Tí, gur chóir go mbeadh córas aistriúcháin do na Teachtaí agus do na Seanadóirí, gur chóir do na páirtithe tacaíocht a thabhairt d'iarrthóirí a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  Na moltaí seo a cuireadh inár láthair i 1963, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil siad cosúil le cuid de na moltaí a bhfuil muid ag caint orthu go fóill.  Tá dul chun cinn déanta.  Mar a dúirt mé, tá córas aistriúcháin anseo sa Dáil, beidh sé sa Seanad gan mhoill, agus cuireann sé áthas agus lúcháir orm nuair a thagaim isteach anseo agus nuair a fheicim daoine nach raibh an seans céanna acu agus a bhí agamsa agus ag daoine eile, agus atá sásta an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim, go bhfuil siad sásta úsáid a bhaint as an chóras sin.</P>
    <P>Cad é an mhaitheas córas aistriúcháin a bheith againn, cad é an mhaitheas costas a chur orainn féin le é a chur ar fáil, cad é an mhaitheas an t-airgead sin uilig a chaitheamh mura bhfuil daoine sásta úsáid a bhaint as.  Cuireann sé áthas orm, mar a dúirt mé, nuair a fheicim daoine ag teacht isteach anseo, nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh líofa acu agus atá ag an chuid eile againn, agus atá sásta úsáid a bhaint as an chóras aistriúcháin. Tá súil agam go ndéanfar an rud céanna sa Seanad.</P>
    <P>An dara tuarascáil a cuireadh ar fáil maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge sna páirtithe polaitíochta agus sa Teach, tá ocht mórmholtaí inti.  An chéad cheann baineann sé leis an Ghaeilge agus na páirtithe polaitíochta.  Is é an dara ceann, an Ghaeilge agus an obair i dTithe an Oireachtais a chur chun cinn istigh anseo. Seirbhísí tacaíochta i nGaeilge do Chomhaltaí an dá Theach, sin an tríú <Col N="2034" /> moladh atá sa Tuarascáil, agus sílim go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh againn ansin, mar adúirt an Cathaoirleach, tá seomra na Gaeilge á chur ar fáil; beidh comhairle agus cuidiú le fáil sa seomra ag aon chomhaltaí a bhfuil fonn orthu gnótha a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais.  An ceathrú moladh ná, an Ghaeilge agus na coistí Oireachtais, sé sin tá Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, ach tá coistí Oireachtais eile, agus sílim gur chóir go mbeadh siad ábalta úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaeilge anois agus arís.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na deacrachtaí, ceann de na laigí a fheicimse a bhaineann le Gaeilge anseo, go minic nuair a bhímid ag plé cúrsaí Roinn na Gaeltachta nó Údarás na Gaeltachta, nó Bord na Gaeilge, ná go mbaineann muid úsáid as an Ghaeilge, ach nuair a bhíonn muid ag plé rudaí a bhaineann leis an Roinn Comhshaoil, nó an Roinn Cosanta nó an Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha, nó Ranna eile, go minic bainimid úsáid as an Bhéarla agus ní bhaintear aon úsáid as an Ghaeilge. Ceann de na moltaí atá déanta sa Tuarascáil seo, agus a bhí déanta ag Bord na Gaeilge, gur chóir go mbainfimis úsáid go rialta as an Ghaeilge, is cuma cad é an t-ábhar atá ar siúl againn.  Fiú amháin má bhíonn ceisteanna á gcur síos, ní cóir go gcuirfí síos na ceisteanna Gaeltachta amháin i nGaeilge ach go gcuirfí síos ceisteanna i nGaeilge le haghaidh Ranna eile, agus go mbeadh an stádas céanna le feiceáil go soiléir ag an Ghaeilge agus atá ag an Bhéarla.</P>
    <P>Sílim, agus muid ag plé na Tuarascála seo gur cóir dúinn féinscrúdú a dhéanamh ar cheist na Gaeilge sa tír faoi láthair. B'fhéidir nach aontóimis uilig le sin, ach cé go bhfuil comharthaí dóchais le feiceáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil naíscoileanna agus Gaelscoileanna á gcur ar bun agus mar sin de, tá comharthaí go leor éadóchais ann chomh maith, chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an Ghaeilge. Níl mé ag cur lochta ar Rialtas amháin ná ar Rialtas eile, ach sin mar atá sé.</P>
    <P>Is fear Gaeltachta mé féin agus tá sé soiléir go bhfuil an Béarla ag brú isteach fiú amháin ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé le tabhairt faoi deara ar na daoine óga chomh maith, agus nuair a fheicimid cad <Col N="2035" /> é atá ag dul ar aghaidh taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, go speisialta sna scoileanna agus sa chóras oideachais, sílim go bhfuil an Ghaeilge lag go maith sa chóras oideachais. Níl mé ag cur lochta ar na múinteoirí agus níl mé ag cur lochta ar na daltaí, tá mé ag cur lochta ar an chóras féin, tá mé ag cur lochta ar na modhanna múinte atá againn agus ar an ábhar a thugtar do na daltaí.  Tá an t-ábhar seanaimseartha, agus is iontach an rud é go bhfuil sa chóras oideachais anseo go mbíonn na daltaí ag foghlaim Ghaeilge ón chéad lá a théann siad ar scoil go dtí an lá a fhágann siad an scoil ag sé nó seacht mbliana dhéag, agus céadchodán an-íseal ar fad a bhíonn ábalta a gcaint agus a gcomhrá a dhéanamh trí mhéan na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Nuair a tharlaíonn sé sin, sílim go bhfuil sé in am againn scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an gcóras agus athruithe a chur i bhfeidhm, mar níl sé sin sásúil.  Mar atá a fhios againn uilig, is féidir leat dianchúrsa a dhéanamh i dteanga Eorpach, agus dianchúrsa a dhéanamh i nGaeilge ó Ghael-Linn agus bíonn daoine chomh líofa tar éis dianchúrsa a mhaireann sé seachtainí agus a bhíonn daltaí a bhíonn ag déanamh na Gaeilge ar feadh a saoil scoile.</P>
    <P>Déarfainn féin gur ceann de na rudaí atá mícheart faoi láthair ná nach bhfuil pleanáil cheart againn.  Níl pleanáil cheart maidir le Gaeilge nó cad é is cóir a dhéanamh. Cuir i gcás, sé an fáth go bhfuil an Comhchoiste Gaeilge ann, agus an ceann a bhí roimhe sin, agus an chéad ceann, ná gur mhol Bord na Gaeilge sa chéad Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge ó 1983 go 1987 go mbeadh comhchoiste Oireachtais ann.  Glacadh leis an moladh sin ag an am.  Bhí moltaí eile sa phlean gníomhaíochta, níl fhios agam ar cuireadh i bhfeidhm iad nó nár cuireadh; ní shílim gur cuireadh.  Ach ba rud maith an plean a chum Bord na Gaeilge.  Tháinig an comhchoiste amach as agus táimid ag plé na moltaí agus an dul chun cinn atá déanta.</P>
    <P>Ach is é an deacracht agus an laige a fheicimse gur chóir go mbeadh plean eile ó'87 go dtí'91, agus plean eile ó'91 go dtí'95, ach faoi láthair níl aon phlean a <Col N="2036" /> fheicim á chur i bhfeidhm, agus mar a dúirt mé tá locht orainn uilig.  Bhí an chéad phlean go maith, bhí torthaí air, agus tá Bord na Gaeilge ansin go fóill.  Is cinnte nach bhfuil na baill uilig ar an mbord, tá roinnt folúntas le líonadh.  Níl aon Chathaoirleach ar an bhord le bliain go leith agus sílim go bhfuil sé in am cathaoirleach a chur isteach ann.  Níl shílim go bhfuil aon Bhord Stáit reachtúil sa tír atá fágtha gan Chathaoirleach ar feadh bliain go leith agus tá súil agam go ndíreoidh an Rialtas agus an tAire agus an Roinn a n-aire ar an fhadhb sin agus é a réiteach chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Tá trí eagraíocht reachtúla freagrach as polasaihe Gaeilge.  Tá Roinn na Gaeltachta féin, tá an tAire Stáit linn anseo, tá Bord na Gaeilge, a bhfuil seasamh reachtúil aige, agus tá Údarás na Gaeltachta. Ba chóir go mbeadh comhordú idir na trí dreamanna sin, is é sin go mbeadh an polasaí céanna acu maidir leis an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht féin.  Ní shílim go bhfuil an teagmháil cheart idir na trí boird.  Tá a fhios agam i bplean Bhord na Gaeilge go raibh na trí dreamanna ábalta teacht le chéile, agus go raibh sé sin ag tarlú ar feadh tamaill, go raibh bord comhordaithe ann maidir le polasaíthe Gaeilge, ach níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé sin ag teacht le chéile go rialta anois. Sílim gur chóir go ndéanfaí breathnú air sin agus go dtiocfadh siad le chéile go rialta, agus go mbeadh polasaí ceart againn.  Tá sé mar chúram ar an Chomhchoiste an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn taobh amuigh de Thithe an Oireachtais. Tá dul chun cinn áirithe déanta againn taobh istigh de Thithe an Oireachtais agus sílim gur féidir linn níos mó a dhéanamh, ach tá freagracht orainn dul chun cinn taobh amuigh de Thithe an Oireachtais a chur ar aghaidh chomh maith.  Ceann de na deacrachtaí is mó a fheicim ná go bhfuil easpa polasaí, agus gurb é an polasaí atá againn anois ná &ldquo;fág rudaí mar atá, beidh sé ceart go leor&rdquo;, agus táimid ag dul ó lá go lá agus ó bhliain go bliain, tá géarghá la plean eile agus le leanúnachas ó phlean amháin go plean eile.  Sílim go bhfuil ceann curtha ar fáil don Roinn le cúpla bliain ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé ar <Col N="2037" /> intinn é a chur i bhfeidhm, nó an bhfuil dearmad déanta de.  Ach, má táimid dáiríre, caithfear é a phleanáil, nó mura ndéantar é beidh an Ghaeilge í féin ag meath mar atá anois.</P>
    <P>Sílim gurb é an Teachta Higgins a dúirt go raibh fealsúnacht sa tír seo, fealsúnacht eacnamaíochta go raibh an teanga Gaeilge agus an t-am a bhí muid ag caitheamh leis an Ghaeilge ag cur isteach ar fhorbairt eacnamaíochta na tíre, agus dá mbeadh Béarla againn uilig nó Gearmáinis againn uilig, nó Fraincís againn uilig, go mbeadh deireadh lenár gcuid deacrachtaí eacnamaíochta, nach mbeadh dífhostaíocht sa tír, ná boilsciú nach mbeadh imirce sa tír, agus bhí siad ag cur lochta ar an am a bhíonn muid ag caitheamh leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag léamh le cúpla seachtain leabhar úr atá ar an mhargadh ag stairí mór de chuid na tíre, an tOllamh Lee as Coláiste Ollscoile Chorcaí, agus caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir sé áthas orm go bhfuil sé i ndiaidh an teoiric seo a thógáil, agus is é an chéad duine acadúil, chomh fada agus is eol dom, a thóg an teoiric seo go raibh an Ghaeilge ag cur isteach ar ár bhforbairt eacnamaíochta.  Thóg sé pointe i ndiaidh pointe, agus tá sé i ndiaidh argóintí móra a chur suas, agus tá súil agam go dtosóidh sé seo díospóireacht ar fud na tíre faoi cén buntáiste atá sa Ghaeilge, cad é an tábhacht atá sa Ghaeilge, agus cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé dár bhféiniúlacht agus dár meas féin.</P>
    <P>Thug sé sampla de thíortha na hEorpa, tíortha cosúil leis an bhFionlainn, a bhfuil mionteanga acu, tír cosúil leis an Iorua, an tSualainn agus an Ísealtír, agus níl siadsan ag cur deiridh lena dteanga náisiúnta féin, agus ag foghlaim na Gearmáinise, nó na Rúisise nó an Bhéarla.  Tá siad brodúil as a dteanga féin.  Tuigeann siad gurb í an pháirt is tábhachtaí dá gcultúr féin, tugann sé mórtas cine dóibh, agus ó thaobh na heacnamaíochta de, dá mbeadh muidne sa tír seo ag déanamh chomh maith leo, is beag deacracht eacnamaíochta a bheadh againn.  Sílim gur leabhar an-tábhachtach é, agus go gcaithfimid ár n-aire a dhíriú ar na teoiricí <Col N="2038" /> a chuir sé inár láthair, agus sílim go bhfuil a lán le foghlaim againn astu.</P>
    <P>Tá an t-am atá againn teoranta, ach sílim gurb í an Ghaeilge an gné is tábhachtaí agus is luachmhaire agus is suntasaí dár gcúltúr agus dár dtraidisiún.  Tá an ceol againn agus tá na rincí againn ach, mar sin féin, is í an teanga Gaeilge an gné is tábhachtaí ar fad, an seod is luachmhaire. Táimid anseo mar pholaiteoirí, agus an ghlúin daoine atá sa tír i láthair na huaire, tugadh an teanga anuas againn ó na cianta.  Tá sí againn anois agus tá sé de dhualgas agus de fhreagracht orainn an teanga sin a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile atá ag teacht ar aghaidh.  Cá fios nó go nglacfaidh siad an teanga, agus go gcuirfidh siad níos mó béime uirthi ná mar atáimid féin.</P>
    <P>Tá an dualgas sin orainn agus caithfimid smaoineamh cad é an rud is fearr a dhéanamh.  Tá géarghá le plean agus caithfimid go léir dul le chéile agus é a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ní rud é a bhaineann le páirtí amháin nó le páirtí eile, ná le haon dream ar leith sa Teach.  Baineann sé linn uilig mar Ghaeil.  Agus an Eoraip ag éirí níos dlúithe anois, tá sé níos tábhachtaí ná riamh go gcoinneoimid ár dteanga féin, agus sin ceann de na cuspóirí a chaithfidh bheith ag an chomhchoiste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom an t-am atá ar fáil agam a roinnt idir mé féin agus an Teachta O'Shea.  Beidh an chuid is mó den am seo á úsáid ag an Teachta O'Shea.  Fuair mé cuireadh ón Teachta Andrews, Cathaoirleach an Chomhchoiste, páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht seo, agus táim buíoch de as an seans atá ar fáil inniu.  Tá cúpla rud le rá agamsa sa díospóireacht.  Ar an gcéad dul síos léirigh an suirbhé go bhfuil dea-mhian i measc.  Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí don Ghaeilge, agus go bhfuil said sásta úsáid na Gaeilge a fhorbairt i dTithe an Oireachtais. Ba mhaith liom, mar cheannaire Dream an Lucht Oibre, a gheallúint go ndéanfaidh mé féin, agus an páirtí, ár ndícheall cabhrú leis an bhforbairt sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fuair mé litir ó Chathaoirleach an Chomhchoiste agus chuir sé rudaí éagsúla in iúl dom.  D'fhreagair mé an litir sin <Col N="2039" /> agus dúirt mé leis an Teachta Andrews go ndéanfadh Dream an Lucht Oibre gach dícheall, na moltaí a chuir sé amach chugainn a chur i bhfeidhm.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, d'iarr sé orainn go n-úsáidfeadh uachtarán an pháirtí an Ghaeilge i ngnáthimeachtaí, a oiread agus is féidir. Tá mise chun iarracht a dhéanamh an teanga a úsáid chomh fada agus is féidir liom.  Beidh mé ag iarraidh, sna ráitis a chuirim amach gach lá, ceann amháin a chur amach i nGaeilge gach seachtain. Beidh mé ag iarraidh ag gach cruinniú a bheas ar siúl ag Páirtí an Lucht Oibre plé in nGaeilge a shocrú i gcuid den chruinniú, an agenda, go háirithe ag an cruinnithe gach Céadaoin.  Sa chaoi sin beidh na Teachtaí ábalta rudaí beaga a dhéanamh chun cabhrú leis na haidhmeanna agus na moltaí a chur an Comhchoiste faoinár mbráid.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith le sin beidh mé ag iarraidh ar choiste feidhmiúcháin an pháirtí an Ghaeilge a úsáid ag a ngnáthchruinniú uair amháin sa mhí.  Is é mo thuairim nach bhfuil staid na Gaeilge rómhaith an lá atá inniu ann.  Caithfimid mar Theachtaí agus mar Sheanadóirí san Oireachtas, iarracht láidir a dhéanamh chun cabhrú leis na daoine atá ag obair taobh amuigh den Oireachtas chun an teanga a chur ar aghaidh, agus gnáthúsáid a bhaint aisti.  Tá súil agam, de bharr na díospóireachta seo, go dtarlóidh rudaí san Oireachtas.  Sa seomra atá curtha ar fáil ag an gCeann Comhairle, beidh seans ag na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí an Ghaeilge a chleachtadh agus a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Tá sé deacair an teanga a chleachtadh. Tá sí ceart go leor ag an Teachta McGinley agus a chairde ó Dhún na nGall, tá siad an-mhaith, agus ag an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Gallagher freisin.  Caithfimidne, na Teachtaí eile, iarracht a dhéanamh, agus déanfaimid é ón lá seo amach.  Ba mhaith liom geallúint a thabhairt do Chathaoirleach agus do bhaill an Chomhchoiste go mbeimid, as seo amach, ag iarraidh na moltaí a chuir siad romhainn a chur i bhfeidhm.  Beimid ag déanamh iarrachtaí beaga i dtosach agus, as sin amach, beimid ag dul chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Níl mé i mo bhall den chomhchoiste, ach ar feadh tamaill bhig, agus rud amháin a chuir an-áthas orm in imeachtaí an chomhchoiste sin go bhfuil na baill go léir ag tabhairt faoi cheist na Gaeilge dáiríre.  Ní bhraithfeá ag na cruinnithe go raibh daoine ann ó Fhianna Fáil, Fhine Gael, ón Lucht Oibre agus Neamhspleách.  Tá an meon ceart ag an gcomhchoiste, agus, mar a dúirt an Teachta McGinley, tá an-chuid déanta ag an gcathaoirleach ó cuireadh an coiste seo ar bun, agus tá mé lánchinnte go leanfaidh an comhchoiste mar sin ag tabhairt ceannaireachta don Dáil agus don Seanad i dtaobh fhorbairt na Gaeilge sna Tithe seo.</P>
      <P>Tá an cheist i bhfad níos leithne ná sin. Bhí mé i mo mhúinteoir scoile ar feadh níos mó ná scór bliain sular tháinig mé go dtí an Seanad i 1987, agus rud amháin an-tábhachtach a d'fhoghlaim mé le linn na tréimhse sin ná gurb é dea-shampla an mhúinteora is fearr, an dea-shampla an chinnireacht is fearr.  Tá dualgas an-mhór orainne sna Tithe i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus i dtaobh athbheochan na Gaeilge. Mura dtagann an dea-shampla go tréan agus go minic ó na Tithe seo, tá mé ag ceapadh nach dtiocfaidh aon fheabhas ar an scéal mar atá sé.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt An Teachta Dick Spring, níl an scéal go rómhaith i dtaobh na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre ag an nóiméad. Bhí an méid céanna le rá ag an Teachta McGinley.  Nílimid ag rá mar náisiún cén fáth gur ceart an Ghaeilge a athbheochan mar theanga bheo.  Éireannaigh sinn, daoine éagsúla, daoine go bhfuil cultúr dár gcuid féin againn, go bhfuil stair fhada agus stair go bhfuil an-chuid deathréithe ag baint leis.  Tá mise ag rá i dtaobh na Geailge, go bhfuil sé de dhualgas orainn an tírghrá a athbheochan ar an gcéad dul síos, go mbeadh bród orainn mar Theachtaí anseo gur Éireannaigh sinn, agus go gcabhróimid leis an bhród sin a chothú i measc an phobail, go mórmhór sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá gné eile den cheist seo ann.  Tá lucht eacnamaíochta ag rá linn go mbeidh an <Col N="2041" /> chuid is mó de na postanna ar fáil amach anseo i gcúrsaí turasóireachta agus caitheamh aimsire.  Na turasóirí a thagann go dtí an tír seo ón iasacht, ó Mheiricrá, agus ó Mhór-Roinn na hEorpa, tá an-suim acusan sa stair, sna fothraigh stairiúla &mdash; roots, cuirim i gcás, ag na daoine a thagann ó Mheiriceá agus gur tháinig a muintir ón tír seo.  B'fhéidir nach nglacann muid leis go bhfuil saibhreas againn chun daoine a mhealladh go dtí an tír seo mar chuairteoirí chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar na fothraigh atá againn, nó chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar ár stair.  Más rud é go bhfuilimid chun turasóireacht a fhorbairt i gceart sa tír seo, tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh an pobal go léir páirteach san obair sin.  Mar chéadchéim san obair seo caithfimid an tírghrá a fhorbairt sa Teach seo, sa Seanad nó ar fud na tíre agus sa Ghaeltacht.  Rud eile a d'fhoghlaim mé nuair a bhí mé ag múineadh na Gaeilge, an straitéis is fearr a úsáid ná an beagán a úsáid go mion agus go minic.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhneach liom nuair a bhí mé ag freastal ar an mheánscoil i bPort Láirge, ag Cnoc Síon, bhí Bráthair again san Ardteist, an Bráthair Ó Catháin, a fuair bás le déanaí, go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam, agus séard a deireadh sé linn i gcónaí: Labhair an teanga, ná bíodh eagla oraibh go ndéanfaidh sibh tuaiplis sa ghramadach, agus mura mbíonn an focal Gaeilge agat cuir isteach an focal Béarla. Sa rang sin fuair an uile dhuine onóracha i nGaeilge san Ardteist.  Thuig seisean rud an-tábhachtach, gur as labhairt na teanga a thagann an fhorbairt.  Agus b'fhéidir sna laethanta atá imithe go raibh sórt élitism ag dul leis an Ghaeilge, agus na daoine a bhí ag caint leis an náisiún mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge, bhí siadsan ag cur eagla ar dhaoine.  Bhí eagla ar dhaoine go ndéanfadh siad botún agus a leithéid.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Spring, léirigh an suirbhé go bhfuil an-dea-mhéin i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Tá mise cinnte go bhfuil an dea-mhéin céanna ar fáil i measc an phobail.</P>
    <P>Déanaimid dearmad in amanna, go bhfuil cuid mhaith focail Ghaeilge i ngnáthúsáid i measc an Bhéarla ar fud na tíre.  I bPort Láirge, cuirim i gcás, Déise, tá iris a chuirtear amach ag an Old Waterford <Col N="2042" /> Society, agus a raibh alt ann cúpla bliain ó shin, liosta focal a bhí i ngnáthúsáid i measc an Bhéarla i sráidbhaile beag agus an ceantar mórthimpeall air in aice leis an Trá Mhór.  Focail mar bóithrín, sceach, bothán, toiteog, amadán agus óinseach.  Tá focail mar sin ann agus i ngnáthúsáid i measc an Bhéarla.  Sin gné den Ghaeilge bheo atá againn go fóill.</P>
    <P>Rud eile atá an-tábhachtach, ceapaim, ná go mbeadh tuiscint ag an phobal i gcoitinne ar na logainmneachta.  Mar shampla, tagaim ón Trá Mhór.  Tá an t-ainm sothuigthe ón trá (strand).  Dún Mór áit eile.  Tá an-chuid dúnta ar fud an chontae as a dtagaimse agus ar fud na tíre.  Tá an-chuid de stair na tíre le fáil ó na logainmneacha céanna, ó logainmneacha bailte, ceantair, paróistí agus a leithéid, agus sin rud go mba mhaith liom go mbeadh níos mó béime air ó thaobh chúrsaí craolacháin agus teilifíse.  Tá suim ar leith ag daoine in ainm a n-áite féin nó áiteanna atá ar eolas acu a thuiscint níos fearr.  Agus ag an am céanna tá na focail Ghaeilge atá acu ag forbairt an t-am go léir.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-tábhachtach a chur ina luí ar dhaoine nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh deacair sin le foghlaim.  Tá an Béarla i bhfad níos deacra ná an Ghaeilge.  Tá sé níos fusa Port Láirge&mdash;the harbour that's shaped like a thigh &mdash; a thuiscint ná an leagan Béarla.  Goilleann sé orm nach mbainimid úsáid go forleathan as an saibhreas atá againn ó thaobh na staire agus ó thaobh na teanga.  Sa Ghaeilge tá litríocht an-mhaith againn, litríocht a bhfuil clú air ar fud an domhain.  Níl an cultúr sin nó níl na scríbhinní sin ar fáil i gceart don phobal i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do theilifís na Gaeltachta.  Ceapaim go bhfuil meon de shaghas Anglo-Meiriceánach ag dul i bhfeidhm ar aos óg na tíre seo faoi láthair.  Measaim go ndeánfadh Teilifís na Gaeltachta, mar atá geallta ag an Taoiseach dúinn, an-difríocht do chúrsaí na Gaeilge sa Ghalltacht.  Tá daoine ann a cheapann nár chóir ach Gaeilge na nGaeltachtaí a úsáid ar an stáisiún seo.  Ní aontaím leis an dtuairim sin.  Chruthaigh Liam Ó Murchú lena <Col N="2043" /> chlár &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; go bhfuil an-suim ag muintir na tíre seo sa dá-theangachas. Ní foláir an staisiún seo teilifíse a bhunadh go luath óir go bhfuil an t-am ag gabháil thart gan aon dul chun cinn á dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam, maidir leis an dá-theangachas, go mbeidh béim mhór ar na logainmneacha, ar na focail Ghaeilge atá i ngnáth-usáid ag lucht an Bhéarla agus ar stair, ar chultúr agus ar áilleacht na tíre. Chuideodh sé seo leis an tír-ghrá, ar ar thrácht mé cheana, a chothú agus a fhorbairt. Is é múscailt an tír-ghrá seo is bunús le gnéithe eile &mdash; agus as a dtiocfaidh forbaírt na ngnéithe seo &mdash; ar nós an teanga, an cultúr, meon na tíre agus forbairt eacnamaíochta na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ní mór dúinn a bheith bródúil as ár n-aitheantas mar Éireannaigh, mar thír ar leithligh, mar mhuintir atá inchurtha le nó níos fearr ná aon phobal eile ar domhan.  Dá bhféadfaimis an tír-ghrá a fhorbairt ó thaobh na staire de, creidim go gcabhródh sé sin go mór le ath-aontú na tíre.  Bítear de shíor ag caint ar athaontú na tíre agus ar athbheochan na teanga ach is annamh a bhíonn ann ach caint.  Feictear domsa ón gcomhchoiste agus ón méid atá cloiste agam timpeall an Tí de dhíospóireachtaí ó na páirithe éagsúla, go n-eireoidh linn an dul chun cinn seo a dhéanamh i leith na Gaeilge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom, le do thoil, mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Mac Giolla.  Fáiltím roimh an díospóireacht seo. Tugann sé deis dúinn ceist na Gaeilge a phlé, ní hamháin mar a bhaineann sé le hobair an Oireachtais ach le stádas na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.  Molaim an méid a dúirt an Teachta Andrews agus an obair atá déanta ag an gcomhchoiste.  Tá dhá thuarascáil os ár gcomhair agus ba mhaith liom, ar dtús, tagairt a dhéanamh do leathanach a seacht sa chéad tuarascáil agus do leathanach a naoi sa dara ceann; is orthu siúd a ainmnítear comhaltaí an chomhchoiste.  Mar a fheicfear, ní raibh ball de Pháirtí na nOibrithe ar cheachtar den dá chomhchoiste.  Ní bhfuair siad áit ach oireach ar an dtríú comhchoiste, a <Col N="2044" /> toghadh cúpla mí ó shin.  Is mór an trua é sin agus dá bharr, ní raibh aon deis againn ár gcuid smaointe i dtaobh na Gaeilge a phlé leis na comhaltaí eile.  Ar an ábhar sin, fáiltím go speisialta roimh an ndíospóireacht seo a thugann seans dúinn ár ndearcadh ar chúrsaí Gaeilge a chur faoi bhráid na Dála.</P>
      <P>Níor tugadh seans dúinn a bheith páireach sa chomhchoiste mar gur dearnadh gnó páirtí-polaitiúil de.  Má tá ábhar ar bith ann ar fiú a phlé go lánpháirtíoch is í an Ghaeilge an t-ábhar sin.  Caitear droch-mheas ar an teanga nuair déantar liathróid pholaitiúil de, mar a tharla cúpla bliain ó shin nuair a roghnaíodh an comhchoiste. Dúradh le Páirtí na nOibrithe ar an ócáid sin nach bhfaighidís áit ar an gcomhchoiste go dtí go mbeadh seachtar Teachtaí Dála acu.  Nuair a shroicheamar an uimhir sin, athraíodh na rialacha agus ní bhfuaireamar áit ar an dtríú comhchoiste ach oiread.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liom nach bhfuil cothrom na Feínne á fháil ag Páirtí na nOibrithe sa Dáil seo.  Chonaiceamar sampla den dearcadh seo aréir nuair a déanadh iarracht anseo ceart labhartha a bhaint de cheannaire an pháirtí.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh meas níos mó ar mholtaí an chomhchoiste dá mbeadh cur isteach ann ó 'chuile Theachta Dála a mbeadh suim ar leith acu sa Ghaeilge.  Is trua liom nach ndearna an comhchoiste a leithéid sin de mholadh.  Dá ndéanfadh, b'fhéidir nach mbeimís anseo ag machnamh ar an scannal faoi leith seo.  D'ullmhaigh an comhchoiste tuarascáil ceithre bliana ó shin, inar déanadh cúig moltaí is fiche ach níor gníomhaíodh dá réir.</P>
      <P>Nach léiríonn sé sin nach bhfuil mórán toil polaitiúil sa Dáil i leith usáid na Gaeilge?  Níl anseo ach &ldquo;lip service&rdquo; don Ghaeilge.  Tugann Teachtaí Dála le fios go bhfuil an-suim acu sa teanga ach ní bhíonn siad sásta gníomhú nuair a thagann an deis.  Taímid bailithe anseo, ceithre bliana taréis fhoilsiú na tuarascála, agus gan na moltaí a bheith curtha i gcrích.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é dearcadh bunúsach an chomhchoiste ná gur mór a chuideodh sé le leathú na Gaeilge mar theanga náisiúnta dá m'eol do mhuintir na tíre go raibh an <Col N="2045" /> gradam is dual don Ghaeilge á thabhairt di i dTithe an Oireachtais, agus go raibh sí á úsáid go rialta ina gcuid imeachtaí. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an dearcadh seo ceart.  Nuair a bhí mé ag léamh na tuarascála anseo, rith sé liom gurb é a bhí i gceist ag an gcomhchoiste ná saghas Gaeltacht nua ar leith a bhunadh i dTeach Laighean &mdash; Gaeltacht Theach Laighean, ar ndóigh.  Is é a bheadh i gecist ná áit ina mbeadh na Comhaltaí uile agus an fhoireann ag déanamh formhór a gcuid gnó trí Ghaeilge agus go dtaispeánfadh sé sin don phobal lasmuigh go bhfuil suim sa Ghaeilge anseo agus gurbh fhiú don phobal sampla seo an tír-ghrá a árdú leo.</P>
    <P>Ní léiríonn an dearcadh sin cén fáth go bhfuil úsáid na Gaeilge i ndrochaoi, cén fáth a bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí ag dul i laghad, cén fáth a bhfuilimid fós anseo sa Dáil, trí scór bliain go leith tar éis saorú an Stáit, ag plé gnéithe bunúsacha ar nós soláthar suaitheantas agus comharthaí trí Ghaeilge?  Nach leiríonn sé seo go bhfuil teipthe ar pholasaithe na Rialtas a bhí againn anuas trí na blianta, agus in ainneoin na ndeontas, an airgid agus in ainneoin an chaint oifigiúil go léir, nach bhfuil athbheochan dá laghad tagtha ar an nGaeilge agus an scéal chomh dona anois agus a bhí ariamh?  Ní cúis ionaidh é, mar sin, go mbeadh stádas agus úsáid na Gaeilge chomh hainnis is atá, i measc na mball.  Ní dhéanfar morán dul chun cinn i leith na Gaeilge laistigh den Dáil, go dtí go ndéanfar feabhsú ann lasmuigh.  Ní féidir Gaeltacht a bhunadh i dTeach Laighean gan trácht ar stádas na Gaeilge i measc an phobail lasmuigh.</P>
    <P>Cad is cúis le drochás na Gaeilge lasmuigh?  Tá cúrsaí sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta na tíre, báúil leithi.  Ní féidir a sheánadh ná gur chuir an imirce isteach ar úsáid na Gaeilge; níorbh aon mhaitheas Gaeilge a fhoghlaim dá mbeadh ort triall ar Chamden Town nó ar an mBronx ag lorg job.  Béarla a bheadh de dhíth ort ansin.  Is amhlaidh atá an scéal inniu.  Ina theannta sin, creidtear inniu gur fearr don duine óg Gearmáinis nó Fraincís a fhoghlaim in ionad na Gaeilge.  Ní eireoidh linn mórán a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge go dtí go mbeidh fostaíocht ar fáil dár muintir agus go dtí go gcuirfear <Col N="2046" /> deireadh leis an imirce atá riachtanach anois, beagnach.</P>
    <P>Má táimid ag iarraidh athúsáid na Gaeilge a spreagadh i measc an phobail, bheadh sé chomh maith dúinn díospóireacht a eagrú ar Raidió na Gaeltachta le linn an olltoghcháin.  Gheall an Taoiseach seirbhís teilifíse do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Cheistigh mé féin agus Teachtaí eile an Taoiseach agus an tAire Stáit, ach go háirithe, maidir le cinneadh i leith na geallúinte sin.  Dúradh linn nár scrúdaíodh an tuarascáil go fóill.  Saghas seirbhís theilifís Ghaeilge atá i gceist anois, ach ní seirbhís faoi leith é.  Is é atá faoi chaibidil ná cúpla cláracha breise Gaeilge a chur ar fáil ar RTÉ.  Tá gach cosúlacht ann anois go bhfuil an Rialtas ag tarraingt siar ar an ngeallúint a thug siad go mbunódh siad Teilifís an Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire Stáit anseo tagairt do Theilifís na Gaeltachta nuair a bheidh sé ag freagairt na díospóireachta seo, agus go n-abródh sé go cruinn an bhfuil an Rialtas chun seirbhís Theilifís na Gaeltachta a bhunú agus cad é an scála ama.  Dhéanfadh seirbhís Theilifís na Gaeltachta i bhfad níos mó don Ghaeilge ná aon díospóireacht anseo sa Dáil.  Sa nua aois in a bhfuilimid, is ón teilifís is mó a bhfaigheann an pobal an cultúr, agus go háirithe an t-aos óg. Muna gcuireann an Rialtas Teilifís na Gaeltachta ar fáil, ní fiú dúinn bheith ag caint faoi athbheocan na Gaeilge chor ar bith.  Geobhaidh sí bás.</P>
    <P>Tá na daoine óga, fiú amháin sna Gaeltachtaí, in áiteanna mar Tír an Fhia agus Corca Dhuibhne, ag féachaint ar &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo; agus cláracha mar sin, cosúil céanna leis na daoine óga sna cathracha móra.  Is ar Kylie Minogue agus ní ar Caitlín Ní hUallacháin anois atá aos óg na Gaeltachta ag déanamh aithrise, agus ní féidir an Ghaeilge a shábháil, fiú amháin sna Gaeltachtaí, mura gcuirtear fostaíocht ar fáil iontu agus mura gcuirtear na meáin nua cumarsáide ar fáil trí Ghaeilge.  Sa tuarascáil seo atá os ár gcomhair, nílim ag dul ina gcoinne.  Ach táim ag rá nach leor í, fiú amháin má táimid ag caint ar úsáid na Gaeilge anseo i dTithe an Oireachtais.  Cinnte ba cheart na moltaí go léir a chur i gcrích, agus is <Col N="2047" /> cúis náire é don Rialtas agus don Dáil nach bhfuil dul chun cinn níos mó déanta orthu fós.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt go háirithe do chúpla moltaí, uimhir a haon, an moladh go mbeadh deis ag Comhaltaí ceisteanna Dála breise a chur isteach trí Ghaeilge. Aontaím le sin agus sílim go gcuideodh sé go mór le h-úsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach. An dara moladh a ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó ná an moladh go gcuirfí seomra agus téip taifeadáin ar fáil chun chur ar chumas na gComhaltaí a gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh, le téipeanna teagaisc ón leabharlann.  Cosúil leis an Teachta Andrews nílim féin ón nGaeltacht, agus d'fhoghlaim mé mo chuig Gaeilge ar scoil, ach chaill mé í i rith na mblianta.</P>
    <P>Bhí an t-ádh liom bheith i mbunscoil lán-Ghaelach, agus bhí an t-ádh liom arís go raibh múinteoir an-mhaith agam ar mheánscoil.  Ina dhiaidh sin, in ainneoin gur fhreastal mé ar Ollscoil na Gaillimhe, chaill mé an Ghaeilge, mar nach raibh cleachtadh agam.  Ar ndóigh níl an mhuinín chéanna agam cosúil lena lán Teachtaí eile labhairt anseo i nGaeilge seachas i mBéarla.  Mar sin molaim go mór go gcuirfí an seomra agus an leabharlann bheag Gaeilge ar fáil ionnas go mbeidh seans ag na Teachtaí cleachtadh ar úsáid na Gaeilge, agus go mbeidh níos mó úsáid ar Ghaeilge sa Teach seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl ach cúpla pointe beaga a ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh.  I dtús báire cuidím leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Gilmore faoin gcoiste agus bhaill an choiste, mar is cuimhin liom thart faoi 1983 nó 1984, go raibh ceathrar againn, an Teachta McGinley anseo, na Teachtaí Frank Prendergast, Denis Gallagher agus mé féin.  Bhí cruinnithe againn le Bord na Gaeilge, agus cruinnithe againn anseo sa Teach, díreach chun Comhchoiste na Gaeilge a bhunú san Oireachtas.  Is sin an rud a bhíomar ag caint faoi ar feadh bliana, agus faoi dheireadh thiar thall d'aontaíodh go mbeadh Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge curtha ar bun don Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a bunaíodh é níor toghadh mise <Col N="2048" /> ar an gcomhchoiste.  Ní raibh eínne de Pháirtí na nOibrithe ariamh ar an gcomhchoiste, agus is trua liom sin.  Pé scéal é ní raibh a fhios agam go raibh an Teachta Andrews ina chathaoirleach ar an gcomhchoiste nua.  B'fhéidir gur chóir go mbeadh a fhios agam, go dtáinig scéala sa phost chugam uair éigin, ach ní raibh agam an t-eolas sin, agus ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis.  Sílim go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos fearr go bhfuil Teachta mar an Teachta Andrews in a chathaoirleach ná, abair, an Teachta Donncha McGinley nó an Teachta Gallagher nó duine éigin eile ón nGaeltacht go mbeadh Gaeilge chomh líofa sin aige.  Mar bheadh a fhios ag an Teachta Andrews na deacrachtaí atá ag na Comhaltaí eile sa Teach.  Tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé ar aghaidh leis an sprid atá aige anois.  On méid a dúirt sé is furast a fheiscint go bhfuil sé ag cleachtadh na Gaeilge arís.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud freisin go raibh cruinniú aige aréir mar a deir sé chun ceann de na moltaí a chur i bhfeidhm sular thosaigh an díospóireacht seo.  Tá sé molta leis na blianta anois seomra a chur ar fáil agus níl sé ann go foíll ach dhéanfadh sé a lán mhaitheasa dá mbeadh sé ar fáil.  Mar a deir an Teachta Gilmore, cleachtadh an rud is mó atá in easnamh ar na Teachtaí &mdash; áit eígin gur féidir leo bualadh le Teachtaí eile agus labhairt leo as Gaeilge. Mura bhfuil sí ág labhairt cailltear í tapa go leor.  Tá Raidio na Gaeltachta an-tábhachtach ar fad.  Is féidir bheith ag éisteacht leis sa ghluaisteán nó san oíche agus cleachtadh a fháil; ach amháin sin ní bheadh aon teacht againn ar dhaoine ag labhairt Gaeilge.  Bíonn daoine ag obair ó mhaidin go hoíche agus ní bhíonn aon seans acu dul in aít a mbeadh Gaeilge á labhairt.  An cleachtadh an rud is mó a bhfuil gá leis.</P>
    <P>Ar leathanach a h-aon den tuarascáil seo tá rud an-tábhachtach pleíte, is é sin ceist na poiblíochta agus deirtear anseo go bhfuil curtha in iúl go minic do Chomhaltaí an dá Theach gur beag poiblíochta a bhíonn le fáil as an Ghaeilge nuair a úsáidtear í san Teach anseo, agus go bhfuil seans níos fearr ann má labhraíonn siad as Beárla.  Pléadh é sin sa <Col N="2049" /> chomhchoiste agus labhair siad le muintir an Phreas.  Ag éirí as an gcruinniú ba léir nach raibh aon chlaonadh i gcoinne na Gaeilge sa tuairisceoireacht, ach gur cheist eagarthóireachta a bhí inti go príomha, agus dúirt siad go raibh beartaithe acu cruinniú eile a bheith acu le hionadaithe ó na meáin chumarsáide chun an cheist seo a phlé.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam ar tharla sé sin ach sílim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach, agus tá sé tábhachtach freisin, go mbeadh aistriuchán le fáil go tapa ag an preas, i dtreo, má tá poiblíocht ag teacht as go mbeadh an seans ceánna má labhraíonn Comhalta as Gaeilge agus má labhraíonn sé as Béarla.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Teachta Gilmore ag caint faoi incentives.  Caithfear incentive éigin a thabhairt do Theachtaí.  Moladh ceann amhain agus sin go bhféadfaidh Teachtaí an tríú ceist a chur sa Teach seo dá mbeadh an tríú ceann as Gaeilge. B'fhéidir sa chrannchur a bhíonn ann do Thráth na gCeist, b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí crannchur faoi leith a eagrú do cheisteanna as Gaeilge i dtreo is go mbeadh ceann de na ceisteanna as Gaeilge ag teacht ag tús an chláir sna ceisteanna.  Abair go mbeadh trí nó ceithre ceisteanna as Gaeilge, go mbeadh crannchur faoi leith dóibh siúd, go dtoghfaí ceist amháin agus go mbeadh sé sin curtha ag barr an chláir agus ansin go leanfaí leis an chrannchur do na cinn eile &mdash; rud éigin mar sin, a thabharfadh incentive do na Teachtaí ceisteanna a chur síos agus labhairt orthu.</P>
    <P>Beidh an seomra seo an tábhachtach má chuirtear ar bun é, mar chomh maith le seans bheith ag Teachtaí cleachtadh a fháil bheith ag labhairt i nGaeilge, beidh na bunleabhair thagartha ann.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh, pé scéal é.  Tá na moltaí seo ann le ceithre bliana anois, agus bhí sé molta ansin, ní amháin go mbeadh na leabhair seo le fáil i seomra faoi leith ach go mbeadh foclóir Béarla-Gaeilge agus foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla le fáil ag gach oifig, agus leabhair eile atá le fáil freisin go mbeadh siad curtha mórthimpeall an Tí i dtreo is go mbeadh siad ann i gcomhair gach Comhalta.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfear na moltaí seo i bhfeidhm anois.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis áthais dom an deis a thapú chun páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht ar an tairiscint thábhachtach atá os ár gcomhair anseo sa Dáil inniu.  Is cinnte go bhfuil Comhaltaí ó gach taobh den Teach ag léiriú spéise sa díospóireacht agus ag glacadh páirte inti go fonnmhar. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná go ndéanfaidh Teachtaí iarracht chun an méid Gaeilge atá acu a úsáid sa díospóireacht agus tá súil agam nach mbeidh cúthail ar dhuine ar bith chun na críche sin.</P>
      <P>Tá dhá thuarascáil a d'eisigh an Dara Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge faoi chaibidil againn inniú agus tá téama amháin lárnach don dá cheann, is é sin, tábhacht na Gaeilge sa pholaitíocht &mdash; lasmuigh agus laistigh de Thithe an Oireachtais.  Tá sé mar aidhm náisiúnta le fada go leanfaí le hiarrachtaí chun an Ghaeilge a hathbheochan ach cad is fiú aidhm mar sin mura dtugann ionadaithe tofa an phobail an áit is dual di don teanga?  Is gá a admháil &mdash; agus ar ndóigh tá an méid seo luaite ag an dá Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge a d'eisigh tuarascálacha go dtí seo &mdash; nach bhfuil na páirtithe polaitíochta ná an Comhaltaí de Thithe an Oireachtais ag déanamh a ndóthain chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a úsáid. Ní gá dúinn bheith ró-imníoch, áfach, maidir leis an easpa dul chun cinn atá déanta go dtí seo: is féidir dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh ach an toil agus an cur chuige ceart a bheith ann.  Ar an mbonn sin, is ábhar mór misnigh domsa na moltaí phraiticiúla atá déanta sa dara tuarascáil ón gComhchoiste, agus treaslaím leis na comhaltaí as ucht a ndíograis agus a gcuid saothair chun an tsraith moltaí seo a chur le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roinntear na moltaí sa tuarascáil go príomha idir cur chun cinn na Gaeilge laistigh den na páirtithe polaitíochta, agus laistigh de Thithe an Oireachtais, agus ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh ar dtús do cheist na dTithe féin.  Ag féachaint don mhéid atáa sa tuarascáil, is cosúil go bhfuil go leor rudaí a d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sna Tithe.  Is é an príomh-rud, is dócha, ná go gcaithfear dea-shampla a thabhairt i dtaobh na teanga.  Níl sé sin <Col N="2051" /> ag tarlú faoi láthair chomh minic agus ba mhaith linn agus tá a lán daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu a d'fhéadfaí níos mó a dhéanamh faoi seo.  Is trua go mór gurb amhlaidh an scéal ach sin mar atá agus caithfimid iarracht a dhéanamh chun cúrsaí a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Molann an comhchoiste go gcuirfeadh Airí sleachta suntasacha i nGaeilge in óráidí a bheidh le tabhairt sna Tithe feasta agus go ndéanfadh na hurlabhraithe ón bhFreasúra mar an gcéanna.  Cé nár mhaith liom go mbeadh sleachta mar sin curtha isteach in óráidí ar mhaithe leis an méid sin amháin, sílim go bhfuil fiúntas leis an moladh.  Ar ndóigh, ní fiú mórán é seo a dhéanamh má leantar as Béarla le haistriúchán den mhéid atá ráite i nGaeilge &mdash; ní chun leasa na Gaeilge a rachadh a leithéid de chur chuige ach a mhalairt ar fad.  Agus an méid sin ráite, ní mór a lua go bhfuil iarrtha ag an Taoiseach ar na hAirí go léir gach is féidir leo a dhéanamh chun go mbeadh teacht ag pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta ar sheirbhisí trí Ghaeilge ó Ranna agus eagraíochtaí Stáit.  Ní tharlóidh feabhas mór thar oíche, ar ndóigh, ach táim dóchasach go gcinnteoidh an beart seo go mbeidh Ranna agus eagrais Stáit níos fábhrúil don Ghaeilge feasta agus go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar an drochstaid atá ann le roinnt mhaith de bhlianta.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil beartaithe ag an gCeann Comhairle réimse leathan seirbhísí tacaíochta a chur ar fáil do Chomhaltaí den dá Theach go luath amach anseo.  Nuair a bhí an Teachta McGinley ag labhairt thug sé ardmholadh don Cheann Comhairle agus don Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Ba mhaith liomsa cur leis an moladh sin as ucht an chomhoibrithe atá faighte ag an gcoiste ón Cheann Comhairle, agus as ucht an dea-shampla atá á thabhairt ag an Cheann Comhairle. Tá ardmholadh tuillte aige.</P>
    <P>Tuigim go gcuirfear seomra ar leith, taobh le Teach Laighean, ar fáil ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn agus go bhfuil pleananna á n-ullmhú faoi láthair chun é sin a hathchóiriú.  De réir mar a thuigim, beidh an seomra réidh le h-úsáid tar éis na Cásca agus cuirfear na <Col N="2052" /> háiseanna seo a leanas ann: (a) téipeanna teagaisc agus cábáin lena n-úsáid; (b) cnuasach leabhar agus irisí Gaeilge; agus (c) ionad cruinnithe.</P>
    <P>Táim cinnte de go bhfáilteoidh Comhaltaí na dTithe roimh na háiseanna seo agus tá súil agam go mbainfear úsáid leanúnach astu: mura mbainfear úsáid cheart as na háiseanna ní bheidh mórán maitheasa leo.  Feictear dom go bhfuil an comhchoiste reatha dóchasach freisin go bhféadfar seirbhís rúnaíochta i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil do Chomhaltaí den dá Theach sa seomra sin amach anseo.  Tá a fhios agam ó mo thaithí phearsanta go bhfuil gá le seirbhís dá leithéad agus bheinn deimhin de go mbainfear úsáid aisti nuair a bheidh sí ar fáil.  Faoi mar a dúirt me, is céim mhór ar aghaidh í na seirbhísí seo a bheith curtha ar fáil agus tréaslaím leat, a Cheann Comhairle, as iad a sholáthar.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor moltaí fiúntacha eile déanta sa tuarascáil seo faoin nGaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais agus is breá liom go bhfuil a lán acu curtha i bhfeidhm cheana féin. Mar shampla, tá tugtha faoi deara agam le tamall anuas go bhfuil na teileafóin i dTeach Laighean á bhfreagairt i nGaeilge agus go bhfuil irisí Gaeilge ar fáil san seomra feithimh.  Is mion rudaí iad seo, ar ndóigh, ach tá tábhacht leo ó thaobh íomhá na Gaeilge agus is maith ann iad. Creidim féin go bhfuil níos mó dea-thoil don Ghaeilge anois i dTithe an Oireachtais ná mar a bhí aon lá.  Is bonn maith é sin chun tógáil air ach caithfimid uile iarracht phearsanta níos treise a dhéanamh feasta.</P>
    <P>Baineann an dara tuarascáil fosta le ceist na Gaeilge laistigh de na páirtithe polaitíochta agus ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi mo pháirtí féin.  Táim cinnte go gcloisfear ó Theachtaí eile ar an dearcadh atá ag a bpáirtithe siúd faoin nGaeilge.  I dtosach báire, ní miste a rá go bhfuil sé mar cheann d'aidhmeanna lárnacha Fhianna Fáil an Ghaeilge a athbhunú mar ghnáthurlabhra sa tír seo.  Bhí an aidhm bhunúsach seo leagtha síos i gCorú Fhianna Fáil ón tús agus tugadh athdhearbhú ina leith nuair a láinseáladh an Clár d'Athshlánú Náisiúnta roimh <Col N="2053" /> olltoghchán na bliana 1987.  Mar aitheantas ar mhórthábhacht na Gaeilge, tá Coiste Gaeilge speisialta bunaithe ag Fianna Fáil, coiste a bhfuilim féin mar Chathaoirleach air i láthair na huaire. Bíonn cruinnithe rialta ag an gCoiste agus tá páipéirí ullmhaithe agus curtha os comhair Ard Chomhairle an Pháirtí ag an gcoiste.  Rinneadh moltaí sna páipéirí seo, <i>inter alia</i>, maidir leis an Ghaeltacht, an Ghaeilge sa Chóras Oideachais, an Ghaeilge sna Meáin Chumarsáide, agus an Ghaeilge laistigh d'Fhianna Fáil.  Tá na páipéirí seo uile pléite ag ard Chomhairle an Pháirtí agus tá siad anois mar chuid de pholasaí oifigiúil Fhianna Fáil i leith na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ag trácht ar na páirtithe polaitíochta is áthas liom a chlos ón Teachta Spring go bhfuil céimeanna dearfa á glacadh ag a pháirtí chun usáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn laistigh dá pháirtí.  Luaigh sé féin gur mionrudaí a bhí i gceist ach mar a deirtear sa Bhéarla &mdash;&ldquo;from little acorns great trees grow.&rdquo;  Táim breá sásta go bhfuil an-suim ag páirtithe an Tí seo agus ag na Teachtaí neamhspleácha sa Ghaeilge agus is rud an-tábhachtach é sin.  Ní mór do Cheannairí na bPáirtithe an sampla a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Ní leor, ar ndóigh, plé a dhéanamh maidir le polasaí amháin &mdash; tá gá freisin leis an gníomh praiticiúil.  Tá iarracht ar leith á déanamh againn ina thaobh sin de le cúpla bliain anuas.  Sampla amháin de seo ná an socrú atá déanta go mbíonn alt suntasach amháin ar a laghad as Gaeilge i ngach eagrán de nuachtlitir Fhianna Fáil. Sampla praiticiúil eile ná an t-sraith de Chártaí Gaeilge a láinseáladh ag Ard-Fheis anuraidh.  Tá leibhéal 1 de na cártaí curtha ar fáil mar áis d'oifigigh cumann le cabhrú leo níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid le linn a gcuid cruinnithe.  Tá cártaí ar leith ann don Chathaoirleach, d'oifigigh eile agus do ghnáth-bhaill an chumainn a thugann liostaí de nathanna cainte gur féidir a úsáid le linn cruinnithe.  Beidh leibhéal 2 de na cártaí á láinseáil ag Ard Fheis an pháirití i mí Aibreáin seo chugainn. Beidh cnuasaigh eile ag leibhéil níos airde á gcur ar fáil go rialta amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Tá iarrtha ag Ceannaire Fhianna Fáil, an Taoiseach agus Aire na Gaeltachta, <Col N="2054" /> Cathal Ó hEochaidh go ndéanfaí iarracht speisialta chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn in imeachtaí an pháirtí.  Is breá liomsa, mar Chathaoirleach ar Choiste Gaeilge Fhianna Fáil, go bhfuil moltaí phraiticiúla á gcur i bhfeidhm mar thoradh ar an iarratas sin ón dTaoiseach.  Is í an aidhm atá leis an mbeartas seo ná cuidiú le baill an pháirtí cur de réir a chéile le méid agus caighdeán na Gaeilge a bheidh á úsáid acu.  Tá mé cinnte go rachaidh na hiarrachtaí seo chun leas na Gaeilge agus mholfainn do na páirtithe eile go leir aithris a dhéanamh orthu.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir mé anspéis sa tríú tuarascáil a d'eisigh an Dara Comhchoiste maidir le suirbhé i measc na gComhaltaí den dá Theach.  Is tuarascáil neamh-ghnáthach an tuarascáil sin agus is maith ann í.  Chuir na comhaltaí rompu eolas bunúsach a chabhródh leo ina gcuid oibre a bhailiú agus táim cinnte de gur éirigh thar barr leo.  An t-aon easnamh a bhain leis an tuarascáil náa laghad Comhaltaí &mdash; níos lú na leath de chomhaltaí an Tí seo agus 43 faoin gcéad de Chomhaltaí an tSeanaid &mdash; a sheol freagra ar ais chuig an gcomhchoiste ar an gceistneoir.  Luann an comhchoiste gur cúis mhí-shástachta dóibh na figiúirí sin agus tuigim a gcás ach, dá ainneoin sin, tá fiúntas, dar liom, leis na torthaí a baineadh amach.</P>
    <P>Ceapaim féin nár chóir go mbeadh faitíos ar éinne úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge atá acu.  Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste a úsáid ná gan í a úsáid ar chor ar bith.  Cé nach bhfuil an comhchoiste freagarthach as gach uile Comhalta den Teach seo agus den Teach eile, táim cinnte go bhfuil Gaeilge ag gach aon Chomhalta den dá Theach.  Ba chóir dóibh úsáid a bhaint as an nGaeilge ar gach deis a fhaigheann siad, ní hamháin laistigh de Thithe an Oireachtais ach lasmuigh freisin.  Tá an síol ann toise go bhfoghlaimíonn gach duine Gaeilge sa scoil náisiúnta agus is dóigh liom féin nach bhfuil le déanamh ach é sin a chothú.  Tá an-chuid daoine nár rugadh sa Ghaeltacht, ach a bhfuair a gcuid Gaeilge líofa ar scoil.  Dob fhéidir le daoine eile é sin a dhéanamh chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cumas sa teanga, is léir go <Col N="2055" /> bhféadfaí an scéal a fheabhsú &mdash; go háirithe ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge de &mdash; ach, faoi mar a deir an comhchoiste, tá líon suntasach Comhalta sa dá Theach le cumas maith labhartha agus is féidir tógáil air sin amach anseo.  Níl aon amhras ach go gcabhróidh na háiseanna atá á gcur ar fáil sa seomra speisialta don Ghaeilge go mór chun an líon cainteoirí Gaeilge a mhéadú.  Rud eile atá suimiúil ná an líon Comhaltaí a bhfuil ard-chaighdeán acu i léamh na Gaeilge.  Ciallaíonn sé seo go bhfuil go leor Comhaltaí le stóras maith focal agus nach bhfuil uathu ach cleachtadh chun a gcuid Gaeilge labhartha a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Feictear dom gur bhain toradh níos fearr leis an Seanad ná leis an Teach seo chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le húsáid na Gaeilge i ngnó na dTithe.  Is trua go mór nach mbaineann ach 43 faoin gcéad dóibh siúd sa Dáil a chuir freagraí ar fáil úsáid as an nGaeilge riamh.  Ní haon chomhartha dóchais an méid sin agus is gá na cúiseanna a bhaineann leis sin a scrúdú.  D'fhéadfadh an comhchoiste reatha an cheist sin a iniúchadh, b'fhéidir, agus na torthaí a fhoilsiú.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin atá aisteach faoin toradh ar an gceist seo ná an méid úsáide a baintear as an nGaeilge sa Seanad in ainneoin nach bhfuil córas aistriúcháin sa Teach sin.  Fáiltím go fonnmhar, áfach, roimh an gcinneadh córas dá leithéid a lonnú sa Seanad go luath amach anseo. Tá a fhios agam go raibh an Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge atá ann faoi láthair &mdash; agus na cinn a d'imigh roimhe &mdash; ag brú na ceiste seo ar aghaidh agus go raibh Seanadóirí aonaracha ag gníomhú amhlaidh freisin.  Is maith an rud é toradh fiúntach a fheiceáil i ndiaidh na n-iarrachtaí sin ar fad.</P>
    <P>Is ábhar sásaimh dom an líon mór Chomhaltaí sa dá Theach a cheap gurbh fhiú níos mó Ghaeilge a úsáid ina gcuid oibre agus an líon díobh a léirigh fonn chun tuilleadh di a úsáid feasta.  Dá ainneoin sin, caithfear a choimeád i gcuimhne go ndearnadh an staidéar atá faoi chaibidil againn beagnach dhá bhliain ó shin.  An féidir linn a thabhairt faoi deara go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge in <Col N="2056" /> úsáid ag Comhaltaí den dá Theach anois ná mar a bhí ansin?</P>
    <P>Ní léir domsa go bhfuil feabhas suntasach tagtha ar an scéal áirithe sin agus is trua liom go mór é sin.  Mar sin, cé go léiríonn Comhaltaí dea-thoil don teanga, caithfimid bheith lán-soiléir nach leor an méid sin: caithfear gach deis a thapú chun an oiread úsáide agus is féidir a bhaint as an nGaeilge.  Go dtí go mbeidh sé sin ag tarlú go rialta, níor cheart dúinn bheith sásta.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine eile a bhfuil baint acu le Tithe an Oireachtais a d'fhéadfadh antionchar a bheith acu ar an gceist seo, i mo thuairim &mdash; táim ag tagairt dár gcáirde sna meáin chumarsáide.  Táid ann sa dá Theach a cheapann nach dtugtar aon suntas sna meáin chumarsáide d'ábhar a ndeirtear as Gaeilge.  Ní thagaim féin leis an tuairim sin.  Má deireann tú rud éigin fiúntach, in-nuachta i dTithe an Oireachtais, tá mé cinnte de go ndéanfar tagairt dó sna meáin chumarsáide &mdash; cuma cén teanga a úsáideann tú.  Ach tá an mothú ann ag roinnt Comhaltaí nach ndéanfar, mar a luaigh mé thuas, agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh na hiriseoirí cabhrú leis an mothú sin a athrú trí rian den &ldquo;positive discrimination&rdquo;, mar a deirtear, a thabhairt dóibh siúd a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge mar mheán i gceachtar den dá Theach &mdash; faoi réir, ar ndóigh, go bhfuil ráiteas fiúntach, in-nuachta á thabhairt acu.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, caithfidh mé ceist a chur.  An ceart dúinn mar Chomhaltaí den Oireachtas bheith ag iarraidh ar dhaoine eile an Ghaeilge a labhairt mura bhfuil muid féin sásta an dea-shampla sin a thabhairt?</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo mar tá spéis agam sa Ghaeilge, agus sin é an fáth gur ball den Chomhchoiste don Gaeilge mé.  Mura léiríonn Teachtaí Dála agus Seanadóirí spéis sa teanga, ní bheimid ábalta í a thabhairt ar ais sa tír seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many people in the past, I emigrated. It is only when one returns that one has a sense of pride in one's language.  I see us as having to set an example in this House.  If we are truly to <Col N="2057" /> be committed to the revival of the Irish language, it is incumbent on Deputies and Senators to use as much Irish as possible.  I would further extend that to local authorities.  We should give as much encouragement as possible to all local authorities who embrace other public representatives if we are to stimulate interest in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>In my home town of Newcastle West there is a very active branch of Conradh na Gaeilge who participate in Glór na nGael competitions.  This is a kind of stimulus which should be used on a national basis.  Many ornate shop fronts in small towns have been replaced by neon plastic signs.  There has been an improvement in my local area where these modern signs have been removed and replaced by signs in the Irish language which are more artistic and more fitting.  This may appear to be a small measure but to the local community it is tangible proof that something is happening in the area of the Irish language. All these things help to foster and stimulate the language.</P>
    <P>Is Gaeilgeoir é, Alan Dukes, ceannaire Fhine Gael, a thugann dea-shampla i gcónaí do na Teachtaí eile i bPáirtí Fhine Gael, maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  It is important when one's Leader speaks Irish to follow the example.  The Minister of State referred to that in relation to his party. It is by example that we can help to improve the language.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate in the comhcoiste to have a chairman who is bilingual.  It is easier for people like me to identify and reassess their skill in relation to the language when listening to somebody like Deputy David Andrews. My Irish has improved and this was one of my objectives when I joined this committee. It is important in committees of that nature to try to embrace people who might not have great skill in the Irish language.  In many cases these people have to be the ambassadors and spear carriers in spreading the message in their local communities and stimulating the language.  I welcome the initiative shown by that committee who have achieved quite a lot within a short period.  I hope <Col N="2058" /> on another occasion when I address this House that my entire speech will be in the Irish language.  I look forward to that day.  It will be proof that I at least will have advanced to some degree in proficiency in the language.  I hope to extend the commitment within my own community.</P>

      <P>Feicimid ón suirbhé seo nach gcuireann ach 10 faoin gcéad de Theachtaí Dála ceisteanna sa Dáil as Gaeilge cé go bhfuil léamh na Gaeilge ag seachtó trí faoin gcéad agus scríobh na Gaeilge ag seasca hocht faoin gcéad de Theachtaí.  Is léir nach mbíonn fonn ar go leor Teachtaí le Gaeilge dul i muinín na n-áiseanna atá ar fáil chun leas úsáid na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Arbh fhéidir le Comhchoiste na Gaeilge aistritheoir a chur ar fail i nGailearaí an Phreas chun óráidí as Gaeilge a mhíniú do lucht an phreas atá ar bheagán Gaeilge b'fhéidir.</P>

Chuige sin, bíonn ionadh ormsa gach lá nuair a léim sna páipéir agus nuair a bhím ag éisteacht le daoine a bhíonn an-suaite faoi rudaí sa tír seo a bhaineann le stair na tíre, a bhaineann leis an ré atá caite, agus go mbíonn siad ag iarraidh seaneaglais nó cnoc nó áras nó rud eigin a choimeád beo.  Ag an am céanna ní chuireann siad suim sa rud is luachmhaire atá againn; and rud a théann níos sia siar na rud ar bith eile atá againn i stair na tíre.  Is í sin an teanga.  Mar dhuine a d'fhoghlaim mo chuid Gaeilge ar scoil anseo i lár na cathrach, tuigim na deacrachtaí atá ann. Is eol dom go bhfuil deacrachtaí maidir le múineadh na Gaeilge ar scoil agus tuigim nach bhfuil locht ar aon duine nó ar aon dream faoi leith mar gur cuireadh an tualach seo orthu, an teanga a athbheochan laistigh d'achar áirithe ama.  Ní raibh siad ábalta é sin a dhéanamh, ar ndóigh agus is é a tharla ná gur múineadh an Ghaeilge, ní mar teanga labhartha ach amhail is dá mbeifí ag múineadh na Gréigise nó na Laidine.  Bhíomar go léir <Col N="2059" /> plódaithe leis an ngramadach agus sinn ar scoil.  Níor thuigeamar gur teanga bheo í an Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Ina theannta sin, measaim gur dearnadh ceangal idir an teanga agus slí bheatha a bhí imithe chun seoil.  Dhealraigh sé dúinne i lár na cathrach nach raibh cead agat Gaeilge a labhairt muna raibh sé ar do chumas móin a bhaint, prátaí a chur agus muna raidh tú oilte i gcúrsaí feirmeoireachta agus na farraige.  Ní miste a rá gur glacadh leis gur saol na mbocht a bhí i gceist agus cén fáth, mar sin, a bheadh suim ag garsún i lár na cathrach i dteanga nár thuig sé, i dteanga ar cheap sé dá dteastódh uaidh í a labhairt go gcaithfeadh sé dul le feirmeoireacht, go gcaithfeadh sé dul leis na rudaí ar fad a bhí sna ceachtanna agus é ag dul ar scoil.  Ní bhfuair mise ceacht riamh agus mé ar scoil ar na rudaí a bhain le mo shaol féin.  Níor chuala mé múinteoir ag cur síos ariamh ar an saol a bhí agamsa ar scoil.  Dá bhrí sin, dealraítear domsa go bhfuil saghas easpa misnigh agus éadochas ar roinnt mhaith daoine chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an nGaeilge. Is é mo thuairim, áfach, gurb é lagmhisneach i leith na Gaeilge an peaca is mó a bheadh ar chumas an domhain seo.</P>
      <P>Ní cóir dúinn a cheapadh, óir nár chuireamar chuige i gceart maidir le modhanna múinte agus modhanna labhartha, gur ar an teanga atá an locht.  Ar an ábhar sin, aontaím go hiomlán leis na Teachtaí a deireann nach bhfuil rud ar bith atá níos eiféachtaí ná an dea-shampla.  Déanaim féin iarracht ar mhéidín beag Gaeilge a labhairt chuile lá.  Ní dhéanaim, ach oiread, a bheag d'éinne nach bhfuil neart Gaeilge aige.  Cuireann a leithéid lagmhisneach ar dhaoine.  Is cuimhin liom dul chuig an Oireachtas agus chuig a leithéid d'áiteanna nuair a bhí mé óg.  Bhíodh daoine &mdash; éilitists &mdash; ag caitheamh anuas orm mar nach raibh an blas ceart agam. Shílfeá uathu go mba thábhachtaí ar fad an blas ná na focail.  Cuireann sé sin isteach ar dhaoine.  Ní thuigfeá an focal than an mblas ó na daoine céanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má táimid chun an Ghaeilge, agus suim na ndaoine sa Ghaeilge, a athmhúscailt, <Col N="2060" /> caithfear iarraidh ar gach éinne sa tír í a labhairt.  Tá uimhir mhór daoine sa tír a bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith acu.  Glacaim leis nach dtabharfaidh mise morán misnigh d'éinne ach is maith an rud é an dea-shampla. Molaim don choiste dul i gcomhar le daoine sa tír seo atá iomráiteach i saol na ndaoine chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an gcaint.  Fágaimíd scéal na fealsúnachta agus mar sin de ar leataobh. &ldquo;Ceithre Máistrí&rdquo; an lae inniu a bheadh i gceist agam: daoine ar nós Gay Byrne, Stephen Roche, a chruthaigh gurbh fhéidir leis teanga iasachta a fhoghlaim, Pat Kenny agus an tAthair Mícheál Ó Cléirigh.  Dob fhéidir a iarraidh ar na Ceithre Maistrí sin, agus é a dhéanamh go deas réidh, pé Gaeilge a bheadh acu a úsáid.  Is cuimhin liom oíche amháin a chaitheamh i gcomhluadar Gay Byrne agus tá roinnt mhaith Gaeilge aige.  Tá suim aige ann, leis, agus arís, dála mo chás féin, ní thuigtear dó go bhfuil cead aige mar Bhleá Cliathach í a labhairt. B'amhlaidh a bhí.</P>
    <P>Thug mé le fios do Ghaeilgeoir cháiliúil le deánaí, gurb é an rud is mó a chuir bac ar labhairt na Gaeilge i measc cathróirí, agus tá formhór na ndaoine ina gcónaí i gcathracha, ná an tuairim nach dtabharfadh na daoine a raibh líofacht Gaeilge acu saghas &ldquo;L-plates&rdquo; d'fhoghlaimeoirí na teanga.  Sin í an tuiscint a bhí ann cé gur mhíthuiscint í.  Níl aon ghá le breis Gaeilge a fhoghlaim, ach an Ghaeilge atá ar fud an tíre a usáid, dá bhfeádfaí daoine a mhealladh chun Gaeilge shimplí a úsáid i dtús báire; tá seanfhocal sa Ghaeilge a deir gur ansin atá saibhreas ár sinsir, agus go mbíonn gach tosú lag.  Shílfeá nár ghlac muintir na Gaeilge leis an ráiteas sin, idir mhúinteoirí agus ollúna.  Cuireadh an iomad béime i gcónaí ar chúrsaí gramadaí. &ldquo;An é sin an fhoirm cheart den Tuiseal Ginideach?  An é sin an Modh Foshuiteach, an Modh Coinníollach?&rdquo; Do chuireadar múisc ar na daoine, leis an mbéim sin.</P>
    <P>Tá neart Gaeilge labhartha ag `chuile Chomhalta anseo.  Tugaimse faoi ndeara nuair a bhím thar lear le mo chairde anseo, go mbíonn fonn orthu pé beagán Fraincíse agus Gearmáinise a bhíonn acu a úsáid.  Tuigtear dóibh nach mbeidh <Col N="2061" /> éinne ag gáire futhu agus teastaíonn uathu í a úsáid.  Tá an oiread sin lagmhisnigh ar dhaoine anseo.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go maith go dtuigeann muintir na tíre tábhacht na teanga.  Tuigimse tábhacht an Bhéarla agus tá mé sásta a admháil nach mbeadh, b'fhéidir, an clú agus an cháil atá ar an tír seo ar chor ar bith, b'fhéidir, mura mbeadh an Béarla againn.  Mura mbeadh ann riamh ach an Ghaeilge &mdash; suimiúil an smaoineamh é &mdash; an mbeadh an Empire atá againn ar tud an domhain?  Níl mise ag caitheamh anuas ar an mBéarla, tuigim go gcaithfimid í a úsáid, gur ar mhaitheas na tí seo é a úsáid, ach ní hionann sin agus a rá nach bhfuil an oiread céanna maitheasa in úsáid na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Luadh níos luaithe faoi chúrsaí turasóireachta. Cuireann sé an-ghliondar ar thurasóirí bheith ag éisteacht leis an Ghaeilge, cuireann sé gliondar orthu nuair a thuigeann siad fealsúnacht na teanga, agus arís, chomh fada agus a bhaineann liom féin, an saibhreas is mó atá againn maidir leis an teanga ná gur ansin atá ciall cheannaithe na mílte duine a chuaigh romhainn.  Agus ní athraíonn gach a bhfuil timpeall orthu, ní athraíonn na mothucháin agus rudaí a bhaineann leis an ngnáthdhuine.  Tá siad sin chomh húr inniu agus a bhíodar na mílte bliain ó shin.  Is sa Ghaeilge, is é sin teanga mo mhuintire, atá an chiall cheannaithe sin, agus sin an fáth go dteastaíonn uaimse go mbeadh an saibhreas sin ar fáil do na daoine a thiocfas i mo dhiaidh.</P>
    <P>Moladh amháin a dhéanaimse don choiste anseo, gan an iomad béime a chur ar chúrsaí foirmeálta, ach, mar chéadchéim, a iarraidh ar chuile dhuine anseo an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Freisin, mo chara thall ansin, an Teachta Doyle a bhfull a fhios agam an Ghaeilge a bheith aige, cé go gceapann sé nach bhfuil sé maith go leor í a labhairt.  Ach chuile dhuine anseo, na daoine atá ag obair timpeall an Tí, tá Gaeilge acu, agus ba cheart dúinn tús a chur leis sin, Gaeilge shimplí a úsáid agus muid ag cur síos orainn féin, ar an lá, rudaí beaga mar sin.  Is as seo a thiocfaidh an misneach labhairt anseo uair éigin nuair a bheas níos mó ama nó leathlá á <Col N="2062" /> chaitheamh againn ag cur síos ar thábhacht agus ar dhul chun cinn ár dteanga féin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtús báire, sílim gur dul chun cinn é, muid bheith inniu ag plé le tuarascáil an chomhchoiste.  Ní mórán is fiú comhchoiste mura dtagann toradh uaidh, agus mura mbaintear úsáid as an toradh sin.  Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar feadh cúpla bomaite ar thorthaí an Chomhchoiste seo, agus go mórmhór ar an dá thuarascáil atá déanta aige, an dara agus an tríú tuarascáil.  Os rud é gurb í an Ghaeilge ár dteanga dhúchais agus go bhfuil glactha léi mar phríomhtheanga na tíre, tá sé de dhualgas orainn a thaispeáint do mhuintir na hEireann go bhfuil muid dáiríre.</P>
      <P>Conas a thig linn a bheith ag súil le hathbheochan na teanga nuair nach gcluintear í ach go hannamh sa Teach seo?  Faoi láthair, mar a dúirt an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, tá ualach na hoibre seo ar mhúinteoirí agus ar mhiic léinn, iad seo atá ag obair faoin Roinn Oideachais. Nuair a fhágann na mic léinn seo an córas oideachais, is minic gur sin deireadh lena gcuid Gaeilge.  Le rófhada a d'fhág muid athbheochan na teanga ina muinín sin agus ní leor é sin.  Má táimid ag glacadh leis an Bhunreacht, agus má táimid dáiríre, caithfimid cinnireacht a thaispeáint do phobal na tíre i gcoitinne. Caithfimid úsáid a bhaint aisti, mar a mholann an comhchoiste, le linn cheisteanna Dála, agus in óráidí, agus ní leor díreach cúpla focal cosúil le &ldquo;a Chathaoirligh&rdquo; agus &ldquo;go raibh míle maith agaibh&rdquo;. Caithfimid úsáid a bhaint aisti nuair a bhíonn muid ag plé ceisteanna náisiúnta agus idirnáisiúnta, agus ní leor é nuair a bhímid ag plé na Gaeltachta nó nithe a bhfuil baint acu leis an Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cén fáth nach ndéanaimid go léir é sin? De réir an dara tuarascáil is iad leisciúlacht, easpa poiblíochta, easpa suime agus easpa cumais na cúiseanna.  Cé gur deacrachtaí iad seo, ní fadhbanna gan réiteach iad.  Moltar sa dara tuarascáil go gcuirfear seomra ar fáil agus foireann lánaimseartha le cuidiú leis na Teachtaí agus leis na Seanadóirí a gcuid óráidí agus a gcuid ceisteanna a ullmhú.  Seomra ina mbeadh <Col N="2063" /> leabharlann, foclóirí Gaeilge; seomra ina mbeadh cúrsaí Gaeilge ar théipeanna, agus ranganna chun cuidiú leis na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí anseo feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Táimid cinnte anois, mar a dúirt Cathaoirleach an Chomhchoiste, go mbeidh an seomra sin ar fáil go luath agus go mbeimid ag súil leis na rudaí eile atá de dhíth orainn sa chomhchoiste, go mbeidh siad againn go luath fosta.  I dtaca le heaspa poiblíochta, aontaimid uilig go bhfuil an phoiblíocht tábhachtach.  Deir an tuarascáil gurb é an fáth nach dtugtar poiblíocht dúinn nuair a úsáidtear Gaeilge anseo ná, de ghnáth is ar nithe Ghaeltachta a bhímid go léir ag plé, agus ni bhíonn na nithe tábhachtach go leor le go bhfaighimís poiblíocht náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Iarrann an tuarascáil go mbainfidh na Teachtaí, go mórmhór na hAirí sa Teach seo, úsáid as an Ghaeilge nuair a bhíonn nithe tábhachtacha, nithe náisiúnta nó nithe idirináisiúnta á bplé acu, ní amháin sa Dáil ach taobh amuigh de freisin.  Mar sin de, bheimis cinnte go bhfaighimis poiblíocht, agus san am céanna bheimis ag tabhairt dea-shampla do phobal na tíre.  Tuigimid go léir go mbíonn sé deacair ar Theachtaí a bpointí a chur trasna chomh héifeachtach agus chomh cinnte agus ar mhian leo trí mheán na Gaeilge. Ach duine ar bith go mbíonn eagla nó imní mar sin air na rudaí sin a dhéanamh, ar a laghad ba chóir dó nó di an Ghaeilge a úsáid mar theanga shóisialta le linn caidrimh nó comhrá le daoine eile sa Teach seo, leis na hoifigigh, leis na daoine atá ag obair anseo, ar ndóigh le duine ar bith a measann siad atá ábalta cúpla focal nó beagán Gaeilge a labhairt gach lá sa Teach.</P>
    <P>Le cois na moltaí a luaigh mé go dtí seo, is iad a leanas cuid de na moltaí atá sa tuarascáil.  Uimhir a haon, go gcuirfidh ceannairí na bpáirtithe éagsúla feabhas ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus go mbeadh siad ábalta labhairt go cumasach, mura bhfuil siad cheana.  Buíochas le Dia go bhfuilimid ag plé thorthaí na tuarascála atá curtha i gcrích ag Comhchoiste na Gaeilge go dtí seo.  Ní mórán is fiú an dul chun cinn seo, agus an obair seo go léir, <Col N="2064" /> mura gcuirfear na moltaí i bhfeidhm. Leanfaidh an comhchoiste ar aghaidh lena gcuid oibre, ach ní fiú dada é sin mura bhfuilimidne sásta lán-tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh, agus a thaispeáint dóibhsan agus don tír i gcoitinne go bhfuilimid dáiríre faoin Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Níl dóigh is fearr le sin a dhéanamh ná glacadh leis na moltaí a luaigh mé, agus ár ndícheall a dhéanamh iad a chur i bhfeidhm, chomh maith agus is féidir linn.  Cé go raibh mise ar an dara chomchoiste agus arís ar an tríú comhchoiste, rinneamar sárobair sa dara chomchoiste, ach d'ainneoin nach bhfuil an tríú chomhchoiste ann ach cúpla mí, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé an-bhuíoch den chathaoirleach, an Teachta Andrews, mar gheall ar an tsárobair a rinne sé, mar gheall ar bheith ábalta díospóireacht a bheith againn.  Sa Teach so, tá go leor Gaeilge ag an chuid is mó de na ceannairí agus is dea-shampla mór é do gach duine ina bpáirtithe féin.</P>
    <P>Seo na moltaí eile &mdash; uimhir a dó: go ndéanfadh Cathaoirleach an tSeanaid agus Ceann Comhairle na Dála mar an gcéanna.  Tá Gaeilge líofa ag an Cheann Comhairle agus ag an Leas-Cheann Comhairle agus agat féin, sílim, a Chathaoirligh, fosta.  Uimhir a trí, go gcuirfidh gach Teachta ceist amháin Gaeilge, sa tseachtain; uimhir a ceathair, go mbainfear úsáid as an Ghaeilge le linn díospóireachta ar Riar na hOibre; uimhir a cúig, go ndéanfar Díospóireacht ar an Athló trí Ghaeilge ar a laghad trí huaire sa téarma; uimhir a sé, go mbeidh roinnt Gaeilge in achan tuairisc do choiste an Oireachtais; uimhir a seacht, rud atá éasca a dhéanamh, go gcuirfear cumann Gaelach ar bun sa Dáil, sa dóigh is go mbeidh gach duine ábalta cúpla focal a rá sa Dáil, mar chomhrá nó rud éigin mar sin &mdash; sé sin, Gaeilge shóisialta.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé i dtosach báire, is dul chun cinn é seo sa Dáil inniu díospoireacht faoin tuarascáil a bheith againn, ach go mórmhór ní mór na seirbhísí a thabhairt dúinn.  Bhí mé ag caint faoin seomra Gaeilge bheith againn, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó againn, agus go mbeidh tacaíocht, ní amháin sa chomhcloiste, ach taobh <Col N="2065" /> amuigh de do na rudaí atáimid ag déanamh sa chomhchoiste.  Le cúnamh Dé, beidh níos mó daoine sa Teach, ní amháin sa Dáil, ach sa Seanad fosta, agus níos mó Gaeilge á húsáid sna díospóireachtaí mar cheisteanna Dála agus rudaí mar sin. Mar fhocal scoir, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé sásta go bhfuil na meáin chumarsáide ag éisteacht linn, go bhfuil siad anseo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó spéise acu sna rudaí atá déanta ag an chomhchoiste agus sa Dáil, cé go mbeimid ag tnúth le níos mó Gaeilge á húsáid ag an hAirí agus ag achan duine anseo i gcúrsaí eile sa Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom, chomh maith leis an Comhaltaí eile, comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an chathaoirleach, an Teachta Andrews, as ucht an dul chun cinn atá déanta aige i mbliana.  Go háirithe mar a chualamar cheana, tá seomra na Gaeilge le cur ar fáil anois; saghas seomra caidrimh atá i gceist go ginearálta, agus beidh téipeanna teagaisc ann chomh maith.  Tá seans ann, is docha, go mbeidh seirbhís rúnaíochta ann i gcóir na dTeachtaí agus na Seanadóirí a bheidh ag iarraidh seirbhíse den saghas sin.  Tá tuairisc ann maidir le córas aistriúcháin sa Seanad.  Tá dul chun cinn an-mhór déanta ansin freisin, agus tá an dealramh ar an scéal go mbeidh córas bunaithe i ndiaidh an tsamhraidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An tríú rud ná go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar siúl inniu, agus is é mo thuairim féin go bhfuil sár job déanta ag an cathaoirleach agus ag na cathaoirligh a bhí ann roimhe.  Seo é an chéad uair domsa bheith ar an gcomhchoiste, agus tá mé iontach sásta leis an méid oibre atá déanta ag Daithí Mac Aindriú mar Chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste.  Ba mhaith liom i dtús báire díriú ar na téarmaí tagartha atá acu.  Tá dhá cheann ann, an chéad cheann ná úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach.  Is é tuairim an chomhchoiste go bhfuil gá le dea-shampla agus caithfidh a leithéid teacht ó Chomhaltaí an Oireachtais i dtosach báire, agus dul chun cinn fiúntach a dhéanamh laistigh de Thithe an Oireachtas, ansin díriú ar an <Col N="2066" /> gceist níos leithne faoin Ghaeilge i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím go hiomlán leis an tuairim sin agus leis an tuairim a bhí ag an dara comhchoiste.  Measaim go bhfuil orainn anois níos mó béime a chur ar an Ghaeilge a gcoitinne agus go háirithe lasmuigh den Teach.  Is féidir linn bheith ag déileáil leis an scéal i gcónaí maidir le Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí na Dála. Is féidir linn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ceart go leor, ach cén fáth nach féidir linn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh lasmuigh den Teach ag an am céanna?  Ba chóir dúinn ach go háirithe mórcheisteanna cosúil le gluaiseacht na gaelscoileanna a phlé. agus an saol sna Gaeltachtaí chomh maith.  Caithfimid an-chuid tacaíochta a thabhairt do dhreamanna éagsúla atá amuigh ansin ag déanamh a ndíchill chun an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt agus a leathadh.</P>
    <P>Tá fás agus forbairt iontach le feiceáil ar na gaelscoileanna le déanaí.  I gcathair Chorcaí amháin tá suas le trí scoileanna déag anois.  Ach, leis an fhás agus an fhorbairt sin tá deacrachtaí ann chomh maith, an-chuid deacrachtaí.  Bímse buartha i gcónaí anois faoi na deacrachtaí éagsúla a bhaineann le gaelscoileanna i gcathair Chorcaí amháin.  Measaim go bhfuil sé in am don chomhchoiste díriú ar an gceist seo.  Tá deacrachtaí a bhaineann le huimhreacha daltaí, mar níl mórán foirgneamh curtha ar fáil anois, mar shampla, do an-chuid de na gaelscoileanna. Beidh deacrachtaí sa todhchaí, an saghas gaoil idir na gaelscoileanna agus na gnáthscoileanna, an tslí inar féidir iad a thógáil le chéile agus iad ag dul ar aghaidh le chéile.</P>
    <P>De réir mar a thiteann na huimhreacha sna bunscoileanna, tá dainséar ann go mbeidh coimhlint de shaghas éigin idir na gnáthscoileanna agus na gaelscoileanna. Caithfimid mar chomhchoiste díriú ar an gceist sin, mar is é mo thuairim gurb é gluaiseacht na ngaelscoileanna an ghluaiseacht is tábhachtaí ó thaobh athbeochan na teanga sa todhchaí.  Caithfimid cruinnithe a eagrú leis an Aire Oideachais agus b'fhéidir le hAire na Gaeltachta chun an cheist seo a phlé níos deimhnithí agus chun polasaí iomlán a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine áirithe ag caint faoi theilifís <Col N="2067" /> na Gaeilge nó teilifís na Gaeltachta. Teastaíonn uainn teilifís na Gaeilge, ní amháin teilifís na Gaeltachta, mar tá tuairim áirithe ann go mba chóir dúinn teilifís Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil, teilifís atá bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht amháin.  Dá ndéanfaimis é sin, tá dainséar ann gur teilifís áitiúil a bheadh ann, bunaithe sa Ghaeltacht.  Measaim go bhfuil uainn teilifís náisiúnta trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na tíre.  Tá mé an-láidir ar an gceist seo, mar, má leanaimid ar aghaidh ag iarraidh teilifís a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht amháin, nach mbeadh éileamh ar an teilifís sin ar fud na tíre ar fad?  Is ceist í a chaithfear a phlé níos domhaine arís sa chomhchoiste agus moltaí a chur chuig an Aire atá i gceannas na ceiste sin.</P>
    <P>Tá an saol atá sna Gaeltachtaí i gceist freisin.  Arís tá sé tábhachtach na Gaeltachtaí a choimeád beo agus an Ghaeilge a choimeád beo sna Gaeltachtaí, chomh maith le forbairt tionschlaíochta, eacnamaíochta agus turasóireachta.  I gcónaí bíonn coimhlint idir forbairt eacnamaíochta agus forbairt turasóireachta agus an Ghaeilge, agus caithfimid déileáil leis an gceist sin i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Tá sé feicthe agamsa anois go bhfuil an-chuid dreamanna nua ag teacht ar an bhfód agus tá smaointe nua acu chun an Ghaeilge a athbheochan agus a fhorbairt. I gCorcaigh amháin, mar shampla, tá gluaiseacht nua ann &mdash; Gaeltaca an t-ainm atá air.  Mar léiriú ar an saghas oibre atá á déanamh acu, tá busanna lánGhaelacha curtha ar fáil i gCathair Chorcaí. Is é an rud a dheineadar ná tabhairt ar chomhlachtaí ar nós Suttons, Tae de Barra agus Banc na hÉireann a gcuid fógraíochta ar na busanna a chur i nGaeilge.  Anois tá busanna lán-Ghaelacha ag dul timpeall na cathrach.  Is fógraíocht an-mhaith é i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus i dtaobh na gcomhlachtaí seo.</P>
    <P>Tá Gaeltaca ag déanamh an-chuid oibre maidir le forbairt na Gaeilge i gCorcaigh. Tá smaointe nua acu agus tá spiorad nua ann.  Caithfimidne mar chomchoiste cabhair a thabhairt do na dreamanna seo agus aon rud is féidir linn a dhéanamh, a dhéanamh.  Fiú amháin inné fuaireamar litir maidir le daoine áirithe <Col N="2068" /> atá ag iarraidh rogha uimhirchlár do ghluaisteáin a fháil, mar shampla, 90 Baile Átha Cliath 1, nó rud mar sin.  Ní féidir le daoine uimhirchlár Gaeilge a úsáid ar ghluaisteán faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Is féidir linn an-chuid oibre a dhéanamh mar eadarghabhálaí idir na húdaráis agus an comhchoiste.  An príomh phointe atá a dhéanamh agam inniu, ná gur chóir dúinn sa chomhchoiste díriú ar an dara aidhm agus an dara ceann de na horduithe tagartha don chomhchoiste, is é sin an Ghaeilge a leathnú agus a athbheochan i gcoitinne.  Táim buíoch don chara liom a bhí i gColáiste Chríost Rí linn i gCorcaigh, coláiste a bhí i bhfábhar an teanga i gcónaí, a dhein sár job í a mhúineadh dúinn.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Ghaeilge sa Teach seo, tá moltaí áirithe curtha ar fáil ag an dara tuarascáil agus tá sé riachtanach dúinn is dócha, i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú sa Teach seo.  Ba chóir dúinn a bhfuil Gaeilge againn beannachtaí a thabhairt go rialta i nGaeilge, agus fiosrúcháin ghairide a dhéanamh leis an fhoireann chomh maith.  Os rud é go bhfuil an seomra beagnach réidh, is dócha go mbeidh dul chun cinn agus feabhas mór ag teacht ar an scéal sa todhchaí.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh moltaí suntasacha chomh maith sa chéad tuarascáil, faoi chomharthaí i gcoitinne, agus moladh freisin go mbeadh suathantais an-úsáideach sna Tithe i nGaeilge.  Níl dul chun cinn sásúil faoi na nithe seo deánta, ná le feiceáil fós. Tá geallúintí faighte go gcuirfidh Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí na comharthaí ar fáil go luath agus ba cheart go gcuirfí ar fáil iad anois gan tuilleadh moille.</P>
    <P>Measaim go bhfuil ról faoi leith agus ról an tábhachtach ag na meáin chumarsáide maidir le forbhairt na Gaeilge sna Tithe. Tá a fhios ag an chomhchoiste go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag an bhfurmhór agus go bhféadfaidís cabhrú go mór leis na hiarrachtaí chun atmasféar don Ghaeilge sna Tithe a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Mar a léiríonn an tuarascáil, tá curtha in iúl go minic don comhchoiste ag Comhaltaí den dá Theach gur beag poiblíochta a bhíonn le fáil as an nGaeilge a úsáid in imeachtaí na dTithe, agus go mbíonn <Col N="2069" /> seans níor fearr ann ná labhraíonn siad as Beárla.  Is léir nach bhfuil claonadh i gcoinne na Gaeilge sa tuairisceoireacht agus gur ceist eagarthóireachta a bhíonn inti go príomha.  Caithfimid an fhadhb sin a phlé agus caithfidh an comhchoiste deighleáil leis na heagarthóirí chun an scéal seo a fheabhsú agus chun dealramh níos fearr a chur ar an scéal.</P>
    <P>Tháinig moltaí tábhachtacha ón dara comhchoiste a bhain le Tráth na gCeisteanna. Rinneadh moladh amháin measaim faoi Thráth na gCeisteanna atá sa Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge, 1983-86.  Mar a deireann an tuarascáil tá Tráth na gCeisteanna ar cheann de na hinstitiúidí is tábhachtaí sa Dáil agus glacann gach Comhalta páirt ann go fonnmhar.  Is é an moladh a bhí ann ná ceisteanna as Gaeilge a chur ar an chlár agus go dtógfaí ceist amháin ar a laghad as Gaeilge gach lá a mbíonn Tráth na gCeisteanna ar siúl sa Dáil; agus dhá cheist ar a laghad as Gaeilge tar éis tréimhse bliana.</P>
    <P>Do luadh ag an am sin 1983 mar sprioc dáta, ach faraor níor cuireadh an moladh i bhfeidhm go fóill.  Is féidir lena lán Comhaltaí ceisteanna a chuirtear i mBéarla faoi láthair a chur i nGaeilge feasta gan mórán stró, agus bheadh an toradh céanna ann dóibh féin sa deireadh. Dá gcuirfeadh gach Comhalta a bhfuil Gaeilge aige nó aici ceist amháin síos i nGaeilge gach seachtain mar thús bheadh sé soiléir go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo agus á húsáid.  Agus tá moltaí eile a bhaineann le Tráth na gCeisteanna, ach sin is dócha slí amháin inar féidir linn an-dul chun cinn a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a leathnú sa Dáil.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an córas aistriúcháin atá againn sa Teach seo, tá an-chuid le déanamh againn fós, agus mar a deir an tuarascáil, dá méadófaí líon na n-aistritheoirí bheifí ag súil go bhféadfadh an dá leagan de Bhillí bheith ar fáil ag an am céanna, nuair a thagann an nua-theicneolaíocht ar an bhfód.  Measaim go bhfuil sin tábhachtach go leor mar anois ní fhaighimid ach an Bille trí Bhéarla ar dtús.  Chabhródh sé go mór le Teachtaí Dála a mbeadh fonn orthu labhairt i nGaeilge ar dtús ar Bhille ach nach mbeadh na <Col N="2070" /> téarmaí teichniúla acu a bhaineann leis an reachtaíocht.  Is droch scéal é nach bhfuil Billí ar fáil i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla ag an am céanna faoi láthair agus is bac an-mhór é.  Is cuimhin liom féin fonn a bheith ormsa labhairt ar an mBille a bhain le horticulture agus bhí an-chuid téarmaí teichniúla ann.  Bheadh réiteach ar an bhfadhb sin dá gceapfaí níos mó aistritheoirí.</P>
    <P>Tá an tAire Airgeadais ag iarraidh clóscríobháin agus word processors a chur ar fáil dúinn i mbliana.  Tá sé tábhachtach roimh na rudaí seo a cheannach go mbeimid ábalta síntí fada a chur isteach. Is rud beag é, ach faoi láthair bíonn orm an biro a úsáid leis na síntí fada a chur isteach.  Bhí orm léacht a thabhairt an tseachtain seo caite thíos i gCorcaigh a raibh timpeall sé leathanach déag ann. Bhí orm an biro a úsáid agus tógann sé an-cuid ama.  Tá an tAire Airgeadais chun nua-theicneolaíocht a thabhairt isteach agus caithfimid mar chomhchoiste a rá leis, roimh aon rud a dhéanamh, bí deimhnitheach go bhfuil na síntí fada istigh sna chlóscríobháin.</P>
    <P>Tá seans ann anois go mbeidh an teilifís istigh sa Teach seo agus tugann sin an chaoi dúinn an Ghaeilge a leathnú í bhfad níos mó.  Caithfidh an comhchoiste diriú ar an gceist sin, mar má thagann an teilifís isteach anseo, beidh orainn oráidi nó díospóireachtaí trí Ghaeilge a dhéanamh. Beidh muintir na tíre ábalta a fheiscint go bhfuil Gaeilge ag roinnt de na hionadaithe poiblí agus go bhfuil siad sásta í a úsáid sa Teach.  Bheadh dea-thionchar ag an rud sin ar ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge ar fad ar fud na tíre.  Mar shampla bheadh na scoileanna eágsúla ábalta an díospóireacht trí Ghaeilge sa Pharlaimint Náisiúnta a fheiceáil.  Is rud réabhlóideach é sin, an tseirbhís teilifíse atá ag teacht isteach, agus tá sé riachtanach go mbeidh an comhchoiste réidh don fhorbairt sin agus go mbeidh muid ábalta úsáid a bhaint as an buntáiste a bheidh ann.</P>
    <P>Chuir an chéad agus an dara chomhchoiste, an iomad béime ar an Ghaeilge agus imeachtaí sa Teach seo agus sa Seanad.  Caithfimid níos mó béime a chur ar fhorbairt na Gaeilge lasmuigh de an Tithe agus ar fud na tíre ar fad.  Luaigh <Col N="2071" /> mé gluaiseacht na ngaelscoileanna, teilifís na Gaeilge, na dreamanna éagsúla atá ann ar chóir dúinn cabhair a thabhairt dóibh agus, chomh mhaith leis sin, na Gaeltachtaí.  Táimid chun cuairt a thabhairt ar Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall ar ball. Is féidir linn bheith ag caint go dtí deireadh an haoise seo maidir le Gaeilge sa Teach seo, tá daoine áirithe anseo atá sásta a bpáirt a ghlacadh sa chás seo.</P>
    <P>Ní haon mhaith bheith ag leanúint ar aghaidh ag cur moltaí os ár gcomhair faoin Ghaeilge sa Dáil.  Caithfear an scéal a leathnú agus aird a dhíriú go láidir agus go héifeachtach ar mhórcheisteanna na Gaeilge atá lasmuigh den Teach seo agus déileáil leis na dreamanna éagsúla atá amuigh ansin, moltaí a chur roimh na hAirí éagsúla, cruinnithe a eagrú leis an Aire Oideachtais agus leis an Aire Stáit, An Teachta Gallagher, maidir leis na gaelscoileanna agus na Gaeltachtaí.</P>

      <P>Titeann sé ormsa deireadh a chur leis an díospóireacht inniu agus tá roinnt rudaí ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dóibh.  Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas féin agus buíochas an chomhchoiste a chur in iúl do gach duine a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo inniu. Labhair Teachtaí atá líofa sa Ghaeilge agus ghlac Teachtaí cosúil liom féin, a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge ach nach bhfuil líofa inti, páirt bhríomhar sa díospóireacht freisin.  Is é an príomhrud ná go ndéanfadh gach duine iarracht shuntasach chun úsáid a bhaint as an méid Gaeilge atá aige nó aici.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mura bhfuil daoine sásta an iarracht riachtanach sin a dhéanamh i dtaobh na Gaeilge, tá an áit is dual a thabhairt don teanga caillte.  Agus caithfear smaoineamh nach bhfuil an cath sin tosaithe fós. Chuir an méid a chuala mé anseo inniu go mór le mo mhisneach agus tá mé deimhin de go spreagfar go leor daoine eile chun cur lena gcuid iarrachtaí amach anseo.  Gabhaim buíochas chomh maith leis an Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta, seanchara liom féin, an Teachta Pat the Cope Gallagher, a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht inniu agus a thug éisteacht do na cainteoirí éagsúla.  Tá mé cinnte go dtabharfaidh an tAire Stáit agus a chuid <Col N="2072" /> oifigeach suntas do na rudaí a dúradh anseo inniu agus go ndéanfaidh siad a ndícheall chun cabhrú leis an chomhchoiste ina chuid iarrachtaí chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn amach anseo, laistigh agus lasmuigh de Thithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin go dtógfadh an tAire Stáit an teachtaireacht seo a leanas leis ón Teach seo inniu, is é sin, go bhfuil sé fíor-riachtanach go dtabharfadh Airí agus Airí Stáit dea-shampla, mar a dúirt an tAire Stáit féin, do Chomhaltaí an Tí agus don phobal i gcoitinne i dtaobh úsáid na Gaeilge.  Ó tharla go rabhamar ag díriú ar an dara tuarascáil ón dara comhchoiste inniu, sílim gurbh fhiú an sliocht seo a leanas a lua toisc go dtéann sé go croí na ceiste: &ldquo;Is gá do na páirtithe polaitíochta beart a dhéanamh de réir a mbriathar anois má tá an Ghaeilge le maireachtáil agus dul i dtreise.  Tá an rogha ag na páirtithe an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn nó ligean di dul i léig.&rdquo;  Is ceist dúinn go léir ár gcuid féin a dhéanamh chun a chinntiú gur i dtreise a bheidh an Ghaeilge ag dul sa todhchaí, agus cuirimís chuige.</P>
    <P>Anois, a Chathaoirligh, tá cúig nóiméad fágtha agam agus ba cheart dom briseadh isteach sa dara teanga oifigiúil.  Is dóigh liom go mbeadh sé drochbhéasach gan é sin a dhéanamh do na daoine a labhair as Béarla.  Mar Chathaoirleach ar an gcomhchoiste, déanaim comhghairdeas leis na daoine nach raibh mórán Gaeilge acu agus a rinne iarracht í a labhairt. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leo.</P>
    <P>I very much appreciate the effort made by people who like me are not practised in Irish.  I do not lack Irish but I am not practised in it.  During the last six weeks it has come as a revelation to me that I can recall as much Irish as I can and I know that by the end of the year I will be as fluent as one can be having regard to the inhibitions of my age.  People between the ages of four and seven are probably the best learners of the language. It becomes a bit more difficult when one gets into one's fifties. However, I will do my best and I will certainly come into the House more perfect in speaking the Irish language.  As <Col N="2073" /> far as my commitment to the language is concerned, I am second to none and the equal of most.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the committee, an Teachta McGinley.  I find it a great support to have a man on the committee who speaks Irish fluently.  Listening to him is like listening to a poet.  He speaks beautiful Irish and he expresses himself well.  The Deputy has given me tremendous support in my capacity as Cathaoirleach and I deeply appreciate that support.</P>
    <P>This is a non-political all-party committee. The language should be above politics and the fact that it has not been is perhaps one of the reasons why it has not flourished since the foundation of the State.  Because it was drawn into the political system the language has survived in a very emaciated form.</P>
    <P>I thank also the Minister of State whose presence during the debate has been deeply appreciated.  We thank the parties who have participated, The Workers' Party, the Labour Party, the Green Party in the person of Deputy Roger Garland who made a genuine effort to speak the language.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a gabháil don Pháirtí Glas agus do Pháirtí Fhine Gael agus do gach duine a thug part sa díospóireacht.  Ba mhaith liom mo buíochas a ghabháil do fhoireann na dTithe, particularly the telephone operators who have taken a genuine interest. It is lovely to ring through to the Dáil to hear &ldquo;Tithe an Oireachtais&rdquo; or &ldquo;Leinster House&rdquo; according to one's will.  One at least has a choice and I am grateful to them for what they are doing.</P>
    <P>In relation to the committee, they have no finance, which is a very sad state of affairs as it is a committee who espouse what we see as the sprituality of our nation.  Those who read my words as chairman of the committee might take account of the fact that we are looking for money for this committee.  We also want a full-time secretary.  That is the least the committee deserve.  Most other commitees of this House have full-time secretaries.  It is an extraordinary tribute to the Irish language that we do not have <Col N="2074" /> such an officer.  The procuring of a full-time secretary would be another priority of this committee.  We should also have a meeting room as at the moment we are like itinerants travelling round this House for meetings.  I am not referring to us as personalities or as members of the Dáil but it is not good enough &mdash; for the Irish language and for the time being we are the guardians of the language in this House.  These matters are my immediate concerns and I hope we will have them dealt with, if not during this session of the Dáil, during the next session.</P>
    <P>I appreciate also the contributions of my colleagues on the back benches, Deputies Michael Martin and Mary Coughlan.  As an older inhabitant of this House it is marvellous to see the language in such good hands.  The future of the language lies in the hands of these young people and others who are younger.  All we can do is try to give a litle bit of leadership from time to time.</P>
    <P>We should have a discussion lasting at least three hours on some aspect of the Irish language at least twice a year if not once in every term.  We are deeply grateful for the opportunity for this debate given us by the Whips and to the Taoiseach who supported us in this debate and to the political leaders to whom I wrote in connection with it.  I will not go overboard in my thanks because after all we are talking about the Irish language.  It was great to have the opportunity and from now on we will go from strength to strength building on the work of the chairmen and the committee members of the previous two committees.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh agus aontaíodh an cheist.</P>

      <P>Is léir go bhfuil ag éirí leis na céimeanna ar glacadh leo le cúpla bliain anuas chun cúrsaí airgeadais a chur faoi smacht agus chun feabhas a chur ar staid eacnamaíochta na tíre.  Táim sásta go mbeidh sé soiléir d'aon duine a scrúdóidh an cháinaisnéis seo go bhfuil comharthaí dóchais láidir le feiceáil inti do na blíanta amach romhainn.  Ní shárófar fadhbanna na tíre mura dtuigfidh an pobal go soiléir an ghéarchéim atá romhainn agus mura mbeidh a gcomhoibriú ar fáil lena réiteach &mdash; agus is deimhin liom go raibh an chomhoibriú sin ar fáil go fial le cúpla bliain anuas.  Táim cinnte go leanfar leis sin agus, cé go bhfuil roghanna deacra romhainn fós, go mbeidh forbairt agus dul chun cinn i ndán dár muintir uile ach tarraingt le cheile go fonnmhar in aon iarracht amháin ar mhaithe lena chéile. Cé go bhfuil cúrsaí airgeadais feabhsaithe go mór, bheadh sé tubaisteach dá n-éireodh muid bogásach anois.  Tá tuilleadh dul chun cinn riachtanach agus ceapadh an cháinaisnéis seo ar dhóigh a chinnteoidh go gcabhrófar leis an dul chun cinn seo agus go dtreiseofar é.</P>
      <P>Níl dabht ar bith ach go bhfuil an dífhostaíocht ar cheann de na fadhbanna is mó atá le sárú againn sa tír i gcoiteann agus, ar ndóigh, sna ceantair Ghaeltachta a bhfuil freagracht ormsa ina leith.  Ní mór a chinntiú, mar sin, go mbeidh tionchar ar an bhfadhb sin ag aon phleananna forbartha a chuirfear i gcrích.  Díreofar ar an t-airgead atá ar fáil a chaitheamh ar bhealaí fiúntacha d'fhonn torthaí réalaíocha a bhaint amach agus poist sheasmhacha a chruthú in ionad an t-airgead sin a bheith á chur amú ar thograí nach mbeadh inmharthana.  Tá mé bródúil go bhfuil áit lárnach ag Údarás na Gaeltachta san straitéis seo agus déanfaidh mé tagairt níos leithne don ról atá acu ar ball beag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2076" /> Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh cothrom na Féinne le fáil ag gach saoránach ó aon cháinaisnéis a mholann Rialtas agus tá mé sásta go bhfuil an riachtanas sin á chomhlíonadh ag an gcáinaisnéis seo. Mar shampla, tá an ráta cáin ioncaim le laghdú arís is mbliana &mdash; ó 32 go 30 faoin gcéad &mdash; rud a chabhróidh le gach duine atá ag íoc cánach.  Tá an barr-ráta den cháin ioncaim á laghdú freisin ó 56 go dtí 53 faoin gcéad.  Maidir le cáin bhreisluacha, tá an gnáthráta á laghdú ó 25 faoin gcéad go dtí 23 faoin gcéad, beart a chabhróidh le praghsanna a ísliú ar raon leathan d'earraí sna siopaí.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna, tá soláthar déanta sa cháinaisnéis le haghaidh méaduithe suntasacha sna rátaí leasa shóisialaigh agus tá méaduithe níos airde le tabhairt dóibh siúd atá dífhostaithe ar feadh tréimhse fada.  Nuair a smaoinítear ar na harduithe a tugadh le cúpla bliain anuas, agus nuair a ghlactar leis go bhfuil an ráta boilscithe níos ísle ná an bunráta méadaithe, is léir go mbeidh na daoine sin atá ag brath go mór ar an gcóras leasa shóisialaigh i bhfad níos fearr as i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Is cúis áthais ar leith domsa go bhfuil ré na n-iasachtaí mar leigheas ar an ngátar airgid a bhí ag brú ar an tír seo le fada thart agus go bhfuil cúrsaí airgeadais an Stáit á gcur ar shlí a réitithe.  De thoradh na cáinaisnéise seo, meastar go mbeidh laghdú £305 milliún ar an méid a bheidh ar an Rialtas a fháil ar iasacht i mbliana i gcomparáid leis an suim don bhliain seo caite.  Agus, ar ndóigh, b'iontach an rud é go raibh an tsuim a fuarthas ar iasacht anuraidh níos lú ná leath den mhéid a measadh dó i gcáinaisnéis na bliana sin. Fós féin, is costas trom é ar an Stát an t-ús ar na hiasachtaí go léir &mdash; ús de dhá billiún punt nó mar sin atá i gceist i mbliana.  Is ionann é sin agus beagnach an méid iomlán a íocann lucht cánach PAYE.  Caithfidh an Rialtas ualach na n-iasachtaí a laghdú tuilleadh agus tá céimeanna suntasacha glactha sa cháinaisnéis seo i ndáil leis sin.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhb amháin a bhfuil a réiteach ag brath ar gach uile dhuine sa tír agus is é sin fadhb an truaillithe.  Tá a lán airgid á chur ar fáil sa cháinaisnéis seo mar <Col N="2077" /> chabhair chun an Plean Náisiúnta Comhshaoil a fheidhmiú ach saothar in aisce a bheidh ann mura nglacann gach aon saoránach an fhreagracht atá air féachaint chuige nach ndéanfar truailliú de bharr aon ghníomh dá chuid.  Tá dualgas ar gach uile dhuine bheith faichileach sna gnóthaí seo lena chinntiú go dtiocfaidh torthaí fiúntacha as an airgead mór atá á chur ar fáil faoin gcáinaisnéis don phlean náisiúnta seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na freagrachtaí sonracha atá orm féin go pearsanta, tá breis agus £19.5 milliún á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas i mbliana lena chaitheamh chun leas na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Is airgead vótáilte breis agus £16 mhilliún de sin agus tá sonraí faoin gcaitheachas measta tugtha sna Meastacháin i gcóir na Seirbhisí Poiblí.  B'fhearr liomsa, ar ndóigh, go mbeadh níos mó ar fáil ach, ag an am céanna, tá méadú de 27 faoin gcéad déanta sna Meastacháin i mbliana i gcomparáid le soláthar na bliana seo caite, rud a léiríonn go soiléir seasamh an Rialtais seo i leith na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash; an gléas forbartha tionscail atá ag an Rialtas don Ghaeltacht &mdash; is cúis sásaimh domsa go raibh méadú substaintiúil arís ag deireadh na bliana seo caite, don ochtú bliain as a chéile, i líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ón eagraíocht. Ar 31 Nollaig 1989, bhí breis is 54,000 duine fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscnaimh éagsúla sa Ghaeltacht faoi scáth an Údaráis agus is ionann é sin agus glanmhéadú de 30 faoin gcéad ó 1982 ar aghaidh. Tuigim ón Údarás gur cruthaíodh 1,098 bpost nua breise lánaimseartha ar an dtalamh sa Ghaeltacht i rith 1989.  Bhí sprioc de 600 post nua breise leagtha síos don Údarás sa Phlean Téarnaimh Náisiúnta le haghaidh 1989 agus is ábhar dóchais dúinn uile gur sáraíodh an figiúr sin de bheagnach 500 post.  Tá fostaíocht sheasúrach ríthábhachtach don Ghaeltacht agus mhéadaigh líon na bpost páirtaimseartha-séasúrach go dtí os cionn 2,000 anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Tá tacaíocht nach beag tugtha don Údarás ag an Rialtas seo le cur ar chumas <Col N="2078" /> na heagraíochta cúnamh a thabhairt do thionsclóirí chun tionscnaimh a lonnú sa Ghaeltacht d'fhonn deiseanna fostaíochta a chur ar fáil don phobal ansin. Aithníonn an Rialtas go maith na deacrachtaí bunúsacha a bhíonn ag an Údarás agus é ag iarraidh saol eacnamaíochta, sóisialta agus cultúrtha na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus caighdeán maireachtála muintir na Gaeltachta a ardú oiread agus is féidir.  Mar fhianaise ar dháiríreacht an Rialtais maidir le cabhrú leis an Údarás san obair sin, tá méadú suntasach déanta ar an gcúnamh atá á chur fáil don Údarás i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Beidh níos mó ná £13 mhilliún ar fáil ón Stát don eagraíocht i 1990 i gcomparáid le breis is £10 milliún anuraidh.  Is airgead vótáilte a chuirtear ar fáil trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta £9.65 milliún den soláthar iomlán, i.e., suim £2.25 milliún mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do chaiteachas reatha agus suim £7.4 milliún mar dheontas-i-gcabhair do chaiteachas caipitil. Úsáidtear an soláthar caipitil sin chun deontais a íoc mar chabhair chun tionscail nó scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta a bhunú, a fhorbairt nó a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Is méadú de 54 faoin gcéad an tsuim atá á cur ar fáil i mbliana chun deontais a íoc i gcomparáid leis an tsuim a cuireadh ar fáil anuraidh.  Anuas ar sin, tá beagnach £3.5 milliún údaraithe don Údarás mar airleacain ón bPríomh-Chiste chun monarchana a thógáil nó a athchóiriú, infheistíocht a dhéanamh i scaireanna, i bhfochuideachtaí, agus i gcomhchuideachtaí, agus chun maoin a cheannach.  Leis an airgead méadaithe sin, táim cinnte go mbeidh ar chumas an Údaráis brú ar aghaidh leis an obair thábhachtach atá ar siúl aige ar mhaithe le gach gné de shaol pobal na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt.</P>
    <P>Is éineacht le tacaíocht a thabhairt chun tionscail dhéantúsaíochta, fheirmeoireacht éisc-saothrú na mara, forbairt achmainní nádúrtha, etc., sa Ghaeltacht a chur chun cinn, tá béim ar leith á cur ag an Údarás ar thionscnaimh straitéiseacha. Tá straitéis fhad-thréimhseach acu chun tionscal teileachumarsáide agus faisnéise a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht agus, mar chuid den phlean, tá dhá chuideachta <Col N="2079" /> nua &mdash; Telegael Teo agus G-Com Teo &mdash; bunaithe.  Is cuideachta í Telegael Teo atá ag cur réimse cuimsitheach de shaoráidí táirgthe agus iartháirgthe chlár teilifíse ar fáil, ar bhonn trádála, do léiritheoirí neamhspleácha agus do RTÉ féin.  Bunaíodh G-Com Teo mar chomhlacht forbartha teicneolaíochta teileachumarsáide agus faisnéise.  Is é an aidhm atá leis na tionscnaimh straitéiseacha seo ná a chinntiú go mbeidh an Ghaeltacht ar chomhchéim iomaíochta le ceantair eile sa tír i réimsí infheistíochta nua-theicneolaíochta a mhealladh chun na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Tá grinnscrúdú á dhéanamh ag an Údarás ar riachtanais eacnamaíochta sóisialta agus cultúrtha na Gaeltachta sna nóchaidí agus ar an ról a bheidh ag an Údarás chun na riachtanais sin a shásamh. Tá an eagraíocht ag ullmhú le haghaidh dúshlán na haoise seo agus do na deiseanna a bheidh ann do thionscail Ghaeltachta nuair a bheidh Margadh Comhaontaithe na hEorpa i réim in 1992 Cinnte beidh buntáistí fiúntacha ar leith le fáil ag an nGaeltacht ón margadh sin, ach na tionscail éagsúla inti a bheith ullamh agus eagraithe chun na deiseanna gnó a bheidh ann a thapú.  Beidh an tÚdarás ag cabhrú leis na tionscail sin chun tairbhe a bhaint as na deiseanna a bheidh ar fáil.  Díreofar ar thograí comhaontaithe ceadúnais mhargaíochta agus dhéantúsaíochta agus aistriú teicneolaíochta, d'fhonn deiseanna i margadh na hEorpa a thapú.  Chomh maith leis sin, bainfear feidhm as gníomhaíocht dhíreach nuair is gá.</P>
    <P>Is í an Ghaeltacht foinse ár dteanga agus ár n-oidhreachta agus glactar leis go coitianta nach mbeidh an rath ar an nGaeilge mura mbeidh ceantair bhríomhara ann agus an Ghaeilge á labhairt iontu mar ghnáth-urlabhra an phobail. Ní mór mar sin a chinntiú go mbíonn na saoráidí cuí sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ionas go mbeidh ar chumas na ndaoine caighdeán maireachtála sásúil a bheith acu inti.  Ceapadh scéimeanna feabhsúcháin Roinn na Gaeltachta, mar sin, chun bun-struchtúr na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt d'fhonn caighdeán maireachtála sásúil a <Col N="2080" /> chinntiú don phobal.  Tá scéimeanna éagsúla ann a chuidíonn le gach saoráid atá ag teastáil &mdash; bóithre, uisce agus séarachais, saoráidí calaíochta, chomh maith le saorádí spóirt agus caithimh aimsire ar nós hallaí pobail, páirceanna imeartha, agus mar sin de.  Is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil an soláthar airgid do scéimeanna feabhsúcháin mo Roinne-se méadaithe ó £1.492 milliún i 1989 go £1.755 milliún i mbliana &mdash; méadú de bheagnach 18 faoin gcéad.</P>
    <P>Is bealach an-mhaith chun ceantar a fhorbairt ná lámh a bheith ag an bpobal áitiúil i bpleanáil agus i gcur i gcrích na forbairte: sin mar a tharlaíonn le comharchumann gníomhach áitiúil.  Tá an cúnamh a bheidh ar fáil do scéim mo Roinn-se faoina dtugtar cúnamh do chomharchumainn Ghaeltachta méadaithe i mbliana go breis agus £0.5 milliúin &mdash; méadú 21 faoin gcéad i gcomparáid le soláthar na bliana 1989.  Is léiriú é seo ar an tábhacht a bhaineann leis na comharchumainn Ghaeltachta i dtuairim an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>Ach má táthar chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, ní leor go mbeadh sí á labhairt sa Ghaeltacht amháin.  Tá dualgas ar gach aon duine againn ár gcion féin a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Is beag duine anois nár fhoghlaim Gaeilge ar scoil agus, cé go bhféadfadh meirg a bheith tagtha ar chuid mhaith di de bharr easpa cleachtaidh, tá an cumas ionainn go léir, ach an toil a bheith ann, roinnt éigin Gaeilge a úsáid inár ngnáthshaol. Ní féidir an dualgas seo a fhágáil faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta amháin &mdash; má dhéantar amhlaidh, cruthófar meoin an &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; sul i bhfad.  Tá obair mhaith déanta ag Bord na Gaeilge chun an dualgas atá leagtha air ag an Oireachtas a chomhlíonadh &mdash; úsáid na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo agus mar ghnáthmeán cumarsáide a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ceapaim go mbeidh sé tráthúil beagán a rá faoin ard-chaighdeán díospóireachta a bhí againn inniu.  Glacaim leis an deis seo chun tréaslú a dhéanamh leis na Teachtaí go léir a tháinig isteach inniu agus a thaispeán go bhfuil an oiread sin suime acu sa Ghaeilge.  Is beag duine nach bhfoghlaimíonn Gaeilge ar scoil <Col N="2081" /> agus caithfear, mar sin, glacadh leis go bhfuil Gaeilge ag gach duine sa Teach seo.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt scéimeanna cultúrtha á reachtáil ag mo Roinn féin chun úsáid na Gaeilge sa phobal i gcoitinne a fhorbairt. Tugtar cúnamh do thréimhseacháin éagsúla i nGaeilge agus do nuachtán seachtainiúil Ghaeilge, cuirtear cúnamh ar fáil chun cabhrú leis an drámaíocht Ghaeilge agus cabhraítear le cuid mhaith eagras atá ag obair go tréan d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl leis na coistí deonacha atá ag fáil tacaíocht ón Roinn, as ucht an obair iontaigh atá á dhéanamh acu go léir.  Tá a fhios agamsa agus ag saol mór amuigh nach féidir an teanga a athshlanú, a chaomhnú, le hairgead amháin.  Is cuidiú é, ar ndóigh ach tá an-tábhacht ag gábhail leis na daoine atá ag obair go deonach ar fud na tíre, sna coistí sin.  Is eol dom go bhfuil an cuspóir céanna ag na coistí sin go léir.</P>
    <P>Is é an ceann is tábhachtaí agus is costaisí de na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha a bhíonn á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse ná Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, faoina n-íoctar deontais díreach le mná tí sa Ghaeltacht a mbíonn foghlaimeoirí aitheanta ar iostas acu.  Bhí ar mo chumas i mbliana an deontas sin a mhéadú go dtí £3.50 in aghaidh an lae do gach dalta &mdash; sin méadú de 40 pingin.  Is méadú suntasach é sin agus tá mé cinnte go gcabhróidh sé, ní amháin leis na mná tí a dhéanann sár-obair as son na Gaeilge sa samhradh, ach do na coláistí samhraidh féin, mar cuirfidh sé ar a gcumas an táille a íocann tuismitheoirí a choinneáil ag leibhéal inghlactha.  Is cuid an-tábhachtach d'eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta na coláistí samhraidh.  I 1989 d'fhreastail beagnach 17,000 foghlaimeoirí ar cúrsaí Gaeilge na Gaeltachta, gan trácht ar chuairteanna ó thuismitheoirí, cáirde agus mar sin de.  Tionscal turasóireachta iontu féin iad na coláistí samhraidh gan aon dabht.  Mar aitheantas speisialta ar na cúrsaí trí-mhí a eagraíonn Gael-Linn, ba chúis áthais dom bheith in ann a fhógairt go mbeadh deontas £5 in aghaidh an lae á íoc ag mo Roinnse i leith gach dalta scoile a fhreastalaíonn ar na cúrsaí seo i <Col N="2082" /> 1990. Tá an deontas breise seo tuillte ag na mná tí mar go mbíonn an dalta scoile ar iostas acu do thréimhse níos mó ná 80 lá de ghnáth.  Ó thaobh fhoghlaim na Gaeilge, níl sárú na gcúrsaí seo le fáil.</P>
    <P>Cuirim fáilte ar leith roimh an gcáinaisnéis seo.  Níl aon amhras ach gur plean réalaíoch é don bhliain seo &mdash; plean a chabhróidh le gach aicme den phobal. Tá mé cinnte go mbainfear amach na spriocanna airgeadais atá leagtha síos ann agus tá dóchas mór agam go n-éireoidh leis an Aire Airgeadais cáinaisnéis níos fearr fós fiú a chur inár láthar an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was confident enough to deliver my speech in Irish I would start by thanking the Minister of State for providing a translation of his speech.  I notice he stated that there is no doubt that unemployment is one of the biggest problems we have to resolve, not only in the country in general but in the Gaeltacht, in the area he represents.  I would like to make some reference to the area I represent and to the unemployment problem there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past number of years the need to bring the public finances under control was so urgent that very little effective political choice was left to Government in relation to financial matters.  I have witnessed over a long number of years successive Ministers for Finance having to deal with large budget deficits.  I was elected to this House in 1982 and because of irresponsible borrowing by the previous Government the budget deficit stood then at 22 per cent of GNP.  As a result of the tremendous efforts of that Government, when they left office in 1987 the deficit stood at 12 per cent of GNP.  The present Government in the following two years with the responsible support of the Fine Gael Party in Opposition were able to reduce the deficit substantially, to such an extent that the present Minister for Finance was able to come into the House this year and open the budget with a modest surplus.  I believe it is now within our power in the years ahead to balance our budgets <Col N="2083" /> without further reference to significant borrowing.</P>
    <P>Our priority now must be to reduce the national debt.  This was clearly emphasised by the Central Bank in their recent report.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the budget were aimed principally at the top and bottom of our income tax scale.  Social welfare recipients will also have an increase in benefits from July, with some of the worst off getting above average increases.  At the other end of the scale, the tax changes will for the most part confer benefits on those in the upper income groups. Almost everyone will benefit to some extent from the tax changes in April. There are three basic concessions.  The 32 per cent standard rate is reduced to 30 per cent, the tax band for married couples is widened from £12,000 to £13,000 and the final concession is the lowering of the 56p band to 53p.  It can be fairly said that the Minister gave a little here and a little there in the hope of satisfying everyone but failed to meet the real challenge facing society, namely job creation and the elimination of poverty.</P>
    <P>Social welfare increases can certainly help the less well off but they are not a solution to their problem, which can only be resolved by gainful employment.  It frightens me at times to find in certain parts of my constituency whole families who have not been in gainful employment for many years.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister for Finance managed to put a substantial amount of money into the economy in the hope that it will boost consumer spending and overall economic growth this year.  The Department of Finance estimate that growth will be 1 per cent higher in 1990 due to the budget and they are now predicting an increase of 3.75 per cent in GNP.  Faster growth would mean more jobs and the Government are now estimating a 13,000 increase in total employment this year.  These are only estimates; they are not real jobs.  Even if they did materialise, would they be sufficient?  I do not think so.  This is the main weakness in the budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> One only has to look at the situation in Dublin to understand the real problem of unemployment.  For years it was accepted that Dublin was capable of looking after itself.  It was the policy of successive Governments in the sixties and seventies to encourage the IDA to promote the rest of the country for industrial expansion at the expense of Dublin.  As a result Dublin's share of industrial employment in new overseas industries is well below the average for the rest of the State.  Between 1975 and 1987 State grants and capital expenditure on industrial development in Dublin increased from £5 million to £39 million, as compared with an increase from £38 million to £107 million in the rest of the country. The long recession has bitten deeper in Dublin than in the rest of the country. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that Dublin, with 28 per cent of the population and 31 per cent of the labour force, has 33 per cent of national unemployment. The measures taken by the Minister for Finance in this budget to cope with the problems of unemployment fall well below the target as far as Dublin is concerned.</P>
    <P>To hold unemployment at its 1989 level, allowing for emigration, Dublin needs 8,000 net new jobs by 1996.  To halve the 1989 unemployment level, over 40,000 jobs would be required.  The problem is so severe that a five or seven year perspective is needed to create reasonable prospects of dealing with it.  By 1996 the labour force in Dublin will have grown by 58,000.  If no new net jobs are created total unemployment in Dublin will rise to over 106,000.</P>
    <P>For too long public representatives for the greater Dublin area have appeared to be shy about promoting the needs of the capital city.  I make no apology for putting on the record of the House during this debate the substantial problem which faces the Government in providing jobs for the city of Dublin and the greater Dublin area.  It is not realistic to contemplate zero unemployment in this city. A very challenging target would be 50 per cent of 106,000, namely 53,000 jobs, leaving 11 per cent of the labour force <Col N="2085" /> unemployed, as against 17 per cent at present.  This target would be set by the year 1996.  This is a challenge to any Government and to any Minister for Finance because since 1985 only 3,000 net new jobs have been created in the capital city.  To achieve the target of 53,000 net new jobs by 1999, job creation must be stepped up from 750 jobs a year to almost 7,500 jobs a year.  This is a major challenge. I regret that in his budget speech the Minister did not refer to this matter and did not say what measures he intends to take to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>The best hope for Dublin in resolving its problems lies in the service industries and in tourism.  I welcome the £2 million allocation to Bord Fáilte for promotional activities but this amount will fall short of the minimum necessary to meet the target of 50 per cent growth in tourist numbers by 1990.  The additional £2 million is to be matched by the tourism industry and I understand that Bord Fáilte are currently engaged in discussions with the industry to increase their participation in a wide range of promotional activities.</P>
    <P>Dublin is unsold as a tourist destination. Is is losing a great opportunity in the midst of a world boom in travel. More and more people are in search of new and interesting destinations.  Dublin needs to be repositioned as the year-round flagship of Irish tourism.  The thrust must come from a vibrant tourist authority promoting year-round visits to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Direct access from the USA to Dublin would benefit Irish tourism without damaging Shannon.  Dublin Airport's place in international air transportation is being constrained by the special position of Shannon which requires trans-Atlantic scheduled services to stop there.  The case for the retention of this constraint is no longer justified by the circumstances of Shannon.  The ending of the mandatory Shannon stopover would free Dublin Airport to develop as a major international air transportation hub as an inevitable alternative to the crowded airports of London and continental Europe.  There is now just one North American carrier willing to serve Ireland.  Within hours <Col N="2086" /> of the UK Government's announcement that the Prestwick monopoly on Scottish trans-Athlantic flights was being lifted, two North Atlantic carriers announced that they were prepared to serve Glasgow directly.  It is clear from the responses of the DKM survey of North American carriers that at least three of them are interested in direct services to Dublin. These services would involve up to 250,000 extra seats to Ireland.  The impact on tourism, not just in Dublin but throughout the country, would be enormous because every 40 tourists creates one extra job.  Therefore, a load factor of 70 per cent extra flights would mean more than 4,000 extra jobs.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport are losing more than tourists as Irish traffic to north America is going through London at the rate of 80,000 passengers per year to avoid the compulsory stopover at Shannon.  Aer Lingus are losing business and they would expand employment at Dublin Airport if they could compete more effectively with London.  However, they cannot do this without direct flights.  The defenders of the Shannon monopoly must be sweet music to British Airways who are the major beneficiaries of the current policy. Dublin is the only capital in Europe where direct North American air services are prohibited.  This is hindering economic development and job creation in the city of Dublin where unemployment, as I said, is substantially above the national level.  To achieve this change substantial political initiative is required.  I call on Deputies from all parties representing the greater Dublin area to support this initiative.</P>
    <P>To ease unemployment in Dublin tourism must be vigorously promoted.  Use could be made of Dublin all the year round, especially its attractions.  Above all, we need a national convention centre to handle international conventions of 2,000 people and more.  If Dublin had this kind of facility it would have a galvanising effect on tourist development.</P>
    <P>Birmingham has such an investment; like other cities which fought their way back to economic growth through tourism they find that the convention centre <Col N="2087" /> is the core investment.  Tourist related jobs in Birmingham increased from 10,000 in 1975 to 69,000 in 1985 and to 90,000 last year.  The conference centre is expected to lead to the creation of 12,000 to 15,000 additional new jobs.  To get this facility for Dublin the Government would need to show the same enthusiasm and support which they gave to the Custom House Docks development and the Financial Services Centre. I am sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you are aware of the 156,000 container units which are lost to Dublin port every year because they do not have proper access.  They now go on to Larne but if access roads were available to the port this problem would be resolved.  I hope the necessary finance will be provided by the Minister for Finance for these roadways and that local authorities will have the courage to implement them.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated that there was a significant growth in the proceeds from the sale of State assets.  These sales have been carried out in pursuance of the Government's view that it is not in the best interests of the State &mdash; any more than it is of business &mdash; to hold on to assets which are not providing an adequate return.  The State assets I have in mind differ very much in degree from what the Minister had in mind.  There is a number of housing sites in the Dublin area, especially in my area of Beggar's Bush.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of finance when the Department of the Environment built houses, Dublin Corporation are now forced to sell these sites. This is a retrograde step because housing is badly needed.  The site at Beggar's Bush is particularly suitable for senior citizen accommodation.  Dublin Corporation were negotiating with the Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance to purchase this site for a nominal price but, unfortunately, I understand that these negotiations have broken down.  I ask the Minister for Finance to intercede with his Department to enable Dublin Corporation to purchase this site at a nominal price, which was the original intention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> The Minister for Finance, in presenting his budget, failed to address the serious problems of unemployment and emigration. However, I admit that it was a politically astute budget which will keep our finances on the rails.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Doyle for the many constructive points he made. The national budget tries to do two things each year which in many ways are contradictory. On the one hand it is a major annual vote-keeping exercise; it sets spending and revenue raising agenda for the 12 months ahead but within this broad framework the Government and the Minister for Finance tend to balance the multitude of conflicting demands, pressure and priorities in a way which best serves the needs of the community as a whole and as many individuals as possible within that community.</P>
      <P>A budget is, of necessity, a balance between bookkeeping and social action, taxation and spending, rich and poor, the present and the future.  A budget is also, unfortunately, a prisoner of the past. Each day we spend £6 million or £7 million paying interest on past borrowings. There are people in this House who think we should keep on borrowing so that the State can become more and more dominant in all aspects of everyday life.  These people, who represent the Left, seem to be unaware of what is happening all round us in Europe and elsewhere. Once it was the proud boast of leaders in Eastern Europe that they were left-wingers and Marxists and that they presided over workers' republics.  As we have seen, the workers did not agree with them and their leaders are, for the most part, gone.  Unfortunately, the legacy of their Marxist workers' republics remains after them, debt, despair, repression, shattered infrastructure, filthy polluted environments and a disillusioned people whose confidence has been undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are parties in this House who think that we should lead our people down the Marxist road.  Those parties share a basic ideology with the former dictators of Romania, East Germany and <Col N="2089" /> the USSR.  Of course they do not advocate dictatorship but how can they avoid it?  Is it not necessary to establish a dictatorship of the people in order to have a full flowering of Marxist ideology?  I am told that The Workers' Party are a Marxist party.  If that is the case they should say so.  More importantly they should tell the people that they are a Marxist party and people will then be able to look to those states which have lived under Marxism for 40 years to see what Marxism in action really means.</P>
    <P>There are also Marxists of a very militant variety in the Labour Party.  Deputy Spring did his best to root them out as he knows how dangerous Marxists can be but I think there are a few left.  The Green Party are part of the Left alliance and I do not know what to say about them. They do not know themselves.  Recently the Fine Gael Leader, to our surprise and disbelief, said that Fine Gael are moving to the Left.</P>

      <P>They, too, have turned their soul and disturbed the stormy waters of the Left.  How typical of them when, all over the world, many nations and parties are turning from the big brother politics of the Left.  This is a cynical decision and a strategy to go where votes may possibly be won.  That is the prerogative of Fine Gael but they are unsuited to this direction.  I have no doubt that they will put their plans together and theorise endlessly about the propriety of this or that social attitude or stance.  They will provide beautifully written dissertations to the great and pressing questions of the day.  Their analysis will, by their own sketchy standards, be quite good but do not ask them to put their theories into practice.  The gulf between saying and doing has always been too wide for Fine Gael to cross and I say this more in sorrow than in anger. History is our instructor.  They are like a well turned out horse flying towards the jump, snorting and puffing with leathers flying but always unable to take the jump, <Col N="2090" /> always refusing at the last moment, forever disappointing all those who were impressed by the well groomed look and the impeccable manner.</P>

      <P>Let me get back to the real world, a world in which we must pay our debts and make adequate provision for our people, the disadvantaged, those with no jobs and those who want a future here.  People want a clean environment, free from pollution and nuclear waste, free from fear of crime and war, and free from inequality and injustice.  The most important point is that people feel free.</P>
      <P>It is a tall order to have to put together a budget, so how did the budget measure up?  I would like to deal with one or two specific points and maybe make some suggestions because it is the rôle of backbenchers to make suggestions.  The business expansion scheme deserves a mention in this debate.  The success of this scheme is entirely due to the amendments of the 1987 legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil, when the tourist sector and shipping activities were included as qualifying activities.  In his budget speech, the Minister indicated that he was asking the Revenue Commissioners to look at some schemes being submitted to them within the framework of the existing legislation.  Some groups have attempted to use the scheme of tax relief to provide what is effectively loan capital to projects while dressing this up as equity participation through share issues which qualify under the business expansion scheme.  The scheme has many beneficial effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wider share ownership is being promoted and there should be substantial <Col N="2091" /> improvements, to the tourist infrastructure through the development of hotels and other leisure facilities.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport has expressed reservations about property developers making use of the scheme.  I share his concern but I would ask the Minister for Finance to retain his essentially positive attitude towards the scheme when considering any legislative changes to be made in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The principal area of potential abuse, if I may call it that, is in the hotel building sector.  I would suggest that if the Minister were to ensure that funds raised had to go to build new facilities rather than fund the purchase of existing facilities, the more obvious seams would be prevented. A critical examination of the guidelines laid down by Bord Fáilte would serve to restrict manipulators of the scheme.  Companies are only allowed to spend limited percentages of the money raised under the scheme on land and buildings.  However, the application of these guidelines laid down by Bord Fáilte is far from clear.  A hotel is restricted to 65 per cent of the amount of its total assets to be employed in land and buildings.  One way of restricting and controlling the use of the business expansion scheme in this area would be to critically examine the application of the guidelines, possibly reducing them but definitely laying down stricter criteria as to their application.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this topic I would like to suggest that the Minister consider introducing a form of roll-over relief for capital gains tax purposes in connection with business expansion scheme shares. An individual who sells his shares within the five year period and who would normally incur a claw-back if he rein-could defer this claw-back if he reinvested in further qualifying shares.  This measure would create a market in the shares of many of these companies and would promote wider share ownership in general and the business expansion scheme in particular, with no cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>On the question of tax rates it has to <Col N="2092" /> be pointed out that between 1987 and 1990 the top rate of tax has been cut by 5 per cent, from 58 to 53 per cent, and the standard rate has also been cut by 5 per cent, from 35 to 30 per cent.  This dramatic reduction in tax has been achieved despite the grim state of the country's finances which faced the Fianna Fáil Party when they took office after the chaos left by the fire-backed Coalition.  I consider these achievements to represent nothing short of a triumph for this administration and I would warmly applaud the Government and the Minister for their significant contribution to this achievement. The contribution of some of the Minister's Deputy Reynolds, predecessors does not, unfortunately, shine forth in the same manner.  Deputy Dukes, in his years as Minister for Finance, had little to show other than the inequitable and aborted farm tax and residential property tax which, to my mind, were badly drawn up and continued many serious inequities.  Fine Gael showed themselves incapable of grappling with many of the structural problems affecting the tax system but Fianna Fáil are now doing this.</P>
    <P>Private sector employment depends largely on confidence.  Individual employers will not take on people when they are uncertain about the future of the economy and do not feel confident about the future of their own businesses.  Successive surveys of Irish business people show that business confidence is building under this Government.  I firmly believe this will translate into job creation in the private sector.  The reduction in tax rates, the increased numbers exempt from PRSI and the general air of business confidence, despite unwelcome development on the international front, will bring about much needed improvement in employment.  This degree of confidence is shared by many international bankers. Having talked to many people in the financial world, I firmly believe that if offered the prospect of anything other than Fianna Fáil in Government, the business community both at home and abroad would take a far less sanguine <Col N="2093" /> view of the Irish economy as a place to leave their funds.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been referred to by many speakers in this debate.  This was derided by many of our political opponents and by various press commentators as an election gimmick, but it has proved to be anything but that.  The dramatic revitalisation of the tourist industry, the potentially enormously successful international Financial Services Centre, the commitment and adherence to the reduction of the tax burden on the average worker, were all well signalled in our programme.  No matter how our opponents wish to twist the facts, there is no way they can dispute the success of this programme.</P>
    <P>We are paying our debts.  My income tax &mdash; and we all feel the same about income tax &mdash; is high but not as high as it was last year or the year before.  Income tax rates are coming down and the Fine Gael Party should note that in particular. Last year we commenced a process of tax reduction, we are continuing it this year and next year there will be more cuts in tax &mdash; there had better be because the rates are still too high.  At the end of the day what we must draw attention to is the average worker because his tax is still too high.  This is the object lesson which Fine Gael have never learned.  Action, even a small action, is better than verbiage.  We had plenty of verbiage from the last Coalition Government and also over the last two years.</P>
    <P>There is hardly need for the Government to restate their commitment to the poor, the disadvantaged and the unemployed, those who are most in need.  Our proud record over the last two years can stand up.  We can reassure the people that our priorities exist in actions, and not just in words.  Of course we will give disproportionately large allocations to help those most in need and we do not claim any credit for that.  We have always done that and we will always do it.  It is our philosophy.  It is not to be wondered at; justice demands it.</P>
    <P>I read in this morning's paper that the Central Bank said that tax concessions and the social welfare measures were too <Col N="2094" /> generous.  That shows the stark difference between Governments, financiers and banks.  We do not believe these measures were too generous, and that is the direction in which we will proceed. We will provide hope for the future and we have a right to claim credit for giving hope to the people of Ireland.  In the last two years, the outlook for thousands of people has been changed utterly for the better.  People have hope and they know things are getting better slowly but surely.  More jobs are being created, although not nearly enough and progress has been made and much more progress will be made in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>With falling personal tax rates, one of the major constraints to the creation of jobs and the exploitation of enterprise and talent is being removed.  I welcome this move to lighten the burden of direct personal taxation.  I see the way ahead as a continuation of this process, that is, a redistribution of direct taxation away from the individual and towards the corporate sector.  While we must continue to raise revenue, there is a real limit to the amount of saving and cutting back that can be done.  I have no doubt there are still areas where further savings can be made and we must find these areas and make these savings but as a community of people, it is our duty to regulate our affairs in such a way that all members of society receive equitable treatment.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that real moves will be made over the next years to deal with the problem of urban smoke pollution.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when we will no longer dread the approach of November with its inversion into consequent smog.  The living environment is of such crucial importance that we must, if we are to survive as a civilised nation, devote increasing resources, nationally and internationally, to cleaning our planet.  I am satisfied that the measures being taken will lead to an increase in environmental awareness, the necessary prerequisite to introducing and sustaining long term major energy, land and resources, planning and social programmes which are specifically designed <Col N="2095" /> to improve and preserve the environment. We are the people who will take the action; we will get the job done.  The budget continues a momentum which has been gathering pace over the last few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 3, 5, 16 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I expect to introduce a Bill in the House within a week, in fact next Tuesday, which will provide for the establishment of representative associations for members of the Permanent Defence Force for the purpose of representing them on remuneration and related matters. The new legislation will be enabling and the detailed arrangements will be provided for by regulation.  Representatives of the new association will be elected by secret ballot by the personnel whom they are to represent, the purpose being to give members of the force a representative voice on pay and related matters; on conditions of service, other than matters which would affect areas such as security, discipline, command and military operations; and, on welfare matters such as credit union, family support systems, recreational facilities and medical benefit schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed arrangements in regard to <Col N="2097" /> the operation of the new system, including access to the media, funding, meetings and conciliation and arbitration will be worked out in consultation with the elected representatives.  In general terms, however, it is contemplated that a system of conciliation and arbitration will be provided; spokespersons will be permitted to make statements to the news media on matters which fall within the scope of the representative associations; associations will be given certain facilities in the matter of accommodation and staffing by the State; subscriptions to meet other expenses will be permitted, the level of such subscriptions to be the subject of discussion with the representatives who emerge from the election process; there will be regular meetings of representatives in military installations to whatever extent is required.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the arrangements will be fully protected by legislation and regulations.  Moreover, there is no question of imposing a system without consultation; on the contrary every opportunity will be accorded to the duly elected representatives to participate in the formulation and finalisation of the arrangements.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to questions on 6 February 1990 it is important that the House be satisfied that the arrangements being introduced strike the correct balance between giving the members of the Permanent Defence Force a representative voice in relation to their pay and other conditions of service, and at the same time, maintaining proper controls in essential areas such as command and operations.  I also wish to stress again the importance of refraining from action which would, in effect, seek to pre-empt the decision of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Full opportunity to debate this important development will be provided when I bring the proposed legislation before the House for a Second Stage reading on next Tuesday, an arrangement which has been agreed between the Whips.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has repeated <Col N="2098" /> that he does not intend to impose anything and yet he has told us that legislation to deal with this matter will be introduced next week.  The Minister has given us a broad outline of what that legislation will contain.  However, meaningful consultations will not take place. We now have it official from the officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The Deputy should proceed by way of supplementary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the Curragh Command and from PDFORRA and I should like to ask the Minister what he is doing if he is not imposing his own structure on the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be elaborating on this next Tuesday.  I am going even further than the suggestions contained in the memorandum prepared by the PDFORRA.  I am giving a system of conciliation and arbitration in addition to what they suggest.  What they have suggested in regard to the general principles I have mentioned is on all fours with the views I have made known to the House. I have with me the full proposals made by this body and I have followed them &mdash; it is important that I should emphasise that &mdash; and they are on all fours with what the Garda representative body have in regard to their function with their members.  There is no conflict whatever in regard to what the objectives should be, that they should cover pay, conditions and the welfare matters I mentioned.  The body, or bodies, when established, can have access to the media and can adopt their funding arrangements in addition to being facilitated in regard to accommodation by the Department of Defence. There is really nothing between us. However, what is there is the fact that those who will form the personnel of the new representative body will be elected by all the personnel in the Defence Forces, the various commands of the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps.  I will be meeting representatives, elected by <Col N="2099" /> the personnel of the Defence Forces, following the passing of legislation by the House.  The democratic structure of Oireachtas Éireann, and the Government elected by Oireachtas Éireann, will be in a position to place the legislation on record.  As a result of that legislation agreement can be reached through elected representatives on behalf of the military personnel and military headquarters of the details of what are to be the agreed structures to meet the case put by PDFORRA or anybody else.  I cannot put the issue clearer than that. Everything is being allowed but the important distinction is that it will be done under the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  The ultimate power resides with the Oireachtas and the Government of the day in regard to these matters, and that is as it should be.  Within that broad framework full consultation will take place.  It will take place not with any self appointed group, or any self appointed people, but with the representatives elected by the members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again appeal for brevity having regard to the time limit imposed in respect of these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair will accept that I am always very brief and to the point. If the Minister is so reasonable why is it that he did not have consultations?  Why did the officers of the Curragh Command say that what the Minister is proposing is not remotely near to what they seek? Why are PDFORRA going to boycott the Minister's suggestions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do not go on, this is too important and sensitive a matter.  I should like to ask the Deputy to control what he has to say in this respect.  What the officers of the Curragh Command did had nothing to do with our legislation. That is what I would expect from any <Col N="2100" /> Army group expressing a point of view.</P>
      <P>That is a difference of opinion between officers of the Curragh Command and their own headquarters officer staff.  That is an internal matter between officers and it has nothing to do, and I should hope it would have nothing to do, with what is passed by the Oireachtas.  What I will be doing on Tuesday is bringing in legislation embodying what I have said to the Deputy.  It will provide for a democratic election subsequently and, arising out of that, the structuring of a representative body and the arrangements for that in conjunction with the elected representatives. That is all an internal matter for the Army subsequent to the Oireachtas laying down the parameters.</P>
      <P>We are into this area now and I want to repudiate the suggestion that there are any officers in the Curragh or anywhere else taking action <i>vis-á-vis</i> me, because as Minister for Defence I have never proposed any alternative structure or sought to impose any alternative structure. This will all flow from the decision of the Oireachtas because that is where the power resides.  The Deputy must be careful in this matter; the ultimate power in this area must reside with the Oireachtas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to be brief.  I want to put on record my acknowledgment of the Minister's efforts.  I remember only too well that we <Col N="2101" /> were going nowhere last year but we are now making remarkable progress.  I would urge the Minister, in the context of my question to consider that the permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association represents a little more than a self-appointed organisation. There appears to be breakdown in communications.  Respecting the primacy of the Oireachtas in the matter&mdash; we will debate the Bill next week &mdash; would he arrange at an early date to meet them to appraise them fully that there is little if anything between what the Minister proposes and what they are seeking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been at pains to say just that in reply to questions here and in public statements and I have gone on the media to explain patiently everything that is involved.  A small minority of people do not seem to appreciate the situation.  I would like to use this occasion to ask the members of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, or anybody else in the Army, whether it is the officers in the Curragh, in the Navy or the Air Corp who have a view on these matters, to put themselves forward for election.  When the time for the election comes I will ensure that it is fully supervised, that, in every sense there will be a fair election by secret ballot, broken down in the most democratic manner, and that all these aspects will be fully taken into account. At this stage I do not want to start receiving diverse representations from various elements within the Defence Forces. Once the legislation is in place, I or the Chief of Staff will meet these people to discuss the details which will inevitably arise.  That meeting should be between the elected representatives of the personnel of the Defence Forces and the appropriate authorities.  When you think it through you will see that is the way it should be because at that stage the representatives will have been elected by their fellow members &mdash; I take it that the people in a democratic parliament know what I am talking about.  This gives them a mandate and a democratic legitimacy and entitlement to speak on behalf of the <Col N="2102" /> members.  That provision does not exist at the moment.  I do not know with whom I am dealing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read that constitution and I agree with 95 per cent of it.  I will go even further and say that, in their proposed objectives, they do not mention a system of conciliation and arbitration which, in my view, is most important. I am ahead of them in proposing that they include a system of conciliation and arbitration similar to that covering the public service and the Garda Síochána. That is the most important suggestion I have made.</P>
      <P>An analysis of the general outline &mdash; I know the details will be hammered out in the manner I have discussed &mdash; will show that the proposals I am advancing are more radical and progressive and will give members of the Defence Forces a real say, for the first time since the formation of the State, in how they can put forward their point of view to their representatives on the matters I have mentioned.</P>

      <Quest>the investigations which have been held into the circumstances of an attack on Irish troops serving with UNIFIL on 21 February 1990; if he is satisfied that Irish troops have adequate resources and equipment to enable them to carry out their duties safely; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Apart from my brief statement on this matter in the Dáil on 21 February 1990, the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to a number of questions &mdash; Nos. 85, 86 and 87 on 27 February 1990 &mdash; regarding the attack.  As indicated in that reply, a patrol from the Irish Battalion serving with UNIFIL was fired on near Haddathah village by members of the local Amal militia.  There had earlier been an exchange of fire in the area between <i>de facto forces</i> and armed elements and the patrol had entered the village to assess the consequent damage and civilian casualties.  The patrol was obliged to return fire because of the grave threat to life as their assailants continued to fire. Unfortunately three Irish soldiers suffered gunshot wounds and two of their assailants were fatally injured.  The incident continues to be investigated by UNIFIL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Steps were taken immediately at several levels to try to defuse the situation. The soldiers' commanding officer made contact locally with Amal, who promised full support in restoring the situation to normal.  UNIFIL officials also met with Amal leaders, including the commander <Col N="2105" /> of the two men who were killed.  Amal, expressing regret for the incident, stated that it was not planned or authorised, and that their policy towards UNIFIL was unchanged.  Relations between Amal and UNIFIL have been good traditionally and it is clear that there is a strong desire on all sides to maintain these good relations particularly between Amal and the Irish Battalion.  Contact with the family of the two men who died, who were brothers, has been established with a view to further reducing tension in the area.</P>
    <P>The matter was raised through diplomatic channels and the importance of ensuring the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel was emphasised.  The Government's deep concern at the incident was also expressed to the UN in New York.  The three soldiers who were injured in the attack are in the Swedish Medical Hospital in Naquora and are making satisfactory progress.</P>
    <P>The safety of the Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL is a constant preoccupation. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection.  They are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures are geared to provide maximum safety consistent with the carrying out of their mission.  In addition, physical security in the form of equipment and engineer works at posts and checkpoints is steadily being improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in wishing the three Irish soldiers well and I would express my regret to the families of those who died in this incident. Seeing that this location has been the scene of previous attacks and this week there was a further attack of the sentry posts of the Irish peacekeeping forces, have any measures been taken to strengthen security there and to equip the Defence Forces with better resources with which to deal with what seems to be developing as a flash point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's anxiety about that area and the need for further protective security measures to be adopted.  That is the concern of UNIFIL on the ground at present.  Matters in line with what the Deputy is suggesting are being considered closely with a view to improving the arrangements in what has proven to be an increasingly difficult area.  With regard to the two Moslem groups in the area, one backed by the Syrians and one backed by the Iranians, plus the pro-Israeli forces who are also operating in the area this has proved to be very difficult terrain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amal have generally been constructive in their approach to UNIFIL and to the Irish troops, and relations are good.  Since the fatalities occurred the Amal command in the area have come voluntarily to the Irish command and have met the families, and there is a general understanding that it was entirely out of character that that conflict should have taken place because generally Amal in that area tend to support UNIFIL operations in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Israeli Government are not involved in this incident.  This relates to Amal, the pro-Syrian Moslem organisation in the area.  There are three organisations in the area, two Moslem ones backed by the Iranians and the Syrians and the <i>de facto</i> forces supported by the Israeli Government.  The pro-Israeli forces were engaged in an exhange of fire with the Moslem forces on the evening before this incident.  After the firing had stopped the Irish contingent went out to see if they could help with civilian casualties, if any, and then this incident <Col N="2107" /> occurred between them and the Amal personnel due to a misunderstanding on the ground by the Amal personnel.  Normally relations are good between UNIFIL and Amal.  The Israeli forces are not involved in this at all, I thought I made that clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Defence Force Regulations are divided into six main categories containing in all 50 separate regulations.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the regulations are reviewed on a continuous basis and updated by: the making of amendments thereto; incorporating the amendments in the main regulations and having them reprinted; and rewriting a new version of existing regulations.</P>
      <P>During the past five years, for example, 258 amendments to regulations have been made and at present three regulations are in course of preparation for reprinting, incorporating all existing amendments thereto.  New versions of a further five regulations are in course of preparation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the regulations which cover virtually every aspect of life in the Defence Forces is a daunting document of such complexity that it would take an expert to understand them?  Will the Minister indicate whether there is a possibility that they can be made more easily understood? I thank the Minister for outlining that there are six main sections with 50 regulations, but there are myriads of amendments, additions and substractions to the regulations that make them unintelligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be visiting Army Headquarters tomorrow with other members of The Workers' Party, so with trepidation I would ask the Minister to agree that one of the problems in this area is that a large Civil Service has written itself into existence with the continued existence of this complex set of regulations and that that must be looked <Col N="2109" /> at in addition to simply reorganisation of the regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had forgotten about the visit of The Workers' Party Deputies to military headquarters.  They are very welcome. Will Deputy McCartan raise that issue with the authorities there?  It is part of the military mind to encumber the command structure with regulations to cover every opening.  It can get to the stage where things need to be trimmed. There is a research job involved there for someone with legal experience who can take the regulations apart and reorganise them.  Additions have been made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis up to now without condification. What is required is a proper codification of the regulations.  Perhaps the Deputy will mention that to the military authorities tomorrow and I will be coming at it from the other end.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service have seven patrol vessels, two of which <i>LE Orla</i> and <i>LECiara</i> were acquired in late 1988 and went into operational service in January 1989. Naval Service vessels are taken out of service from time to time to allow for crew leave, scheduled maintenance and other contingencies.</P>
      <P>During the year 1988, Naval Service vessels steamed a total of 100,611 nautical miles and spent 933 days of patrol. The corresponding figures for 1989 are 108,345 nautical miles and 1,034 days respectively.  In other words, patrolling increased by about 11 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is intended that more than 100 recruits will be enlisted in the Naval Service in 1990.  Forty recruits have already taken up duty, and it is expected that a further 60 will be enlisted by end March 1990.</P>

      <P>No, these new recruits should meet our requirements.  I want to emphasise that we are adopting a new system of recruitment to the forces generally whereby new personnel will be recruited every year so that we do not have to deal with a delay in recruitment. We will decide on a figure each year, announce it in December and take on the recruits month by month during the following year.  This will be a continuing process.</P>
      <P>These 100 recruits will meet our immediate requirements.  There is also the additional factor that because of the advancements in technology the equipment being installed in the boats enable them to be crewed with fewer personnel. I am satisfied that these 100 recruits will meet our immediate requirements. However next year's requirements will have to be met by recruiting more personnel, starting next December.  This will be the practice every December to cater for the years ahead.</P>

A further ten Naval Service personnel approximately are assigned each year to apprenticeship schemes with FAS.  In addition advertisements are placed from time to time in the national press for the recruitment of direct entry technicians.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The proposed sailing of <i>LE Aisling</i> to Haifa with supplies for the Irish UN contingent was postponed until later this year because <i>LE Aisling</i> was required for fishery protection duties.</P>
      <P>A decision has not yet been taken in relation to the means by which any stores which might have been brought home by <i>LE Aisling</i> will now be transported.</P>

      <P>Was that not a very embarrassing situation for the Navy? Could it not have been foreseen that the vessel would have been required for fishery protection duty?  Will the Minister give me an assurance that the cancellation was not because of lack of personnel to man the vessel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was anything but.  It was a very practical decision made by me on the basis that the fishery protection duties are very important and it is on the basis of the fishery protection duties that we get the necessary funding from the Community for both our Navy and our Air Corps engaged in marine surveillance. I want to emphasise that point. That was paramount in my mind when I made the decision.  What was to be transported out to Lebannon from here has been transported.  We are now discussing and have almost reached finality on how various cargoes can be brought back.  What I have to do as Minister is weigh the balance.  The paramount consideration was fishery protection and on this depends the funding of the Navy which is now being considered in Brussels and which will amount to 50 per cent funding.  I was getting my priorities right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone made the original decision and obviously was not getting their priorities right.  Would the Minister accept that that was a major cock-up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because I can understand a particular service in the Department of Defence making a decision in their own way.  I have a different responsibility.  I have to take the overall responsibility and I am responsible to the Government on a collective responsibility basis.  When I ascertained that the Navy were going ahead with this tour of duty I decided that a far more sensible approach would be to leave this until later because shortly the Community will be deciding on the exact amount of funding for Ireland and it is very important that our case stand up, and our case stands up on the basis of the fishery protection we are affording.  These are the facts.  This matter is now pending.  It is under current examination by the Commission with a view to formulating the precise amount of money we are to receive.  The allocation will depend on our facing up to responsibilities in regard to fishery protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> That is the only interest the Community has in this matter and funding does not arise unless that matter is given priority by our Navy and by our Air Force.  Do I make myself clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste makes himself clear to some extent.  We are told the Navy personnel had in fact changed their punts to dollars, that the ship was loaded and ready to slip anchor.  How could things have been allowed go that far before a decision was taken?  Am I correct in believing that there exists a Defence Forces handbook of priorities that puts peacekeeping exercises ahead of fishery protection exercises?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was just a servicing matter, not a peace-keeping operation in the total sense of the UNIFIL operation. It was a servicing operation that could be conducted other than by an Irish Navy ship.  It was really a matter of postponement. I do agree that there has been an annual visit and that will take place later in the year.  As of now this matter is being considered by the Commission of the European Communities and the attention we are giving to fishery protection at present will rate very high in their consideration of our claim to financial aid and funding, and I think I got my priorities on this.</P>

It is quite obvious that our Naval Service arrived at their present strength largely because of 50 per cent funding over a number of years from <Col N="2120" /> the European Community; in fact some years ago it was 75 per cent.  I am dealing with realities and I hope everybody appreciates that.  I must take a much broader view of this matter than would be taken by the very good people who are in charge of the Naval Service.  They have a particular duty to their service and a responsibility to it but I have to take a broader governmental view of the whole matter.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive pre-retirement course is conducted each year in the Eastern Command and each alternate year in the other Commands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question deals with both pre-retirement and resettlement and specifically with the problem of long-serving men who live in barracks &mdash; I am not too sure if it applies to women &mdash; and are in need of something more than another year on and off.  I understand from the Minister's reply that the Eastern Command benefit from a course once a year but the other Commands once every other year.  I urge the Minister to look at this whole area as it is an issue of concern that there are not adequate conditions there for the Defence Forces particularly those long serving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked to have a look at it.  To put the matter into perspective and put in some supplementary information, just 10 per cent of other ranks personnel are over 40 years of age. That puts it into perspective as to the need for these courses.  I will query from them as to whether it is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the proposition that, whatever the percentages and I do not think that helps the issue one way or another, even if one member of the Defence Forces at any one time needs aid, assistance and counselling with <Col N="2126" /> regard to having spent long years serving, he &mdash; or she &mdash; should have the fullest of service in recognition of the duties tendered to the State over that long number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is flexible.  The courses are on the basis I have talked about, every alternate year and every year in the Eastern Command, but professional advisers are availed of when required at any time.  A professional adviser can be made available on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  I will inquire into it to see whether it is flexible enough to meet the situation mentioned by the Deputy.  Two years does not appear to be a long time but if somebody is held back for two years that seems a long time.  I am told that in that case if it appears to be an urgent matter, professional advice can be made available outside the normal.  I will inquire into it and I will write to the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Army maintain a dual command system; his views on whether it would be more appropriate for a neutral and non-combative nation to rely on one structure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding command of the Defence Forces is that the Minister for Defence is authorised by the Government, under the direction of the President, to exercise military command over the Defence Forces and all executive and administrative powers in relation to these forces, including the power to delegate command and authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Military command is delegated by the <Col N="2127" /> Minister to the four Command General Officers Commanding within the areas of their Commands and to three Corps Commanders &mdash; Air Corps, Naval Service and Observer Corps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the issue being addressed here is whether there is a dual structure of command, one for peacetime operations and one for combative wartime operations.  Is it not correct that the Defence Forces maintain those two structures on an ongoing basis and that in part contributes to what seems to be an extraordinarily large number of civil personnel employed in the administration of these structures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  As it is now structured I have had no difficulties since I became Minister in meeting the heads of either the civilian or the military sides.  It works rather well provided the Minister keeps in touch with each of them.  I accept that it is unique.  It is different from other Departments in that respect but I think it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put another proposition.  Given that we have such a small geographic spread of our Defence Forces and we do not have a particularly large number of personnel, have the Department and the Minister considered at any stage the need to rationalise the command structures so as to give a more efficient, more streamlined service and return on the investment put into it by the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter point is being looked at very closely at the moment.  I have had discussions with the military command on this aspect with a view to making the military generally more mobile, more mechanised and less barracks oriented, to encapsulate it in a few words.  This year we have an extra allocation in respect of revamping the whole transportation system.  I see more efficient transportation on land and in the air as being very important, with a capacity to move quickly from location <Col N="2128" /> to location, general mobility rather than a rigid or static command structure based on barracks.  We want to get away from that and I have asked them to examine the whole structure, particularly in the Army, of command with a view to moving in this direction.  To that extent I go along with the Deputy.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence,</askee>
      <Quest>having regard to the fact that it has taken seven years for the Dauphin helicopter to fly at night and in storm conditions to its present capabilities, whether a medium range helicopter would be fully utilised by the Air Corps.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The five Dauphin helicopters held by the Air Corps were delivered in the period June to December 1986 and not seven years ago as stated in the Deputy's question.  Introductory training was provided in France prior to delivery and operational training programmes commenced in January 1987.  It should be recognised that in order to reach a satisfactory level of operational efficiency, the crews of Dauphin helicopters must undergo an extensive period of sophisticated training.</P>
      <P>Since the Deuphins were acquired they have flown 247 search and rescue missions as a result of which 182 people were rescued.  They have also carried out 94 air ambulance missions including 20 island relief missions.</P>
      <P>The question of the adequacy of this country's helicopter resources for air-sea rescue purposes is likely to be considered by the Government in the near future in the light of the report of the committee on air/sea rescue services which was recently presented to the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this report which has been with the Minister and the Government for the last three weeks <Col N="2129" /> recommend the introduction of a long range helicopter into the Air Corps?  Can the Minister let the House know that at this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to facilitate the Deputy with an answer but the report has not been considered by the Government as a whole.  It is with the Minister for the Marine.  He was the commissioning Minister, as it were.  It has not been considered on a collective basis by the Government, so I do not want to pre-empt whatever decision will be reached by the Government.  However, I assure the Deputy it is under current consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are reports that only one or two Dauphin helicopters can operate at any given time because of lack of manpower to service and maintain the helicopters and that while we may have five, two is the maximum that can be in operation at any given time.  Is that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite true. There are certain air-sea rescue operations for which, by reason of the turbulence of the weather on the south, south-west and west coasts, the Dauphins are not suitable.  However, there are exceptional cases which tend to get the headlines.  That is why we get a rather distorted perception.  In the great weight of missions the Dauphins are very successful &mdash; I am talking about a 96 to 97 per cent success rate.  The 2 per cent or 3 per cent of cases, the serious ones, that command the headlines are ones for which these machines are not strong enough.  That is why the <i>Sea King</i> was commissioned from Britain to deal with the incident off Castletownbere.  That is all I can say to the Deputy, but the matter has been examined in detail.  The report of that commission is with the Minister at the moment and will be with the Government very shortly and we should be hearing more about it.</P>

      <P>The lease of a Puma helicopter, which had been operated by the Air Corps from June 1981, was terminated on 28 February 1983.  This aircraft was due a major inspection at the time, which would have rendered it unserviceable for a considerable period, and it was not considered that the expenditure involved in the continued lease of the aircraft would have been warranted.</P>

It is a very obvious problem in facing up to the storms which occur off our southwestern coast.

Given what is involved, it is vitally important that money be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>

We can have a full <Col N="2132" /> debate in the Dáil on this matter when the Government decision is reached.  It will be a very important aspect of the recommendations.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects to it.  How real is the establishment figure? The establishment figure for all ranks has been there for a considerable time and it may be a bit unrealistic in terms of a mobilised, mechanised approach to military organisation, particularly in the Army.  The notion of chasing an establishment figure fixed ten years ago, if we are to change the whole approach to the Army structure, is a bit unreal.  This is the main consideration and I have asked the Army authorities to come up with a realistic figure to aim at, rather than what is rapidly becoming a mythical establishment figure which will never really be reached.</P>

There is a drill in place whereby a unit in Dundalk can go into immediate operation and get further back-up from Dublin if necessary.  The Deputy will be there tomorrow with the other Deputies from The Workers' Party.  This is a matter I should like them to talk about.  We are rather proud of the fact that a very good unit has been established who have had one or two successes in recent months.

      <P>The element of hazard from electromagnetic radiation and electromagnetic interference for the safe operation and custody of ordnance employed by the Permanent Defence Forces of the State is minor and not such as to occasion concern.  In cases where the Defence Forces themselves operate high powered radiation generators, as in <Col N="2137" /> the use of radar and communications equipments, standing operational procedures come into play to ensure that neither personnel nor sensitive or vulnerable equipments are affected.  When equipments are being purchased for the Defence Forces, the specifications take into account the conditions, including electromagnetic radiation from military and non-military sources, in which they are intended for use.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his detailed interest in this area and I have read the correspondence he has had with the Department.  The Defence Forces are monitoring the problem and they do not see the need for drastic measures at present.  It must be monitored in case it gets out of hand because there are very serious implications.  It is also worrying other authorities throughout the world and we are keeping in touch with the United States in particular where they are familiar with the problems of hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance.  The background papers which the Deputy furnished to my Department are very helpful.  I have acquainted my colleague, the Minister for Energy, with the problem and it is primarily his responsibility in regard to non-military scources and the population at large.  As I said, it merits very close examination which it is getting at the moment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  I do not seek to be alarmist about this; like the Minister I do not consider it to be a major problem but it <Col N="2138" /> is a factor which should be borne in mind. Will the Minister indicate whether it is a factor borne in mind in urban located barracks where, I presume, there is the possibility of ordnance being stored near civilian accommodation?</P>

      <P>There is disagreement with the CIF, but it only applies to the Dublin area of which my Department are a part.  Whether we should make it an issue outside that area, unrelated to other workers and employees, is another day's work.  This matter concerns the whole delicate matter of negotiations with trade unions and so on.  I will have a look at it but my guess is that it would have to be done on a multilateral basis in regard to all employees.  It works in the Dublin area where the CIF speak for all employers, the employees co-operate within the trade union structure and we go along with the CIF.  If that is not in place outside the Dublin area it would be difficult for my Department to make a unliateral move in that direction. However, I will inquire about the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget, more than any other item of legislation, deals with the basic underlying philosophy or ideology of the Government because it prioritises all other policy measures in so far as it dictates the amount of money and resources available to Government Departments.  It is in this context rather than in the context of individual proposals that I propose to address the budget today.  However, before I do that I could not let the opportunity pass without referring to some of the issues raised by the previous speaker and the unfair criticisms of the 1982-87 Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>It would be well to remember that Government's long, credible and laudible list of achievements and I intend to list a few for the record of the House.  Low inflation is a cornerstone of economic health and it was that Government which brought inflation down from 21 per cent to 3 per cent.  The trade balance had reached a record deficit of £1.8 billion in 1981 following the four years of Fianna Fáil Government but was brought into a surplus of £315 million by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in 1985.  It was the first trade surplus in 40 years and we have had a trade surplus every year since.  The balance of payments went into surplus in 1986 for the first time in decades and has been in surplus ever since.  The Fine Gael-Labour Government brought the top rate of income tax down to 58 per cent and it was also that Government who brought the top rate of VAT down from 35 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering that from mid-1981 to the end of 1986 that Government reduced the Exchequer borrowing requirment from 20 per cent of GNP to 12.8 per cent.  It is that figure rather than the spurious figures that are trotted out without context by members of the Government today that are worth bearing in mind.  It was that Fine Gael-Labour Government which brought the designated areas into being and introduced the business expansion scheme about <Col N="2153" /> which the previous speaker spoke very favourably.  There are four major State schemes in operation to encourage employment &mdash; the social employment scheme, the employment incentive scheme, the enterprise allowance scheme and the Teamwork scheme &mdash; and not one of those four schemes was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  All those schemes are credible and laudable achievements of the last Government.</P>
    <P>To appreciate and objectively assess the merits and demerits of the 1990 budget, one has to take into account the context in which the Minister began to put together that budget.  The backdrop was ten years of increasing taxation and ten years of reduction of State expenditure in services, and I do not have to list the effects that has had on our health system, our educational system and the ability of our local authorities to carry out their statutory duties.  There was also the immediate context of rising interest rates, 50,000 people having emigrated in the previous year, 230,000 people unemployed and one-third of our population living in poverty.  After a decade of retrenchment, of cutbacks in public spending and services, much of it badly planned and poorly executed, economic recovery had arrived.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, unlike any of his predecessors, had a golden opportunity to alleviate much of the suffering and hardship which had to be endured in order to put him in that position.</P>
    <P>As we entered the last decade of the 20th century the over-riding problems facing our economy and staring the Minister in the face as he sat down to draft this budget were poverty, with one million people or 31 per cent of our population affected &mdash; 41 per cent of the children of this country are living in poverty &mdash; and unemployment, with 230,000 people unemployed.  These were scarcely recognised in the Minister's preamble or in his proposals for the 1990 budget.  The opportunity to repay those people, on whose backs this economic recovery had been brought about and to whom we owed a debt of gratitude for the suffering <Col N="2154" /> they endured in the eighties to bring about this recovery was lost.  It must never be forgotten that this recovery was built on the backs of those least able to afford it.</P>
    <P>In a just society this deserved recognition in the 1990 budget but unfortunately this was not forthcoming.  Social welfare increases, which by the end of 1990 will have been consumed by inflation, serve only to maintain those sections of welfare recipients in continuing poverty.  Of course some progress was made in improving the lot of single long-term unemployed people, people with incomes of £60 a week or less and low income families.  I welcome the provisions in the budget to introduce a carer's allowance, new resources for women's projects, increases in school capitation grants, adult literacy programmes and so on.  However, these improvements across a wide and diverse programme of needs, highlights the absence of a clear and coherent policy to eliminate poverty in Irish society.</P>
    <P>With unemployment at 230,000, despite the huge numbers who have been forced to emigrate in recent years, this, along with poverty, should have been the focus of a two-prong attack by the Minister but unfortunately this was not the case.  The Minister and the Government, consumed by political matters, gauged the pulse of the public correctly prior to the publication of the budget With presidential and local electons in the offing, the Minister squandered like confetti the scope which he had to tackle the twin problems of poverty and unemployment. Politically it is very difficult to be critical of a budget whose basic achievement was £5 here, £5 there and £5 everywhere.  No wonder the general public sighed with relief afterwards. There are shades of the late seventies and the activities of Fianna Fáil in that period inherent in this budget.  A real opportunity was lost.</P>
    <P>This Government lack the political will to tackle in a serious way poverty and unemployment.  They pander to public relations to espouse concern for their <Col N="2155" /> position when the reality is much different. One could be forgiven for believing that unemployment and poverty were by and large urban phenomena.  I want to dispel that myth and concentrate much of my remaining time dealing with this problem as it affects rural Ireland.  Poverty and unemployment permeate every corner, every town, every parish and townland in rural Ireland.  There are not the same glaring symptoms or concentrations of poverty as in large urban areas and much of it is hidden by family pride and embarrassment.  Rural poverty has two clearly identifiable strands: rural unemployment which is devastating because of remoteness of those affected from possible employment opportunities elsewhere; and poverty due to inadequate income from agriculture.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis is placed in the run up to 1992 on regional development and infrastructural investment to facilitate this.  This is very laudable and the eight such regions in this country spent considerable time and effort drawing up plans for local development in consultation with local knowledge and know how.  What an elaborate fraud.  The final draft submitted by the Government to Brussels bore little testimony to the plans and programmes drawn up by the subregions. Structural Funds, marketed as the last opportunity for rural revitalisation, a do or die effort, has failed miserably.  Perhaps the Minister, if he disagrees, could justify why not one mile of strategic routes, identified in the national roads plan for investment from Regional Funds, is to be found in Connacht, Munster or Ulster but runs in a line from Dundalk to Rosslare and ventures out of the pale in two directions as far as Kinnegad and Portlaoise.  This is only the tip of the iceberg.  I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to give regional authorities direct access to the Commission for funding.  Put local authorities on a sure financial footing and these regions will serve as vibrant development agencies, the likes of which are necessary if we are to survive and prosper in rural Ireland in the post-1992 <Col N="2156" /> era.  This is a fundamental prerequisite to tackling the problems of rural unemployment and poverty.</P>
    <P>In some uninformed quarters farming and poverty are deemed to be mutually exclusive but the reality is much different. Approximately 7,000 farmers are forced to leave the land every year due to inability to eke out a living.  Large tracts of agricultural lands are being planted by State and private forestry as a result.  This, in the absence of positive policies to combat it, has tremendous consequences for rural Ireland and has the destructive potential to change the whole social fabric of Irish rural society in a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>Poverty and unemployment in stagnant rural communities, drained of their life blood by emigration, lead to depopulation and a gravitus towards urban life where services and companionship are assumed to be near at hand.  Without elaborating on this, the consequences for the countryside are horrendous.  Schools, post offices, Garda stations, are all undermined, not to mention private commercial concerns such as public houses, shops and so on.</P>
    <P>The debate on the extension of the disadvantaged areas has generated much comment in the House.  To date it is the only effective mechanism at our disposal to counteract the problems I have outlined. I should like to avail of this opportunity to again call on the Government, in particular on the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to immediately grant a maximum extension to safeguard in some small way the future viability of 30,000 family farms currently under threat.  I firmly believe that that in itself will not ensure viability in the long-term of those holdings.  By its nature the disadvantaged areas scheme tends to favour those who have already developed to such an extent that ensures their survival.  Some form of direct income aid to those beleaguered farmers is necessary if they are to survive. The emergence in recent times of a family farm organisation for that marginalised group in Irish agriculture is proof positive <Col N="2157" /> of the problems I have highlighted and which need to be addressed by them.</P>
    <P>The milk quota system, like no other structure, has decided who will stand and who will fall by the wayside in Irish agriculture. Talk is cheap but a major diplomatic and political initiative is necessary at EC level to shake the shackles off Irish agriculture in this context and to give scope to many countless young farmers, in whom we have invested millions of pounds of State money in agricultural training and education, to make a decent living.  It is interesting to recall that when milk quotas were introduced the attitude adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party who were in Opposition was that they were unnecessary.  We were told that if Fianna Fáil were in Government the quotas would not have been introduced.  That glib remark was typical of Fianna Fáil opposition between 1982 and 1987 but we could well do with them using our EC Presidency to make some progress in that area to ensure long-term viability for rural Ireland and the many educated young farmers who are inheriting holdings that do not have the potential to provide them with a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>Rising interest rates are the biggest single factor affecting our ability to generate employment and eliminate poverty. The very fact that our Minister for Finance on budget day was unaware of the implications of German unity for our interest rates displays incompetence beyond credulity, especially as the dogs in the street knew of the implications for Irish interest rates of such a move.  In fact, interest rates have risen by 5 per cent over the last 12 months and the budget offered no relief for besieged mortgage holders.  In view of the alarming increase in the number of repossessions by local authorities, banks and building societies, and the implications of that for local authority housing waiting lists which are already endless, I should like to appeal to the Minister to consider restoring full mortgage interest relief when he is drafting the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>To alleviate the impact of interest rate increases on farmers and industry it is <Col N="2158" /> necessary to provide low interest loans for specific projects with the exchange rate risk being guaranteed by the Government. That is not a revolutionary idea because it was used in the period between 1982 and 1987.  In agriculture all farm grant costings are four to five years out of date and need to be revised.  Prompt payment by the Department is also essential. Some farmers are suffering severe hardship by reason of those twin disadvantages in the grant schemes.  It appears that there is a deliberate policy by the Department to delay grant payments.</P>
    <P>Criticism of a budget is easy if one does not have to find the additional finance for one's alternative proposals but I do not intend to deal with that today.  Our tax base is excessively narrow with an over-reliance on personal taxation.  In my view we are reaping our just rewards in terms of unemployment and emigration because of our over-reliance on personal taxation.  We need to widen our tax base. In 1987, taxes on corporate income in Ireland was equivalent to 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product, and 3.2 per cent of total tax revenue.  That put us at the bottom of the OECD league based on the information available.</P>
    <P>The huge amounts of money paid out by the State in planning compensation is a scandal.  The Government must ensure that every pound of taxpayers' money is accounted for and maximum benefit derived from it.  That has not always been the case.  Overall a significant opportunity was lost in the budget to produce a more just and equitable tax system.  I have no doubt that people will look back on the 1990 budget as an occasion when the Minister for Finance was presented with a golden opportunity to redress inequalities and injustices in our society. The opportunity was lost as the Minister pandered to political popularity.  In planning the budget the Government listened to the articulate, well-off and influential lobby.  What about the provision in our Constitution which states that we are obliged to cherish all children of the nation equally?  We must never be intimidated in our pursuit of justice for the <Col N="2159" /> downtrodden.  The Minister and the Government were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>In his first budget the Minister faced two difficult tasks.  The first was the need to promote continued recovery of the economy and the second was the requirement to cater for the needs of the disadvantaged in our community. I am pleased to say that on both counts the Minister has been successful. Central to the achievements of the last three years has been the consensus between the Government and the social partners on the main economic and social policy objectives.  I am heartened that that consensus which underpins the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is reflected in this year's financial statement. Advances in the area of employment, debt reduction, tax reform and social equity can only take place when their interdependence is recognised.  The Government are to be applauded for adhering to the strategy of progress on parallel fronts.</P>
      <P>I have come to the House from a business background and resulting from that is my concern that an environment in which commerce may thrive should continue to develop.  On the face of it there are substantial grounds for confidence as we enter the nineties.  The country has embarked on the fourth successive year of economic expansion.  The runaway national debt has been captured following the Government's valiant efforts. Inflation is low and there are indications that the improved economic conditions are having a positive effect on the stubborn problem of unemployment.  Despite recent difficulties the differential with UK interest rates has improved by 6 per cent on 1986 and by 5 per cent with West German rates for the same year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Export growth remains buoyant and we have built up a £2.5 billion trade surplus with the rest of the EC.  The economy's industrial production has been impressive.  There has been a 10 per cent, or more, growth in volume over the last three years.  The same period has witnessed a renewed flow of investment; <Col N="2160" /> strong demand, especially at home, and the gearing up of EC Structural Funds spending during 1990 will provide a vitally important boost to the forecast expansion in capital spending this year. The budget announcement that accelerated capital allowances are to be eliminated from April 1992 onwards should cause planned investment to be brought forward.  Nevertheless, difficult tasks remain to be completed.</P>
    <P>Personal taxation is a key issue to be addressed if national recovery is to be sustained.  The legitimate grievances of the heavily burdened and the flight of skilled people from our shores to more favourable tax regimes demand action. The Minister deserves our praise for his positive, yet prudent, approach to tax reform.  We now have a situation whereby virtually two thirds of taxpayers pay at the standard rate of tax.  Between 1989 and 1990 this standard rate has been reduced from 35 per cent to 30 per cent. In addition, the higher rate has fallen from 58 per cent to 53 per cent.  The latter move is particularly welcome as many skilled single people are taxed at the higher rate.  Now that that trend has been firmly established I look forward to the achievement of two rates of taxation. Equity requires that the self employed contribute fairly to the tax yield.  Self assessment, the withholding tax on professional fees and the new powers given to the Revenue Commissioners to combat fraud or non-compliance have facilitated the collection of tax.  For the year 1988, excluding the impact of the tax amnesty, the average income tax paid by the self employed, businesses and professional taxpayers was 55 per cent higher than in 1986.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of the Minister for Finance to introduce tax assessment on a current year basis for the self employed in this year's Finance Bill.  The changes to the corporation tax regime are both timely and astute.  Amendments made are such that while revenue will increase, the rate of tax can be reduced from 43 per cent to 40 per cent this year. The significance of this move for the service sector should be clear to all.  The <Col N="2161" /> Government's decision to adjust the regime to aid the creation of new jobs is a fine example of justifiable intervention to promote economic growth.</P>
    <P>The levels of excise duties and VAT rates have long been a source of disquiet. The cutting of the standard rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent will have a positive inflationary effect and will promote job creation.  This move will, of course, benefit the poorest in the community with the fall in the price of necessities.  In addition, the Minister is to be commended on his efforts to curb the loss of business in Border areas.</P>
    <P>As someone involved in the motor industry, I enthusiastically support the changes in indirect taxation.  The industry has shown signs of an upturn in recent times.  This latest development can boost growth still further.  While there is much in the budget provisions about which to be encouraged, there is need for some words of warning.  The economies with which we have much of our trade, namely, the UK and the US, have experienced a slow down in recent months. The UK can legitimately be said to be bordering on the brink of recession. Consequently, we need to look to domestic demand expansion as a growth source.  Static demand levels abroad, combined with high levels at home, could put our balance of payments surplus in peril.  In addition, weak exchange rates for high domestic demand could well exert upward pressure on pay.</P>
    <P>We must avoid a trend whereby wage settlements are above the levels recommended in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Past experience shows the danger of pay settlement expectations becoming unreasonably inflated once economic conditions improve.  Control of inflation has been one of the Government's top priorities and principal achievements.  Care must be taken lest rising demand pressures release the inflationary beast from its cage.</P>
    <P>Our national debt remains a great obstacle to full recovery.  The economy's rapid growth in recent years has reduced the length of the shadow it casts over us all but we should never forget its capacity to hinder our progress if the economy falters.  However, these observations are <Col N="2162" /> made against a background of outstanding achievement by this Government. Now is the time for resolution and commitment to a winning strategy.  We have come too far to throw away our success.</P>
    <P>At a time of major fiscal adjustment the situation of those who lack the strength to articulate their needs demands attention; it is a crucial test of any administration that these people should feature prominently on the Government's list of priorities.  In years to come when Fianna Fáil's term in office from 1987 onwards is examined I am confident that credit will be given for the efforts made to protect the underprivileged. It is evident that the allocations to Departments charged with providing services of value to the marginalised have enabled the State, not only to protect these people, but to make significant progress in raising the real value of transferred payments to them.</P>
    <P>While there are definite signs of economic revival the Government of a democratic civilised society are honour bound to ensure that the benefits of economic improvement are spread across our society.  Care for the weakest in society has long been a hallmark of Fianna Fáil Governments.  The lot of those on low pay has been improved with the further extension of the exemption scheme for low income families.  A married couple with five children and an income of £8,000 or less, will be completely exempt from tax.  This is but one of a package of measures to aid the low paid.  Further evidence of the Government's commitment to those on the fringes of economic life is seen in the 5 per cent general rise in social welfare benefits.  This is well in excess of the predicted rate of inflation of 3.35 per cent for the coming year.  The successive increases of about 11 per cent for each of the last three years and the transfers to the long term unemployed represent a genuine effort to assist the most vulnerable in our community.  The same is true of the extra payment to lone parents on long term assistance and to spouses in the home.  I am particularly pleased by the increase in the carers' allowance.</P>
    <P>This is an added recognition of the <Col N="2163" /> many dedicated people who tend to the needs of infirm relatives.  Any country claiming to have a Christian ethos should not neglect these people.  This budget has delivered to those in need.</P>
    <P>The operation of the various free schemes has given rise to adverse comment in recent times.  I am pleased that the Minister has taken steps to remove anomalies in schemes and to facilitate individuals in their efforts to avail of those schemes to which they are entitled. The take-up of the free travel concession by the elderly was low because a companion travelling with the elderly person to aid mobility had to pay the fare.  From now on companions may journey free with beneficiaries of the travel scheme. This reform is sensible and humane and I hope the frustrations of those who were unable to avail of their entitlements will be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>A further enlightened change relates to the decision to permit pensioners over the age of 80 to retain their free electricity entitlement when people come to live with them.  This is a fine example of the State recognising the reality of life for the most vulnerable in our community.  I also welcome the removal of the anomaly in the treatment of invalidity pensioners. The fact that persons with free scheme entitlements lost their entitlement when transferring to retirement pension at 65 was absurd.  The ending of this restriction comes not before time.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of the operation of the free fuel scheme reveals the Minister's practical approach.  Heretofore, a long-term welfare recipient was denied free fuel allowance where the recipient of short-term benefit lived with him.  As of mid-October 1990 the denial of the fuel allowance will be abolished in such cases and it is gratifying that the allowance will be extended to persons in receipt of smallholders unemployment assistance who live alone.  Such people are often battling against considerable economic odds and a small change in the annual budget can greatly enhance their circumstances.</P>
    <P>This debate on the economic wellbeing of the country gives me the opportunity to acknowledge the Government's action <Col N="2164" /> to alleviate the plight of fishermen in Kilmore Quay.  Members will be aware of the damage along the east coast caused by the recent severe weather.  The village of Kilmore was particularly badly affected and many fishing businesses crashed following the destruction of boats. Given that the replacement cost of a fishing boat is about £1 million, even those fishermen with insurance are facing daunting bills.  The magnitude of the problem is obvious when one considers that three boats were wrecked and 17 severely damaged, jeopardising the livelihood's of almost 100 people. Against this background representations were made to the Minister for Finance for whose assistance I am grateful.  The decision to allocate £100,000 to BIM to assist in the repair and replacement of boats is a wise move which will aid a return to economic vibrancy in the area which enjoyed virtually full employment. It also represents a compassionate response to the plight of citizens overtaken by natural disaster.</P>
    <P>The 1990 budget further consolidates our financial position.  It offers significant personal tax relief, keeps a downward pressure on inflation, moves towards tax harmonisation and creates economic growth and employment.  I compliment the Minister on his excellent budget.  May it be the first of many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I aim in my contribution to examine the contribution of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  There is a comprehensive examination of every aspect of Government policy expressed in a budget, and the Minister's contribution in a budget debate usually charts the policy of the Department for the coming year.  The speech of the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the budget devoted six lines to agriculture, and that was on the grants for agricultural students.  The contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, in the budget debate &mdash; who I take it was stating Government policy on agriculture &mdash; was pathetic and appalling given the present outlook for the nation's greatest industry. We heard from the Minister of State the usual banalities about how much the so called better economic climate suited <Col N="2165" /> agriculture and how it would make the industry grow.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged that in 1990 we are facing into somewhat weaker markets for some of our major farm products in a tight price cost environment and made a meal out of a marginal increase from 2 per cent to 2.3 per cent in the flat VAT rebate to unregistered farmers, but he forgot to tell us that that used to be 2.4 per cent until Mr. MacSharry rather vindictively reduced it to 1.3 per cent in 1987 to punish farmers for not paying their health and employment contributions; how could they when a proper assessment was never sent to them?  The Minister of State also spoke of the concession of indexing capital acquisition tax, to family transfers.  That is hardly a concession since a principle of justice in any taxation measure should be the indexation to the changing values of money.  Of course the Minister had nothing to say about the fact that the thresholds on transfers fixed several years ago were not changed from £120,000. The Minister scraped the bottom of the barrel quoting the most miserly pickings to put some kind of gloss on the farm scene.</P>
      <P>In the early part of 1989 we listened on many occasions to the tiresome blustering optimism of Mr. O'Kennedy.  As we passed the mid-year with all the indications bad except the weather, he decided to close his mouth.  Minister Walsh spoke of interest rates in his policy speech on the budget.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  The Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, spoke of interest rates in his policy speech on the budget on 6 February last, but did not mention that the increased interest rates in 1989 cost farmers £30 million more than in 1988.  The Minister said not a word about the fact that, with the exception of dairying, most enterprises fared no better in 1989 than in 1988 and that for cattle farmers 1989 was nothing short of disastrous, especially for summer grazers <Col N="2166" /> and everybody selling cattle in the autumn.  Overall margins in dry stock were back to 1984 levels even in nominal terms.  Sheep margins fell significantly as did those for winter wheat and spring barley.  But for the good returns in dairying due to an improvement in world trading conditions in 1989, the year would have been one of agriculture's worst in a generation.</P>
      <P>I remember Deputy O'Kennedy in ebulient mood in the Seanad last April telling me that 1989 would be one of the best years for Irish farming in a generation. Now the outlook for 1990 and beyond is pessimistic and depressing since virtually all price projections are negative.  The imminent fall in the milk price is unprecedented in scale, about 20 times greater than anything that has happened since World War II.  Consequently the biggest prop that agriculture has is about to take a hammering this year with margins likely to fall by 25 per cent or more with a fall greater than that for the 50 per cent of total dairy farmers whose milk quota is 20,000 gallons or less.  That is the state of the most important sector of the country's largest industry. The Minister for Finance did not say a word about this in his Budget Statement nor did the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, say a word about it when he gave what we must regard as the definitive policy statement in this House on the budget a month ago.</P>
      <P>The position is even more depressing when one considers the low returns for cattle and sheep with producers prices running from 10 to 20 per cent lower than last year's low levels.  Cereal farmers face another fall in prices and after a brief respite last autumn pig producers face a very uncertain future.  All in all we are facing a very serious crisis.  Income in all sectors will fall this year, in total by perhaps 10 per cent, with the small producers coming out worst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is particularly critical for cattle producers.  This sector is now arguably in a more depressed state than it was in 1974.  It is true to say that the industry is in a total shambles.  What happened to the promises which were made in 1987? After his return to power at the time the Taoiseach gave an expansive spoof about <Col N="2167" /> doubling the workforce in the food processing industry.  He said that the food processing industry would be the &ldquo;leading motor&rdquo; of economic recovery.  All that is forgotten now.  The processing jobs promised for Tuam and dozens of other places have all gone up in smoke and the histrionics and cant on the subject by the Taoiseach and his Ministers is finished.</P>
    <P>The position at farm level can be helped by headage payments.  I should like to remind the House that headage payments are the principal outreach from the Structural Funds to low income and marginal farmers.  In recent years the Minister accepted drastic reductions in intervention price guarantees.  I accept that when intervention is abused it can do a lot of harm to the real market but for all its faults it was a major source of transfer to small farmers and its removal or reduction affects the income of smaller farmers and producers most acutely.  We can see the effects of this all around us in recent months.  However, there has been plenty of warning that intervention as a market support was on the way out but there were plenty of promises in parallel that income supplements from the Structural Funds &mdash; headage payments are the best example &mdash; would fully compensate those whose incomes were adversely affected by the move to market determined prices.  The move to market determined prices has been at great speed &mdash; well helped by our Minister for Agriculture and Food &mdash; but the compensatory headage payments have not moved at all.</P>
    <P>The promises to double these payments, as was mentioned by Deputy Creed, extend the classified areas and develop the integrated rural development programme have so far not been kept. During a year when thousands of small or marginal enterprises are about to go to the wall the Estimates only include an extra £10 million this year to fund this Government's promises to double the headage payments, extend the eligible areas and include &mdash; this has officially been brought in, part-time farmers in the scheme.  The fact that there has been no meaningful move on the integrated rural development programmes means we are <Col N="2168" /> losing out on several million pounds which we could be drawing down from the Structural Funds this year.</P>
    <P>There is a range of other income supports which the Government could be drawing down to help small producers. So far as the Commission is concerned the way is clear to apply the environmentally sensitive areas scheme.  This would be a major boost to the 4,000 flood victims and farm families in the Shannon valley who have been most callously ignored by the Government.  There is also the extensification scheme &mdash; the opposite of intensification &mdash; by which a premium is paid to a small producer if he reduces his livestock by 20 per cent.  Has this scheme been applied for?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another very important point.  What is the Minister's attitude to the saving this year of four billion ECUs in the Community farm budget? Four billion ECUs amount to well over IR£3 billion.  Some years ago the Council of Ministers, with the enthusiastic support of our Minister, placed planned enforced restrictions on farm spending. These restrictions would have meant that the planned spending budget for 1990 could not go above 30 billion ECUs.  Now that the farm talks have resulted in an agreed budget of 26 billion ECUs for 1990, four billion ECUs have been saved which can be redirected and spent without infringing the regulations.  Is our Minister ensuring that this money is being directed towards market supports which would help our cattle or milk prices in 1990?  That is an important question.  Is the Minister seeking some of this money for our people who have been partially or fully ruined by storms and floods during recent weeks?  Is he seeking some of it for major structural reform, that is, a land policy which would direct more land to the farmers who wish to and can stay in farming if they could extend their holdings to economic limits?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not realise that larger more economic holdings must evolve to meet the challenges of GATT and other market changes?  Will the Minister fight for a share of this IR£3 billion to fund a plan for the beef and beef processing industry which is utterly in chaos and now more critical than ever? <Col N="2169" /> Will he seek support for an overall plan to give some sense of direction and support to all farm commodity markets since confidence and morale are so low?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt when the Minister is replying &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, is trying to do this now &mdash; he will try to represent my contribution as scaremongering.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a report published last Monday by Teagasc, the agricultural and food development authority set up by the Government.  Their findings on farm incomes in County Offaly is a case study typical of more than half the farms in Ireland.  I wish to quote from a summary to that report written by Mr. Michael Miley.  It says:</P>
      <P>Offaly has a total of 4,500 farmers, of which 3,000 are farming full-time. Only 18 per cent of full-time farmers are in milk production.  The bulk of the remainder rely on drystock for their main source of income.  Because of the very low number of beef cows in Offaly, these farmers were forced to rely on calves and store cattle from the dairying counties of the south.</P>
      <P>As the impact of milk began to bite, a greater proportion of these calves and stores were retained on dairy farms resulting in a scarcity and a dramatic increase in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall result has been an erosion of the income base of the majority of drystock farmers.  The main conclusions in the analysis are only 300 farmers &mdash; all with more than 30 dairy cows &mdash; have expanded their farming activities and income since 1983.  This group represents one-third of the country's dairy farmers of the remainder of dairy farmers, almost half have fewer than 15 cows and earned an average income of just £5,500 in 1989. They face major problems of viability and survival in the future; among drystock farmers, almost 1,000 have an apparently strong resource base with adequate acreage and livestock numbers.  However, the average income of this group in 1989 was just £8,000, reflecting the poor returns <Col N="2170" /> from cattle.  While a number of these farmers have substantially expanded sheep numbers, this has not been sufficient to counteract the erosion in cattle incomes.</P>
    <P>In summary, only about 700 farmers, or 25 per cent of those farming full-time, are in a position to meet the adjustments which the current changes in EC policy and other market forces will impose.  For the remainder, it is essential that support measures are introduced to help them restore their income base.</P>
    <P>That is the state of farming in Offaly, scientifically and objectively arrived at. The House will agree that it concurs with much of what I have just said about the industry nationally.  Let me repeat that this Offaly study is but a case study which is typical of half the country's farms and the response to this situation by the Government is six irrelevant lines by the Minister for Finance in the budget speech and the most appalling sidestepping and evading of responsibility in the budget speech by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, delivered in this House about a month ago.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by raising the plight of flood and storm victims and the awful, shabby manner in which the Government have dismissed and disregarded them.  I will speak solely of the plight of the unfortunate people in my own county of Roscommon who have been hit by the storms and the floods because they too are another case study and, like the farmers in Offaly who are typical of those people on low incomes nationally, the people and situations I will mention now are typical of the unfortunate people washed out all over the country.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency to associate the Shannon and its lakes with tranquility and leisure, but when the system becomes badly swollen with floods and storms it is far from tranquil; it becomes instead an overwhelming and very bad tempered neighbour.  The Shannon, incidentally, is our direct neighbour for 70 miles of boundary on the eastern side and its second largest tributary, the River Suck, is our direct neighbour for over 40 miles on the western side.  Because of the poor elevation of widespread areas of <Col N="2171" /> land close to both rivers and because of poor gradient in the main river channels, flooding is always a prospect.</P>
    <P>However, enough is known about normal flood behaviour that most people in vulnerable areas have arranged their lives and activities to avoid damage, major loss and major inconvenience. However, these arrangements went well out the window with the recent persistent downpowers and hurricanes to such an extent that there are now over 2,000 people, mostly farmers, suffering major loss, many of them absolute disaster, in the Shannon valley alone and most of them in County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>In County Roscommon, for instance, out of a total of 8,000 holdings, 2,300 are or were affected by anything ranging from medium loss and damage to absolute loss of everything.  In an area south of Athlone, on the west side, there are 200 farmers, 70 per cent of whose lands on average are or were completely under water, much of it over six feet deep. There are or were at least 40 homes cut off or marooned by water in that area and at least 20 homes have become uninhabitable as the water flowed through them.</P>
    <P>That is, or very recently was, the situation in one area, and I am talking about a relatively small area at that.  In other areas in the catchment there are dozens more, less concentrated admittedly, who are marooned and they too have fled their homes and their lands are just acres of lapping water anything from one foot to six feet deep.  This was brought home very graphically to me when one unfortunate woman wrote to me about the floods.  She addressed her letter, as all people do, with her home address but asked me not to reply to her at that address because she had had to leave home and would probably not be able to return for a month.  She is typical of at least 40 or 50 families in that area.</P>
    <P>The economic losses of these people are quite colossal.  Winter fodder stocks are lost or destroyed.  Hundreds of livestock have had to be evacuated and weight loss is most severe because of the lack of food and the lack of dry or sheltered layerage.  Miles and miles of <Col N="2172" /> farm fences have been swept away and will take countless thousands of pounds to reinstate.  Miles of private farm roadways have been destroyed too.  In my own county of Roscommon alone a conservative estimate of the farm losses is £5 million to £6 million.  Teagasc, using another conservative figure, state that there was 16,478 acres of land under water in County Roscommon two weeks ago from the spates and the burst banks of the Shannon and the Suck systems. Our colleagues here from Counties Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and East Galway will no doubt be able to give the acreages inundated in these other counties from those two systems alone.  If one adds those acres ruined and swamped to the 16,500 acres overwhelmed by water in County Roscommon, one must surely arrive at a figure close to 50,000 to 60,000 acres of land in total.  Somehow, and despite all that, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, claimed he travelled from Donegal to Cork and that he could see no floods or damage.  I do not wish to suggest that the Minister of State was misleading the House when he made that statement last week, but the most charitable thing I can say is that he must have developed a serious eyesight problem, because when I visited the flooded areas on our side of the Shannon valley I could not escape the impression that I was looking at the Atlantic Ocean.</P>

      <P>It remains a matter of sheer disbelief on my part that the Government have so callously ignored the ruin and destruction of the farms, homes and livelihood of so many unfortunate people.  In the summer floods of 1985 and 1986, not a fraction as bad as the recent floods were, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Austin Deasy, made available £13 million from the State Exchequer to stricken farmers to improve their fodder supply.  That was in 1985.  In 1986 the then Minister, Deputy Austin Deasy, negotiated an extra £14 million from the EC to double headage <Col N="2173" /> payments in the disadvantaged areas as a cushion against flood damage in that year which again was a mere puddle compared with what was experienced in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>What have we got from the current Minister as expressed across these benches last week?  I listened with absolute incredulity to the Minister, Deputy Wilson, talking about the £120,000 which the EC were going to pay us to cushion us against the damage we suffered recently.  Does the man know his arithmetic?  In 1985 the Exchequer here spent £12 million &mdash; or was it £13 million &mdash; and in 1986 we got an additional £13 million from the EC to which there was Exchequer additionality. There had to be, although the then Minister, Deputy Deasy, did a very good job in getting the EC to pay 70 per cent of it. The Minister and the Government came into this House a week ago and told us what their response to the problem was, that the problem should be resolved by giving £120,000.  That amount would not solve the problems of the three people I talked to in the Athlone region a fortnight ago.  That is an indication of how bad the problem is and of how extreme the response is from the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want this Cabinet committee &mdash; this Government are great for committees, study groups and what have you &mdash; to come back in, say, two months time to tell us &mdash; they will if they are let away with it and I know they are setting themselves up to get away with it, that the problem has gone away so there is no question of its having to be solved.  There is an ongoing income problem for those <Col N="2174" /> people who have been ruined and the Government have an absolute duty in justice to respond to it.  I am appealing to their reason and to the fact that Ministers are public representatives, too, who have to go back to their people.  The Minister for Finance has to go back to the Shannon Valley to look for many of his votes, and I hope there will be at least a smidgen of sympathy in his heart and mind to respond to the problems of these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I would like to have said a good deal more but time does not permit.  I hope the House, and especially the Ministers concerned have taken due and good note of what I have said.</P>

      <P>As a rural Deputy my prime concern is bringing to the attention of this House the problems, needs and priorities of the constituency it is my privilege to represent. It is part of the region that is peripheral not only within the county but within the Community.  It shares part of the Border with Northern Ireland.  It has a scattered, rural population and all the towns there are small with the exception of Sligo town.  Unfortunately, the level of emigration from there has been high over the years.  The region's rugged, varied and often breathtaking scenery makes it a major tourist attraction, but these rural and scenic assets present significant problems in the field of community development which add to the cost of infrastructural development.  The nature of the terrain means that the cost of maintaining roads, particularly county roads, is high.  Here I pay tribute to the Minister for the Environment.  In 1986 we had £66,000 for county roads.  This year in County Sligo we have almost £1.5 million to upgrade and strengthen our county roads and a marvellous job is being done in that respect.  I welcome the Minister's measures in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2175" /> My constituency is a maritime one and has a very important port in Sligo town which has tremendous potential for industrial, agricultural, marine and tourism development in the area.  Therefore, I would welcome a decision to tackle the situation that has arisen in this port in recent years.  The Minister for the Marine is taking a look at new proposals and I hope he will make a decision to grant money to update Sligo port.</P>
    <P>I welcome the plans for the development of Sligo Airport which is a vital part of the infrastructure of our constituency. Because of our remoteness it is essential that Sligo Airport be enlarged, extended and improved in every way so that it can cater for direct flights to major British and European cities.  Aer Lingus provide a feeder service at the airport for people wishing to fly to other destinations. Ryanair will be establishing direct flights to Luton very shortly, and I welcome that.  I support the growing number of people who are calling for direct flights to Horan International Airport at Knock. I see no logic in the present arrangement which requires planes to land at Shannon before they can land at Knock.  Such compulsory landing at Shannon adds thousands of pounds to the cost of chartered flights to Knock from North America. Direct charter flights from the US, for example, to Knock would save considerably on time, fuel costs and landing charges if they were allowed to overfly Shannon.  Knock airport has proved itself.  Justifiably it has attracted a huge number of tourists, pilgrims, commuters and others.  An ever-increasing number of emigrants are using it.  It is the success story of the eighties.  In the past there was a great deal of criticism of Knock airport even among Members of this House.  Some Members have realised their mistake and have withdrawn their criticisms.  I welcome their courage in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for your agreement because there is the threat of job losses in the Kerry Fashions plant in Tralee and in the Sunbeam plant in Cork. I will let my Cork colleagues deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>On 29 January the difficulties of the parent group of these companies were made public.  Many weeks have now elapsed and it would appear that no progress has been made in efforts to save these jobs.  I raise the matter today because the situation is now very serious and has been deteriorating on a daily basis.  In the case of Tralee there were nearly 200 workers, mostly female, in a town with 20 per cent unemployment and the impact of 200 further redundancies will be very profound. Most of the female workers are from single income families where the husband is unemployed.  There is little or no alternative employment available.  Already I have had discussions with a number of young single women who are considering emigrating because the prospects of employment in Tralee or in County Kerry are not very healthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he has met deputations from Cork and Kerry but the attitude to date has been laid back.  It is necessary that there should be direct intervention by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the State agencies &mdash; in the case of the Kerry plant by Shannon Development and in the case of the Cork <Col N="2177" /> plant by the IDA.  We need a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; approach otherwise the situation which has been deteriorating will become irretrievable.</P>
    <P>During the past two weeks people had been made redundant in different sections of the plant and it appears that the plant will have reached total wind down by next weekend.  If they stop manufacturing we are in serious trouble and it will not be possible to keep their markets open.  The knitwear industry is a very competitive business and those market opportunities will be filled very quickly, be they in the United States, Britain or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister of State to intervene directly, to contact prospective buyers and ensure they are given every facility by the State agencies in the hope of saving these jobs before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for the opportunity to speak in this debate. I contacted the Minister's office earlier to say there was agreement with the Ceann Comhairle's Office to share time and also to deal with Sunbeam.</P>
      <P>It gives me no great pleasure to talk again about Sunbeam Wolsey in Blackpool, Cork.  There are 450 jobs at stake there.  I will not go over the details because we have dealt with them in the past.  If the plant closes in Blackpool it will be a killer punch for an area which has been rocked by unemployment in recent years.  The average rate of unemployment in the city is over 20 per cent but in pockets on the northside where the factory is situated unemployment is over 80 per cent.  Closure would be a killer punch in such an area.  Many of the workers are female and are the only breadwinners in their families.</P>
      <P>Sunbeam has a long and proud tradition in the Blackpool area.  It is part of the folklore of that area.  The song &ldquo;The Boys of Fairhill&rdquo; contains the phrase &ldquo;Blackpool girls are very tall up against the Sunbeam wall&rdquo;.  I will not go into it. It will be tragic if the place closes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many meetings in recent weeks with the workforce, the <Col N="2178" /> management, the receiver and the IDA. My constituency colleagues of all shades of opinion have worked day and night in their attempts to save this plant.</P>
    <P>Last night a sit-in commenced in the plant.  This is a symptom of the frustration of the workers.  I would pay tribute to their positive approach in recent weeks and to their commitment to keeping the plant going.  There will be more redundancies tomorrow which will leave only 100 workers in the knitting plant out of a total of 180.  In the next few days the knitting floor will cease operation entirely, which will mean that the knitting plant will be on the point of closing down and will cease operations.</P>
    <P>I come here this evening in the hope that the Minister can give a ray of hope to a workforce who are now deeply frustrated. I would ask him to have discussions with the Minister for Finance on the possible involvement of Fóir Teoranta. I know that Fóir Teoranta is on the point of being dissolved under proposed legislation before this House.  However, the structures of Fóir Teoranta are still there and it is still a <i>de facto</i> body whose dissolution I will be opposing.  Every lifeline must be considered at this desperate hour.  Many firms have been given the kiss of life by Fóir Teoranta.  In the Cork area Carrigaline Potteries and Murphys Brewery are firms which have benefited. It is ironic that the Minister for Finance, in whose area C &amp; D animal foods benefited enormously, is now proposing legislation to dissolve Fóir Teoranta.  I would ask that this suggestion be examined as a last desperate move.  The sands of time are running out for Sunbeam and the direct intervention of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce is necessary.</P>
    <P>The fears of the workforce have been raised by the export to Britain of £500,000 worth of finished products, following the exportation of a lot of equipment prior to the announcement that the receiver was coming in.  I appeal to the Ministers to intervene directly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for allowing me to participate in <Col N="2179" /> this debate.  I would sincerely ask the Minister to intervene immediately in this crisis.  For the past five or six weeks the public representatives of the area from all parties have been meeting in an effort to get something moving on this issue. What we have seen last night and this morning is the built up frustration of a workforce who have given every co-operation to the receiver, the IDA and the Minister.  They have bent over backwards to try to facilitate everyone involved in order to save jobs and to keep the company running.  As someone who worked for 30 years in a factory and went through the traumatic experience of being made redundant when the factory closed, I understand what those people are going through.  It is very frustrating because maybe 75 per cent of the workforce are women whose husbands are unemployed and who see no future work for them. Many of these women are the breadwinners and sole earners.</P>
      <P>Whatever method the Minister uses&mdash; the National Development Corporation, the IDA or direct intervention by him&mdash; the time is ripe for intervention.  As public representatives we did our best and it is easy to understand the pent up frustration of many workers who cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to take on board the representations we have made here and to direct someone somewhere to step in to save the jobs of 450 workers which are of paramount importance to the prosperity of the north side of the city.  I ask the Minister to resolve the crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies Spring, Allen and O'Sullivan for their contribution and I recognise their united approach in regard to the constituency involved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, Deputy Wallace and Deputy Quill were also here for the debate and they are very concerned about this serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Minister for Industry and Commerce stressed in the House on 30 January and 15 February last his concern about the threat to <Col N="2180" /> jobs in the Sunbeam Group as a result of the appointment of the receiver.  These are concerns which I also share.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the Minister is keeping in very close touch with developments in relation to both companies and I would reiterate that every effort is being made to secure takeovers of the plants and to save the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the IDA and Shannon Development are working very closely with the receiver and the various interests shown in the companies are being explored.  However, I must stress to the House that contacts between the receiver, State agencies and potential investors are confidential and I am not at liberty to disclose details of such contacts. Indeed, any disclosure by me would be unhelpful to all concerned.  I know Deputies understand the confidentiality of the matter at this important stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent action taken by a section of the workforce at the Sunbeam plant, I am concerned about the possible adverse effect of this on the efforts of both the receiver and the IDA to attract a buyer.  While I can understand the frustration of the employees concerned whose jobs are at risk this type of action undermines the image of the company and impacts on customer confidence, which is crucial in any future strategy for the operation in the event of a takeover.  I appeal to the workers to stop this action and to withdraw from the plant.</P>
    <P>In relation to Kerry Fashions, a possible management buy-out is being examined by the receiver but I cannot say any more at this stage because of the sensitivity of the issue.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the situation.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry in general is facing a difficult period at present. Undoubtedly, the improved exchange rate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the UK, our main market, has impacted on the clothing industry together with the slow-down in consumer spending in the UK.</P>
    <P>However, the particular difficulties being experienced by knitwear producers is a problem which is affecting producers in a number of member states of the Community at present.  Notwithstanding <Col N="2181" /> this, in so far as the Irish clothing industry are concerned, I want to emphasise that, while some companies in the industry are experiencing difficulties, there are many successful ones with significant growth potential.</P>
    <P>In this regard, a wide range of measures are in place and are being implemented on an on-going basis to address the weaknesses identified in the sector, which include lack of scale, inadequate management skill, lack of attention to marketing and lack of finance. The measures in place include financial packages with increased emphasis on State support for marketing and technology; marketing initiatives, home and export; company development planning; training programmes, etc., and involve the State agencies working very closely with the sector.  Incentive packages are structured to meet the agreed strategic development needs of companies with more emphasis on management development and greater support for strategic market led initiatives.</P>
    <P>The measures in place to assist the industry are, of course, continually being refined in the light of evolving trade developments.  The major challenges facing the Irish clothing industry in the future are the completion of the Internal Market by 1992 and the longer term phasing out of the multifibre arrangement (MFA).</P>
    <P>The clothing industry must prepare themselves to meet the challenges ahead and the increased competition from low cost sources by increasing their competitiveness and developing their export markets.  I am confident that the industry can meet the challenges ahead with the assistance of the strategies being pursued by the State agencies.</P>
    <P>While the support agencies play an important role in helping the industry to develop and expand, much of the initiative rests with the industry itself to exploit new markets and to be competitive on the home market.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, has assured me that everything possible is being done to try to resolve the great difficulties facing the Sunbeam Wolsey Group.  I share the concern of the Deputies in this regard and I hope they <Col N="2182" /> understand the sensitivity of the issue.  I appeal to the employees concerned to withdraw from the factory because it is damaging the efforts of State agencies in relation to the negotiations taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I also wish to thank the Minister for Education for taking an interest and having the commitment to come in to the House to give her reply.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go through the background of the necessity for regional technical colleges, but I want to give some of the facts in relation to the background of the proposal.  The case for a regional college in Castlebar has dragged on for over 20 years and various Ministers and politicians have made statements about it in those years.</P>
      <P>On 17 December 1981 the then Minister for Education, former Deputy John Boland said:</P>
      <P>The question of providing such a facility to serve Castlebar and the adjoining region has separately been raised with me some time ago and, as a result, I wish to reiterate my commitment to the provision of such a facility in Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question on 17 February 1983 the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Hussey, said she was aware of the decision of her predecessor and that she was satisfied as to the validity and strength of the case for a regional technical college in Castlebar. From that time on all inquiries and representations in regard to the establishment of an RTC in Castlebar were answered on the basis that all such projects were being considered in the context of the third level investment programme <Col N="2183" /> which was to be brought out soon afterwards. Paragraph 7.85 of <i>Building on Reality</i> stated, among other things:</P>
    <P>New regional technical colleges in Tallaght, Dún Laoghaire and Blanchardstown and the commencement of planning of new colleges in Thurles and Castlebar have also been proposed. Subject to further examination of the need for each project and to availability of capital, as many as possible of these projects will be commenced in the plan period.</P>
    <P>On 16 May 1985 the Department of Finance issued formal sanction to commence planning and design of the Castlebar and Thurles projects.  On 7 June 1985 the then Minister for Education announced the go ahead for Castlebar and Thurles and a team of architects, services engineers and structural engineers were appointed on 28 June 1985.  The college proposed for Castlebar was to cater for 800 students at an estimated cost of about £9 million.</P>
    <P>The proposals for a schedule of courses and numbers were discussed with the County Mayo VEC at that time.  Suffice it to say that the Department confirmed on 6 February 1987 as follows:</P>
    <P>I confirm the Department's agreement to purchase 18 to 20 acres of land adjacent to Davitt House on the main Castlebar-Claremorris road.</P>
    <P>Castlebar Urban District Council, on 12 March 1987, passed a formal motion proposing that the relevant land in their possession would also be made available. Financial sanction to purchase the site was granted on 28 January 1987 and signed by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>On 15 January this year the acting county manager stated: &ldquo;As requested I wish to confirm that this land is available if it is required by the Department of Education as a site for the proposed Regional Technical College&rdquo;.  The Fine Gael Party Leader, Deputy Alan Dukes, confirmed the following on 18 December in writing:</P>
    <P>My view of the priorities in relation to the provision of RTCs remains unchanged.  Sanction has now been <Col N="2184" /> given to proceed with the Tallaght College: that means that the Castlebar project is number one on the priority list.  I take a very strong view that work should begin on this at the earliest possible moment, because the need for the college has been established beyond any doubt.</P>
    <P>I am a realist and I know the Minister has a great number of difficulties in her Department but I would like to ask her across the floor of the House if she would be prepared, through the normal channels, to meet a formal deputation of the VEC, together with Members of the Oireachtas and various interested organisations, in order that we may put proposals before her.  It might then be possible for her to give approval to some third level courses which could be run in existing accommodation which is available in the town and in that way the Department could show their continued commitment to the regional college.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about the provision of any college.  When one considers the proportionate growth of Tralee, Athlone, Carlow, Dundalk or Letterkenny, relative to the RTCs, in this case we are talking about the economic salvation of a county, approximately 2,000 of whose students now attend third level colleges outside the county.  The Minister will be well aware of the distances involved.  The number attending second level schools in Mayo is over 2,300 and on an annual basis 2,000 to 2,500 students attend third level education outside the county.  There is a social, economic, educational and industrial argument to be made for this college.  I would like to think that not alone would the Minister approve courses but that the commitment for the college will not die. The land which was so sought after and took a very long time to acquire is still, and will be, available if the Minister requires it in future.  I would ask her to consider this most important issue for our county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my colleague, Deputy Enda Kenny, for agreeing to share his time with me.  This is not alone a county issue in Mayo but a regional issue.  In Mayo we are not just <Col N="2185" /> looking for a regional technical college in a watered-down sense; we are looking for a fully-fledged regional technical college. The Minister's intransigence in this regard thus far is all the more incomprehensible when one considers the shortage of supply of third level places in certain faculty areas.  For example, there is only one college in the country currently training opticians, that is the College of Technology in Kevin Street, Dublin, which last year took in 16 such students.  This is a high growth area when one takes into consideration cosmetic opticians as well.  There is enormous scope in that area.  At present there is only one college in the country training pharmacists, that is Trinity College Dublin which took in only 50 such students last year.  Again, there is enormous scope in that area.</P>
      <P>Mayo has a particularly high level of pharmaceutical industries.  For example, there is Asahi in Killala, Baxter in Castlebar and Swinford and Hollister in Ballina.  It seems that Mayo has the essential basic pharmaceutical infrastructure which could be in ideal partnership with a pharmacy faculty at a new third level college.  The potential of a college in Mayo is enormous but unfortunately the Minister has refused to relent thus far.  I hope the persuasive agruments of Deputy Kenny and myself will have the necessary effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent letter to me the Minister stated that an inter-departmental committee are currently examining the position of student places at third level. Pending receipt of the committee's report a number of capital projects have been deferred, including the proposed regional technical college in Castlebar.  It is extremely difficult for Mayo people to accept such ministerial logic when the same inter-departmental committee has been by-passed in the Minister's haste to approve an RTC for Tallaght in Dublin. Mayo children have to travel the length and breadth of the country for third level facilities while students from Tallaght are within easy range of UCD, Trinity College, the new Dublin City University, the College of Commerce at Rathmines, the College of Technology at Kevin Street and Bolton Street, the National <Col N="2186" /> College of Music, the College of Catering in Cathal Brugha Street and the College of Home Economics in Sion Hill, as well as a plethora of private third level institutions. Despite the overwhelming case for a third level institution in Mayo, each year 2,800 third level students have to leave the county.  Therefore there is a fairly substantial case for an RTC in Mayo.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's insensitivity to the problem in Mayo is in no way refined by the fact that the Minister enjoys in her own town of Athlone a very prestigious third level RTC which is an ideal complement to the various industries in that town.  We are entitled to a college in Mayo and we trust that the Minister has the necessary sensitivity to grant us that college.  As Deputy Kenny said, we look forward to a meeting with the Minister and with other public representatives. We would ask her to be sensitive to our rights, justice and entitlements and to accede to our request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let us get jealousy out of the way.  Deputy Higgins cited all the colleges in Dublin but I do not think the purpose of any debate is to say: &ldquo;we want what they have&rdquo;.  Similarly, he cited Athlone which has a very fine regional college with which I have been associated for over 20 years.  If the Deputy's purpose in putting that into the debate was to highlight for his local paper some sort of insensitivity on my part, it is completely daft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I let the Deputy rant on and did not interrupt him.  From Dr. Patrick Clancy's report on the scale of <Col N="2187" /> the percentage of students going into third level education, Mayo ranked sixth highest in the land.  On the scale of students getting third level grants it ranked second highest whereas Dublin ranked lowest at 19 per cent, a full 11 per cent behind Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is proving our point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let that be on the record of the House so that the case of Dublin is not so jealously expressed in this House.  We were able to put Tallaght forward as a flagship special project to Brussels, where Deputy Bertie Ahern and I had to go to plead the case because of the demographic and social needs of the area and the fact that Dublin was the lowest by far on the scale of participation in third level education.  That enabled the funds to be received for that project.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny and Deputy Higgins for raising this matter.  I always try to take Adjournment debates myself because it is only corect and fair that the Minister in charge of the Department should do so.  There are lacunas in the chronological account of events as detailed by Deputy Kenny but in deference to his sensitivity I shall not detail them.  They relate to Deputy Bruton at two particular points in his career.  The final Cabinet meeting before the Government dissolved in March 1987 at which a decision was made about the inter-departmental committee was not mentioned in the Deputy's contribution and neither was a remark made last July but perhaps that was an aberration on the Deputy's part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> If I had my way every town in the land would have a regional college but we have to have a measure of decorum about our public finances and arrangements about how we do our business.  As I have said, in relation to third level places Mayo was the sixth highest of all the counties. I am delighted the young students there are getting the education they truthfully deserve and that the second level institutions, which are many, varied and excellent, are producing young students with such capabilities.</P>
    <P>A proposal was put to me today by Deputy Kenny which has been, for some time past, a matter of informal discussion between the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraig Flynn and myself, that is that I would meet with a deputation from Mayo VEC to discuss with them this whole issue and also to see what can be done in the matter of outreach courses.  Tentative and informal discussions have taken place already on that matter.  As I have said, Deputy Flynn has talked to me about this, as indeed has Deputy Kenny, and we have probed a little into the matter.  By the time the VEC delegation come to see me &mdash; I hope it will be soon&mdash;I think we will be able to explore that idea in a much greater depth.  It certainly is an idea which has much potential.  In that respect I would be very glad, in conjunction with my colleague and friend, the Minister for the Environment, and also Deputy Kenny, Deputy Higgins and whoever else wishes to come, to meet with Mayo VEC to explore that possibility.</P>

      <P>At 11.15 a.m. on 1 March 1990, following the completion of a routine operational training mission involving two qualified flying officers, an Air Corps Cessna aircraft was positioning for landing at Gormanston Aerodrome when the aircraft experienced a loss of power.  At that time the aircraft was over water south east of Gormanston.  The pilot in charge established the aircraft in a gliding attitude and headed immediately towards the shore for an emergency landing.  However, as <Col N="2142" /> there was not enough height available, it became necessary for the pilot to land his aircraft on the sea about 30 metres from the shore line.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that both pilots emerged uninjured and were able to reach the shore without difficulty.</P>
      <P>The aircraft was later recovered by the Air Corps and returned to Gormanston Aerodrome.  The cause of the engine failure is the subject of an investigation.</P>

      <P>Arising from routine sampling and analysis procedures carried out by Westmeath County Council, some contamination of the water supply to Streamstown national school has come to light.  However, I am informed that absence from the school because of illness is not considered to be unusually high for this time of the year and a surveillance by the health board of the local general practitioners does not indicate an unusual level of illness related to the school.</P>
      <P>The local health board director of community care has, as a precautionary measure, administered a course of preventive injections to those children whose families were willing to accept it.  The drinking water tap in the school yard has been disconnected and the children have been warned against drinking the water from the taps in the toilets where the younger ones particularly are supervised when using them.  Operational hygiene has been improved including the boiling of any water which is needed for drinking or cooking.  The director of community care does not consider it necessary to close the school.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the sanitary authority in this case, Westmeath County Council, to ensure that drinking water meets the quality standards set down in the European Communities (Quality of Water intended for Human Consumption Regulations, 1988) and the procedures to be adopted where the statutory levels are not met are set down in the regulations. The director of community care has made recommendations to the Westmeath County Council for the improvement of the situation and the board of management of the school.  I am also communicating with my colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Education, about the matter.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme the reckonable income to be determined for the purposes of the award of a grant is gross income from all sources of the candidate and his/her parents, less any sum paid by way of contribution to a superannuation fund, and excluding also children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts, holiday earnings, if any, of the candidate and payments under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
      <P>In the case of self-employed persons, when reckoning expenses which may be taken into account as expenses incurred in earning profits no amount may be included in respect of mortgage repayments. PAYE taxpayers are similarly affected.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is understood to be referring in the main to persons in County Meath who are basically ineligible for school transport service and have failed to be accommodated under an arrangement whereby, on an existing service, concessionary fare paying passengers may be accepted on a first come first served basis.</P>
      <P>The capacity of the vehicle used in the service referred to is 21 children, and I understand that a number of children who applied for fare paying concessionary places could not be accommodated. The service is currently under review, with the possibility of its being discontinued altogether, because the number of children eligible for free transport has fallen.  Among that eligible number are three from one of the families in which the Deputy is interested.  There is a fourth member of that family who is ineligible for free transport, and who under existing arrangements probably could not have been accommodated had he applied for the spring term.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the number of ineligible children wishing to avail of a service cannot be a factor either in determining the capacity of the vehicle to be used to serve a particular centre, or whether the service should continue.</P>
