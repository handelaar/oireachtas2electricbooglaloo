      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 10 and 11.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding the resolution of the Dáil of Tuesday, 10 July 1990, that the proceedings on No. 10 shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. today.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 21.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, there are two matters I would like to raise.  First, in the event that Brian Keenan is released today &mdash; which is something we all wish to see &mdash; can we have an assurance from the Government that all the arrangements for bringing him back will be made and handled by our Government and that no other Government will be involved?  The other matter I would like to raise concerns the setting up of a proposed committee of this House on crime.  We will be proposing, Sir, an addition to the terms of reference of that committee to allow the committee to send for persons and papers and specifically that the chairperson of that committee be provided by one of the Opposition parties, in line with previous precedents in the matter.  I would like to have an indication from the Government <Col N="1206" /> that we could finally resolve this issue and proceed in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the Deputy to express his view on these matters, strictly speaking they are not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, on both issues it would be useful to have an indication from the Government and we would do no violence to the other groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Government are very deeply involved in that matter.  It is a sensitive matter which is best left as the Government have handled it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be dealt with entirely by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Dukes in relation to his request for a committee on crime.  Perhaps the Tánaiste would inform the House why there is now a delay in setting up this committee?  We have waited for it for months.  There has been a good deal of discussion between the Whips and given what is happening on the streets of Dublin, as late as last Friday, surely the House has a responsibility to have a committee on crime.  Perhaps the Tánaiste could take steps to ensure the committee is appointed before this House rises.</P>
      <P>Last week my colleague, Deputy Quinn, put down a question to the Taoiseach in relation to formal decisions made by the various Ministers in the context of the Presidency.  We were informed that the decisions will be laid before this House.  It has not been done, Sir, and when will it be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring will appreciate that the first matter to which he referred is not strictly in order now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand <Col N="1207" /> that matters appertaining to the Presidency were dealt with yesterday by way of parliamentary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, item No. 7 on today's Order Paper is the proposal to set up a committee on crime.  I believe I am entitled to a response in relation to some difficulties that have arisen.  The second matter related to a parliamentary question.  It is important in relation to Private Members' Business of this House this evening and I think I am also entitled to a response on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste wish to respond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the Government are very anxious to establish a committee on crime and, indeed, and delay in the matter is because of a certain stance taken by the Opposition parties in regard to the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this House previously had a Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  At that time it was clearly decided and accepted on all sides of the House that the Chair of that committee would be occupied by a Member of the Opposition.  All we are asking is that this Government in setting up this committee on crime follow that precedent.  The Government so far have dug their heels in on this, for some reason which I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Government to follow the precedent that was fixed on the last occasion so that we can have that committee set up before this House rises for the summer recess and they can get down to work during the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Tánaiste is aware that there is an agreement between the Opposition parties in relation to a nominee for chairman of this <Col N="1208" /> committee.  Surely it can be done before the House rises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter primarily for the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will I be allowed to add my voice of concern on this issue under cover of the latitude being granted to the other parties because it is a matter I sought to raise on many occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be taken as a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The up-to-date position so far as the Whips are concerned is that we put a proposition to the Government Chief Whip &mdash; the Tánaiste may not be aware of this.  He undertook to have the matter considered.  We understood in that context that we would hear from him.  The delay in establishing this very important committee rests with the Government and nowhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that should, at this stage, be left to the Whips.  I appreciate what the Deputies have said. The matter could be settled immediately if there was agreement on the Government chairman.  There is no question about that.  If the Opposition parties have another view it can be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we will take into account what has been said here.  If the House would be patient and leave it to the Whips we should make every effort to settle this matter before we adjourn so that they can meet as a committee during the vacation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on another item.  I put down a question to every one of the Government Ministers on 3 July 1990 seeking to obtain from them the context and the format of the decisions which were taken during the course of the Irish Presidency and the Councils for which they had responsibility and the subsequent action that would follow from such decisions.  All of those questions, sent to each individual Minister, were answered by the Taoiseach who, in a holding reply, said that the information was being assembled in comprehensive form and would be laid before the House. This morning I checked with the Library again when I ascertained that the reply to these questions &mdash; to which I am entitled &mdash; has not yet been supplied.  I do not know what is happening over on those benches, perhaps they themselves do not know, but will somebody please co-ordinate the information and let me have the reply to which I am entitled?</P>

      <P>On the question of promised legislation, in view of the decision taken yesterday in Cork by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to seek not to have moneylending licences renewed because, they allege, moneylenders are charging up to 74 per cent interest to unfortunate people who can least afford to bear such payments, is the Tánaiste in <Col N="1210" /> a position to say if the legislation promised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be introduced early in the next session?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of promised legislation this House has been waiting a long time for an environmental protection agency Bill.  It now appears that this promised legislation is held up because of what are termed in the papers today personality differences between the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State, Deputy Harney.  Can the Tánaiste now give this House an assurance that the Bill will be circulated even at this late stage?  Can he also inform the House what he is doing from the point of view of resolving the personality differences between the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State, Deputy Harney?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, last week I raised the question of the regulations arising from Government consideration of the report of the Commission on Health Funding.  I asked whether regulations or legislation would be introduced.  I want to make the point that on 6 February last the Minister stated that both will produce results within this Dáil session, allowing him to bring more detailed and specific plans to Government before the Summer Recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  &mdash;(1)  The Minister shall appoint a review body to be known as the Broadcasting Policy Review Council (in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Broadcasting Council&rsquo;).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Broadcasting Council shall consist of representatives of the Authority, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, radio and television broadcasting contractors, advertisers, newspapers, faculties of communications in the institutes of higher learning, the trade unions, the <Col N="1219" /> Irish language and such other persons as the Minister thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(3)  There shall not be more than 18 members on the Broadcasting Council.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Broadcasting Council shall make an annual report to both Houses of the Oireachtas including its recommendations for changes in broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>(5)  Its remit shall include consideration of all relevant questions affecting community, local, national and international broadcasting including funding, competition (internal and external), balance standards (including standards relating to good taste, violence, sex and language), public order, copyright, performing rights, home production (including independent home production), Irish language culture and news content.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I propose that a broadcasting policy review council be set up as a feature of the future arrangements in relation to broadcasting.  The way things have developed in relation to broadcasting since the beginning of this year highlights the need for a body to look at broadcasting issues in a reflective and detached way.  There is a need for a body outside the political arena to listen to the views of those groups that have a legitimate interest.</P>
    <P>We now have a fourth set of proposals from the Minister in the space of two months.  None of these proposals was discussed with many of the interest groups involved.  They certainly were not discussed with the RTE Authority, the Institute of Advertisers, the Association of Advertising Practitioners nor with any other directly involved interest groups. Given the level of correspondence that I and other Deputies have received, it is clear that the Minister and the Government have refused to meet with the interest groups to hear their point of view.  I know that the advertising groups concerned have not only sought a meeting with the Minister for Communications but with the Minister for <Col N="1220" /> Industry and Commerce who, one would think, would have a direct interest as the Minister responsible for competition and for prices.  Yet he would not meet any of these interest groups.</P>
    <P>So we have proposals, amended proposals, amendments to the amended proposals, addenda to the amendments to the amended proposals, all without the slightest consultation with people who are vitally interested.  If the Minister was so sure of his ground and so anxious to do the right thing for broadcasting, if he was motivated only by the concern to lay a permanent foundation for vibrant and lasting broadcasting in the independent sector, surely he would have had the confidence and, indeed, the intelligence, to seek and take on board the views of people who are directly involved and others not directly involved but who have an interest.</P>
    <P>Apart from those who are directly involved, whom the Minister might wish to fob off on the basis that they have a vested interest &mdash; and I suppose it would be unrealistic to ask the Minister to hear these people and then give them everything they were looking for as if their's was a detached view of events &mdash; there are other independent people who have no vested interest.  For example, the engineers get no direct benefit from this legislation.  Clearly however, they do have an interest.  In the editorial which is carried on page 3 of the July edition of <i>The Engineers Journal</i>, they are very clear on the matter.  The editorial which takes up the entire page states:</P>
    <P>Everyone will criticise RTE at some time or other &mdash; for one reason or another.  That is only natural. However, the criticism now will be as nothing compared to the criticism which will accrue if the national service is spancelled as is proposed.</P>
    <P>A limited number of excellent services is far better than a diversity of sub-standard services and that applies in no uncertain manner to broadcasting. The objective nationally must be to have a first class national service <Col N="1221" /> which will be expected to serve the country with the highest standards of broadcasting.  But more than that, it should also continue to be an enterprising organisation fully capable of expanding and competing in a very demanding market.</P>
    <P>The editorial, which is extremely constructive, continues in that vein.  I would refer it to the Minister for his attention because I assume, on the basis of his continuing dogmatism in relation to this legislation, he has not read it.</P>
    <P>I would now like to quote from a letter dated 9 July from The Marketing Society, which has been circulated to Deputies in the last few days.  It states:</P>
    <P>While the Society agrees wholeheartedly with the objectives as stated in the Minister's speech to the Dáil on 7 June last, some of the aims intended to serve these objectives seem, in our professional opinion, unlikely to achieve their intentions.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the effectiveness of the Minister's intended orders, in particular the &ldquo;capping&rdquo; of RTE advertising levels, may well lead to quite a different outcome to that intended by his objectives.  It is important that the mechanics of marketing and advertising practice should be clearly understood before assessing this impact.  It is quite a complex business but the essential facts would appear to be:</P>
    <P> (1)  If the amount of advertising on RTE is limited, there are two immediate effects:</P>
    <P>(a)  the cost of advertising rises, as RTE must ensure that it sells all of its time to maximise its permitted revenue;</P>
    <P>(b)  advertisers who cannot obtain time on RTE will look to other relevant media instead.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any price rise will tend to squeeze the smaller advertiser out of the market in favour of the big-budget international marketing company; this can have a detrimental effect on the <Col N="1222" /> growing sector of new, small Irish companies; this would appear to be contrary to the Minister's stated objectives.</P>
    <P>(3)  An advertiser, who cannot obtain time on RTE, but has the funds to advertise, is much more likely to seek an alternative broadcast medium. The largest share of this is for television and an advertiser who has a TV commercial available (often produced outside this country and therefore bearing no direct cost to the Irish marketing company) will select the next best TV alternative.</P>
    <P>The only serious alternative is UTV. Two out of three sets in the Republic can receive UTV programmes and this rises to 85 per cent in Dublin.  The likely effect of &ldquo;capping&rdquo; therefore is to drive money out of the economy and into Northern Ireland.  There is no guarantee that it will re-circulate among the other Irish media.</P>
    <P>(4)  The availability of TV3 still appears to be at least a year away; after that TV3 will have to build a reputation for its programmes and prove that it has a large enough viewership to justify advertisers spending money with the station.  This could take many years to develop, in the meantime UTV will have benefitted from the &ldquo;capping&rdquo; and will fight hard to maintain the opportunity handed to it.</P>
    <P>(5)  The reduction in RTE earnings and the shift of advertising money from the State to Northern Ireland will have serious consequences for employment in RTE, marketing companies, market research organisations and advertising agencies.  This would seem to be in direct contravention to the Minister's objectives.  </P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Society would like to draw attention to the EC Directive on TV Advertising which recommends an average of nine minutes per hour for TV advertising, with a maximum of 12 minutes in any one hour.  This is <Col N="1223" /> significantly higher than the limits the Minister seeks to impose.  Finally, Section 4 of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>section 2 as it is drafted at present</P>
    <P>&mdash; does seem to present an open gate to a Minister to introduce orders limiting the freedom of broadcasters to operate.  The Irish Law Times has already devoted its most recent editorial to outlining why it thinks this action may be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the importance of these points will be taken into account by all concerned and that Section 4 and its implications will be resolved in the interest of the Irish economy and not become the possible reason for an important loss of revenue and employment within the Irish market.</P>
    <P>They are two quite separate views from those expressed by everybody on this side of the House, and indeed by many people directly involved in broadcasting. Despite this unanimous view of the professional bodies, the Minister is proceeding with the legislation.  This is no way to proceed with legislation of such importance.  There is a clear and definite need for a calm review which would include representatives of the legitimate interests concerned, professional and competent people who have no direct vested interests but who have the competence to assess the whole question of funding, the marketplace, the amount of advertising funds now available, the extent to which they will be available in the future, the extent to which they will be eroded or otherwise by foreign-based competition, with ever-growing transnational broadcasting, and all the other questions we list in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister even at this stage, and even if he is intent on proceeding with the proposals in the rest of the Bill, to accept the idea of a broadcasting review council.  We suggest such a council should consist of representatives of the RTE Authority, the Independent Radio and Television <Col N="1224" /> Commission, radio and television broadcasting contractors, advertisers, newspapers, faculties of communications in the institutes of higher learning, the trade unions, the Irish language and such other persons as the Minister thinks fit.  We also propose that the broadcasting council should report to both Houses of the Oireachtas whatever the changes, if any, it recommends in broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>We propose in our amendment that the remit of the broadcasting council shall include consideration of all relevant questions affecting community, local, national and international broadcasting, including funding, competition &mdash; both internal and external, balance, standards &mdash; including standards relating to good taste, violence, sex and language, public order, copyright, performing rights, home production &mdash; including independent home production &mdash; Irish language, culture and news content.  I cannot pretend that this proposal is original.  This is how other administrations do things. They set up commissions to examine in detail the present state of the industry, all relevant factors, including prospective factors or developments, and made recommendations.  As I have said on Second Stage of this debate, in Britain there has been the Peacock report and the report of the Select Committee on Broadcasting of the House of Commons, and they then proceeded to a White Paper on broadcasting which set out the general views of the administration, so as to allow the general public and the interest groups an opportunity of commenting on those proposals.</P>
    <P>The situation here is very different. Nobody, with the possible exception of the national newspapers of Ireland, has had any input into this legislation.  The Minister has simply refused to see the other interested parties.  The changes that have been made, were made without consulting the interest groups directly involved which is a sure recipe for disaster. I want to predict, Sir, that If the Minister continues with his proposals as they stand, it is very clear that a further broadcasting Bill will be brought before this House before the end of next year in <Col N="1225" /> order to put right many of the things which are being put wrong by this legislation. It seems to me that the Minister will live to regret the hasty and ill considered proposals which are before the House and which are the fourth different set of proposals he has brought before us in the past eight weeks.</P>
    <P>It is 16 years since we have had a Broadcasting Review Council.  The last time we had a report on the future of broadcasting was in 1974.  However, there has been a revolution in communications technology since that time. We did not have satellite broadcasting 16 years ago.  In the meantime, satellite broadcasting, both direct broadcasting satellites and indirect broadcasting satellites have been set in place and, in fact, the great majority of the Irish population have access to several satellite services, in addition to the four British terrestrial services and the two Irish terrestrial services. We also know that several other satellite channels are planned and the UK Government have proposed a fifth terrestrial television channel, TV5.  We know also that there are proposals for at least three other British satellite channels.</P>
    <P>The nature of broadcasting is such that we cannot detach ourselves from the world around us and this is particularly the case with British broadcasting because first they are our nearest neighbours and second they speak the same language.  We in Ireland have a different experience from Europe where the impact of French television in Germany is greatly diminished by the fact that many Germans are not proficient in French, but we do not have that automatic defence mechanism because we speak English. The Irish audience have available and will have available all the English language services emanating from Great Britain at present and in the near future.  This has an enormous potential impact on the market share of Irish television channels.  If the market share of the Irish television channels diminishes, there is a good chance that their share of the advertising cake will diminish.  Indeed, I contend that the Irish advertising cake will be diminished <Col N="1226" /> by diversion to London or Belfast, particularly London where advertising films can be made and then booked on the new commercial or satellite channels, which will have a growing penetration of the Irish market.</P>
    <P>The Marketing Society in a letter, from which I have quoted earlier, indicate that two out of three households in the Republic already receive UTV and that 85 per cent of the households in the greater Dublin area already receive UTV.  This number will increase particularly as the availability of cable television and MMDS increases.  Only a fool would ignore the potential impact of these developments, that can be foreseen, on the advertising pool within the Republic.  To proceed to restrict RTE now on the basis this should help a third Irish Television channel, which will be set up sometime in the future, seems to me to be an absurdity in the absence of any study, research or independent consideration of the matter.</P>
    <P>While funding is central to the viability, stability and continuation of stations in the future, it is not the only question that has to be considered in the light of the increasing trans-national nature of broadcasting. I suggest that other factors will have to be taken into consideration such as consumer rights.  How can we protect and enforce consumer rights under our law on advertising emanating from foreign based satellite channels?  What are the implications for consumer rights of the increasing availability of foreign based stations carrying advertising?  We also have to examine the question of copyright and the fees for performing rights of actors in this new international situation?  Will we have to pay more in future for the privilege of receiving these foreign based channels?  If so how is it proposed to pay for the performing rights?  What other implications arise from the increasing penetration of foreign based channels especially if they are carried by cable or by MMDS?  What are the financial implications for Irish viewers in the future in relation to performing rights fees in view of the fact that many of the signals are carried by cable or in <Col N="1227" /> the future will be carried by MMDS?  It would be wrong to pretend that there will be no charge for rebroadcasting these signals; there will be as there cannot be a legal licence to rebroadcast if the licence does not cover our international obligations to pay performing rights fees.  If the Government were to proceed without considering these issues I know there would be a writ in the High Court, if there has not already been one, in relation to these matters.  These issues need to be discussed and teased out.  The potential viewers need to know what it will cost to have a MMDS or cable system which will carry the additional channels and which may cost the viewer dearly in the end.</P>
    <P>The internationalisation of broadcasting also raises questions of what is considered good taste and acceptable standards in relation to violence, sex or language.  There already seems to be a problem in relation to the amount of violence on television.  School teachers have told me that the level to which school children copy television programmes in the school yard is extremely worrying. We all know that there has been an increase in violence in our society but noone has really studied the extent to which this has been contributed to by violence on television.  It is time such a study was carried out.</P>
    <P>The British have begun to address this problem by setting up the British Broadcasting Standards Council.  There is no similar body in Ireland.  I believe the setting up of a permanent broadcasting review council such as one proposed in my amendment would be the ideal vehicle for dealing with the question of standards in broadcasting, whether they relate to violence, sex, language or general good taste.</P>
    <P>Without being in any way prudish, I have watched early evening television programmes at home which were certainly unsuitable for viewing by my younger children.  At the same time I acknowledge that the last people who should decide what should or should not be on television are politicians, who have a very direct interest in the media as <Col N="1228" /> part of their job.  These issues should be referred to a detached independent body for recommendation on what is appropriate to be shown and when, without being totally prudish or censorious in this respect.  These matters have been or are being addressed by other adminstrations, most notably by our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom.  The British Broadcasting Standards Council is a permanent feature of the British broadcasting establishment and they keep under review the question of good standards in broadcasting.  Some people may say that the first thing an Irish broadcasting standards council would do is close down &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; because of their alleged preoccupation with sex, etc.  I am not proposing that they should do this but there should be some sort of vehicle to which people who have a gripe can refer matters for consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the question of home production.  There has been a red alert from the independent producers over the past few weeks, in common with many other interest groups, in relation to the proposals contained in the Broadcasting Bill.  The Minister has put down a later amendment which would appear to give them respite for one year only, in that RTE will be obliged, under the proposed amendment not yet discussed, to maintain the same percentage of home production up to the end of 1991 as they have in the past year.  This proposal is <i>ad hoc-ery</i> at best.  We should have a very clear and permanent policy on the development of independent home production.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers also to the Irish language, culture and news content.  We may have gone overboard by requiring the independent stations to devote 20 per cent of their time to news and current affairs.  The 20 per cent requirement seemed too high to me at the time it was introduced and it still seems to be too high.  I have proposed in a later amendment that they should devote 10 per cent of their time to news and current affairs programmes.  I am not even sure if that is the right figure and I would prefer <Col N="1229" /> such issues to be decided on the basis of submissions, consideration and research, and recommendations made in a detached and professional way.  On the face of it, it seems that the 20 per cent requirement for news and current affairs on the independent radio sector both national and local is an unnecessary encumbrance and it smacks of politicians wanting to dictate what people should listen to.  This is something I have resisted for many years.  It is not for us to dictate what people should listen to or view; that, in general, is decided by the viewer and listener themselves.  In so far as parameters should be laid down, this should be done after detached consideration.</P>
    <P>This is why Fine Gael have proposed the setting up of a broadcasting review council.  This is not a novel concept &mdash; it is the way they do things elsewhere.  The difference is that instead of having a parliamentary all-party committee on broadcasting, a commission on the future of broadcasting and several other committees who would deal with different aspects of broadcasting, as they had in the United Kingdom, together with a broadcasting standards council, we are proposing the setting-up of one standing council &mdash; they could be appointed by the Minister but representative in the main of direct interest groups and some independents &mdash; as a permanent feature of our broadcasting arrangements.  The setting up of such a council is necessary, and the changes which have taken place since 1974 warrant the setting-up of such a council.  The events which have taken place in the past five months indicate the urgent need for the setting-up of some stable, steady body who will make recommendations on broadcasting on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>When I made a speech in Cork on 12 February I said that the Minister for Communications was planning to divert money from RTE and I called for the setting-up of a review council.  I got only a one-line response from the Minister, who denied that there were any such proposals.  When I raised the matter by way of parliamentary question on 22 February the Minister denied that there were <Col N="1230" /> any such proposals.  In fact, I was asked to leave the House for making an unfounded allegation.  When he made a speech on 29 March to the media conference in Cork, the Minister said he was going to do something to level the playing pitch.  When I tabled my motion on broadcasting on 29 May I called for the setting-up of a broadcasting review body and asked for temporary steps to be taken to help the independent radio stations which were in trouble, on the same day the Minister came in here with his set of proposals.  He said that a Bill containing certain proposals would be published later in the week.  When the Bill was published four days later it contained radically different proposals from those announced by the Minister four days previously. Within a week a third set of proposals emerged, different from those contained in the Bill, even before we had debated Second Stage.  Since then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Going back over the whole debate to that extent, Deputy Mitchell, is clearly not in order now in respect of your amendment.  Your amendment is pretty wide-ranging and takes in a lot of subject matter but not to the extent that you can engage in a marathon Second Reading speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point &mdash; I will not labour it &mdash; that the debate started with my speech in Cork on 12 February when I proposed what is now proposed in this amendment, and there has been nothing but contradictions, denials, addendums, amendments, more amendments and more addendums by <Col N="1231" /> the Minister since then.  This is not the way to decide broadcasting policy.  This is back-of-the-envelope, top-of-the-head and seat-of-the-pants stuff.  In the process there is a clear likelihood that the progress made in broadcasting will be set at nought because the Minister is about to make a hames of broadcasting.</P>
      <P>We need a broadcasting review council to consider all these matters and to make calm and detached recommendations as the basis for a decision.  We should not take decisions &mdash; in the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; by short cuts which are a recipe for disaster. The problem is that more short cuts have been taken since the Minister made that admission.  It has now got to the stage where the debate is not about the future of broadcasting but of saving face and showing that the Government will stand firm in the face of any opposition. That is what they think but they are a weak Government who cannot acknowledge that they made a mistake. I predict that, as a result of the hames which has been made of this in the past four months by his denials, amendments, addendums and amendments to addendums, we will, within a year, be back in the House with more legislation in the area of broadcasting to try to set right many of the unforced errors contained in the Minister's proposals, amended or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A central part of this proposal is that groups with a legitimate interest should be consulted so that their point of view would be heard.  Their views do not necessarily have to be accepted in full but they should be heard.  However, most of the interest groups did not have that opportunity, apart from the national newspapers.  For a long time, the national newspapers have been calling for a levelling of the playing pitch in relation to funding in advertising.  As Minister, I met them on several occasions and the then Taoiseach and Minister for Finance also met them.  In response to their case we made a start at levelling the playing pitch where it counted by reducing the VAT rate on newspaper coverage charge from <Col N="1232" /> 18 per cent to 10 per cent.  Our newspapers largely depend on the advertising pool &mdash; so do RTE &mdash; but they are also in direct competition with British based newspapers just as RTE are in direct competition with British based broadcasting. If we want to level the playing pitch in relation to our newspapers we should address the question of VAT because, notwithstanding the improvements brought about by the last Government in relation to VAT, our newspapers still carry a 10 per cent VAT rate on their cover charge whereas the United Kingdom based newspapers are zero rated, which gives them a 10 per cent advantage.</P>
    <P>Moreover, advertising in Britain carries a standard 15 per cent VAT rate and in this country the rate is 23 per cent.  Our newspapers are at a double disadvantage. Prior to 1985 they carried a rate of 23 per cent on cover charge and advertising so one significant step was taken to eliminate this discrepancy.  It would greatly assist Irish newspapers if it was Government policy that within three, four or five years, the VAT rate would be changed in a way which would mean that Irish newspapers would not be at a disadvantage compared with their British competitors.  That is a very reasonable proposal because, at present, our newspapers are at an enormous disadvantage compared to the British based newspapers.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I tabled a question in relation to VAT on newspapers and advertising generally and I asked what it would cost to zero rate VAT on newspaper cover charges and to bring the VAT on newspaper advertising down to 10 per cent.</P>

Undoubtedly, newspapers have a very direct interest in this matter.

      <P>I know but it would not preclude the Broadcasting Council from making recommendations in respect of that.  It was felt that Irish broadcasting or newspapers were at a competitive disadvantage with their competitors across the Irish Sea.  This is one of the points that a broadcasting council should and would look at.  Irish newspapers have to compete with British newspapers, which have a far more beneficial tax regime and RTE and Irish broadcasting generally have to compete <Col N="1234" /> with &mdash; in the main &mdash; United Kingdom based broadcasting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A broadcasting council would look at this issue in great detail. I was making the point that all interest groups should be consulted but that the only one which was consulted were the national newspapers who have a very legitimate interest in the matter.  It is my contention that any detached analysis will show that the newspapers will not benefit to any serious extent from the proposals before us and that there is a problem with the newspapers which should be addressed.  However, it is certainly not being addressed in this Bill and it would be far better to refer these matters to a Broadcasting Council of the kind proposed in this amendment which could also look at other questions, as proposed in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I hope that even if the Minister wants to proceed with the substantive proposals in the Bill in relation to capping etc. which I think is a dreadful mistake, he will accept the principle of setting up a broadcasting council.  It is now timely. He has asked why I did not set one up in 1982 of 1983 when I became Minister. It was only eight years then since the previous review body had been set up.  It is now 16 years; a further eight years have elapsed and it is time for an overall review of broadcasting and how it impinges on other aspects of Irish life.  I hope the Minister will accept the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can accept the main thrust of Deputy Mitchell's amendment, there are a few points I would like to put to him which I hope he will clarify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the amendment is that &ldquo;The Minister shall appoint a review body to be known as the Broadcasting Policy Review Council (in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Broadcasting Council&rsquo;).&rdquo;  The method of appointment or nomination <Col N="1235" /> will have to be considered in view of the heated exchanges we have had over the last couple of weeks and the counter accusations regarding cronyism and clienteleism. The amendment does not address the method of appointment or nomination.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the Irish language. Is the Deputy referring to the Gaeltacht communities?  Is there provision in his amendment for representation of the Gaeltacht communities?</P>
    <P>The amendment asks for an annual report but there is no provision in the amendment for a debate on these reports.  One extra report on the shelves is of no use unless it has some teeth and leads to some form of discussion.  The Deputy's amendment takes us no closer to that, I am afraid.  The Minister said that at the moment we have reports on various things which have never been discussed stacked four or five feet high in various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to standards of violence and various types of violence. What precisely is the Deputy saying?  Is he referring to pornography?  When the Deputy refers to news content is he referring to current affairs?  What precisely does he hope to achieve?</P>
    <P>The first paragraph of the amendment sets out precisely what the Deputy wants. He wants a review council.  I can say he has been consistent in this regard in that he devoted some of his party's Private Members' time to the setting up of this review body for the purpose of producing a White Paper on broadcasting.  This was not successful.  I will say for the Minister that he has been consistent in this regard. In his speech on 10 February 1987 on the Sound Broadcasting Bill he again voiced resistance to the setting up of a commission or review body to discuss broadcasting. In view of the many doubts that have been expressed regarding the direction in which we are going in the area of broadcasting, it is absolutely essential that such a body be set up and I ask the Minister to consider that further.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely satisfied to go down <Col N="1236" /> the road of this amendment but I agree in principle with what Deputy Mitchell is trying to achieve.  I question his methods and there are some points I hope he will clarify.  During this debate Deputy Mitchell has mentioned his speech in Cork on 12 February.  I am at complete loss as to what the Deputy said on that occasion and I would appreciate even at this late stage getting a copy of that speech.  There has been a great deal of reference as to what the Minister said in Cork and what Deputy Mitchell said in Cork.  While I am aware of some things the Minister said on that occasion I am not familiar with what Deputy Mitchell said.  This puts me at a slight disadvantage despite the fact that it happened on my own doorstep. I hope the Deputy will give me a copy of that speech so that even in the final hours of this debate I will have an opportunity to examine it.</P>
    <P>Subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of the Deputy's amendment refer to the composition, duties and terms of reference of this body and merely support his call for the setting up of a review body.  The Deputy mentioned during this debate the fact that he was expelled from this House. On that occasion I was as annoyed as he was.  I had put down a priority question and had he allowed me go ahead with that question without interruption he would not have been expelled from the House.  I want to put on the record that it was a question I put down and the Deputy pulled the rug from under my feet and crashed into my priority question, and, as a result of being unruly he was asked to leave the House.</P>
    <P>On the question of zero VAT rating for Irish newspapers, we would like to aspire to that but the Deputy is making the wrong comparison.  He is making a comparison with the zero rating for newspapers in Britain.  You cannot do that in isolation because other sides of industry and business in this country are subject to VAT rating.  You cannot pick out one segment of business and say that by virtue of the fact that it qualified for zero rating in Britain it would qualify for zero rating here.  That will create an imbalance.  The Deputy has not spelled out why we should <Col N="1237" /> pick out the newspaper industry in particular and give it preferential treatment. Of course I would welcome total abolition of VAT.</P>
    <P>I will support the amendment.  There is a need for a review body or a review council, not necessarily on the lines suggested by Deputy Mitchell.  I think there is a need for discussion.  Despite the fact that the Minister, as far back as February 1987, said he was not in favour of establishing the body, what has happened in the interim has proved that there is an urgent need for such a body.  Let me refer to the speech the Minister made introducing two elements into the Broadcasting Act.  He was setting up the Independent Radio and Television Commission at that time.  What has happened since then proves there is a need for a debate, otherwise we will have a rehash of what we have had since 29 May of this year when the original Bill was circulated.  Since then, despite the best efforts of the Opposition, the Minister has stonewalled.  I was not surprised when I heard him say yesterday he was interested in cricket.  The way he has been stonewalling here for the past couple of weeks proves that he had no intention of hitting for a home run or a six &mdash; am I mixing something up?</P>

We would like to bring the Minister out of his cocoon in which he has spent the last couple of weeks. Despite the threat the Minister issued to me yesterday, I look forward to his coming out.  The Minister has been too quiet and that is not like him.  I would prefer if the Minister came at us so that at least we would have something to which we could respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like Deputy Mitchell to comment on some of my points and tell me <Col N="1238" /> precisely what he did say in my native city in February of this year because it is central to the whole debate at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which is very much in keeping with amendment No. 3 proposed by The Workers' Party on Committee Stage. Because the point was decided on Committee Stage I did not seek to put down an amendment in support of a commission on broadcasting on this Stage. The Minister does not feel that the time is right to respond to our propositions but I disagree with him and support the amendment.  Now is an opportune time to look again at the direction of broadcasting and the fundamental principles upon which we hope to develop it.</P>
      <P>We first argued this case in 1982.  I referred to Deputy De Rossa's statement then on our behalf and referred to it again during the debates in 1988.  I do not intend to go any further in relation to that.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Michael D. Higgins in regretting Deputy Mitchell's remark that we were opportunistic in suggesting that these amendments be taken together.  We agreed that the previous set of amendments be taken together.  I understand now that the consequence of taking the amendment together is that if the issue is lost, the consequential amendments based on it, amendments Nos. 9, 28, 30 and 50 in the Deputy's name will be lost as well, and we will not get to talk about some of the better features of the Deputy's overall scheme of things.  We had hoped to address some of the better concepts, such as consultation with the industries and the notion that the Commission would be the authority to draw up advertising standards.  We will not now be able to discuss those matters and that is a great pity.  However, we agreed to take the amendments together to aid Deputy Mitchell and not to be opportunistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept proposed in the amendment is an excellent one.  I support the amendments of my Front Bench colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, <Col N="1239" /> because never was there a time when a review body or a council in the whole area of communications or broadcasting was more needed.  Television has been totally transformed from what it was ten years ago and it will be again transformed in ten years time.  The reason for the transformation relates not so much to what appears on the screen.  The real revolution in broadcasting, particularly in television, relates to the development of communications.  Development in communications technology has been bewildering and it is mainly based on the satellites, in geo-stationary satellites with massive footprints and also in the development of fibre optics and computers. The best and most dramatic example of all the change that has taken place is the recent example of the World Cup where Packie Bonner stops a penalty and is seen in the remotest corner of the world.  That is the sort of transformation which is taking place and we have only started with this technology.</P>
      <P>We no longer have national frontiers in broadcasting.  There are no frontiers on the airwaves and this has a huge impact on us, something that should be the subject of consideration on an ongoing basis by a review body such as that suggested by Deputy Mitchell in his amendment.  We can no longer have a cosy arrangement controling our own viewing exclusively, because channels will continue to pour in from the sky where there are no frontiers.  It is essential therefore to have this review body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not talking about something static or traditional in television, for instance like the theatre which, despite changes in style and methods, is still basically the same.  Television is changing very swifely.  One of the major tasks of a review body would be to consider the proposition the Minister has before us now: do we or do we not need a third television channel?  Perhaps the review body would come down in favour of that and perhaps not.  The Minister has told us that there will be a third channel and has given us his opinion which in recent times has been shown to be wrong <Col N="1240" /> because the Minister has changed dramatically from the first proposition put before the House.  There is a fair indication to suggest that the Minister thinks that the opinion he put forward first is the right one.  We differ with all of them. This is the kind of thing to which the experts on a review body could apply their minds and they could help out with the thinking in the Department and the thinking of the Minister, so that we can get it right.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the purpose of this Bill is to have greater competition. Is it necessary to have a third television channel?  Is that the best way to go about getting greater competition?  That would be a matter for the review body.  Will greater competition improve the standards, as the Minister wishes?  It will not automatically.  If the Minister wants to look at an example of what competition does, he should look at what it has done to the British tabloids.  The hectic competition there has not led to a new era of improved journalism, to new, greater, uplifting daily morning newspapers, unless one is the type of person who would regard the page three girls as being uplifting.  What we have in the tabloids is a competition of revelations and titillations of one sort or another, not what the distinguished owners of these papers set about doing, but what competition for a very finite market, as far as advertising is concerned, has done.  They are following where the greatest revenue will be for them.  They did not set out to do this, but it is the result of intense competition. I am not saying that television competition will be the same but it is something that a review body might examine. Greater competition in television could bring us competition not where the Minister wants it, but in soap operas all shown at the same time and based on whatever is the vogue of the day.  Television stations do not want to cater even for their own soap junkies.  All they are interested in is TAM ratings; what registers with their advertising.</P>
    <P>The Minister is obviously looking for greater competition in the areas of news and current affairs, the areas where we <Col N="1241" /> can give our own distinct personality to our television station, where we can push out the frontiers of broadcasting.  That is the area in which the Minister is obviously interested but is competition, the kind of competition that would be provided by TV3, the answer?  Perhaps it is but I would like that to be discussed at enormous length because of its impact on the future of television.  There is another possibility.  The Minister might have considered setting up an independent news and broadcasting service for the existing channel two.  Perhaps there are lots of objections to that.  That may not be the answer but it is a matter I would like a commission to consider.</P>
    <P>With TV3 there will be greater competition for limited resources and my opinion is that we may end up with two mediocre services. If we have mediocre services the viewing public will operate their remote controls to switch off from the Irish channels and tune in to the satellite channels or UTV.  If that occurs the limited amount of advertising available to any Irish station will go.  The Minister has told us that RTE will always remain the dominant service but I wonder if that will be the case.  I would like to think that they will remain the dominant service because as a sovereign nation we need a strong public service broadcasting voice. Have the BBC, with their strong financial support from licence fees, remained the dominant television station?  Some might think they have but I do not think so. It may be that RTE may not receive permission to broadcast a major event like an All-Ireland final.  There is nothing more English than a test match and we should bear in mind that this year Sky channel televised the test match from the West Indies.  They did so because they were able to up the ante and buy the television rights and there is no guarantee that RTE will continue to be in a position to buy the rights to major sporting and public events.</P>
    <P>For the Minister to say that RTE will remain the dominant service will not be very encouraging for TV3.  In effect he is saying to the new channel that he will <Col N="1242" /> help them along the line but that he will not permit them to become the dominant station.  That does not represent a very good start for any enterprise, whether public or private.  I fear that we will not get an improvement in news and current affairs or public affairs broadcasting areas.  We will have competition at the lower level and very often in order to attract viewers stations lower their standards. That may be the effect of competition and it is something that a commission could examine if such a body was given broad terms of reference as suggested by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The general feeling was that Century Radio would be successful but that has not turned out to be the case.  I wish Century Radio well and I hope they survive but if more thought was given to establishing the station I do not think they would be struggling today.  We are talking about something that is of great importance to our listeners and viewers and, therefore, to our lifestyle.  Most of us like to watch television and the programmes produced are important to us. The Minister's changes will not be the only ones that will take place in regard to television.  Technology will change enormously and a Government some years hence will have to make changes to meet the demands of the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to public service broadcasting but I do not think his ideas for 2FM represent the best approach. The Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Justice, may be interested to know that I was responsible for the launching of &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; in the sixties.  I understand that it is the second longest running programme on RTE.</P>

      <P>It is an example of public service broadcasting being put over in a <Col N="1243" /> popular form.  It has proved to be of general interest and has succeeded in getting across a message.  That should be the approach to public service broadcasting. Leaving aside the controversy about the Minister's proposals in regard to 2FM, I do not think there is any point in having excellent public service programmes crushed together on one station because people will not view them.  There is little point in having an excellent message if there are no viewers.  Such a matter could be considered by a commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's amendment deals with the Irish Language.  As far as a proposed Teilifís na Gaeltachta is concerned we may have missed the boat with the launching of TV3 and the provisions in the Bill for the capping of RTE advertising. I presume that up to now RTE would not come up front as far as such a channel is concerned but it appears that they have resources to set up such a channel without the need to seek an increase in the licence fee.  However, that opportunity will go with the passing of the Bill because of the capping on advertising.  It is unfortunate that we have lost the last opportunity of establishing Teilifís na Gaeltachta without the need to depend on a subsidy by the public.  If that station was established through revenue generated within RTE the public would not object to it and we would have a very fine Irish language channel.</P>
      <P>Countries with minority languages cater for them and the best example nearest our shores is the Welsh television service.  It is well financed and is doing an excellent job as far as the Welsh language is concerned.  It is proving very attractive and pulling in an audience who would normally switch off from such a station.  A commission along the lines suggested by Deputy Mitchell could get involved in such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may disagree with many of the points I have raised but he should bear in mind that, like others, I am putting forward my ideas as to what is best for broadcasting.  I accept that it is being done in a political atmosphere and that as a result it may appear that I am taking <Col N="1244" /> up an entrenched position and that because of the Minister's attitude there will not be any give and take.  It is for that reason that a commission could act as an arbitrator on the ideas put forward during the course of the debate.  If such a body was established and considered the suggestions put forward we would have better broadcasting.  The difficulties that have arisen over the Minister's Bill, the enormous public attention it has attracted and the emotions it has raised, are a reflection of the extent to which television in particular, and radio, are part of our lives.  We should proceed making use of the advice available to us. A review body along the lines suggested by Deputy Mitchell would be the ideal vehicle to deal with this process.  I strongly recommend Deputy Mitchell's amendment and if the Minister cannot accept it at this stage he might consider doing so in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief at this stage because on Committee Stage when the concept of a broadcasting council was proposed we had an opportunity of putting our views forward.  The Minister responded but he did not see merit in the proposal.  The Labour Party can support the amendment in terms of its principle.  However, I will have considerable difficulty in agreeing with the proposed terms of reference of the proposed council.  As has been said, we will also have a difficulty in accepting paragraph (ii) which would confine representation on the council to, for example, representatives of the Irish language. Quite frankly, there are many groups involved in the revival movement interested in the survival of the language but these differ when it comes to the survival of the Gaeltachts.  While I do not want to get involved in the dispute on that issue, I wish to state that I was greatly disappointed that the Minister was unwilling to reply on Committee Stage, apart altogether from the political differences between us, to long and detailed statements on broadcasting policy and a list of broadcasting issues raised by Deputy McCartan and myself.  Indeed, <Col N="1245" /> one of the Minister's responses to a number of issues at the heart of broadcasting was just three sentences long.</P>
      <P>I recall prefacing my remarks on the proposed broadcasting policy review council by stating that, irrespective of who was Minister for Communications, these issues have to be faced and that everyone would benefit if these matters were clarified by a council adequately composed.  Like the flat-earthers who said that the time for discussing physics ended some years ago, the Minister's argument that the time for discussing broadcasting policy ceased in the eighties, and dropped dead when he took over, is unsustainable.  This is a very unfortunate attitude to adopt.  The Minister is well aware that there was a time when he said he did not want talking shops, that he was a man of action and so forth. Many Popes held such a view and I have no doubt that the ghost of Gallileo will visit the Minister to ask him explain the consequences of his actions.</P>
      <P>One of the issues the Minister chose not to respond to is the impact of the satellite stations on European broadcasting. I recall asking him questions about the current pressures on the EBU, its relationship with Eastern Europe and on the statement from the Council of the EBU in which they stated that they were forced into the marketplace to bid against satellite operators for the rights to cover international events and the effect this would have on their ability not to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> charge for subscribers to their services.  The concept that membership established an entitlement was a powerful one in international broadcasting but this has changed since the advent of satellite broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I have also made reference to the impact of what is called in shorthand Japanese hardware and American software on satellite capacity, the question of programming content, the nature of material sold internationally and on the near monopoly, far from the free market, enjoyed by producers of &ldquo;soaps&rdquo;, for example, in North America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also failed to address the <Col N="1246" /> question of developments in cable services. In this instance, we have broadcating issues in competition with other aspects of telecommunications development. It is possible to use cable in a number of commercial activities which come into conflict with its use for broadcasting at certain points.  The Minister also failed to comment on the usage of MMDS.  After all, as the Minister said himself, he is breaking new ground and is the first Irish Minister to introduce MMDS as a national system.  However, the cold water of reason flowed all around us for a while afterwards and the Minister's bullish attitude seems to have evaporated like snow on a sunny morning. I am listing here issues which a broadcasting council could and should have looked at.  However, the Minister decided that he was not going to comment on the questions of satellite, cable and MMDS and we need not be concerned about them.  I prefaced my remarks by stating that irrespective of who was Minister for Communications he has to take up the technical aspects of broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>Some other issues raised are purely political.  At one stage in the debate we moved from the concept of plurality of choice, a programming issue, to the question of ownership, control and access which has not been addressed.  Let me say, with respect, that it is this rather ignorant confusion over the dimensions of ownership, control, access, programming and editorial activity which has led to the current chaos in broadcasting. Those who imagined that they had money to fire at broadcasting lost sight of the fundamental nature of broadcasting which is that a particular professionalism and ethos is established over time which results in good programming content. As, unfortunately, many people have learned in Ireland and elsewhere, it is possible to have a great deal of money to invest in broadcasting, but because of inadequate or insensitive, innovative programming, not to capture an audience.</P>
    <P>In relation to broadcasting on both radio and television, advertisers will come back to tell you that you can fire all <Col N="1247" /> the money you like at it and find the most exotic investors but unless people listen or watch they are not interested in purchasing advertising.  We have no great ideological problems with these propositions. However, the Minister is not willing to tease them out or answer specific questions in this House on programming and the differences between having a range of choices and the question of ownership.  Indeed, he has gone so far as to say that there is no point in having any council to discuss these issues. It is, as I said, as if the world had stopped. This is a dangerous policy to adopt.</P>
    <P>While I am unhappy at the way in which the Irish language is handled in the amendment, where it has been included after &ldquo;good taste, violence, sex...&rdquo; I am willing to accept the wording so as not to defeat the concept.  What we are now witnessing is a total abandonment of the right of the people of the Gaeltachts to have a television station located in the Gaeltacht which meet their own needs and provides a national service for anyone interested in the language.  There is no point in imagining that this is not the position.  As anyone remotely interested in broadcasting knows, this legislation marks a complete departure from any generic concept of broadcasting, that the people should have a say in exercising choices and have sovereignty over what is carried.  This is being sacrificed not only in terms of a free marketplace but a regulated, manipulated marketplace.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to listenership surveys for radio but, interestingly, he has not referred to any survey which indicates that an overwhelming or significant minority of the public have said they want independent, commercial and privately owned television.  I ask the Minister to produce evidence which shows that there is a significant group of people asking for a TV3 channel.  I would love to see the results of a survey, like. the listenership one which has so often been pushed at us, as to how the public would feel about a further concept, that <Col N="1248" /> is, that what they expressed no great preference for will happen regardless but that it will happen at the cost of a station for which they had accountability and which was developed in an ethos of public service broadcasting.  Where is the survey data to support that proposition?  There is no point in continuing to repeat ourselves because there are so many issues of a broadcasting policy kind that are being ignored now that I feel it is a real disservice to the public and to this House.</P>
    <P>In many ways the entire anti-national thrust of legislation such as this is distressing. It is as if there is to be nothing for which we might have a féin mhias any more.  The whole question of Teilifís na Gaeltachta has been an insult.  Having been involved and having met a meitheal of Teilifís na Gaeltachta very early on &mdash; I was on the Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge made up of Members of both Houses when they came and gave evidence &mdash; and I watched the progress on that question, what I find distasteful is people coming along to the Gaeltacht now like Keepers of Indians, spattering out their few words of Irish, when knowing full well as Members who support this legislation will, that this was the week in which the final blow was given to the Gaeltacht areas on a fundamental aspect of rights. The reality is &mdash; and I represent here the largest Gaeltacht &mdash; that the communicative order of a community contains both what is in print and what is broadcast.  There has been a battle by the people of the Gaeltacht to have their own paper.  This Government can answer a question to me to say that there is no newspaper or journal produced in the Gaeltacht; it is written for them rather like the case of the reservations.</P>
    <P>There has been a successful Raidio na Gaeltachta.  The ability of the Gaeltacht communities to survive depended on undoing the incredible damage of a visual medium that was in English and in competition with an aural medium that was through Irish.  We begged the Government who had a kind of superficial commitment to the Irish language &mdash; at least they never put it into its shroud and buried it officially &mdash; that they might <Col N="1249" /> listen to these arguments.  So far as the Irish language is mentioned in this amendment as something which the broadcasting council might give consideration to, with respect to the proposer, I believe it will be too late.  The fact is that this is the death knell in relation to any Gaeltacht-located television service. I am in no doubt whatsoever about that. The language and the people of the Gaeltacht and their questions of communication were buried slowly by reports.  I have to say this and I wish the Minister was here; it is my hope that before this Government goes out of office that the Aire na Gaeltachta will one day come in and stand up here and speak in Irish, English, French or whatever language he likes, justifying what he has presided over in relation to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  It has been a scandal, a source of shame and a disgrace. The special report came up from the meitheal, it went to RTE and from there to the Department of Communications and finally to the Department of the Gaeltacht.  A different range of Airí Stáit stand up and they all say: níl aon chinneadh déanta fós.  There will be no decision to be taken after this legislation is enacted and we want to be very clear on that.</P>
    <P>When all the posturing about the Irish language is over and I have spoken more Irish in the House than most Members. I would say that it has been a matter of struggling for your rights here.  I have seen people depart quickly from the Chamber when one begins, in the Irish language.  That is a minor insult that a representative of the Gaeltacht has to put up with in this House but it is nothing in comparison to the deprivation of the rights of the people of the Gaeltacht to have even the possibility of a station that would be located in the Gaeltacht and that would carry the Irish language.  Politeness stops me from telling you what you can do with your two hours on RTE 2 when you have in fact decided what is down the road.  The Minister will stand up and tell us he will impose two hours on RTE 2.  I suspect that one of the prime motivations in that will be to try to make <Col N="1250" /> the station unattractive so that TV 3 can mop up some advertising while RTE goes on with the obligation of keeping the hypocrisy in relation to the language going.</P>
    <P>What has been happening is an absolute outrage.  I am weary of making concessions in this House on this matter.  We have rights under the Constitution but I suggest that, following the enactment of this Bill, we tear out of it all the pages that have pieces in Irish.  There is no commitment on the other side of the House by any serious person in relation to one jot or iota of the language.  That is why they put in a silent mummy as Aire na Gaeltachta.  I wish he would come down and speak in my constituency some time and explain what he is doing.</P>
    <P>There are a few minor points I would like to make.  Here we have the sheer anti-intellectualism of opposing the idea of a review body or council.  We must be in a singular position in this country in relation to this.  What is so unique about Ireland that every time somebody has the capacity to offer alternative ideas about the future of broadcasting, it is a talking shop?  Is it in the cumanns that the intellectual hard work goes on so that by the time the Minister comes up with a proposal, or has weaved it together, all discourse must stop?  These are the people who mouth on about authoritarianism being under challenge in the world, in Eastern Europe and in other places.  This idea that you must not, should not, will not have anything like a council or a review body is nonsense.  I am not saying anything I did not say &mdash; as Deputy Mitchell knows &mdash; in my opposition to his proposals at different times which were on the basis of having a White Paper and a council etc.  He would acknowledge that.  These are not views I have had in relation to this Minister. It is damaging to broadcasting to do as the Minister is doing.  The idea is that decisions will be taken by the Minister and by the Department.  The attitude is &ldquo;what would the public have to say anyhow?&rdquo; that is arrogant and authoritarian. To leave the present Minister out of it for a moment, any Minister <Col N="1251" /> who opposes the possibilities of people discussing broadcasting must be judged on that.</P>
    <P>We have to make progress on these amendments.  I appeal again to the Minister not to simply dismiss the idea of a council; there would be no point in that at this stage because we are talking about the future of broadcasting.  There is no point in saying, &ldquo;when you were there,&rdquo; or &ldquo;when I was there&rdquo; or &ldquo;when I was in Cork and you were in Belfast&rdquo;, or wherever all this was.  At the end of the day the issue very simply is whether there is a case for a broadcasting review body or a broadcasting council.  It seems to me that there is a case for such a council or body if we are talking about the future orderly development of broadcasting &mdash; whatever may survive of it.  In that sense we in the Labour Party can support the concept of a broadcasting council, whatever our reservations about the ordering of the terms of reference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to briefly make a contribution on amendment No. 8.  The need for it is obvious in the sense that the legislation we have before us is extremely controversial and divisive.  If there was a broadcasting body or council in operation many of the views which have been put so vociferously in the last number of weeks would have been made known before hand.  I question the Minister on what advice he took before he presented the Bill?  Did he talk to anybody?  Did he have advice?  Does he have advisers who, from time to time, give him some background information on what he proposes to do?  It appears that this is not the case and that he sprung this Bill on all of us. What we have been learning over the past few weeks should have been known long before the Minister decided to put this Bill before the House.  It is extremely divisive.  Every day Deputies in the House, including the Minister, are getting memoranda from various organisations and groups spelling out from their point of view the damage this legislation will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> I had a letter dated 10 July, this morning from the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, on the same theme as much of the other literature we have received, pointing out quite clearly the implications of the Minister's proposals. Of course it must be said that it contains their opinion but the Minister will refute it entirely, leaving most of us in the House confused because, in the midst of all this controversy, we are not sure who is right and who is wrong.  It would appear that the Minister was ill-informed, ill-advised.  Obviously he did not talk to the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, to RTE or to anybody involved in the industry.  He jumped this whole business on us.  Then he found the whole world collapsing on his head, began to change from day to day, to back pedal, flounder; indeed every time one reads a paper one sees something new with regard to what the Minister intends doing.  This morning &mdash; so the newspapers tell us &mdash; it is to be a reprieve for the RTE people for a few months.  Tomorrow morning it will be something else and the day after yet something new again.  It is a shambles from beginning to end.  If there were a broadcasting council it is unlikely that such would happen.  The Minister would then have available to him much advice, background information and would not make the silly mistakes he has made here.</P>
    <P>On the very strong views expressed by the previous Deputy on the subject of the Irish language, surely there is need to examine this matter in great detail in terms of the times in which we live. Everybody in the country today would contend that the Irish language is more or less dead, that when we study it, we are studying something from our past not at all relevant to today.  The undoubted national aspiration, that of the Government and of all Members would be that the Irish language should survive, be vibrant and relative to today.  Yet nobody, including the Minister for Education, has taken any steps to endeavour to take an overview of that subject.  I might point to a question Deputy Bruton has tabled on the Order <Col N="1253" /> Paper for tomorrow which I discussed with him &mdash; that is an attempt to internationalise the language, letting our people see that Gaelic is used in many parts of the world.  Anybody who has travelled around Scotland and observed the posters appearing in villages there &mdash; written in Scots Gaelic &mdash; will realise that we can read and understand them, since Scots Gaelic is quite similar to our language. There are various other parts of the world in which Gaelic is still a spoken language.  Why cannot we have a new vibrant approach to the overall teaching of Irish, its televising, interlinking all the communities who use it?  Surely the proposed broadcasting council would, if so requested, examine that matter.  If such an enlightened approach was adopted, I have no doubt that the use of Irish in schools, on television, in the Gaeltacht areas and in daily discussions between people would become more relevant, have a new motivation and new dignity attaching to it.  I hazard a guess that the Minister, in the preparation of this Bill, sought no advice on that matter either. Rather it would appear he did something he felt was the thing to do and that was it.  It is essential that the contents of amendment No. 8 be incorporated in this botched Bill.  Indeed I commend Deputy Jim Mitchell for having tabled it.</P>
    <P>I want to take up with the Minister also the question of illegal broadcasting.  We had all been under the impression that illegal broadcasting was something of the past.</P>

      <P>With regard to paragraph (5) of amendment No. 8 I contend the remit should include an urgent review of existing legislation.  If it my view and has been my experience that the legislation aimed at controlling illegal broadcasting has been totally ineffective.  When in Monaghan I can switch on my radio and listen at any time to an illegal station broadcasting from around the village of Tedavnet north of Monaghan town.  I brought this matter to the attention of the Minister's office and of everybody concerned some months ago.  Indeed I have had discussions with some of the Minister's staff in this regard but, can one believe it, in the days in which we live, they are unable to put this person off the air.  This means there is a serious flaw in the existing legislation.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the example I have given.  I am sure his office has been bombarded by other representatives of my area about this illegal broadcasting problem.  It is a disgrace and should not be allowed continue.  Of course, &ldquo;Northern Sound&rdquo; has been on the air for the past month.  Yet that other illegal station <Col N="1256" /> is competing with it for much needed revenue and listenership.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen that there is a grave need for a review of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister says there is no urgency about the finalisation of this legislation until some time in the autumn, I would urge him to take this Bill, tear it up, throw it away and, in the interim, assemble all of the people who would have a constructive input in overall broadcasting policy here to form some type of <i>ad hoc</i> policy review council to examine all of the important questions raised inside and outside this House since this Bill was produced.  The Minister should give them three or four months to examine in detail all the many policy issues that have arisen.  If he did so I am certain that, at the end of the day, we would be afforded an opportunity to put together a Bill whose provisions would be far-reaching, effecting fundamental changes in the present proposals but developing the broadcasting industry rather than what is happening at present, in that we are told daily that what the Minister is doing is utterly regressive and bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support amendment No. 8 because what we should have done first of all was put into practice the proposals contained therein.  Broadcasting, the dissemination of news, entertainment and so on has progressed by way of a quantum leap over the past 5 to 10 years.  Ten years ago the number of radio wave bands that could be utilised and the radial distribution of television signals were greatly restricted.  We did not then have ultra high frequency &mdash; UHF &mdash; for television transmission.  In the meantime there has been this quantum leap forward in the whole technology of distribution, and this has opened up a completely new scenario in this country as, indeed, it has all over the world.  This country is today being penetrated by radio and television signals, mostly television signals, because of the use of satellites. Satellites were the major leap forward in the last half decade or so in the distribution of television and radio <Col N="1257" /> signals and this has global application. No longer has one to live within sight of a television transmitter.  A satellite dish looks down on half of the planet earth and can distribute signals and messages in this way.</P>
      <P>We have had a great deal of legislation. Two years ago we had the local radio Bill and the Wireless Telegraphy Bill running alongside of that, and there has been other legislation throughout the seventies. None of them have ever been able to fundamentally address the totally new scene in broadcasting that we are faced with.  This, of course is more piecemeal legislation brought in by the Minister which takes no real account of what is taking place in the world all around us. Very wisely, our spokesperson has brought forward this as what we should first have in place.  If we are to have new legislation in broadcasting for radio and television, we should devise it with the information that we would get from a council of this kind.  It would obviously be a council of wise persons because it would be made up of all the people who have interests or are interested in broadcasting, whether it is people involved in the distribution of the signals, the science of distributing the signals, or the consumers. We would appeal to the Minister to take this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area is changing so rapidly. A friend of mine who works in the telecommunications area was able to tell me recently that microwave distribution is rapidly approaching obsolesence; that there are now new techniques by which a whole range of television and radio signals can be received down one's telephone line, and that will be the technology of the future.  There are technologies that are even more futuristic than those.  There is no area that has gone ahead in such leaps and bounds because there was such an amount of funding of the scientific inquiry into the whole area which went along with the space programmes. From that we have developed this marvellous technology and the people who do research in the area say that we will continue making new discoveries which will shrink the world, if <Col N="1258" /> one likes, more and more because of the distribution of television and radio signals.  That has a profound impact upon us culturally, socially and every other way and that would be all within the remit of this broadcasting council, if the Minister would allow it to be put in place.</P>
    <P>It would be a saving grace of the terrible controversy which has surrounded the enactment of this Bill in this House if this were accepted by the Minister. Surely this legislation has got itself a really bad reputation.  It will be seen very much as the Minister's legislation.  People used the word &ldquo;vindictive&rdquo; about it.  If it is to go through in its present form, with all its blemishes, its reputation will just be bad.  The Minister can do something about saving his reputation.  We would say to the Minister that he should scrap the whole thing, but obviously he is determined to go ahead.  The Minister can however do a lot to save its reputation by accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me begin with the point made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  I fully recognise the commitment of Deputy Higgins to the Irish language and the development of our culture.  He has spent many years representing the people of the largest Gaeltacht in the country. He has been involved for many years in the support of Irish theatre, Irish music and art.  He has worked on various committees within this House and elsewhere promoting the language and I would be less than frank or honest if I did not admit that in this House.  He is wrong, however, about the effect this Bill will have on any proposal for the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  I would reject his proposition that it is the death knell of the Teilifís na Gaeltachta proposal.  That is very far from what is in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cotter referred to an article in the paper this morning about the proposal to extend the start time of this legislation, 1 October, and said that it would mean an additional £2 million for RTE this year.  Deputy Cotter actually voted against it last night with Fine Gael, Labour and The Workers' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Nealon's point about <Col N="1259" /> whether or not we should have TV3, that decision has been taken by the Oireachtas in the Radio and Television Act 1988, passed by the Dáil and the Seanad and providing for a television programme service. He said that this review council that is proposed should decide whether or not we should have TV3.  That is already decided by an Act of the Oireachtas.  He said that in some way TV3 would result in a reduction of standards.  I have said before, and it is worth repeating, that in establishing the radio and television service it was decided by the Independent Radio and Television Commission that the Commission shall ensure that the television programme service provided under this Act shall in its programming (a) be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the various elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish the culture and, in particular, for the Irish language; (b) uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression; (c) have regard to the need for the formation of public awareness and understanding of the values and traditions of countries other than the State, including in particular those of such countries which are members of the European Community; (d) include a reasonable proportion of news and current affairs.  It was also decided by the IRTC that the television programme service contractor shall comply with any requirements of the commission in respect of such matters; and that for the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the commission shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service: (a) is produced in the State or in another member state of the European Community; and (b) is devoted to original programme material produced therein by persons other than <Col N="1260" /> the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisation.</P>
    <P>These are exactly the same terms of reference under which RTE operate their programming with the addition, in relation to a reasonable proportion, of programming services being produced outside of the main broadcaster.  There has been no suggestion that the terms of reference under which RTE has been established has in any way affected standards. On the contrary, it is generally and rightfully recognised that RTE have provided, and will continue to provide, the people of this country with a superb standard of radio and television programming. It is exactly the same terms of reference, extended as I have said, under which the independent stations, set up under the Radio and Television Act, 1988, operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon spoke about the national independent station.  In the course of the debate in this House it has been recognised by all sides that the new service of the independent national station has been excellent, and various tributes were paid to it from all sides of the House.  The Deputy wondered whether there was a need for this type of service. The public decided, prior to its establishment, that there is a need for these services.  At that time we had the talking shop referred to by Deputy Higgins, but no action was taken.  There were over 70 pirate stations in this country and there was plenty of talk, commissions and reports but no action.  The public decided they wanted choice and they were listening to these 70 stations, just as they are now listening to the independent stations which have been established since the 1988 Act came into force.  There are now about 20 such stations and there is another going on the air on Friday in south Wicklow.  A survey published two weeks ago shows that approximately one million people, over 40 per cent of the radio listening population, are listening to the independent stations at some time during the day.  That indicates there is a need for choice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to chaos in Irish broadcasting.  I can assure the <Col N="1261" /> Deputy there was chaos on our airwaves but we attempted to do something about that in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, which allowed for the establishment of independent television and radio, and this Bill is one further step in that direction.  I reject the accusation that there is an anti-national thrust to this legislation.  On the contrary, what this legislation and the 1988 Act are doing is establishing choice for Irish people, coming from Irish-produced sources.  At present what we have &mdash; and it is rapidly developing &mdash; is the phenomenon of the satellite stations and the choice and range that are available on satellite, all coming from foreign sources, without an Irish ethos.  I believe strongly it is essential that we would have at least one further TV station which would have an Irish thrust, with Irish news, current affairs and programming produced by Irish programme makers, which together with RTE 1 and Network 2 would help to balance the influence of the stations coming in on terrestrial and by satellite.  It is vitally important that there be a strong Irish influence, and I reject the idea of the Bill being in any way anti-national.</P>
    <P>As far as the future of MMDS is concerned, the MMDS licences to cover the whole country have been allocated and a number of the contractors are already putting the operation in place.  Later sections of the Bill refer to MMDS and assistance to the MMDS operators.  I can assure the House there is no talking shop involved.  What we are doing is developing a strong national broadcasting sector, not just in a State-owned form but with a diverse ownership and a range and choice of programming.  The people have decided that is what they want and that is what they are going to listen to.</P>
    <P>Depty Mitchell referred to an editorial in an engineering magazine and talked about the first-class broadcasting service provided by RTE.  I agree fully that it is, and will remain a first-class broadcasting service, and there is nothing in this legislation that will in any way affect the first-class broadcasting service of RTE.  It is not, and never was the intention of this Government to in any way damage RTE. <Col N="1262" /> What is intended by the Government is that the people will have choice available to them from an Irish source rather than from outside sources.</P>
    <P>As regard my handling of this Bill, the Deputy cannot have it both ways.  On the one hand, I am accused of being dogmatic, that I come in, listen, make short replies and do not take on board any of the points made, while, on the other hand, I am accused of speaking in the House, listening to what has been said, introducing another set of amendments and then a further set.  I have been listening and taking note of the points made in this House and outside it by various representative groups, whether by congress, charities, organisations or various other groups who have legitimate interests in the development of broadcasting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a number of these points on board.  You cannot stand up and accuse me of being dogmatic and refusing to listen while at the same time, when I do make changes, accuse me of flip-flopping around in relation to the legislation.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the amendment is that there should be a review group to consider such matters as good taste and so on.  I assure the Deputy that the world did not stand still the day he, Fine Gael and Labour left Government.  Most of the points the Deputy is concerned with are included in the European Convention on Transfrontier Television and the EC Directive on the co-ordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in member states concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities.  For example, the Deputy asked that the whole question of good taste be looked at.  I will quote from Article 22 of the Council Directive which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that television broadcasts by broadcasters under their <Col N="1263" /> jurisdiction do not include programmes which might seriously impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular those that involve pornography or gratuitous violence. This provision shall extend to other programmes which are likely to impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, except where it is ensured, by selecting the time of the broadcast or by any technical measure, that minors in the area of transmission will not normally hear or see such broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Member States shall also ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.</P>
    <P>All of these points have been covered in the EC Directive and the European Convention.  I will quote from article 7 of the Convention in relation to the same item which states under the heading, Responsibilities of the broadcaster:</P>
    <P> 1.  All items of programme services, as concerns their presentation and content, shall respect the dignity of the human being and the fundamental rights of others.</P>
    <P>In particular, they shall not:</P>
    <P>a.  be indecent and in particular contain pornography;</P>
    <P>b.  give undue prominence to violence or be likely to incite to racial hatred.</P>
    <P>2.  All items of programme services which are likely to impair the physical, mental or moral development of children and adolescents shall not be scheduled when, because of the time of transmission and reception, they are likely to watch them.</P>
    <P>3.  The broadcaster shall ensure that news fairly present facts and events and encourage the free formation of opinions. </P>
    <P>All the various aspects in relation to transfrontier broadcasting are covered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made the point that <Col N="1264" /> one of the amendments I had tabled showed how little I understood the situation and that I was merely giving one year's grace to the independent production sector.  Amendment No. 33 reads:</P>
    <P>4. &mdash;In the period from the commencement of this Act until the 3rd day of October, 1991, the Authority shall ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme material on its television services is devoted to original programme material produced in the State or in another Member State of the European Communities by persons other than the Authority, its subsidiaries or other broadcasting organisations and that, as far as is practicable, that proposition shall not be less than that broadcast by the Authority in the year 1989.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell accused me of giving them one year's grace for home production, but the reality is that the EC Directive comes into force on 3 October 1991 which means that RTE or the independent television production company must give a reasonable proportion of their programme material to the independent sector.  However the Directive does not take effect until 3 October 1991 and I am covering the period from 1 October 1990 until the Directive comes into force.  The Deputy did not seem to be aware of that point, and I am glad to be able to clarify it for him.</P>
    <P>Deputies also commented on the advertising levels but I must stress that the levels laid down were the maximum levels and there was no question of recommending those levels.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will deal with Deputy Mitchell's point on carrying out a calm review of broadcasting.  I think that &ldquo;a calm review&rdquo; in the context of this legislation is a code phrase for doing nothing, and that is exactly the position I started from when I took up office in the Department of Communications three and a half years ago.  I inherited the &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; policy &mdash; commissions plenty of reports <Col N="1265" /> and surveys and have plenty of discussion, indeed plenty of everything, but make no decisions: you cannot be wrong if you make no decisions.  In the meantime, however, 70 pirate radio stations were allowed on air and nothing was done about the development of multichoice television for those who are not fortunate enough to live in a cable television area; nothing was done about the development of MMDS and nothing was done about setting up a legal framework for broadcasting. The philosophy is that you commission plenty of reviews and surveys and committees, but nothing gets done.  In the meantime people find themselves without choice.  We get passed by.  The satellite stations can beam in their signal and offer a choice to our people but on the other hand we are doing nothing to try to develop further choice from an Irish source.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the least bit surprised by the Minister's refusal to accept this amendment.  I think his reply to the points raised in the debate on this amendment indicates the confusion in his own mind.  First, nobody is advocating that we do nothing, as the Minister has said himself.  The House has already decided on enabling legislation for the setting up of a third television channel and that is not what is being discussed. We have seen the need for a review of how broadcasting will develop in the future; and how the technological changes will affect the viability of broadcasting. The fact is that on taking up office the Minister inherited two Bills already prepared which enabled him to move speedily.  He also inherited an RTE which had been turned around from the loss-making company they were when his party left office in 1982.  RTE had been overhauled following the consultants' report and a firm foundation had been set, and when the legislation was ultimately introduced it was supported by those who were its authors.  That was not a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; record, but we were choosing our time wisely and we were <Col N="1266" /> preparing the foundations so that when it was possible to proceed, solid foundations were laid.</P>
      <P>The Minister, to use his own phrase, has been flip-flopping around in a dogmatic way.  The dogma being that whatever he says is the unchallengeable wisdom on broadcasting.  There is no contradiction in accusing him of being both dogmatic and flip-flopping around, because he is guilty on both counts.</P>
      <P>Two commissions previously reported on the future of broadcasting, one in 1958-59 and the other in 1974, so a 15 year period elapsed between the first and second reports and it is now 16 years since the last report was commissioned.  Given the enormous technological changes that have taken place in the meantime and the enormous technological changes in the pipeline &mdash; for example the potential of the telephone system which may make MMDS obsolete before it gets off the ground &mdash; it is self-evident that we need a thorough analysis so that we have a solid foundation for the future of Irish broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank all the Deputies who have spoken in support of my amendment. In fact I have to respond to a point made by Deputy Michael Higgins on the Irish language and say that amendment No. 50 in my name states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;The Broadcasting Council shall make immediate proposals to the Minister for an all-Irish language television service.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>So we did not neglect the Irish language in our amendments.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House any longer as I want the amendment to be put.  However I must repeat that I very much regret that the Minister's flip-flopping &mdash; to use his own phrase &mdash; does not enable him to accept that the future of broadcasting is worthy of a report by a broadcasting review body, comprising those with a vital interest in this area and independent outsiders so that they can recommend to the House what the future broadcasting policy should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the acute anxiety in the medical profession in relation to junior hospital doctors?  One national newspaper said that there has been a mass exodus of newly qualified doctors from this country. There is an acute shortage of Irish trained doctors in our hospitals and unless this matter is resolved the acute crisis, which it is acknowledged exists, will be very seriously exacerbated.  What is the Minister's attitude to the resolution of this problem and what plans has he in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme which provided medical card holders with routine dental treatment through private dental practitioners was established in 1979.  The scheme was found by the health boards to be expensive to operate and most boards began to curtail services in the mid-1980s <Col N="1273" /> which resulted in lengthy waiting lists developing.</P>
    <P>It was in the context of these excessive waiting lists that the Government decided to make an additional £3 million available to the health board dental services in the current year.  Of this amount, £2.2 million is being allocated to the health boards to provide routine dental treatment for adults.  It is expected that about 20,000 persons will benefit from this allocation.  The health boards have been asked to make arrangements appropriate to local circumstances in order to ensure that a routine dental service for adults is provided in a cost-effective and efficent manner.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to establish a full scale &ldquo;choice of dentist&rdquo; scheme for medical card holders and their adult dependants at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the amount allocated is not sufficient to deal with the numbers seeking dental treatment?  Is he also aware that, under the 1970 Health Act, there is a legal obligation on health boards to provide a proper dental service for fillings, extractions and routine dental care? Is the Minister also aware that all health boards are failing in their legal obligations to meet this?  Will he bring forward proposals so that there will be a referral scheme as health board dentists could not cope with the numbers involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that for at least five or six years dental services were not properly funded.  The Minister for Health made a major effort to ensure that resources were made available and, at his request, the Government made an additional £3 million available for the scheme this year, of which £2.2 million has been allocated to the health boards to provide routine dental treatment for adults.  It is virtually impossible to estimate the demand for this service even though we have a good estimate in round figures.  I appreciate that, under the 1970 Health Act, people are entitled to certain services and it has been the priority of <Col N="1274" /> the Minister for Health, since he was appointed in 1987, to ensure that a proper level of service is available right across the board.  As resources become available they are being allocated to the areas where they are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is a national scandal that bank managers and company directors can get free dental treatment under the PRSI dental scheme while, at the same time, old age pensioners and medical card holders are being asked to pay £300 or £400 for dentures? This is unjust and unfair.  Will the Minister reconsider the position and introduce one national dental scheme to ensure that the poorest people have some level of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The language used by the Deputy is very extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some difficulties in regard to the social welfare scheme about which I am not prepared to comment.  Consequently, the availability of the scheme for the people to whom the Deputy referred is being questioned at this moment.  The Deputy should be aware that between 1983 and 1987 the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme which had been in place since 1980 was terminated because of lack of funds.  We have done our utmost since our return to Government in 1987, and particularly this year, to ensure that extra resources are made available.  We are reasonably confident that, with the extra funds being made available this year, we will reduce the waiting list for adults by approximately 50 per cent in one year, a major contribution in a short period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 16, 32 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Professor David Kennedy, Chairman of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group, has now presented an interim report to me.  It is my intention to make this report available to interested parties and to place it in the Library of the House.  The interim report recommends a range of measures to be taken by hospitals to improve the effectiveness of their services, especially of the management of the accident and emergency workload. I am asking the hospitals concerned to prepare plans for the immediate implementation of these recommendations.</P>
      <P>It also recommends the need to develop new organisational structures for the services in Dublin.  The recommendation in this regard is under active consideration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It recommends also the need for <Col N="1276" /> improvements in a range of services within hospitals including assessment, rehabilitation and after-care of elderly patients.  In this regard, it would be my intention to build on the initiative I have taken earlier this year whereby a special allocation of £5 million was provided for targeted developments in services for the elderly.  Discussions have already taken place with a number of the Dublin hospitals concerned to follow up on the recommendations of the Dublin Hospital Initiative Group.</P>
    <P>In regard to the efficiency review of acute hospitals being conducted by Mr. Noel Fox, I expect to receive a report on the first phase of this study around the end of next month.  I will make a decision on the question of publication when I have received the report.  I will, however, make an announcement in due course on the action which I propose to take on foot of the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that the Minister has made no announcement of any initiative on his part in view of the fact that in a debate of no confidence in him this report was to be the basis of further action.  Is he aware that the Kennedy report was damning in its criticism of the lack of liaison and co-ordination between the hospital services and the community care services in the Dublin area?  Does he now propose to establish any new organisational or management structures that would ensure proper liaison between hospital and community care facilities, that people are in the most appropriate as opposed to the most expensive type of beds and that will get a proper evaluation of patients' needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have told the Deputy, first of all I have only recently received that report.  The report identified the need to develop new organisational structures for the services in Dublin.  That recommendation is under very active consideration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A new phrase of the Minister's is &ldquo;the matter has been under active consideration for the last three <Col N="1277" /> years.&rdquo;  Will the Minister let the House know if he has any proposals to ensure better co-ordination between public voluntary hospitals and the Eastern Health Board?  If so, what might they be?  Have his Department even considered what new structures should be put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous proposals as to what might be done, as the Deputy is aware, going back for years.  At present, that is actively being considered. In relation to Professor Kennedy's report, a whole range of measures is to be taken by hospitals to improve the effectiveness of the service and these are already in train.  We have been in touch with some of the agencies already to prepare plans for the immediate implementation of the recommendations contained in the Kennedy report.  Also the report identified the need to improve the range of services for the elderly and that again is in train.  We anticipated that allocating £5 million extra in the budget this year for the care of the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend taking Question Nos. 5 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Gleeson Review Body in respect of hospital consultants which was published last month provides a basis for discussion with the medical profession on the remuneration of consultant medical staff employed by health boards, public voluntary hospitals and other health agencies, and the terms and conditions which should attach to them. Discussions will commence shortly between my Department and the medical profession on the basis of the recommendations of the report.  Implementation of these recommendations is dependent on the outcome of these discussions and it is my view that public utterances at this juncture, by the parties involved, on the detail of the report would be unhelpful to the success of these discussions.  Indeed I am of the view that initial reaction to the report should, in the first instance, be communicated directly between the parties to the report.  Having said that, it is my view that the recommendations in the report can lead to satisfactory new arrangements to the benefit of the patients for whom the services are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some representatives of the medical profession have rejected this report out of hand in the last few days?  In view of that, will he state his position and say whether he is satisfied with the present common contract and whether it makes explicit arrangements between public and private practice?  Will he state to this House whether he favours the creation of fulltime hospital consultant posts so that some consultants, for an agreed salary, would work exclusively for public patients to ensure that this inequality of a two-tier health service is discontinued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, because I am a party to this report, having been given responsibility by Government when the report was published to enter discussions with the consultants on the recommendations in the report, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to <Col N="1279" /> discuss in detail here my views on the various points raised by the Deputy.  All I can say is that we hope to have the first round of discussions before the end of this month.</P>

      <P>As part of the development of psychiatric services in County Kerry in accordance with the policy outlined in the report, <i>Planning for the Future</i>, the Southern health Board intend to transfer acute psychiatric facilities from St. Finan's Hospital, Killarney to Tralee General Hospital.  Discussions have been held between health board management and officers of my Department regarding the steps necessary to commission the acute psychiatric unit at Tralee General Hospital and it is hoped to open this unit later in the year.  Facilities for other categories of patients will of course continue to be provided at St. Finan's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very welcome development.  Nevertheless there will be a huge cost factor involved as regards <Col N="1280" /> both staffing and equipping this new unit. Is the Minister making a special contribution to the Southern Health Board to provide for the extra staffing and extra equipment in order to make it a smooth transition between Killarney and Tralee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the details of the financing arangements entered into.  As the Deputy is aware discussions have taken place between officials in my Department and officials of the Southern Health Board.  There is agreement, I understand, on the movement of the patients to Tralee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the question. As I have told the Deputy, the move to Tralee is in keeping with the psychiatric services planned for the future which recommend the development of a community-based psychiatric service and that patients who suffer from acute mental illness should be treated in a general hospital rather than in a psychiatric hospital.  Allied to that, as the Deputy is aware, in Kerry there are a number of other facilities, 13 community hospitals, day hospitals and workshops. Other than the acute psychiatric patients being treated in the general hospital in Tralee, patients who need hospital care will continue to be treated in St. Finan's Hospital in Killarney.  I will communicate with the Deputy about what is envisaged <Col N="1281" /> for the premises that will now become vacant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Health Funding recommended multi-annual budgeting and we are looking at it in the context of what the commission recommended.  However, the important thing it is a broader question affecting all Departments.  Traditionally, as the Deputy is aware, there has been annual budgeting affecting all Departments.  As I have told the Deputy, we are pursuing it in the context of the recommendations of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that it is impossible for health boards to plan effectively for development of new services without having more certainty as to where they stand in future years?  Would the Minister not consider devising medium-term arrangements for health boards within the confines of annual budgeting to give assurances with regard to the broad development of services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are advantages and disadvantages in multi-annual budgeting.  Certainly from many Departments' point of view multi-annual budgeting would be the ideal way forward. As against that, depending on the finances of the State there could be a problem in ensuring that the money is available.

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two consultant gynaecologist posts at Beaumont, both of which are part-time. One of these posts is vacant at present and interviews for the post were held recently.  Unfortunately, the successful candidate declined the offer of the post and it has recently been re-advertised.  Three consultant gynaecologists are employed at the Mater Hospital.  Two are full-time posts while the third is shared with Holles Street and UCD.  Consultants in both Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital provide services for both in-patients and out-patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of patients on the gynaecology out-patient waiting list at Beaumont is 60 and the waiting time for a <Col N="1286" /> patient placed on the waiting list now is approximately three months.  The corresponding figures for the Mater are 79 and three weeks respectively.  However, depending on the medical need, patients can be seen within a week.</P>
    <P>There are currently 22 patients on the waiting list for in-patient admission to Beaumont and 231 for the Mater.  In order to ensure that emergency and urgent cases can be dealt with promptly, patients' positions on the in-patient waiting list are kept under review and are subject to change.  The precise length of time spent on the waiting list for admission will therefore depend on the medical need of each individual case.</P>
    <P>Staffing levels in hospitals are monitored on a monthly basis by my Department. No applications for additional consultant gynaecologist posts from either Beaumont or the Mater have been received.</P>

      <P>I did not hear the Minister's reply about consultants at Beaumont but I took him to suggest that one of the positions there is part-time.  Will the Minister clarify that?  Beaumont Hospital serves the greater part of the north side of the city and the position there is anything but satisfactory.  Will the Minister accept that it requires urgent attention? Will he agree that requiring women to wait up to three months for a general appointment with a gynaecologist is totally unacceptable?  I should like to invite the Minister to look at the position in Beaumont in view of the extraordinary period of time, almost one-third of the period of gestation, that must pass before a woman can see a gynaecologist in the ordinary way in that hospital.</P>

      <P>With regard to the last remark I am not sure that women who would be going to a gynaecologist in a general hospital would be expecting a baby; they would be going to an obstretrician in one of the obstretric hospitals. There are two posts in Beaumont Hospital and one of them is vacant.  The post was advertised and interviews were held recently.  The successful candidate <Col N="1287" /> declined the offer of the post and it had to be readvertised.  The closing date for that competition is Friday 27 July and that is the reason there is a problem in that hospital.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that neither the Minister, or his Department, have any control over that.  We intend to fill the post as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his response which I found disappointing.  Is the Minister satisfied with the standard of performance and the disparity in the waiting period &mdash; it is three weeks at the Mater and three months at Beaumount?  The Minister has told us that there are 231 patients waiting for in-patient treatment at the Mater and only 22 at Beaumont.  There seems to be a huge imbalance there and I should like to know if the Minister is concerned about that.  How long has there been a vacancy at Beaumont Hospital?  How long does the Minister consider the hospital will have to wait before the post will be filled?  Will the Minister advise us on what was unattractive to the so-called successful candidate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information sought but, obviously, the post has been vacant for some time because there is no locum serving at the moment and there has not been one since the middle of 1989.  Since Mr. Alvey took over the in-patient waiting list has gone down.</P>

The post has been readvertised and the closing date is Friday, 27 July.  I am anxious that the filling of the post be expedited but, as the Deputy is aware, a protocol must be followed in that there is a closing date, interviews must be held, and there will be a time lag before the appointment is <Col N="1288" /> made because the person appointed must give notice to his former employer.  It is not easy to fill the post as rapidly as I, or the Deputy, would like.</P>

The contractors committee have recommended the draft agreement to the members of the IPU for acceptance.  I expect the result of the ballot of the general membership in the near future.</P>
      <P>There have been nine meetings involving my officials and representatives of the IPU since 17 July, 1989.  No further meetings are planned pending the outcome of the ballot.</P>
      <P>Assuming a positive response to the ballot I would intend that the new scheme would come into effect in September, 1990.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not contemplate expanding the long term illness scheme at present but I am satisfied that the new scheme when in operation will be of tremendous benefit to a number of sufferers from long term illnesses, including asthmatics.  It is important, when talking about people suffering from chronic illnesses, that we remember that the cost of drugs for skin diseases can be far in excess of the cost of drugs for other illnesses, including asthma.  It is important that we recognise all those who are suffering from illnesses that need continuous treatment.  The new scheme will cater for everybody who has a long term illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister anticipate will be the annual cost of the scheme?  Will withholding tax be applied to the payments made to pharmacists? Will the £28 per month limit apply to a calendar month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of the scheme will be announced following the ballot.  There should not be an annual cost.  What is involved is a marginal administrative cost.  Effectively what has been happening to date is that people have been paying, for example, £100 per month for their drugs and waiting five to six months to receive £72 back.  Under the new scheme those people will not have to pay the £72; they will pay £28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons for the delay in payments is that when one pays, for example, £56, health boards average <Col N="1290" /> that out.  They will ask how long the prescription is expected to last and if it is to last more than two months the patient will not get anything.  The question which must be asked is if the bill in the pharmacy amounts to £56, will one only have to pay £28 or will the same clause apply?</P>

      <P>This scheme only applies to those suffering from a longterm illness and not to those who pay £56 once a year.  They should continue to apply in the normal way.  This scheme only applies to those on continuous medication.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if he will establish a new post of community nurse at district level, as recommended in the report The Years Ahead.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> recommended that the function of co-ordinating services for the elderly in each district should be the responsibility of a district liaison nurse.  This would not involve the establishment of a new post of community nurse at district level as the working party envisaged that the district liaison nurse would normally be a senior public health nurse with a special interest in the care of the elderly.</P>
      <P>Most health boards have prepared plans to implement the recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead</i>, which include the appointment of district liaison nurses. The additional allocation of £5 million made available by the Government this year to develop services for the elderly will enable boards to appoint liaison nurses in many districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has missed the point.  The report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> contains the proposal that a panel of general nurses, comprising nurses who would work on a part-time basis, be established in each district.  Would the Minister <Col N="1291" /> acknowledge that community care nursing is either provided by public health nurses, who are very well qualified, or home helps, and that there is a need for a nurse, equivalent to the staff nurse in a general hospital, at community level if we are to strengthen community care services? Furthermore, would the Minister consider revising the staff nurse and career structure arrangements in such a way that they would allow for nurses from panels to be made available for, say, three hours one week and 12 hours the next, the panel being organised either by the district nurse or the public health nurse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to create a new post for the purpose outlined by the Deputy as the panel of nurses recommended by the working party will comprise general nurses working on a part-time basis.  Therefore there will be no need to create new posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Minister but, as the Minister is aware, no such panels of general nurses exist at present.  I ask the Minister to set up such panels so that a proper community nurse service is provided and to ask the eight health boards to set up such panels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, this is a matter for the health boards.  As I said, extra money was made available in the budget for the health boards this year. Indeed, a number of health boards including the Eastern, Mid-West, North Eastern and Southern Health Boards, have sought the approval of the Department for the appointment of liaison nurses, for example.  There is no reason the health boards should not appoint part-time nurses if they believe there is a need to do so in their areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I acknowledge the important work done by <Col N="1292" /> the district nurse within the community. However, would the Minister accept that the cutbacks in travel allowances in recent years have had a detrimental effect on the quality of care provided to people at home and say whether the extra money provided will be allocated in such a way that district nurses will be able to undertake the maximum number of home visits?</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the call made by a leading cardiologist (details supplied) for the establishment of a heart-lung transplant programme for cystic fibrosis patients and in, particular, his assertion that it would be more economical to establish such a unit here, rather than continuing to send patients abroad for transplants; if he will give consideration to this proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>While I am aware of the comments in this regard made by a leading paediatrician, I have as yet received no formal proposals for the <Col N="1297" /> establishment of a heart-lung transplant programme for cystic fibrosis patients. Should a proposal for such a programme be submitted to me, I will consider it as sympathetically as possible in the light of the many competing demands for new developments within the hospital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised by the Minister's reply given that he is aware of the position and the number of people who have to be sent abroad, which according to my information is a very expensive procedure, costing in excess of £150,000.  In view of this fact will the Minister investigate the matter with a view to the establishment of the unit outlined in the question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have received no submissions to date from people working in cardiac surgery recommending the establishment of such a programme.  As I said, if such a submission is made it will be considered as sympathetically as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Whom does the Minister expect will make the recommendation? There is a need for such a service to be provided.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very anxious to reduce that waiting list.  As I said, I would consider a proposal to establish a programme relating to heart-lung transplants as sympathetically as possible but, as the Deputy appreciates, a Minister, Government or Department cannot set up such a programme, as it all depends on what the experts in the field feel is the appropriate way to treat patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, it is a matter in the first instance for the experts in the field but would he also accept that when a proposition such as this is made, there is a responsibility on him to take the initiative.  Rather than await the making of submissions to him would he not investigate whether it would be practical to establish such a unit here, the cost implications and the implications for other forms of cardiac surgery, and draw up a plan in his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I am fully aware of what my responsibilities are, and I am glad to say that I have discharged these.  Anyone in need of a heart-lung transplant has not been denied one.  It has been provided for them.  The whole area of transplantation is relatively new in Ireland.  It is one that must be done in association with the experts in the field.  I will be glad to discuss it with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister referred to heart by-pass operations.  Is he aware of the critical situation which is worsening where 730 patients are awaiting cardiac surgery at the Mater Hospital? Will he now acknowledge that lives are at risk unless this problem is urgently dealt with?  That is what the consultants say.</P>

      <P>I was about to tell the Deputy that sufficient money was provided this year to enable the same number of heart by-pass operations as last year.  The consultants in the Mater took a unilateral decision to increase the length of stay of patients in the Hospital and reduced unilaterally the number of patients they would operate on.  That is what I have to deal with and that is what we are trying to correct in discussions with the Mater Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there were two cases of litigation against the cardiac consultant surgeons, who will be personally liable, because patients were being discharged permaturely, after three or four days of their operation.  That was considered to be unsound medically and consequently, such patients had then to be retained for ten days?  There had no other option. Arising out of that there are now 730 people on the waiting list, the lives of some of whom are at risk simply because extra beds have not been available.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the decision of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, Dublin 2 to request a London based consultant gynecologist and obstetrician to conduct a review of its practices and procedures; if the hospital consulted his Department with regard to either the request or the terms of reference given to the consultant; if he considers that this is an adequate response to the public concern arising from the Dunne case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the decision by the National Maternity Hospital to invite a distinguished nominee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists from the United Kingdom to undertake an independent review of the hospital's practices and procedures. I met with the Deputy Chairman and Master of the Hospital and conveyed to them my own concern that public confidence in the hospital should not be undermined and that, if aspects of any case pointed to the need for a review of policies or procedures, it should be dealt with as part of an overall view of the service concerned.</P>
      <P>I am pleased therefore to learn subsequently of the decision of the hospital to initiate the review to which the Deputy refers.  I am awaiting the result of the review and I am confident that the hospital will make such changes in practice and procedure, as may be necessary, arising from this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister address the question of whether he was involved in setting the terms of this investigation?  Was it prudent, having regard to the facts that were thrown up in the Dunne case, to allow the medical profession to investigate the medical profession &mdash; to allow the hospital to choose the person to carry out this inquiry?  Does he intend to publish the eventual conclusions or recommendations for change or whatever is contained in the report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not set the terms of reference.  As I pointed out to the Deputy I did meet the Deputy Chairman and Master of the Hospital on 14 May last.  I do not know whether the National Maternity Hospital wrote to the Royal college and asked them to nominate the particular obstetrician-gynaecologist.  I understand that the gynaecologist concerned is a very eminent member of the Royal college.  I am sure he will carry out his duties conscientiously.  I look forward to receiving that report and if it is necessary to take any further action we will look at it in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm to the House that some of the procedures already have been changed in Holles Street, for example, the practice of monitoring only one heart beat in the case of twins?  If it emerges that the Minister is dissatisfied with the report &mdash; one sincerely hopes it will be a serious investigation &mdash; in the matter of allaying public concern and fears that have arisen from the Dunne baby case, would he be prepared to institute an interdepartmental inquiry into the practices at Holles Street?</P>

    <P>Irish doctors have always had a tradition of going abroad in pursuit of further training and experience in order to <Col N="1302" /> further their careers.  The majority of doctors who go abroad return to take up senior medical posts bringing with them the benefit of training and experience obtained abroad.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of a report published on 29 June in a national newspaper that over one third of non-consultant hospital doctors practising in Ireland now are from outside the EC countries?  Is he aware that the President of the Irish Medical Organisation described the current shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors as a crisis and predicted that the situation will deteriorate in the next three to five years and that the emigration of qualified young doctors from this country is now a serious scandal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a number of non-national doctors working in Ireland.  That has been the case for as long as I remember.  As I pointed out in response to an earlier question a survey conducted by the Higher Education Authority showed that 72 per cent of doctors graduating in Ireland found employment in Ireland.  Of the 28 per cent who go abroad half of those are foreign nationals, generally going home to their own country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any surveys been carried out by any of the two working groups he established subsequent to the no confidence motion in February into the emigration of qualified doctors from this country?  Does he propose to take any action to ensure that the 300 or so medical graduates emerging from our medical schools each year are employed where they are needed in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The two groups to which the Deputy refers would not have any relevance to the question he asked. The Kennedy group will be dealing with the Dublin hospitals and co-ordination in the Dublin hospitals.  As the Deputy is probably aware there has never been a problem in Dublin hospitals in attracting non-consultant hospital doctors.  The <Col N="1303" /> problems are in the smaller hospitals through out the country.  The Fox group is looking purely at the question of value for money.  Again, it would not be relevant that they should be looking at the non-consultant hospital doctors, whether they were qualified and what their experience was.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that such a large proportion &mdash; one-third as instanced in the report I mentioned &mdash; of our non-consultant hospital doctors are from outside the EC?  Would he say whether he finds that acceptable or whether he plans taking any action in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do find it acceptable. They are free agents; if doctors want to move around there is no way I will debar them from so doing.  I also want to make it absolutely clear to the Deputy that there is no way I will discriminate against non-nationals in Irish hospitals.</P>

    </P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board already have a fully developed orthodontic department in place.  The board sought additional funds to expand their routine dental services for adults and children which had been curtailed in order to develop and staff their orthodontic department.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with the orthodontic waiting lists being kept by some of the health boards at present because some lists include children who have not yet been assessed in accordance with the Department of Health guidelines for the provision of this expensive treatment and therefore do not show a true picture of treatment need.  My Department have asked the health boards to review their waiting lists.  I expect that this review will be completed during the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself referred to it earlier.  That amount was mainly gobbled up by routine adult treatment, leaving less than £1 million available to make any impact on orthdontic cases.  Has there been any change in the departmental guidelines in relation to the provision of orthodontic treatment for children since the budget announcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been examining this matter particularly since August of last year.  Towards the end of last year we directed the health boards to assess and treat top priority cases within <Col N="1305" /> their boards.  We made £300,000 available for that purpose towards the end of last year.  We have directed the boards to treat the 500 priority cases within the eight health boards.  I am very pleased to be able to say that, as a result of our efforts, negotiations and the extra allocation, we achieved a target of 594 children being treated.  Following discussions with the health boards we gave a commitment to allocate extra resources in 1990 provided they could prove conclusively they were able to deal with priority cases fairly quickly.  Because of that assurance the Minister for Health was able to persuade his Cabinet colleagues to make extra funds available. The guidelines which obtain at present were drawn up when the Deputy's former party colleague was in office.  Those guidelines are virtually the same except that, as a result of negotiations with the health boards, we have impressed on them the urgency for clearer assessments and quicker decisions pertaining to people on the lists.  As a result of the consensus we reached and the extra funds made available we are confident that the long-standing orthodontic lists can be eradicated fairly quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister of State gets too carried away with the 594 children he says have been treated, is he not aware that there are in total some 20,000 children awaiting orthodontic treatment? Is he also aware that, under the points system, in order to receive orthodontic treatment &mdash; no matter how badly disfigured are one's top or lower teeth &mdash; one cannot gain sufficient points unless both sets of teeth are disfigured?  Would he agree that this is a disgraceful position, leading to many children being left without such treatment?  Would he not now agree that the only way to resolve this problem is to introduce new criteria for the recruitment of consultant orthodontists, allowing a small element of private practice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>I listened with interest to what Deputy Yates had to say.  I am <Col N="1306" /> fully aware of the exact position prevailing at present in our dental services and within the orthodontic area also. Deputy Yates spoke of the points system. I might tell him that between the years 1983 and 1987 the scheme was absolutely denuded of resources.  The Coalition Government at that time brought in certain conditions.  We have improved them, making extra resources available and we are doing our utmost to ensure that maximum flexibility obtains within the service, that the most efficient expeditious method of assessment possible is used when, hopefully, we can involve not alone health board dental surgeons but also the private sector ensuring that by such co-operation, we can provide a proper level of service for our children.</P>

The protocol for carrying out the T cell testing is different in different countries.  For example, the threshold is 500 in America whereas it is 200 in Europe.

Will the Minister now give an assurance that the funding for any patient that requires AZT will be covered by the Department and will not come out of the overall St. James's budget in view of the costly nature of this drug?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give an assurance like that.  The St. James's Hospital will receive a budget this year of approximately £44 million, far and away the largest of any hospital in the country. Included in that is sufficient moneys to ensure that patients who need treatment for HIV or AIDS who go to St. James's will get proper treatment, and all patients do not go to St. James's.

      <P>The Minister and I are aware of the problems at University Hospital, Galway.  I was in the hospital over the weekend and there are beds in all of the corridors all of the time.  Yet, in Merlin Park unit 9 has been closed in the last two years during the term of this Government and the previous one.  Unit 9, with 20 beds was closed; units 8, with 40 beds, was closed; unit 1, with 50 beds, was closed and unit 10 with 122 beds. That is the situation in Merlin Park.  Yet patients are being discharged from University Hospital before they are fit to go home while we have proper facilities available in Merlin Park.</P>

      <P>In 1990 we have allocated in excess of £118 million to the Western Health Board for its budget. Under the 1970 Health Act the statutory responsibility for administering health services in that board area is a matter for the chief executive officer and his team. As a result of representations from the board and at the request of the Minister, I examined the situation.  The Minister himself examined the situation and allocated almost £0.5 million to open the surgical unit.  There are almost 500 beds available in Galway Regional Hospital and University College Hospital, for ten specialities.  There are almost 300 beds available in Merlin Park Hospital for five specialities, and as far as we are concerned &mdash; and the Western Health Board knows this &mdash; we are totally committed to ensuring that the resources are made available to the board, as they become available, to ensure that those who need a service get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash; (1)  Upon the passing of this <Col N="1362" /> Act, and subject to the provisions of subsection (2), television broadcasters shall ensure that no less than 25 per cent of the home produced programmes shall be commissioned from Irish based independent programme makers.</P>
    <P>(2)  The requirements of this section shall apply to the Authority within three years of the enactment of this Act, and to any other television station established under the terms of the Radio and Television Act, 1988 on the commencement of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section an independent programme maker shall be an individual or company operating outside of and financially independent of the contracting broadcaster.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>This amendment is a reasoned attempt to address the central issue the Minister is attempting to grapple with in a rather ham-fisted and hurried way.  He is attempting to redirect resources within the industry generally and is assisting the independent sector to develop into a vibrant and expanding area and contribute to the whole broadcasting industry.</P>
    <P>The proposal in my name arises directly from the representations I received from the group who, for the purposes of this debate, call themselves Campaign 25, which in essence is the campaign slogan of the Irish film makers association, known as Film Makers Ireland.  I understand they have had an opportunity to make their representations known to the Minister and he has met with them.  I acknowledge that in amendment No. 33 the Minister is responding to those representations but, <Col N="1363" /> nonetheless, I have a number of points to make on the issue.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 proposes in subsection (1) that upon the passing of the Act, television broadcasters &mdash; RTE and TV3 or any other television station that might be established within the State &mdash; shall ensure that not less than 25 per cent of home-produced programmes shall be commissioned from Irish-based independent programme makers.  In essence, RTE and any other broadcaster would be required under the law to commission from Irish-based independent companies 25 per cent of all the home-produced programmes that are broadcast.</P>
    <P>Recognising the significance and impact this proposal would have on the resources of the existing broadcaster, the amendment suggests that in regard to RTE, the requirements would be phased in over a three-year period and in regard to TV3 or, indeed, any other station, they would apply as and from the time that station is established.  Finally, in subsection (3) of the amendment I propose a definition of an independent programme maker for the purposes of the section.  In particular, I am attempting to address what I believe will emerge from the establishment of TV3.  The existing independent film makers who are members of Film Makers Ireland do not hold out great hope for their future even though the Minister has suggested that once TV3 has been set up the market will be opened up to them and they will have the same opportunities as, for example, they might have had in England with the advent of Channel 4.</P>
    <P>In the context of subsection (3), Windmill Lane, who are the substantial proprietors of Century Radio and, in time, TV3, have purchased the television studios in Bray, formerly Ardmore Studios which were owned by MTM.  It is expected that when TV3 is up and running, they will fulfil their obligations under this Act when passed or, indeed, under the directive when it becomes law. They will commission the majority if not all their &ldquo;home-produced&rdquo; material from <Col N="1364" /> their subsidiary company based at Ardmore, and that is the reason they purchased those studios.  I am making the point on behalf of those independent operators that TV3 would be obliged, as is the case with the national broadcaster, to go into the independent market and not simply work through subsidiary operations with a view to securing their homebased material.  That is the suggestion in subsection (3).</P>
    <P>This amendment involves an invasion of the resources of RTE, the national broadcaster.  It will result in a substantial cutback in the resources and finances of the authority, but we all have to resign ourselves at this stage to the fact that the Minister intends to do that one way or another, and I do not agree with the way he is doing so.  For that reason I am suggesting in this amendment what I believe to be reasoned and sensible formula to address the issue of the shifting of resources from the monopoly to the independent sector.  That could be achieved by strengthening the position of one sector of the market, namely, the independent film makers, advertisers and programme makers and helping them to expand.  The resources that would be lost to RTE could then be taken up in the home market.  This amendment is proposed in response to people who are active and independent in this area, in an effort to show the Minister that there is another way.  It will ensure that any moneys released from the purse of RTE will be kept within the indigenous homebased industry.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the Minister's proposals to cap advertising and release resources at a time when there is no other competitor in the field here will inevitably lead to those resources going to competitors based abroad who are broadcasting into Ireland.  It has been identified that UTV will be the main beneficiary. As I have said, Sky television have bought the equipment to beam their advertising network in here, and BBC is received in two out of every three homes in the country at present.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that until there is a home-based competitor the vast majority <Col N="1365" /> of the resources that will be released from RTE will slip out in commissions to the broadcasters from abroad and will enhance their potential to the detriment of the home-based industry.  My point is that this proposition suggests another formula to deal with RTE's monopoly while at the same time keeping the resources at home. It goes a step further in that it states that the advent of TV3 as another player is not sufficient to protect the interests of the home-based independent industry.  Subsection (3) is designed to ensure that once TV3 is in place, everybody gets a fair break and that the pitch &mdash; to develop the expression &mdash; is level for RTE as well as for TV3.  The real issue is how TV3 will operate when they are up and running, because the evidence suggests that they intend to operate through subsidiary companies, worked into a network of the parent company to provide all the different requirements that the Minister or the EC Directives will expect in terms of home produced programmes.  However, there is no doubt that if RTE were to expand through the development of subsidiary companies, and set up subsidiary companies either as a joint enterprise or as a wholly controlled and owned enterprise to deal with &ldquo;the independent home produced programmes&rdquo; as will be required under the EC Directives in 1991, I have no doubt that the Minister would say: &ldquo;Sorry, foul, that is not what I mean by material produced by independent broadcasters, producing programmes outside the monopoly and, therefore, is not acceptable&rdquo;.  There is nothing in the Bill that indicates that the Minister proposes that the same regime will apply to the independent broadcasters when TV3 is up and running.</P>
    <P>The independent film making sector acknowledged that amendment No. 33 in the Minister's name is a gesture and a step in the right direction as far as they are concerned.  The amendment recognises that an independent sector exist who have a very important role to play and the Minister recognises what they have to do and the role they can play in <Col N="1366" /> the future of broadcasting.  However, I am concerned that the amendment perhaps does not go far enough and will not, of necessity, achieve everything that we should be seeking to achieve, the re-distribution of resources in a constructive way and, most importantly, ensuring that whatever is taken out for re-distribution is used to develop and secure a vibrant home-based industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has borrowed heavily from the EC Directive, which was adopted by the Council on 3 October 1989 and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities No. L 298/23 of the 17 October 1989.  If I may briefly quote from the Instrument, Article 5 states:</P>
    <P>Member States shall ensure, where practicable and by appropriate means, that broadcasters reserve at least 10% of their transmission time, excluding the time appointed to news, sports events, games, advertising and teletext services, or alternatively, at the discretion of the Member State, at least 10% of their programming budget, for European works created by producers who are independent of broadcasters.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Directive, it would appear that the suggestion that 25 per cent be set aside is contrary to the Directive, but that is not so and we argue for 25 per cent home produced programming so that if RTE or, indeed, any broadcaster simply produced one hour per day of home produced programming, the independents are saying that they should be entitled to a 25 per cent slot of that one hour.  Their argument is that they are looking for 25 per cent of the schedule that is given over to the home-produced sector.  They are also saying that it should be targeted at Irish-based companies or those based and working within the country.  In my view, the Directive asks that the member states would target their percentage work from works that originate within the Community, but there is nothing to prohibit or exclude a further refinement of that in our national legislation. There is nothing prohibiting the Minister from saying that in fulfilling our <Col N="1367" /> obligations under Article 5 we can require that we source the majority of the home-produced programme element in Ireland.  As I have said, that is the existing position in Britain and they have a good scheme based on the 25 per cent principle in operation for some years.  I want to stress that it was not just the establishment of Channel 4 that heralded the healthy and vibrant independent film making industry in that country. However, it was the arrival of Channel 4 among others, coupled with the 25 per cent rule on home-produced programmes that has worked.  Both must be in place to work together.</P>
    <P>Finally, when the Campaign 25 made their case they were as implacably opposed to capping on advertising as I in The Workers' Party or any Member in the Opposition is opposed to capping. They have made a very fine, and I believe unanswerable argument that the interests of independent broadcasters are intrinsically linked to the interests of the national broadcaster, in our case, that is RTE.  In other words, when you have a healthy and expanding national broadcasting authority, you will have a healthy and expanding independent sector, be it film or radio.  They consider that the EC Directive can only work in an environment which is centred around a healthy expanding and developing national broadcasting authority.  If the national authority are not expanding, they are not in a position to commission works as they will not have the resources, inclination or design to move on.</P>
    <P>In arguing for this amendment in my name, I believe that it will only be effective where we do not have capping on advertising.  I believe the idea presented in my amendment is a sensible and constructive way in which to move resources within the industry to ensure the future of a vibrant, independent sector, leading to further employment and engendering all classes of our culture, which have to be served.  The alternative leads to a negativing downward spiral, drawing the blood from RTE without guaranteeing a mechanism whereby the diverted <Col N="1368" /> resources are maintained at home to assist in creating further jobs.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I ask the Minister to reconsider my amendment and accept that it should be taken on board on preference to his own.  I wish to reserve further comments until I hear the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>While I support the broad outline of The Workers' Party amendment in the name of Deputy McCartan there are one or two aspects of it about which I am concerned.  Deputy McCartan said that the marketplace will take up those services displaced by this legislation.  However, I do not have the same faith in the marketplace as Deputy McCartan.  He referred to the threat posed by the broadcasting services from outside the State, namely Sky, BBC, ITV, UTV and the Satellite channels. He said that once TV3 are in operation everyone will get an even break.  I do not think that will happen.  If our experience from the third radio channel is anything to go by we could be faced with a rather chaotic situation and have to come back here in two years' time and try to suppress the second RTE television channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already expressed reservations about the Minister's amendment.  I have doubts about the legality of this amendment and whether it is proper for it to be on the agenda.  Standing Order 105 states that no charge shall be place on the public purse, the Exchequer, or a person.  If this amendment is accepted it will place a charge on the public purse.  If there are job losses it automatically follows that <Col N="1369" /> there will be a drain on the Exchequer by way of social welfare payments, etc. It will also be necessary to pay redundancy to people who will be displaced as a result of this legislation.  I will be supporting The Workers' Party amendment but I cannot see any reason to support the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to amendment No. 33 when speaking on an earlier amendment and said that RTE will remain a first-class station.  I do not think this will be possible.  He is proposing to spancel RTE in such a manner that it will be extremely difficult for them to survive. Following 1 October, the date set by the Minister for the coming into force of the legislation, further pressure will be put on RTE.  The Minister stated that there is nothing in the Bill which will damage RTE.  All I can say in response to that is that he must not be listening to what is being said outside.  Even people who up to recent times had no interest in broadcasting can now see this legislation for what it really is and its likely effect on RTE.  For that reason I have no choice but to oppose the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>If amendment No. 33 was taken on its own and not in conjunction with the capping which the Minister has also proposed I could live with it.  As Deputy McCartan said, under the EC Directive it will be mandatory on us from October 1991 to carry a certain amount of material originating outside the State.  Taken together, the proposal to cap RTE's revenue from advertising and the need for the Authority to ensure that the proportion of outside material broadcast by them shall not be less than that broadcast by them in 1989, will tie not just one but both of RTE's hands and make it extremely difficult for them to survive in that climate.</P>
    <P>I question whether it is in order to have this proposal on the agenda.  I sincerely hope that if needs be the matter will be resolved in the courts.  Unlike other people I have no inhibitions about going to court.  The treatment we have been meted out by the Government during the passage of this Bill through the House means we may be left with no choice but <Col N="1370" /> to go to court.  This Bill is the product of a one-party House which debated the Bill on 29 June.  We were in a very dangerous situation that day in that the people of Ireland were being represented by one party with token opposition from an Independent Deputy.  The Progressive Democrats and the Fianna Fáil Party acted as one unit for the purposes of the debate on this Bill.  This is equivalent to a Comhairle Dáil Ceanntair meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party passing the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The State was ruled by one party on the afternoon of Friday, 29 June.  This should be put on the record because we are going quite close to the brink.  Democracy is under threat and this can be seen by the presence of this Bill on the agenda.  This issue has to be clarified in the courts because there is an unwillingness on the part of this House to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>Every effort has been made to divert attention away from what the Minister is trying to do.  This Bill is not the end, it is just the beginning.  As Deputy Mitchell said, further developments will take place in the telecommunications area and not in the MMDS system.  I think it is fair to say that there will be a revolution in telecommunications and the MMDS system over the next couple of years.  For that reason it is absolutely essential for us to ensure that the Bill we pass in this House is correct.  Earlier today, the Minister refused to accept Deputy Mitchell's amendment which proposed the setting up a commission to investigate broadcasting in this country.  It behoves us to enact legislation which will ensure that our communications system will be free from Government interference. However, we will not be able to do this in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister's first attack on RTE was on 29 May when he said he would take a proportion of their licence fee.  His second attack was on Radio 2FM, the third was the capping of revenue and the fourth was the proposal in amendment No. 33, which is by far the most devious proposal to date.  The Minister has surpassed himself on this occasion by putting down this amendment.  It has to be said <Col N="1371" /> that this is a sinister proposal.  I have some reservations about Deputy McCartan's amendment but I can go along with it.  I cannot accept the Minister's amendment which I regard as the fourth attack by him on RTE.  I will be opposing his amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage a number of Deputies expressed concern about the independent audio-visual production sector and the desirability of fostering that sector.  I indicated at the time that a provision already existed in relation to this sector in the Radio and Television Act, 1988, in regard to the future independent television company and that in any event the EC Directive on Broadcasting Activities would be operative in relation to both the independent television company and RTE from October 1991.  I stated, therefore, that while I was not unamenable to the idea of having a provision in the Bill dealing with this sector so far as RTE are concerned it did not seem necessary.</P>
      <P>Since the Committee Stage debate I received representations from representatives of the independent production sector and discussions were held with them.  While they acknowledged and welcomed the provision that had been made in the 1988 Act so far as the third channel was concerned and were aware of the relevant provision of the EC Directive, they were particularly concerned about the hiatus that would exist between now and the coming into effect of the EC Directive in October 12 months.  The absence of any provision in the Broadcasting Authority Acts governing RTE &mdash; even equivalent to that applying to the third channel in the 1988 Act &mdash; was of particular concern to them, especially in the light of intimations from RTE that they may more or less cease to use the independent production sector.</P>

    <P>Given my stated policy of promoting the audio-visual production sector in this country and the general consensus that seems to prevail in this House that the <Col N="1372" /> development of the independent production sector should be encouraged, I have decided to promote amendment No. 33.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment will be to place RTE in the same situation as the proposed independent channel by requiring it to carry a &ldquo;reasonable proportion&rdquo; of programme material produced by the independent production sector.  I have consciously avoided putting a percentage figure on the amount of such material to be carried because it is an area where some flexibility is needed.  I have, however, set a minimum threshold to the effect that the amount should, as far as practicable, not be less than that carried by RTE in 1989.  This is to ensure that there is at least no regression in RTE's commitment to the sector in the period up to the coming into force of the Directive in October 1991.</P>
    <P>In particular the suggestion that we should go for a 25 per cent quota to be achieved over, say, a three-year period, as the independent production sector itself had been advocating and as referred to in The Workers' Party amendment on this issue, and supported by the Labour Party, might be too inflexible and too ambitious at this stage.  A 25 per cent quota is currently being proposed in UK broadcasting legislation but, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, they have a much more developed independent production sector than we have and they have had the benefit of almost ten years of operation of Channel 4 which has been a major catalyst for the development of the independent sector there.</P>
    <P>Our objective at this time should be to at least attain the EC Directive leval of either 10 per cent of transmission time or programme budgets &mdash; bearing in mind that the independent sector's own estimate of Irish produced independent output from RTE is currently only around 2 per cent or 3 per cent of total output.  It is essentially a question of walking before we run.  I do not want to impose on RTE things which they cannot live with.  I appreciate that Deputy McCartan's amendment was put down in good faith and is supported by Deputy <Col N="1373" /> O'Sullivan despite the fact that my amendment is less demanding.</P>
    <P>I should also mention &mdash; and this is also relevant to The Workers' Party amendment on this issue &mdash; that in a provision like this we cannot discriminate in favour of Irish independent productions as against independent productions from other EC member states or we would be running contrary to our EC obligations. One will find the same in the UK proposed legislation where the relevant provision is basically silent on the question of origin of their proposed 25 per cent quota of independent productions.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan, if I am to judge by his previous interventions, makes great play of the fact that he has allowed for a three-year period for RTE to achieve a 25 per cent quota of independent production. The implication of this position seems to be that he is being much more reasonable to RTE in terms of the demands he is putting on them than I am. Likewise, the Labour Party seem to be under the impression that I am imposing a very serious imposition on RTE.</P>
    <P>Let us look a little more closely at this contention.  If RTE are to achieve a 25 per cent quota over the next three years as proposed by Deputy McCartan and supported by Deputy O'Sullivan, this implies that the volume of independent transmissions from RTE should rise from its current level of around 3 per cent to 8 per cent next year, 16 per cent in 1992 and 24 to 25 per cent in 1993.  The proposal seeks to achieve in three years what is proposed for UK broadcasters after 20 or more years, including ten years of Channel 4 whose general remit is very much towards the independent production sector.</P>
    <P>At this point all I am asking of RTE is that they should at least maintain 1989 levels of independent production for the next year with a view to getting to a situation where they can graduate to the EC Directive levels when it becomes operative in October 1991.</P>
    <P>In other words, I have sought a reasonable compromise between the demands of the independent production sector &mdash; whose desire for a 25 per cent quota I <Col N="1374" /> fully appreciate &mdash; and what I believe is a reasonable and practical demand to place on RTE.</P>
    <P>In this regard I assure Deputies that there have been consultations with representatives of the independent production sector in the drafting of my amendment and, without seeking to put words in their mouths, I believe they are very appreciative of the amendment I am promoting.  While of course they would have preferred that I would have gone for the 25 per cent quota, they have a full understanding of the considerations I have to bear in mind relating to the interests and capability of RTE as regards laying down independent production targets to be achieved.</P>
    <P>In mentioning independent production targets it is interesting to note the figures. I have accepted the point made by the independent production sector &mdash; and I have put down the amendment &mdash; but when one looks at the hours and percentages of independent production which have been commissioned by RTE the figure is, to say the least, very disappointing. If you estimate the historical levels of output for the independent programme sector, you can see that in the year 1982-83 the total output of hours by RTE amounted to 5,100.  Of that, 1,500 hours were devoted to home production, 33 per cent.  As a percentage of the total output it was 1.37 per cent and as a percentage of domestic output it was 4.6 per cent.  In 1987-88 the total output of hours amounted to 7,000 and, of that 3,500 hours were devoted to home production. We had reached 50 per cent.  However, during that time the independent production hours amounted to only 180 out of 7,000; it was only 2.57 per cent of total output and it was 5.14 per cent of domestic output.  In 1988-89 the total output increased to 7,500 hours.  If nothing else, this graph of hours illustrates just how wrong the critics are when they accuse the Government of being biased against RTE.  In 1982-83 the total output of hours was 5,100; in 1988-89 there were 7,500 hours of output and home production during the period 1988-89&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Home production in that time amounted to 3,750 hours &mdash; it amounted to 50 per cent of total output. In regard to independent production, out of 7,500 hours there were 150 hours of independent production representing 2 per cent of total output and 4 per cent of domestic output.  In 1989-90, the figure I suggest that RTE should still support for independent production should not be less than 1989 &mdash;&ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; is the phrase I used in amendment No. 33.  In 1989-90 they produced 7,500 hours and out of that 3,750 hours were devoted to home production; the figure is still 50 per cent for home production.  Independent production hours increased during this time to 180 hours which still represents a derisory 2.57 per cent of total production.  As a percentage of domestic output it represents only 5.14 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I said, I understand Deputy McCartan's amendment and I appreciate his commitment to the independent sector but if we accepted it you are talking about an imposition on RTE which they could not achieve and which would have major job implications, far greater than anything I am being criticised for and threatened with by commentators.  This amendment is supported by the Labour Party but I must reject it and I will, when we reach it, move amendment No. 33.  I appreciate too, that Deputy McCartan has gone towards the 25 per cent on the basis of the strong case being made by the independent sector and his study of the British experience.  However, I remind him that the British experience has 20 years of independent production behind it and ten years of Channel 4.  It is far more realistic to talk about 25 per cent there than in the context of our situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am imposing on RTE by this amendment is similar to what has been done in the 1988 Radio and Television Act, section 18 (4) of which provides that: &ldquo;For the purpose of ensuring compliance with subsection (3) the Commission shall <Col N="1376" /> ensure that a reasonable proportion of the programme service &mdash; (a) is produced in the State or in another member state of the European Communities, and (b) is devoted to original programme material produced therein by persons other than the contractor, his subsidiary, his parent or existing broadcasting organisations&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify one or two points on the question of the Labour Party's attitude towards amendment No. 11 and the Minister's amendment No. 33.  We support amendment No. 11 and reject amendment No. 33 because amendment No. 11 which makes the case for the independents is put forward by Deputy McCartan in the context of there being no capping.  The Minister is putting forward amendment No. 33 with an unequivocal approach towards capping. He is insisting on capping taking place. There is no point in us in this House being confused or in any way misled into believing that these two amendments are similar.  They are far from being so.  What they have in common, in substance, is an attempt to respond to the case made as a lobbying group by the independent film makers and producers.  When Campaign 25 made their case, in their literature they stressed that they were against limiting or capping RTE's advertising. The Minister states he has had meetings with them.  I would be very interested to hear whether they had withdrawn that condition.  I suspect from my contacts with them that they began by saying they were against what they saw as the damaging of RTE as a signficant customer, a significant purchaser of their products. They also, I suspect believe to this minute that capping of advertising of RTE is wrong.  I believe also they are worried about the straight gift of RTE's advertising revenue to stations outside the State altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far today in a long debate the only comment we have had about what is to happen in the interim before TV3 goes on the air is the Minister saying rather weakly that, of course, there is the slack in the print media, the idea being that the revenue which is distorted away from <Col N="1377" /> RTE can go to the papers.  I will be very interested to see how independent film makers will sell films to newspapers, but that is the curious illogicality of the way this whole thing has been thrown together.  There will be a flight of TV advertising in the short term because TV3 is not there, and the assumption is that it can be got back.  We can go into all this again when we come to the next bunch of amendments which deal with the question of levying and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is looking forward to debating the Labour Party's compromise proposal of last week.  It was an attempt to raise a specified sum of money for IRTC from a levy on gross advertising revenue.  It would not have interfered with the freedom of earning capacity in RTE.  I am only making passing reference, as the Minister did, to his future amendments and when we come to that we will go into it in some detail and we will be pointing out that one of the crucial differences between our approach and his is that ours is legal and constitutional and his is not.  Therefore, we are supporting amendment No. 11 in Deputy McCartan's name because, apart altogether from the detail of its phasing and so forth, it is offered before we have decided on capping.  We cannot support the Minister's amendment No. 33 because the Minister has said capping is going ahead irrespective.  Let us think about his amendment No. 33, capping being in place.  He is saying RTE with significantly less income and revenue must sustain their commitments all over the place at their 1988-89 level.  Translated into real terms he is really saying that they are to keep their contracts with the independents alive at the 1988-89 level.  Of course, what is unsaid is that the jobs that will have to go will be RTE staff jobs. Therefore, amendment No. 33 within the concept of capping is a recipe for job destruction within RTE.  On the other hand, amendment No. 11 is an open amendment which provides that, capping not being in place, it would be a good thing to make a provision for the independents. That is the logic behind the <Col N="1378" /> Labour Party's support for amendment No. 11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We and Deputy McCartan will be voting against capping. I do not believe the Minister has made any converts here for capping but maybe when we come to vote on it, it will be all very clear.  If the Minister was to think again about his capping proposal we could reconsider his amendment No. 33.  If between now and the vote on amendment No. 33 the Minister suggests he is considering alternatives to capping we will be glad to reconsider our vote on that amendment.  The Minister has indicated that capping is what it is going to be. &ldquo;What you see is what you have&rdquo; is the motto.  Therefore, I am afraid his amendment must be construed for what it is.  He is saying simply that they can earn less but they must keep these levels of commitments. There are implications there. Let us not try to fool anybody.  At stake here are the basic jobs within RTE as a station.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 is about the relationship of the independents to the broadcasting service, that is of RTE to the other TV stations.  That is the problem that arises.  I do not intend to respond to these curious statistics in relation to home production and otherwise, but it is not quite as simple as the Minister says. Between 1982 and 1989 we had an increase in total output hours.  We might be looking forward to a very different situation.  At the moment I am indicating that there is a logic which enables us to support amendment No. 11 and reject amendment No. 33.  Amendment No. 11 deals with a situation in which capping is rejected.  Amendment No. 33 assumes capping is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again I appeal to the Minister in a constructive spirit.  He has indicated hostility already to our amendment No. 14 which we will discuss when we come to it, but at this stage let me say that, amendment No. 14 has the advantage of <Col N="1379" /> generating revenue to assist public service broadcasting in the independent sector without interfering with the freedom of action to generate income, without putting a ceiling on the earning capacity of RTE.  It is based on fair competition within the marketplace far more than the Minister's amendment which is based on a fundamental distortion of the marketplace.</P>

      <P>I oppose the Minister's amendment No. 33 because it is vague to the point of waffle.  It refers to &ldquo;a reasonable proportion of the programme material&rdquo;&mdash; reasonable to whom?  This is purely aspirational.  This legislation is far too detailed and this type of amendment has no place in the Bill.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to withdrawing it.</P>
      <P>Neither can I support Deputy McCartan's amendment.  We on this side of the House should have stuck to our guns on Committee Stage of the Bill.  The early sections in this Bill are incapable of amendment and they should simply be opposed.  There is no use in tinkering around with something which is so inherently flawed as this Bill.  We are playing into the Minister's hands by putting down these amendments which are quite insignificant and unimportant.  For that reason I appeal to Deputy McCartan to withdraw his amendment and simply oppose this section in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who have contributed in support of the amendment I have put forward.  Also I acknowledge that the Minister has for the first time in the debate entered into the spirit of what we have been discussing, I suppose in promotion of his own amendment in the same context.  It was helpful to hear some of the facts and figures which the Minister used to construct his arguments.  It is a start although it is rather late in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain why The Workers' Party are promoting an amendment.  While I <Col N="1380" /> appreciate the thrust of Deputy Garland's arguments, I would ask him to reflect that my amendment proposes to insert a new idea and that later I will join with him in opposition to the Minister's proposals on section 2.  However, we as legislators must face up to the way in which issues are emerging and circumstances are changing.  There is a view abroad accepted at all levels of broadcasting that whether we like it or not there must be a diffusion of broadcasting services between the State and the independent sector.  We must consider how to address that in a country such as ours where the State has enjoyed a monopoly and we are now trying to put in place a vibrant independent sector.</P>
    <P>My proposals are an alternative to the Minister's proposal.  My proposal is a very constructive one that has emerged from the debate, and has been forced upon us by the Bill being published and presented in the way it has been.  It inevitably would have had to be addressed at some stage in the context of what is happening in Europe and in the market here.  Film Makers Ireland, in the independent sector, have come up with a suggestion based on what is happening abroad and on what is proposed in the UK where, as the Minister has indicated, there is a State broadcasting service, the BBC, and an independent broadcasting service, Channel 4, which has existed for ten years or more.  In Britain there is also a vibrant expanding film making sector.  We must ask why and how.  We cannot draw parallels on the question of capping, however, because advertising is not allowed there.</P>
    <P>I am glad that no-one has argued that because there is no advertising there, we should not have capping or advertising at all.  There is no comparison between the market that provides licence revenue to the BBC and the market available here. What exists in Britain and what has informally operated here up until now is a reservation by the broadcasters of 25 per cent of home-produced programmes being commissioned in the independent sector.  Film Makers Ireland, the independent film makers here, wish to try <Col N="1381" /> something similar here and they quite clearly say that this should be tried as an alternative to the notion of crude capping as a device to move resources from the State sector into the independent sector, as a device to be phased in in a constructive way that will gradually shift the emphasis on resources for programme making from the State to the independent sector and allow the market to assimilate job losses in one sector and gains in the other. This suggestion is worth debating and considering.  I acknowledge that the Minister has attempted to address the proposition but he has not gone far enough in his amendment.  For that reason I am persisting with amendment No. 11 to make the point of clearly rejecting capping. I will support the efforts of Deputy Garland and others to challenge that concept, but it is incumbent on us to look at the issues and suggest possible alternatives.</P>
    <P>There is an emerging vibrant market and I am convinced that the shift in resources can be managed by RTE.  I have consulted the RTE unions and manager associations and they say they could survive with the competition and the incursion into their resources provided it was on a phased basis and provided this proposition was taken as an alternative to the crude capping notion.  I am fortified by their views.  There is agreement between the State sector and the independent sector that this is a workable formula.  This concept has been discussed within the industry and there is a general feeling that it could work.</P>
    <P>The independent market has potential for expansion.  The independent broadcasters thought that their proposal would increase their time from the current 180 hours to a share of something of the order of 750 hours, apparently 10 per cent of the overall broadcasting hours, in keeping with the EC Directive but which allows them to move in the home-produced area to the domestic 25 per cent of what is to be produced.  They thought that this would in time lead to a job increase of 1,000 in their sector.  For that reason this proposal should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the poor <Col N="1382" /> performance of RTE to date in terms of commissioning the domestic independent sector.  It is not the fault of RTE.  Over the last while RTE have undergone a fundamental change in structure and financing arising from the commissioned inquiry by Stokes Kennedy Crowley in 1985.  RTE have achieved a remarkable turnabout.  Over the last five years RTE had to look inwards but nonetheless they have achieved a significant amount in commissioning outside work.  While the figure for 1989-90 of the domestic 5.14 per cent is equivalent to what was there in 1987-88, what does it represent in real money terms?  While the percentage is the same the worth to the market has increased significantly.  Independent Film Makers are a vibrant organisation with potential but they have had difficulties, not just difficulties which have been imposed on them by RTE's struggling to reorganise and restructure in terms of resources and employment, but also because during the same period Government and State effectively abandoned the independent film making sector in this area.  They have been, independent of this debate, making representations to the Taoiseach, as the person in charge of cultural affairs, and to the Minister for Finance seeking tax breaks and so on.</P>
    <P>For more than three years I have been raising this issue in the House but I did not receive any response.  We must remember that the independent film council was closed down and that the State's studios, Ardmore, were sold off. It is not enough to say that the performance of RTE has been dismal.  They were, as illustrated recently by their involvement in such co-productions as &ldquo;Dear Sarah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who Bombed Birmingham?&rdquo;, kicking off into an expanded period of commissioning home-produced independent radio and television programmes. However, they have been stopped in their tracks and as a result are talking about retrenching inwards in the hope of dealing with the capping of their resources under the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have to create the mix and I am disappointed that the Minister has not acknowledged ideology re-defined, if not <Col N="1383" /> ideology abandoned entirely, in that I do not have any difficulty in talking about the independent sector expanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>The independent sector will live and expand only alongside an expanding and vibrant State organisation. They are the major commissioner and without them the independent sector will be at a huge disadvantage.  That is one of the reasons why we cannot talk about an expanding sector in one direction if alongside it we do not have an <Col N="1384" /> equally expanding and developing State sector.  The Minister's proposals are contradictory: one seeks to expand and the other seeks to contract with both of them pulling against each other.  In my amendment I am suggesting a way that will bring both of them together.  We do not want any capping and we want a phasing-in period.  We suggest that there should be a requirement that the State, as is the case with the independent, not be allowed to set up convenient subsidiaries as a device to try to meet their obligations under the Bill.  I am seeking support for my amendment.</P>

I suggest therefore that we discuss amendments Nos. 12 to 17, inclusive, amendment No. 1, to amendment No. 17 and amendment No. 26 together, by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 7 to 17.</P>
      <P>This amendment would delete subsection (1) of section 2.  The Bill before the House makes an unwarranted attack on the constitutional right of RTE to decide on their own broadcasting policy, particularly with regard to the timing of programmes. It seems the benefit of a licence fee income, unique to RTE, does not justify such undue interference in RTE's affairs by the Minister.  I would go so far as to say that this Bill and all previous Acts on broadcasting attack the constitutional right of all broadcasters, under Article 40.6.1º of Bunreacht na hÉireann, to broadcast as they see fit, in a manner similar to publishing, subject only to the condition that they do not exceed the constraints set out in that article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, <Col N="1387" /> have devised a practical and legal mechanism for totally revising the broadcasting system to reduce the role of the Minister and to remove the IRTC while ensuring that the Constitution provisions are adhered to.  Under our scheme the Minister would not have so much influence over RTE in finance or advertising policy or over any other broadcasters. One wonders why so much control over broadcasters is required to level the pitch, as it were, when fairly amateur stations such as the so-called pirates were able to effectively challenge RTE.  We would like to see a totally new approach to broadcasting including a revision of the infamous section 31.  The aim would be to leave RTE pretty much to their own devices, to allow those who wish to broadcast to do so subject to the constraints of the Constitution, and to set aside a segment of the airwaves for community and special interest type broadcasters who will operate without advertising.  Dependence on advertising is not good for radio or television and there are alternatives as with public radio and TV in the US where the State has no controls on advertising of the character set down in section 2 (1).</P>
    <P>We would like to see the role of the Minister reduced to a minimum since we believe that the current roles of the Minister and of the independent radio and television commission, as established by him, are unconstitutional and not in the general interest of democratic communications. The role of the Minister and the IRTC in choosing who may broadcast, and how they must broadcast, is clearly in contravention of Article 40.6.1X i. of Bunreacht na hÉireann which states:</P>
    <P>The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, <Col N="1388" /> incuding criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>We take some succour from the fact that <i>The Irish Law Times</i> devoted a recent editorial to the unconstitutionality of this Bill.</P>
    <P>To cater for the conditions applied in this article, we see a greater monitoring role for the Broadcasting Complaints Commission which would at the same time have to be open to public scrutiny, by issuing reasons for its decisions and by holding public hearings when requested. It is somewhat similar to Bord Pleanála only better.</P>
    <P>Our amendment proposes to remove one of the subsections which tend to give a role to the Minister.  We would like to see many more amendments which would remove the IRTC, or in relation to where we feel the Minister is extending his powers too far.  The amendment we propose to insert instead of section 2 (1) would include repeals in the Acts of 1926 and 1988, where we aim to remove the IRTC altogether and again remove the Minister from any major role in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The main part of our proposal is to replace section 5 in the Radio and Television Act, is set up a new procedure for the issue of broadcasting licences.  It would not facilitate the undue and unnecessary interference in RTE which would result from section 2 of the Bill. The basis would be the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech both in publishing and broadcasting.</P>
    <P>We take further support for our position from the UN Declaration on Human Rights which was recently fully implemented by this State.  Article 19 of this Declaration reads:</P>
    <P>Everyone has a right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> That sets out the position very well; that people have full access to the published medium.  Anything other than full access to the airwaves is, in our opinion, a breach of the Constitution and the UN Declaration.  Is the Minister aiming to regulate advertising in newspapers next? Under our scheme, all applicants would receive a licence for a designated frequency at the power output level they requested, assuming space was available on the airwaves.  The limiting factor, as discovered by the so-called pirates, even in Dublin, was economics not airwaves. Only 24 or so survived and fewer would have done so had they not been allowed in out of the cold.  In the US the space on the airwaves allows cities like New York to have in excess of 100 stations.  Under the proposed scheme it would be an offence for the broadcasters to exceed the power limit, wander off the frequency, to advertise if the licence was for a frequency in the non-advertising segment or to undermine the State or public morality. Outside of these limitations freedom of expression could be enjoyed and democratic debate without State or business interference could ensue should it be desired and a diversity of services could emerge.  The advertising policy would be a matter entirely for the broadcaster.</P>
    <P>Critics of open airwaves refer to Italy as a bad example and even quote the US as an example of largely deregulated broadcasting.  However, we see some merit in both situations.  In Italy, for example in Canale 5, which is an independent station, it rivals RAI which is the public service network for quality. There are also some smaller political stations which open up public debate.  The apparent chaos arose because the legislators thought they could control the airwaves but the constitutional court in Italy ruled that the State had overstepped the mark and now there is no regulation at all.  I can see a similar situation arising here and I believe the reason the pirates were not tackled sooner was because the State realised their legal legitimacy and were afraid to tackle them.  It awaited the backing of the EC.  New Directives will <Col N="1390" /> be coming from the EC on the subject of broadcasting.  If the State acts now it can avoid this chaos.</P>
    <P>In the US, apart from the large dose of awful television with copious advertising, there is public television and radio, which are funded by subscription and have no advertising, and yet remain independent. That appears to be the best model yet developed anywhere.  I see no opportunity for it to develop under the Minister's draconian legislation.</P>
    <P>We have all come to recognise the powerful role of the broadcast media and this appears to occupy the mind of the current Minister a little too much for the health of our democracy, and even business, as indicated by the current debacle.  The only solution is to allow maximum access to the airwaves and allow those keen enough to broadcast to sort it out between themselves.</P>
    <P>In a deregulated scheme we would like to replace section 31 with a better mechanism which would give people the benefit of the doubt as is normal under the law.  The role of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission is an important one and I would like to see it developed into one which would make broadcasting as a whole much more flexible.  In broadcasting we are faced with a situation slightly different from publishing, where the message may reach the public before we can stop it, so we must develop mechanisms which on the one hand seek to avoid broadcasts which would undermine the State as per Article 40 of Bunreacht na hÉireann while on the other hand allowing the greatest freedom of speech as per the same Article.</P>
    <P>Section 31, as it stands, clearly represents a poor compromise between these ideals.  I hasten to add that I am in no way questioning the 1982 decision of the Supreme Court in the <i>Lynch v. Cooney</i> case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing an alternative system for coping with this delicate situation which would not have been presented to those Supreme Court judges for their consideration.</P>
      <P>In attempting to tackle what <i>The Irish Times</i> once described as the blunt instrument of section 31, we have come up with a rather complex: amendment which would amend three Acts of the Oireacthas and revoke all orders under section 31.  It would allow all broadcasters to proceed with their work unhindered, which is what happens today in the case of most publishers.  They would have to consider only what they were broadcasting in the light of the constraints of Article 40.6.1º of the Constitution as well as the normal considerations of libel, copyright and so on.  Should they breach those constraints they would be subjected to the rigour of the law, as should happen when any publisher for any reason, attempts to undermine the State.</P>
      <P>Due to the nature of broadcasting, the mechanism would be different and would require that the Broadcasting Complaints Commission monitor broadcasts or act on a complaint, referring the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions if, in their opinion, a breach had occurred. That mechanism would avoid the present injustice whereby broadcasters, and those who wish to participate in broadcasts such as Sinn Féin, are found guilty before being given a chance to commit a crime.  It is like keeping a customer out of a supermarket for fear that they might steal.  The law is based on an assumption of innocence until guilt is proven.  That is what is so offensive, from a human rights point of view, about section 31. Did the State not often sully its record by involving itself in ill-treatment of witnesses in Garda stations?  Everyone, including the State, should be subject to the same rules and punishment when they transgress them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the <Col N="1392" /> Green Party abhor violence from wherever it emanates, whether from terrorists, freedom fighters or the State, which more often than not initiates it, as in Northern Ireland and South Africa.  I and my colleagues of the Green Party would welcome an opportunity to argue the question of violence at length with Gerry Adams, the British Prime Minister, the Minister for Communications, Nelson Mandela or anyone else on television. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that kind of openness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably this is the kernel of this debate relating to the Minister's approach in regulating the advertising revenue of RTE by the crude, unimaginative device of fixing arbitrary limits on the amount of time RTE can devote to advertising and, as a result, controlling their revenue potential.  It cannot be forgotten that, in addition to this, it is suggested that, should RTE exceed their income limits in any given year from advertising &mdash; in excess of a figure equivalent to their licence fee revenue &mdash; they will be penalised in the following year. For all of those reasons the Minister &mdash; while on the one hand advocating that there should be a free, open, competitive market in which the State sector should be expected and requested to perform as a commercial enterprise, has built into the Bill an absolute bias against potential commerciality within the broadcasting State sector.  For that reason, I and The Workers' Party are implacably opposed to what the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Late though it be in the debate we must make the point absolutely clear that, despite all the efforts and so-called responses of the Minister to representations made to him and much of the misunderstood reaction from whatever sector outside this House, the essence of this Bill has not changed one iota since the Minister introduced his Bill, mark II, in the House.  To date any efforts on our part or on the part of people outside to prevail on the Minister to be reasonable, to listen to what is being said, have borne <Col N="1393" /> little, if any, fruit.  It is hoped that, by the conclusion of the debate on this group of related amendments &mdash; all related to the issue of capping of revenue in RTE &mdash; the Minister will see his way to reconsider.</P>
    <P>There are a number of alternatives in this group of amendments.  We have listened to Deputy Garland suggest that section 2(1) be deleted.  There is no alternative suggested.  Amendment No. 13, which I put down on behalf of The Workers' Party, says:</P>
    <P>In page 4, to delete lines 7 to 17 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The total daily time for broadcasting advertisements shall be fixed by the Authority, but shall not be greater than the level specified in the appropriate directive from the European Community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know which Directive that is, the one to which I referred in the context of the previous amendment.  We know that in that Directive there are limits laid down. For example, Article 18 says:</P>
    <P> 1.  The amount of advertising shall not exceed 15 per cent of the daily transmission time.  However, this percentage may be increased to 20 per cent to include forms of advertisements such as direct offers to the public for the sale, purchase or rental of products or for the provision of services, provided the amount of spot advertising does not exceed 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>2.  The amount of spot advertising within a given one-hour period shall not exceed 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>3.  Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 1, forms of advertisements such as direct offers to the public for the sale, purchase or rental of products or for the provision of services shall not exceed one hour per day. </P>
    <P>Then there is the provision in Article 19, which I quote:</P>
    <P>Member States may lay down stricter rules than those in Article 18 for <Col N="1394" /> programming time and the procedures for television broadcasting for television broadcasters under their jurisdiction, so as to reconcile demand for televised advertising with the public interest, taking account in particular of:</P>
    <P> (a)  the role of television in providing information, education, culture and entertainment;</P>
    <P>(b)  the protection of pluralism of information and of the media. </P>
    <P>Article 18, which we contend contains the overriding guidelines in that EC Directive which should be followed as the maximum times for the purposes of the RTE Authority, laid down generous limits if one has regard to the position prevailing in RTE of percentage advertising time and share-out of the minute per hour, certainly far more generous than what is intended should the Minister have his way under section 2(1).</P>
    <P>The appropriate body at any given time to regulate the whole question of advertising should be the RTE Authority.  They are the people charged with the administration, running and organisation of that broadcasting body.  They are the people charged with the everyday running management and control of the station. They are the broadcasters.  They are the people who know and who should be empowered to regulate within the spirit of the law and directives as they obtain. Whatever the level of advertising to be fixed by legislation, emanating from this Bill today or otherwise &mdash; it should then be left to the RTE Authority.  Our role as legislators and that of the Minister in promoting legislation should be to establish an upper limit, the limits laid down by the EC Directive or otherwise.  If we want to be less generous than that EC Directive, so be it; let us make the case in this House, but set upper limits, saying: that is the maximum and beyond that no broadcaster should proceed.  Thereafter it is a matter for the market itself, for the broadcasting authorities in control of the State broadcasting station, on the one <Col N="1395" /> hand, and the private independent broadcasting stations, on the other, to determine the best way of organising and distributing that percentage throughout broadcasting hours in any one day.  That is what is advanced in our proposal.  We urge the Minister to consider that formula.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes a regime that is far less generous than the EC Directive. I would challenge the Minister to tell us of any other State in Europe that imposes as restrictive conditions on advertising in regard to a state broadcaster in comparable circumstances.  I do not believe there is such.  I say also that the Minister simply has not made a case, in the course of debate here, for having limits as restrictive as those laid down in his section 2.  He has not said where he got the figures from.  He has given no good reason the percentage should be half what is proposed by the EC Directive, although they allow, in certain circumstances, up to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>We go now to the times allotted.  The Minister originally suggested that the period should be four and a half minutes and, in the course of representations, has now gone as far as five minutes.  He says that the increase of 30 seconds was prompted by the charitable organisations who are concerned about their entitlements to facilities at a preferential rate. He said later in the debate that it was a response to ICTU who were concerned that the proposal for four and a half minutes was simply too restrictive and would have a detrimental impact on jobs in the industry.  I would like to hear from the Minister his justification that that represents a saving of £2 million for RTE that would translate into the protection of jobs, and what would now be the expected job loss as a result of the improvement in the Minister's amendment. Is it the case, as I suspect, that the Minister's figure is an ill-conceived, ill-researched and poorly defined parameter, so shoddy that the Minister is in a position to throw in 30 seconds here or there?</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to have <Col N="1396" /> regard to the fact that the urgency which prompted his manoeuvre in this area has passed.  There is no gainsaying the fact that what we were about initially in this legislation was throwing a lifeline to Century who were in trouble and in need of immediate help.  They have apparently read the figures and have now got back out into the market equipped with the listeners' survey to say to their potential advertisers and backers that they were actually doing better than they thought and want to renegotiate.  They have, clearly, at this stage found their lifeline elsewhere, so the urgency of this capping arrangement, proposed by the Minister, has passed.  There is no immediate need for what the Minister is proposing.  For that reason the Minister can and should look to some of the alternatives suggested to him in the group of amendments that are here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there is not just Century, but other areas.  TV3 is not there.  Surely we have made the point well that if the Minister proceeds with his capping proposal in the absence of TV3, inevitably what is drawn out from broadcasting revenue will go to television broadcasting available within the State but emanating from outside in the form of UTV, BBC and the independent, Sky. There is cogent argument to suggest that the Minister should stay his hand on this issue.</P>
    <P>Finally I come to the print media.  The print media has survived exceptionally well and is expanding.  Recently we had the courageous innovation of <i>The Dublin Tribune</i> as another addition.  While they complain of unfair conditions and market there does not seem to be any indications of a contracting market in this area as a result of loss of advertising revenue.  I hope the Minister will not suggest that the misfortuntes of the Irish Press Group, which are entirely the misfortunes of a company mismanaged and poorly run, are a direct result of anything that has happened in the advertising area.  It is just not so.  I will not go into that debate. The Minister suggested last night that there was a link.  I am saying to the Minister that the print media is doing well <Col N="1397" /> and is expanding where it is well managed and properly structured and can survive a little longer in the market if necessary so that we can have a more reasoned approach to this whole area of how to draw revenue from one sector and move it constructively into other areas of the advertising industry.</P>
    <P>In that regard I have to acknowledge that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have made a submission to the Minister that they could, if they were so disposed, increase the advertising times if the capping process is to be relied on by him. The RTE Managers' Association have also made this case to the Minister and have said that the period of advertising should be further increased upwards from five minutes to as close as possible to six minutes per hour.  This suggestion was made in their most recent submission of 9 July in response to the debate on Committee Stage.  In their letter they said they would like to see changes in the Bill as follows: first, an increase in the time from five minutes an hour up to, as close as possible, six minutes an hour and have this expressed as an average with the scope, if needs be, to gradually reduce the minutes over the next few years. They said that this would help them to adjust generally downwards to the new environment.  Here is a representation from those who actually manage the RTE Authority, who are being reasonable, who are saying they want to deal with this on a phased basis and are asking the Minister not to take them down from seven and a half minutes to five minutes as proposed.  They make a good case, and the Minister should look at it, and he has the opportunity to look at it in the context of this group of amendments because it is suggested by Deputy O'Sullivan, on behalf of the Labour group, at amendment No. 16, that an average in any one week can exceed six minutes provided that any consecutive period of four hours, does not exceed 24 minutes.  That is clearly on all fours with what the RTE Managers' Association are advocating as a possible compromise in this regard, recognising that the Minister is bent on the approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> If the Minister is rejecting the proposal that I advance in amendment No. 13, I am prepared to get into a discussion with him in the hope that he would be prepared to advance on the period of five minutes as he proposes in his amendments. We are late in the debate in dealing with this.  There is little over an hour remaining.  It is important that the Minister look again at the figures he is proposing and the way in which he intends to implement them.  I am asking the Minister, at this late stage, to consider an improvement on the period of the capping he talks about.  I would ask him to look at the formulae contained in any of these amendments and allow for a phasing in period so that the impact is not as sudden as it will be if the legislation is implemented from 1 October 1990 or earlier.  It is time the Minister listened not only to the views of people outside the House but to what we on this side of the House have been saying.  I would urge the Minister to respond more favourably and more generously, recognising that there is scope for approaching this issue from a different direction, or at least with some form of compromise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment and the associated amendments deal with the core of the Bill, and it is a rotten core indeed.  It serves no good purpose whatsoever except perhaps it may save face for the Minister and may satisfy his feeling of self-importance.  Before the House is a range of amendments, all of which would give the Minister more flexibility.  Even at this late stage I would ask the Minister not to dismiss the unanimous appeals of this side of the House and the quieter appeals from some on his own side not to impose this ignorant vice-grip on RTE, which will immobolise all incentive and all enterprise in our national broadcasting corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's proposal in this section is one of the most rigid proposals that has ever been put before this House.  It allows for no flexibility either to the Authority or to the Minister who may, on reflection or after the lapse of a few months, see the devastation he has wreaked on RTE. <Col N="1399" /> The proposals in section 4 of the original Bill, bad as they were, at least gave the Minister some flexibility.  They allowed the Minister to come back with an order to the House, and orders can always be amended subsequently.  In this Bill, not only does the Minister immobilise RTE but he immobolises himself in an ignorant vice-grip, and such is the corner he has pushed himself into.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect on the specific provisions of the section as it is now presented. If the amendment in the name of the Minister is carried, RTE will be able to advertise not for an average or a minimum but for a maximum of five minutes in every hour, peak time or otherwise. That means they may not advertise for more than five minutes in any hour even though they may only advertise for three minutes in the preceding or the following hour.  That removes all flexibility and has no regard to the nature of radio or television which has peak and off-peak hours.  As anyone with an ounce of sense knows, in any business you make most of your money during the peak season or the peak hour.  RTE are being told they may not do any more business in the peak time than they can do in the off peak time.  This is a recipe for disaster.  It removes all purpose for enterprise within RTE.  The amount of earnings allowed by the Minister from advertising, sponsorship and other commercial activities will be much less than they have been earning.  This will induce in RTE a lack of interest.  People respond to incentive not only in financial terms but in other terms, and if all commercial incentive is removed from RTE, I am absolutely certain it will affect all areas.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister want to wreak havoc on RTE?  Why should he want to put RTE in a tighter bind than any other television service in Europe and probably in the developed world?  He has at various times put forward certain arguments, one of which is that he wanted to create an opening for TV3.  If that is the case, why did he not wait until TV3 was about to be set up?  The latest indications are that TV3 will not be set up before the end <Col N="1400" /> of next year at the earliest.  Given the number of dates that have been set previously for the setting up of TV3, only to be postponed, there can be very little confidence that TV3 will meet its new deadline of end-1991.</P>
    <P>Let us assume it does meet that deadline, would it not be more realistic for the Minister to set the deadline for the commencement of this Act at 1 October 1991 rather than 1 October 1990?  Would it not be more sensible for him to take power to commence the Act by order, giving himself the flexibility and discretion to commence it at a time most likely to coincide with the setting up of TV3, if that should ever come about? Does the Minister not see the consequences of not accepting that reasonable amendment which gives him greater flexibility and discretion?  Does he not realise that by not accepting that amendment, he may be scuppering all existing hope of TV3 getting off the ground?  Is there not a very strong case to suggest that the capping of RTE in advance of TV3 will lead not only to a leak of money to UTV and the satellite channels but to a flood of money out of the State to those services from 1 October, because there is no other medium available to take up the slack thereby created?</P>
    <P>That is the sort of ignorant vice-grip the Minister is imposing not only on RTE but on himself.  In my time in this House, and in my knowledge of the proceedings of the House, I have never seen a more ill-considered, unwise and bad section in a Bill.  When TV3 is set up it will be hard to recoup the advertising funds that will have leaked out of the State to UTV, as has been unanimously predicted by all those in the advertising world.  This creates an even greater uncertainty about whether TV3 will ever be set up.</P>
    <P>In the earlier debates on this whole issue, initiated by Fine Gael in May, we discussed the problems of Century Radio in surviving as a national alternative radio service.  Could the Minister quantify any benefit that he believes will accrue to Century or to other radio services as a result of the measures he seeks to impose?  Can he quantify the assistance <Col N="1401" /> that will be given to Century and other commercial stations by way of diverted advertising revenue?  Can he guarantee that this measure is the one that will save alternative national radio?  If there is a doubt about an alternative national radio, how can there be any confidence about alternative national television? Even if the total £12 million to be diverted annually from RTE goes to the alternative national station &mdash; as the Minister is so prone to point out it is only £12 million &mdash; it is a huge amount for any organisation to do without, but it is only a fraction of the reduced budget of RTE, which in turn is a fraction of ITV's budget or the budget of the BBC, with whom RTE have to compete.</P>
    <P>The Minister has painted himself very clearly into a desperate corner.  If he were man enough, he would acknowledge the fact even at this late stage and withdraw this mendacious proposal.  I hope, Sir, that in the remaining hour of debate left on this section, the Minister will at least &mdash; if he does not accept any of the amendments proposed from this side of the House &mdash; give himself greater flexibility, so that if the worst effects forecast as a result of the present proposals actually materialise, he will have discretion to ameliorate the situation by order of this House.</P>
    <P>Bad and all as the original proposals were, they at least had the merit of including such a proposal.  For the life of me, I cannot see why the Minister removed this discretion, except that it was done in a hurry by way of short cut, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to.  We have had three sets of proposals from the Minister, each more hurried than the other and none of which was the subject of a Government memorandum or circulated in the normal course for observation.  It was a rushed job, a botched job, from beginning to end.  As a result of the rushing of fences, we have before us a most dangerous and adverse proposal.</P>

      <P>I feel it is my duty as the main Opposition spokesman on the subject to reiterate our strong request that even at this late stage the Minister will see the folly of his present proposals. If he does not feel like withdrawing them I ask that he at least accept some power to change them in the future in the event that the forecasts from this side of the House and from outside the House materialise, as I am quite sure they will.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had quite a good record in introducing broadcasting legislation up until now and I would be the first to admit that.  After becoming Minister, he acted swiftly to deal with the pirate radio stations.  I, for one, was glad that he was able to do so and that he was able to build on the foundations laid by the previous Government.  I am also glad that we on this side of the House supported those proposals in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an area as sensitive and important to democracy as broadcasting it is vital that there is at least some degree of consensus on central issues such as those dealt with in section 2.  I hope, Sir, that the purpose of the different Stages of the Bill is not lost on the Minister.  The purpose of this long, tortuous process is to improve legislation and for the Government to hear what parliament has to say.  I hope the Government and the Minister are listening and that they do not proceed with the present proposals <Col N="1403" /> unamended.  It would be a disaster if they did so.</P>

      <P>We were interested in responding to a suggestion made by the Minister on a previous Stage that he wished that those who opposed his proposals for raising revenue for the independent sector would come up with proposals or alternatives to what he had suggested.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said, and it does not need to be repeated, about the effects of capping.  Capping interferes with the marketplace and it has already been stated in the House, and it is an opinion with which I agree that it is in breach of Article 40.6.1ºi which deals with the freedom to publish and to broadcast.  The suggestion that an editor in the case of the print media or a person who is running an advertising section in the visual media would be restricted from accepting or seeking forms of advertising or having to choose between potential advertisers is in clear breach of the freedom that is referred to in Article 40.6.1ºi.  This is not only my opinion but is an opinion offered in <i>The Irish Law Times</i>, volume 8, No. 7, July 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of capping are very crude, there is an immediate loss of income and an intereference with the structure of funding, programming and employment within RTE.  In amendment No. 14 we are suggesting as an alternative a levy on the gross advertising revenue of stations. In suggesting this, we were very cognisant of the fact that we needed to pin down the levy so that it could not be raised arbitrarily.  We have suggested that it be limited to a levy that would generate an income of £5 million for the Independent <Col N="1404" /> Radio and Television Commission, which in turn would be able to listen to requests from independent stations carrying the burden of public service broadcasting and also they would be able to listen to requests for community radio where, for example, community radio would find it difficult to come into existence.  Even if the levy yields more than £5 million it will sink as a percentage the following year.  The important point about this mechanism of raising funds is that it will not, unlike the capping proposals, interfere with the freedom of RTE in relation to advertising and will not distort the market.  It will enable RTE to earn more, provide revenue and income for the Independent Radio and Television Commission and provide a source of funding for the independent sector.</P>
    <P>We were very conscious in putting forward this amendment of the need to put forward a proposal which would recommend itself to all parties in this House and be a broadcasting solution.  The proposal put forward in amendment No. 14 and our other amendments are designed to extend public choice in broadcasting by providing the financial resources to ensure that competition will be on the basis of programming quality and will strike a fair balance between RTE and the independent radio and television stations. We are willing to accept the arguments put forward about the costings which have been set for the public sector broadcasting component of the independents. We believe our proposal will lead to equality between the independent sector and RTE.  It would also lead to integration between the independents and community radio, which are out of kilter.  I admit that there have been applications made very late in the day for community broadcasting and early applications for commercial broadcasting and I believe our proposal will ensure a balanced and integrated independent community and State sector in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Our proposal will protect public service broadcasting in RTE and employment <Col N="1405" /> and advertising in RTE and in the independents. This proposal will be able to answer the submissions made by, among others, the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland and practically all of the groups who have lobbied both the Minister and the Opposition parties.  As I have said, it will encourage competition on the basis of programme quality between RTE and the independent sector in both radio and television.  Because stations will be able to go to the IRTC for money when they are in difficulty it will encourage the extension of public service broadcasting by including the independent sector and prevent the development of purely commercial broadcasting by either RTE 2 or TV3.</P>
    <P>In reply to the arguments that stations in difficulty will be able to apply immediately for assistance from the fund I ask what will happen to those stations who are not in any difficulty.  What we are proposing is similar to the fund which exists in the insurance industry, aspects of the financial services and the professions. These stations would know that they could apply for assistance from the fund if they got into difficulties as a result of having to carry the costs of public service broadcasting.  It would also build a certain sense of mutuality between the participants in the independent sector.</P>
    <P>Our proposal in relation to the levy on gross advertising revenue has the great advantage of being both legal and constitutional. It will not interfere in the marketplace and will not put the hand of the State into the marketplace so that it can say &ldquo;you can only earn this much advertising&rdquo; or refuse certain companies which have been identified by the courts. This proposal will avoid all the difficulties posed by the cap on advertising revenue, which I sincerely believe has a legal and constitutional shadow on it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of our other amendments.  In regard to applications to the IRTC both in the short term and over a period of time, the IRTC will be free to lay down conditions for the implementation of public service broadcasting norms within the independents.  In other words the IRTC will be beefed up with funding <Col N="1406" /> and allowed to establish criteria so that the independent sector can apply to them in an open way.  This would mean that there would be straightforward accountable forms of funding rather than back door subsidisation without any accountability whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the European Community and conditions after 1992.  The levy we are proposing would be imposed on all larger radio stations, TV3 and RTE.  This would dispose of the argument that one has singled out RTE for a sledge hammer approach.  The Minister said he would like to think of it as the light touch of the State.  The proposal in relation to RTE would not qualify as a light touch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A light touch has many meanings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify another aspect of our proposal.  We propose that there should be a threshold of £1 million for stations who do not receive significant gross advertising revenue so that they would not have to come into the net at all.  This would have the merit of treating stations equally and generate revenue in such a way that it would assist in the retention of jobs.  Our proposal would not in any way restrict RTE's capacity to increase their revenue from advertising and I do not think it would penalise TV3, should they emerge.  It would enhance the quality of programming on TV3 with great emphasis being placed on home-produced rather than imported programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will finish soon because many other people wish to speak.  Good sense should prevail at this stage.  As the Institute of Advertising practitioners clearly stated in their letter of 10 July, the notion that the advertising knocked off RTE will go to the printed medium simply does not stand up.  I do not want to say too much about this but the strength of the signal of UTV in the Dublin area will mean that there will be a loss of advertising to that station and with it the loss of a number of creative jobs in RTE, etc.  Even at this stage good sense should prevail.  The levy we propose will not put a stranglehold on <Col N="1407" /> RTE, is fair and will not lead to a leakage of advertising from the State.  It will also assist in the growth of independent film production.</P>
    <P>The Members of the House must judge between the proposals being put forward in this group of amendments by the Labour Party and the capping proposal being put forward by the Minister.  The proposal to cap the advertising revenue of RTE must be considered in the same light as the proposal to transfer the licence fee.  It will simply prevent RTE from providing the full range of services which they are required to do by the Broadcasting Acts.  This is rather like boot boy economics, that is, RTE must be injured because they have a monopoly. I have said enough about this issue already.</P>
    <P>This proposal is a fundamental departure from the proposals put forward by the Minister on Second Stage and in other broadcasting debates.  By going back to this proposal he is advocating the heavy touch for RTE, putting a ceiling on them and stopping them from performing in the marketplace with freedom and equality, and advocating a light touch for others.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say, as he has said already, that he was waiting for this amendment to say what he thinks about the Labour Party proposals.  It is very clear that RTE will contribute approximately 75 per cent of the £5 million about which we speak.  Subsection (4) of amendment No. 14 provides that the subvention should remain at this level as advertising revenue increases for both RTE and the new TV station.  This means that, a sum having been specified, the percentage of the levy will continue to slide down proportionately as advertising volume increases in both TV3 and RTE. It is equally clear that part of the levy on RTE will go to the community sector.  To a degree it would be up to the independents themselves, in relation to the other amendments we proposed, whether they want to come in under IRTC conditions.  For example, the IRTC might require equity and other <Col N="1408" /> conditions and if the independents felt they could not accept these conditions they could avoid coming to the IRTC.  As I mentioned, the fund would be available for community radio and Telefís na Gaeltachta. The exemption I mentioned would ensure that small stations without much revenue would be exempt.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept that there is nothing fundamentally ideological about this amendment, it represents a practical attempt at answering the challenge to produce a form of income which would enable the present difficulties of the independent sector to be answered and to guard against potential future difficulties. At the same time it would leave RTE free to operate like any other entity in the marketplace and to continue doing what they are best at.  It would also be an incentive to increase advertising because the greater proportion would stay at home.</P>
    <P>Less than ten years ago &mdash; the Minister avoided referring to this &mdash; a great deal of advertising material on the media was made outside this country, the figure might have been 80 per cent, and 20 per cent was made at home.  Today the ratio is the other way round, 20 per cent is imported and 80 per cent is made at home.  Our proposals leave jobs within RTE, independent film making, the advertising industry and in the creative areas on their periphery.  It stops the leaking of funds and integrates and provides a source of funding for community radio where it might not otherwise exist.  It leaves independent stations below a certain figure intact, it integrates within the IRTC and, not only gives it funding but the capacity to deal with commercial independents and the community.</P>
    <P>Because the levy falls not only on RTE but on all the players in the independent field, it will lead to the orderly development between State broadcasting, which is controlled by an Authority, and the IRTC, which will be managing all aspects of the independent area.  This proposal would be acceptable to all the main players in the field, the workers and those involved in the peripheral, creative areas. I strongly urge the Minister to accept it <Col N="1409" /> as an alternative to the crudeness, potentially illegal, almost certainly unconstitutional and disastrous consequences which will flow from his proposals for capping.</P>

      <P>I want to stand back from this issue and look at it in a detached way.  What should the role of a Government be in relation to a public broadcasting organisation which is financed by licence fees and advertising?  I would have thought that, in the public interest, their concern should be to balance two things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse me, Deputy FitzGerald.  I see a note here that Deputy Dempsey was entitled to speak.  He did not offer and I did not know that.  However, I called Deputy FitzGerald and he is entitled to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, their concern should be to balance two things, to maximise the commercial revenue of public broadcasting or to minimise the call on the licence fee while, at the same time, taking account of the fact that there is a public interest in avoiding an excessive volume of advertising which is intrusive or an abuse of advertising. Some limits or limitation on the kind of <Col N="1410" /> advertising to be shown should not be ruled out on principle.  The primary concern must be to maximise the commercial revenue and to limit the call on the ordinary licence holder.  This extraordinary capping proposal is designed to minimise, or limit, the amount of commercial revenue which, of course, means that, for any volume of activity required from RTE, the licence holder will have to pay more.  This is such a perverse approach that one must ask why it has been adopted.</P>
      <P>The limitation on the amount of advertising can be argued about &mdash; the EC limits are very high, intrusive and damaging to people who want to watch television without too many interruptions &mdash; but the present situation in RTE is right. We should all like to see less advertising but we must accept that money is raised in that way.  Some reduction or control might be acceptable but the linking of that to a capping mechanism is totally unacceptable because it will not enable them to maximise revenue from whatever time is thought appropriate for advertising, it will limit the amount of revenue. I can think of only one explanation and none has been given in this debate.  It is to put power in the hands of a Minister to exercise influence over the broadcasting system because of the threat all the time that if they do not behave themselves <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Government the licence fee might be reduced.  This would be popular with the public and it could be done at a time when RTE &mdash; as we all do &mdash; make a mistake.  They could do it at a time when RTE are temporarily unpopular and in that way RTE could be punished.  When this Bill is passed RTE will know that they are open to that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, in this country, there is not a great record of moral courage in various institutions or among people who have to take public responsibility.  I hope &mdash; and believe &mdash; that RTE will have the courage to stand up to this; if they do they will find, in practice, that even the Minister will find it a bit difficult to try this tactic because his bluff could be called.  The purpose of this is to give him at best the power to bluff and at worst to act in <Col N="1411" /> a way which would damage the public broadcasting system.  There is no justification for that in a democratic system.  It is an anti-democratic fact to set up such a structure which visibly has no other conceivable purpose, or none which anyone else has suggested.</P>
    <P>This must be resisted by everybody in the House.  Different views, can be taken of other aspects of the Bill but the basic concept of capping in this form, designed to intimidate the broadcasting authority, is undemocratic and undesirable and something on which we should all unite. The Minister's party contains many liberal minded people, although not perhaps as many as we would like to see and not as many as in other parties.  The same applies to the Progressive Democrats but, in this instance, they do not seem to have taken their responsibilities as seriously as they should have.  It is disappointing that these people, who should be concerned about the democratic process, have not taken a stand against the Minister's jackboot tactics.  It is worrying that our political system is vulnerable to this kind of approach and that it is supported.</P>
    <P>The more vigorously we challenge it the more difficult we make it for the Government and the Minister subsequently to abuse power.  It will also mean that there will be a greater chance that those in charge in RTE of making programmes or running the organisation will feel emboldened to carry out their responsibilities and will not allow themselves to be intimidated by, clearly, an intimidatory tactic.</P>
    <P>I hope whatever Government succeed the present one will take steps to remove this provision and ensure that public broadcasting is rendered as we in Government tried to make it, immune to the maximum extent possible to the kind of political pressures which always tend to be designed to limit their critical faculty. We did this in Government by appointing as strong an Authority as we could to stand up to us and any other Government who might follow us.  It has <Col N="1412" /> not always happened with other Governments, but we did that.</P>
    <P>Looking back, I regret very much that we were unable to bring in legislation to deal with this area.  I think those who made it difficult for us to do so, with due respect to some Deputies in this House, must now look back with some regret on it.  In Government we could and would have brought in, had we been allowed, measures that would have made commercial broadcasting possible but in terms of guarantee to the independents and the continuing successful operation of RTE. That was my intention and wish and, I think, those of all members of the Government.  It is a pity we were not able to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was recently in Czechoslovakia at the time of the election there and I was asked to contribute to a seminar the day after the election on issues involving morality and ethics in politics.  One point I made among many as to the dangers of corruption in the market system and pluralist democratic system which they have to face as they move to it and which they should guard against and not make the mistakes we made, was the importance <Col N="1413" /> of maintaining public broadcasting, and doing nothing to undermine the role of public broadcasting and protecting it from political pressures.  That message in every democracy must be made as clear as possible.  I regret that this Government have allowed one of their Ministers in pursuance of what seems very like a vendetta on his part to adopt this kind of tactics and be given the authority to do so.  The Government themselves will regret it; I think they regret at present that they walked into this and he is probably not a very popular Minister in the Government because of that.  There are sensitive people in that Government who realise that this kind of action is not popular, is not conducive to the standing of the Government, and that this Government, like others, are vulnerable to mistakes of this kind which, if accumulated can bring a Government into disrepute.  Even a Government who may be riding high in the polls at present can come a cropper very quickly if there is an accumulation of actions by them about which the public have become unhappy.  I think this Minister's action in this Bill has been unhelpful to the Government.  On that account I do not welcome it; it is too serious to play party politics with.</P>
    <P>I read with considerable scepticism the submissions made by various vested interests, always looking to see what their motive is and whether the points they make have any validity.  I have to say I was impressed by &mdash; not all &mdash; almost all the points made by the marketing society in the submission they made to us.  They make the point that advertisers who cannot obtain time on RTE will look to other relevant media, that in looking to other relevant media they will produce TV commercials and if they cannot have them on RTE as much as they would like they will put them elsewhere and the only elsewhere they can go to is UTV.  The idea that this Government should set about building up UTV &mdash; for which I have every respect and I hope it will continue in a successful operation in part of our island &mdash; in advance of and against the interests of a third TV channel here which they are keen on having whatever <Col N="1414" /> doubts they may have about its commercial viability, is really rather extraordinary. There must be very strong, irrational motivation to lead them to that course of action.</P>
    <P>The point is made that the only serious alternative is UTV.  Two out of three sets in the Republic can receive it, 85 per cent in Dublin, and this will drive money out of the economy into Northern Ireland.  I think I am correct in saying that the net effect will be serious consequences for employment in RTE, in marketing companies, market research organisations and advertising agencies in this State. Why this Government would allow a Minister to embark on a crusade against employment in this State in these areas is hard to credit, but obviously he carries a certain amount of weight and they may decide to let him away with it this time. They let him away with adopting a policy which is totally contrary to the general thrust of Government policy which is designed &mdash; not always wisely &mdash; all the time to try to maximise the amount of employment.</P>
    <P>The other point I have to make also has validity.  Any price rise in terms of TV advertising will tend to squeeze the smaller advertiser out of the market in favour of the big budget international marketing company with an adverse effect on the growing sector of new small Irish companies, again contrary to the objectives of this and other Governments in this State.  That all this damage should be done just so the Minister can get into a better position to intimidate RTE is extremely discreditable to the Government in office at present.  I hope that when the Government changes, the mistakes made here will be put right.  Oppositions sometimes promise to do things and when they come into Government do not always get round to doing them. We have become cautious about that. There are not too many people promising we will reverse everything here.  Past experience has taught us to be cautious with these promises, but this is one case where we should, whatever we say publicly or make claims about, put down a <Col N="1415" /> marker in our own minds that in Government this is one of the things to be put right very early on when the Government changes.</P>
    <P>I repeat my first point, that this is totally contrary to the rational action we would expect from a Government in regard to a public broadcasting system dependent on advertising and licence fees, which is to maximise the revenue from advertising subject to limit in terms of time or type of advertising, in order to minimise the impact on licence fee.  It has the opposite affect and such a perverse action by a Government can only be explained in the terms I have suggested.</P>

      <P>If we take his hypothesis to the logical conclusion, we would have no licence fees at all.  RTE would have no licence fee and they would get no state subsidy by means of the licence fee itself. I notice from all the other amendments <Col N="1416" /> put down by The Workers' Party and the Labour Party, that they accept the principle that there should be a limitation. They may disagree with the Minister and that is generally what parliamentary democracy is about, but both the Labour Party and The Workers' Party and, in so far as I can judge, the Fine Gael Party accept there should be limitation on advertising time for RTE. The difference in the proposal of The Workers' Party is they want the authority to decide that rather than the Minister.  I do not know what purpose they would serve.  I doubt if the authority, who are RTE, will regulate and control themselves, and if they were in that position it is not likely that they would achieve the Minister's aim of a level playing field for RTE and other broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the Fine Gael position on the amendment and on this section which is, as every speaker has said, at the core of the Bill.  All they could manage to do was to put down an amendment to an amendment put down by the Minister.  With all the shouting and screaming they did over the last number of weeks one would have thought that they would have been able to come up with a substantial proposal for amending the Bill, but they have not done so.  At least I can give the Labour Party credit for putting forward something positive and direct.  Fine Gael have claimed that they are implacably opposed to the Bill. They were so opposed to it that they failed to have enough Deputies in the House to oppose it on Second Stage. They then withdrew during Committee Stage, having wasted three or four days. People outside have recognised their contribution for what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have been consistent throughout the debate, putting forward their own ideology.  At least people can agree to disagree with them on this. Deputy Michael Higgins admitted in relation to amendment No. 14 that they started out totally opposed on principle to taking any money from RTE and they said particularly that money should not be taken from RTE to hand over to private broadcasting companies.  Their <Col N="1417" /> amendment No. 14 turns that belief on its head and the proposal is practically the original proposal by the Minister except that the levy is now coming from advertising rather than licence fees.  I noted that Deputy Higgins, although I am not so sure that he was fully behind the amendment, kept putting in caveats and mentioned the fact that he realised that about 75 per cent of the £5 million he is talking about would come from RTE.</P>

      <P>That is what I said, that you noted that point.  The Labour Party seem to be wondering about the constitutionality of what the Minister is proposing. Effectively their amendment is saying that the £5 million would come from RTE because very few of the private small radio stations would have a revenue in excess of £1 million.  People know my stance on this.</P>

      <P>All the Deputies on various sides have been asking the Minister to be flexible and to be willing to change but any time the Minister has made an amendment to the Bill he has been criticised.  When the Minister made his original remarks about RTE 2 and 2FM and so on he was criticised. When the Bill as published was changed by the Minister he was again criticised.  When the Minister made another change in response to demands by outside interests and Members of this House including Members of his own backbench, he was again criticised.  If the Opposition parties had adopted a more constructive stance right through this debate rather than engaging in the nonsense that went on over the last two or three weeks with personalised attacks on the Minister, making this probably the most vitriolic debate in this House for a considerable number of years, we would have had a Bill that could have been amended.  Instead, the Opposition were more interested in personalised attacks on the Minister.  I very much regret that and the effect it has had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the fact that the Minister has in his amendment added half a minute to the time allowed to RTE for advertising.  I would like to see more time being given but half a minute is a concession. I would like the Minister to clarify that this ranges over all of RTE stations because that will mean two and <Col N="1419" /> a half minutes extra advertising time.  I also acknowledge the Minister's move in postponing the implementation of the Act until October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments deal in the main with the time limits proposed for advertising on RTE and seek either to delete the limits which I have proposed or radically alter them.  We have in addition Labour Party amendment, No. 14, incorporating their levy proposal.</P>
      <P>First I should deal with my own amendment, No. 17, which proposes to increase the maximum advertising per hour to five minutes.</P>
      <P>As I explained yesterday, this amendment has a twofold objective.  First it is a response to the concerns about charity advertising and is intended to enable RTE to continue their current practice of offering a maximum of seven minutes per day of discounted charity advertising on their radio services only.  But it goes further than that.  It is also a response to representations I received, including those from ICTU, who felt that the original 4.5 minute limit was too restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins yesterday had some difficulty understanding how I could be responding to two different sets of representations in the one amendment.  I must confess that I am confused at the Deputy's confusion.  The situation is quite straightforward.  I am giving RTE the extra half minute so that they can continue to offer their discount rate to charities on their radio services up to the maximum of seven minutes currently allowed &mdash; an allowance that would not necessarily be fully used up every day. But the concession enables RTE to go further because it will apply to the totality of their services, including television. This is the context in which I am responding to the ICTU representations.  Part of the concern with the original limit is that it would not be adequate to enable RTE to reach the revenue cap limit &mdash; or at least not without swingeing price increases which might deter advertisers.  By increasing the minutes to five per hour, RTE will be able to bring in the better <Col N="1420" /> part of an additional £2 million a year at current rates.  This will modify the kind of price increases that RTE might otherwise have had to implement to attain the revenue cap level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>Rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This in turn explains &mdash; for Deputy Mitchell's benefit &mdash; what I said yesterday about the value of the five minute concession.  Contrary to his allegations I never said that the five minutes implied a £2 million bonus on the revenue cap level.  I was very careful to say only that it had an equivalent value in current terms of almost £2 million a year.</P>
      <P>Obviously I cannot accept the various amendments proposed to the time limits. This is not due to any stubbornness on my part or an unwillingness to listen to what are I am sure well intentioned proposals from the Opposition.  It is due rather to a fundamental disagreement of principle between the Government side and the Opposition.  What we are doing is creating the conditions for fairer competition in the broadcasting sector.  What the relevant section of the Bill is doing is reducing the time limit for advertising on RTE to half that allowed for the independent sector and the rationale for that limit is that RTE have the exclusive benefit, to the extent of about half their broadcasting income, of licence fee revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This unfortunately seems to be a point missed by Deputy FitzGerald who still seems in his contribution to come from a position of &ldquo;only a monopoly position on broadcasting&rdquo; in this country.  There is now a series of stations, about 20 stations around the country to which, according to a recent audience survey, over a million people are listening.  Deputy FitzGerald who, perhaps more than most Deputies, has talked in this House about pluralism, when we are going towards pluralism in broadcasting, harkens back to the old monopoly days.  It is a bit sad that time passes him by.  There are I am sure other ways of levelling the famous playing pitch.  Some have advocated that <Col N="1421" /> perhaps we should have done away totally with the licence fee and allowed all broadcasters to compete purely on a commercial basis which, undoubtedly, would have been a politically popular move, at least in the short term.  Indeed, that would be the logical extension of the point advocated from the benches opposite last night when it was argued that there should be no time restrictions at all on advertising on RTE, that RTE should be allowed maximise revenue from that source and the benefits passed on to the public through lower licence fees.</P>
    <P>My own view is that such a move would be too radical and too traumatic for RTE. Likewise, while we initially proposed that the way to create fairer competitive conditions would be to give all broadcasters a share of the licence fee &mdash; with the lion's share still going to RTE &mdash; it was clear from the reaction of this House, and also from the confusion created among the public, that there was a large degree of unacceptability with that approach.  And so we have adopted the approach of limiting RTE's role in the advertising sector on the basis I outlined above.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Labour Party's proposal.  First, all I should say that I welcome the proposal in that it is an attempt to be constructive and it recognises, at last, the fundamental issues which my legislative proposals have sought to address.  For this I am certainly grateful.  I must also say that I am amazed and astounded at this proposal given the criticism and villification I came in for from that side of the House when I first announced my original proposals to divert licence fee revenue to the IRTC to enable the independent broadcasting sector to meet its public service obligations. The fact of the matter is that there is no significant difference in practice between what the Labour Party are now proposing and my original proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look a little closer at the Labour Party proposal.  The suggestion is that there would be a levy on all broadcasting services with a gross advertising revenue of more than £1 million and that this would be paid over to the IRTC to enable independent stations meet their public service obligations.</P>
      <P>There are only three independent stations at present whose gross revenue may hit the £1 million mark, and even then they will only exceed that level by a marginal amount if at all.  This means that the vast bulk of the proposed levy would come from RTE &mdash; a levy of 8 per cent on RTE's gross advertising revenue of some £58 million would bring in around £4.64 million.  A levy on the excess over £1 million from the three independent stations would not even go near making up the £400,000 difference to reach the proposed £5 million figure.</P>
      <P>In practice there is little or no difference between my original proposal to divert licence fee revenue to the IRTC and the Labour Party proposal to divert revenue from, in essence, RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the labels have changed.  It was clear that such proposals were unacceptable not just to many Members but among the public at large. We have gone beyond the point of no return on this question.  Having accepted that the idea of diverting revenue to the IRTC was not acceptable to the House, I was left with little alternative but to deal with the matter by addressing the role of RTE in the advertising market.  In those circumstances I cannot accept the Labour Party amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make one final point in relation to the Labour Party and I will sit down within 15 seconds.  The independent stations already pay a levy of 3 per cent on their contracts to support the IRTC.  RTE pay nothing for their licence which is in contrast to the position in the UK where, for instance, the BBC must pay a significant sum to the State for the <Col N="1423" /> frequency spectrum they use.  I commend the remainder of my amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, on <Col N="1432" /> a point of order I do not think it is appropriate simply to go on with the business of the House.  I suggest to you, Sir, that the only way we can get the business of this House properly back on tracks, the only way the Government have any semblance of a means of recovering some of the honour they have thrown away here is to go back to the point in our proceedings where a motion under Standing Order 102 was validly moved.  I would suggest to you, Sir, that there is not any way in which a motion under Standing Order 102 can be engulfed or wrapped up in the time motion, as was attempted to be done here earlier.  The motion was moved, it was proper to move it, it was moved at a point before the order for the Fifth Stage of this Bill had been made.  It is specifically provided for here, Sir, that that can be done and that it is only if the motion is opposed that statements have to be made on it.</P>
      <P>I would suggest, Sir, that you go back to the point in our proceedings at which that motion had been accepted by the Chair and let us see then what the proper procedures of this House will then produce.</P>

I put it to you, Sir, that you are the guardian of the conduct of business in this House.  In <Col N="1433" /> relation to this evening's business I believe that when you take decisions which certainly baffle at least half of the Members of this House we are entitled to an explanation.  The motion under Standing Order 102 was correctly moved. It was disputed by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the first instance.  It was then accepted when he was reminded that you yourself, Sir, had said earlier in this debate that it could be moved at any time.  I believe it was properly moved and should have been taken.  It leaves an unfortunate odour in relation to the conduct of business in this House.  You have a responsibility, Sir, to ensure that our business is conducted openly and fairly with regard to all Members of this House.</P>

Precedents and conventions are not necessarily binding if a case went to <Col N="1434" /> court.  In this case the motion was not declared out of order; it just was not put; at least it must be put.

      <P>I understand there is agreement to dispose of the Motion and the amendment thereto:</P>
      <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Quinn on 10 July 1990:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the historically high levels of emigration, aware of the continuing 16.5 per cent. rate of unemployment in the labour market and the present crisis in agriculture, concerned at the regressive impact of Government cutbacks in health, education and housing, views with alarm the Government's disarray in the ordering of its domestic legislative programme and its total failure at EC level to spell out a clear and formal position concerning Ireland's interests in Economic and Monetary Union and Political Union within the European Community, anxious to ensure positive economic and social progress within the process of the completion of the Single Market by 1992, demands that the Government prepare and publish a comprehensive economic and social programme in consultation with the Oireachtas by December, 1990 so as to restore political and social confidence by all of our people in the ability of the Government and the Oireachtas to meet the needs of our society. </P>
      <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;welcomes the transformation of the economy since 1986 which reversed the economic stagnation and declining living standards of preceding years; improved the public finances following the record high current budget deficit of 1986; reduced the National Debt/GNP ratio following the virtual <Col N="1444" /> doubling of the Debt in the four previous years; restored growth to the economy at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent; increased employment; reduced unemployment; enabled substantial real increases in social welfare benefits and significant reductions in income tax rates; brought about low levels of inflation and interest rates; and increased exports which brought the balance of payments into surplus; recognises the central role in these achievements of the policy strategy of the <i>Programme for National Recovery;</i> acknowledges the contribution of the various social and economic partners to its successful negotiation and implementation; and urges the Government to maintain its successful efforts to promote economic and social progress, based on a further Programme of Development agreed between the Government and the social and economic partners; and, with the support of the European Community and the co-operation of the social and economic partners, to prepare the economy to confront successfully the challenges of the Single Market and Economic and Monetary Union&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,254,664,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health <Col N="1445" /> Boards, miscellaneous grants, and a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The gross non-capital provision in the estimates amounts to £1,389.214 million. Allowing for Appropriations-in-Aid at £163.75 million, the net non-capital grant provision is £1,225.464 million, of which £7.6 million is national lottery funded. The net non-capital provision represents over 21 per cent of total Government expenditure on supply services as compared with under 20 per cent in 1989.</P>
    <P>The net non-capital grant provision represents an increase of £82.332 million on the corresponding out-turn figure for 1989.</P>
    <P>This year sees a signficant improvement for those in receipt of health cash allowances.  Increases of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in these allowances have been provided for.  The provision takes account of certain special pay awards and phase III of the general pay increase under the 1987 agreement on pay in the public service.</P>
    <P>The level of non-capital expenditure approvable on the basis of the subhead provisions in the Estimate is £1,391.975 million.  It comprises £873.154 million in respect of pay, £441.601 million in respect of non-pay, and £77.220 million in respect of cash allowances.  When account is taken of the directly generated income of health agencies the total expenditure in 1990 will be £1,502.975 million.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for 1990 is £37.7 million.  Of this, £22.7 million is being provided from the Exchequer, £12 million by extra-Exchequer receipts comprised of £11 million equipment loans for new facilities, £1 million from sales of properties, and £3 million is being made available from the lottery.  In addition, a provision of £3.5 million was made for systems development and related services in the health agencies.  Funds will be spent on priority projects which are designed to maintain and improve the infrastructure of the health services.</P>
    <P>The 1990 capital programme makes provision for expenditure on all the major components of the health services, <Col N="1446" /> including general hospitals, psychiatric services, services for the handicapped and community health and welfare services.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present in the process of drawing up a comprehensive five year capital programme covering all the major components of the health services and I expect to have decisions made on this programme in the context of the 1991 Estimates.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the health services in 1990 are reviewed it will be seen as a year of consolidation and renewal.  It will also be seen to be year in which a number of very important initiatives were taken to shape the services for the future.</P>
    <P>When I made a statement to the House on 6 February 1990, I outlined a detailed action plan for the year.  I set out in considerable detail a range of initiatives which would be taken this year.  I am very pleased to confirm that very good progress has been made on this action programme.  In the short time available to me this evening, I would like to report to the House on those aspects of the programme which have been priorities during the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>First, I made a firm commitment that overall hospital activity throughout 1990 would be maintained at the latter half of 1989 levels.  I also gave an undertaking that the agreed cost of the additional activity arising from the 'flu epidemic would be met in such a way that it would not intrude on the services to be provided this year.  I am glad to report that both these commitments have been honoured in full and that health boards and hospitals have been enabled to maintain acute hospital activity at the agreed levels.</P>
    <P>In my February statement, I indicated that a number of initiatives would be taken to improve efficiency in the health services.  In particular, I mentioned that studies would be undertaken by Professor David Kennedy on the acute hospital services in Dublin and that Mr. Noel Fox would conduct an efficiency review of acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>In regard to the efficiency review, I expect to receive a report on the first <Col N="1447" /> phase of Mr. Fox's assignment around the end of August.  I will, in due course, make a full statement on the action which will be taken on foot of the report.</P>
    <P>Professor Kennedy has submitted an interim report.  He has made recommendations on steps which can be readily taken to streamline acute hospital services in Dublin.  He has identified a number of areas which need urgent attention, including the development of improved diagnostic, treatment and rehabilitation services for the elderly.  He has also strongly recommended the development of new structures for the planning and delivery of health services in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Professor Kennedy has identified the best practices in use in hospitals and has recommended that these be quickly extended to all acute hospitals in the Dublin area.  The measures to be taken by the acute hospitals in Dublin include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the adoption of an admissions policy in each hospital, supported by an intensive bed management policy;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of one-day and five-day wards, specifically to deal with planned admissions;</P>
    <P>&mdash;senior medical staff to become more involved in decision making in accident and emergency departments when decisions are being taken on further hospital treatment; priority to be given by medical staff to their accident and emergency commitments on the days when they are on take;</P>
    <P>&mdash;more effective diagnostic support for accident and emergency departments and improved liaison with general practitioners;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a more systematic approach to planning of discharge for patients in need of follow-up care; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;improved public education on the use of hospital services. </P>
    <P>I accept these recommendations and <Col N="1448" /> have already asked each of the acute hospitals in Dublin to produce a plan to implement them in advance of the seasonal increase in emergency admissions during the winter.  The implementation and impact of these measures will be closely monitored by my Department, working with a term drawn from the membership of the Kennedy Group.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to act on the recommendations made by Professor Kennedy in relation to the improvement of services for the elderly.  While there will be some additional resources required to implement fully what is necessary, I believe that we can make considerable progress on a number of fronts without further delay.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I made available £4.5 million additional funds to health boards to develop home and community-based services for the elderly.  Important improvements in services are taking place throughout the country, such as expansion of day care places, appointment of additional public health nurses, extension of home nursing and improvement of staffing ratios in existing homes for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Because of the extent and rate of expansion of the population of elderly people in the greater Dublin area, a substantial share of the additional funds has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board.  Further funds will be made available to provide additional places in nursing homes, which will help to relieve pressure on the acute hospital services in Dublin as advocated by Professor Kennedy.</P>
    <P>My Department have already had discussions with a number of the major Dublin hospitals about the provision of a comprehensive specialist medical service for the elderly.  I have been encouraged by the positive response of the hospitals and their commitment to finding ways and means of developing such a service within their existing resources.  My Department are developing proposals for a pilot project in rehabilitation of the elderly and I am having discussions with the National Medical Rehabilitation <Col N="1449" /> Centre to explore the contribution which they can make in this field.</P>
    <P>I also accept the conclusions drawn by the group as to the unsatisfactory nature of the organisational structures in Dublin, and changes to bring about significant improvements to deal with this are under active consideration at the moment.</P>
    <P>Medical consultants are one of the key groups in the delivery of hospital care. The recent report on the pay and conditions of medical consultants by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, under the chairmanship of Mr. Dermot Gleeson, presented a clear analysis of many of the problems associated with the provisions of services at consultant level.  It looked at the question of pay and conditions for consultants in a comprehensive way and clearly points to the need to consider the issues together rather than in isolation.  I do not wish to pre-empt the discussions with the medical profession, which now are being arranged, but I believe that these recommendations provide a satisfactory basis on which to structure the future relationships between patients, consultants and management.</P>
    <P>Last year I announced the introduction of a new drug cost subsidisation scheme to alleviate the position of people with limited eligibility and a requirement for long-term prescription medication.  I am very pleased to announce that my Department have now reached agreement with the contractors' committee of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on the introduction of this scheme, and that acceptances has been recommended to the members.  I hope to make a full announcement, giving details of the scheme, when balloting is completed later this month.  The implementation of this scheme will be of particular benefit to those with chronic conditions, such as asthma.</P>
    <P>A new three year agreement was negotiated between my Department and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries on the price of drugs.  This agreement provides a satisfactory basis for the control of drug prices on the Irish market, <Col N="1450" /> and will have immediate benefits for both the Exchequer and the private purchaser.</P>
    <P>Our presidency of the EC was very successful from a health perspective, and I am confident future Presidencies will build on the positive and constructive work that we achieved: Tobacco &mdash; A directive harmonising reduced tar levels in cigarettes was adopted; Cancer &mdash; A 50 million ECU Europe Against Cancer Programme for 1990-94 was agreed which will focus on cancer prevention, health information and education, training of health professionals and research; Drug Abuse and AIDS &mdash; The EC Council of Health Ministers agreed programmes to develop plans and strategies in these areas: and completion of the internal market where considerable progress was achieved relating to foodstuffs and medicinal products.</P>
    <P>I adopted <i>Youth and Positive Health</i> as the theme to run through our Presidency. I put a special emphasis on health education and the promotion of positive lifestyles among our young people.  This initiative was widely supported by all the EC Health Ministers and will now form the basis for future policy programmes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have outlined briefly the initiatives which are being taken to get the maximum return from the investment by the State in the health services and to improve those services in a number of key areas.  The action programme has already brought beneficial results in the hospital and community care sectors, and when fully implemented, will have created a significantly improved environment for a first class health service.</P>
    <P>I believe that with the resources made available by the Government, and the policy initiatives detailed in this statement, the right standards of health care which our society rightly expects will continue to be provided.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ivan Yates.  We were a little late commencing this debate on health.  It was due to commence at 8.45 p.m. but I want the agreement of the House to ensure that we conform to the Order of the House <Col N="1451" /> proper and that it concludes as stipulated at 9.45 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We still have ten minutes. I must deplore the short time given for this very important debate but now I will proceed as fast as I can.  The last major debate we had on health in this House was in June.  Many of the health issues which generated so much public concern over the last year still remain unresolved. There remains a two-tier health service which means public patients dependent on the State service still have to wait unacceptably long periods for hospital treatments and are denied access to other services.  None of the underlying problems in the health service requiring reform have been dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is disgraceful that we now have 730 adults awaiting cardiac surgery in the Mater Hospital and these queues are being lengthened due to the fact that there are only 25 public beds there. Despite promises, the reduction in the level of surgery there has put lives seriously at risk and the Minister must immediately make available extra resources to ensure the maximum throughput of patients.  Similarly, the waiting period for total hip replacements is still a matter of years.  Many elderly people right across the country are mobile only by virtue of walking aids and are in severe pain.  The Minister's promises to resolve this problem have barely touched the surface and in no way resolved it.  Again this summer we are facing the prospect of summer ward closures which will result in further delays in access to hospital for selective patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December we saw thousands of the friends and relatives of the mentally handicapped on the streets demanding justice for the mentally handicapped. National studies now show there is an inevitable demand for an additional 800 residential places for adult mentally handicapped persons and a further 1,000 similar day care places.  The onus is on the Minister to organise planned capital allocations of finance over the next five years to ensure that the families of the <Col N="1452" /> handicapped are not expected to cope alone.  Repeatedly I am advised of cases of elderly parents who are fearful of the lack of care to be provided for their handicapped son or daughter after their own lifetime.  Platitudes are no substitute for proper hostel, day care and rehabilitation facilities.</P>
    <P>In regard to dental services, the Government have failed utterly to provide an adult dental service for routine treatments.  In the mid-eighties adult medical card holders and their dependants could go to their local clinics and obtain approval for referral to a local dentist for treatment.  Despite many protestations inside and outside the Dáil there is now only an emergency extraction service.  Old age pensioners are being asked to pay over £300 for a set of dentures privately.  The Minister for Health in conjunction with the Dental Council has still not established the auxiliary post of denturist to sell dentures to the public more cheaply.  An approved training course and qualification procedure should be established to allow for a proper career structure for this specialist group.  The Government have also failed to recruit full-time orthodontists to the health boards.  Through a change in the contract of employment to allow some level of private practice this problem could be overcome.  Many children face real anxiety and depression from badly formed teeth and cannot get enough priority points to be treated.  There is no national dental prevention programme involving water flouridation, fissure sealants and dental maintenance for school children.</P>
    <P>I turn to AIDS, a most serious public health issue facing this country and the world in the nineties.  It is reckoned conservatively that some 20,000 people will be HIV positive by the end of this decade. It is vital that we now put in place the best possible AIDS prevention programme to attempt to control the spread of the disease and to meet the care requirements of these patients.  We need the immediate appointment of a second consultant to the gum clinic to treat patients.  We need proper continuous funding from the <Col N="1453" /> Department of Health for the unit in St. James's, not the British Medical Council for research grants or <i>ad hoc</i> lottery funding. We need proper counselling services, and supplementary welfare allowance payments to meet the specialist needs of heating, dietary and mobility expenses of AIDS patients.  We need a code of practice to outlaw discrimination against AIDS patients in the workplace.  Sheltered housing and home care nursing are required for AIDS patients.  We need a national advertising campaign to promote a greater understanding and to provide information on the prevalence of the disease, as is the case in Britain.  I regret that despite the best efforts of the national AIDS co-ordinator, all the Government have done is to try to sweep this disease under the carpet because of its stigmatised nature.  There are no guilty or innocent victims of AIDS.  They all deserve our care and compassion.  This is a policy of serious neglect that will lead to tragic and fatal consequences in the future.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months the Minister for Health constantly rejected my claims that huge savings could be made in the cost of drugs.  Yet, the drug industry volunteered a saving of £14 million, or 10 per cent, in order to obtain another purchasing agreement.  They were desperate to get any agreement to avoid a free-for-all. We could have made a further £10 million savings with the substitution of off-patent branded medicines by generic drugs of equivalent composition.  In Sweden there is a very simple technique. On the prescription form there is a blank square and unless the doctor puts an X in that square, the chemist must use a generic drug.  If the doctor wants a branded product to be used he can put an X in the square.  This would save millions of pounds because generic drugs are 25 per cent to 30 per cent cheaper than branded drugs.  I call on the Minister to make this simple change for obvious cost benefits.</P>
    <P>The biggest practical problem facing many hospitals is the lack of availability of specialist nursing staff to recruit, and our over-dependence on non-EC foreign <Col N="1454" /> doctors at non-consultant hospital level is very worrying.  The root cause of both of these problems is the massive level of emigration by our nurses and doctors, which in total runs into tens of thousands over recent years.  This is turn is due to a crisis in morale of health workers because of the high level of stress, the poor level of pay and conditions, and the lack of planning in the health service. The Minister must immediately tackle this by first improving the incremental payments for specialist nursing posts.  The pay difference between an ordinary staff nurse and a nurse in an operating theatre or working in intensive care is only £226 a year.  These are the people who are going abroad.  We need to increase the increments for those nurses.  We need to relax the embargo and recruit a further 1,000 nurses so that we will not have the scandal of people working full time in temporary positions.  We should also implement the Gleeson report to revise the circumstances for our consultant doctors.  All of these measures will show that we appreciate the work of the health staff and will restore morale.</P>
    <P>In relation to the elderly we need to immediately improve our community care services.  We should implement a central recommendation of the care of the aged report &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;, whereby panels of district nurses would be available on a part-time basis under the guidance of district nurses and public health nurses to provide the same nursing care that is available in hospital.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will state, when replying, what the new levels of subvention will be in the nursing homes arising from the Nursing Homes Bill.  We need to know that elderly people will be looked after in nursing homes during the coming winter when other beds are not available.  We need the appointment of more geriatricians.</P>
    <P>Through the work of the special Dáil committee the Child Care Bill has passed Committee Stage.  Before this is enacted child care services will have to be improved in order to implement the proposed changes.  New facilities such as supervision orders will require extra care <Col N="1455" /> and social workers.  We need localised referral centres for abused children.  We need a larger panel of foster parents, children's courts and a national children's council.  We also need sheltered accommodation for homeless children.  The Bill will be meaningless when enacted unless these other services are put in place.</P>
    <P>In relation to community care there are two appalling difficulties at present. There was a report saying that a further 300 speech therapists are required.  We also need occupational therapists.  The waiting lists for speech therapy are so long now that children will not get a service within their formative years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should carry out an immediate study in relation to the health costs between North and South.  According to figures given by the Minister in reply to a Dáil question it takes a little over £1 billion to provide a health service for 1.5 million people in Northern Ireland whereas in the Republic it costs £1.39 billion to provide a health service for 3.5 million people.  This means that it costs £395 <i>per capita</i> to run a health service in the Republic and £632 <i>per capita</i> in the North.  What are the reasons for these huge discrepancies?  Either we are under-funded here or they have a much better service in the North.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has still not announced major reforms necessary in the structures of the health service.  The Minister is still sticking with the health boards when no later than today in the Kennedy report they have been proved not to have been the answer for the future.  The report clearly recommends new structures for liaison between hospitals and community care.  The current <i>ad hoc</i> approach is short-sighted and will not succeed in obtaining greater efficiency.  We need the radical reform that this House is demanding.</P>
    <P>I regret that despite the preparation of two more reports under the chairmanship of Fox and Kennedy, the basic inequality between the private and public patients, which led to the motion of no confidence in the Minister earlier this year still remains.  Morale amongst health workers <Col N="1456" /> has never been lower.  The vital services, particularly for children, are non-existent in many parts of the country.  The waiting lists for hospital operations are still unacceptably long and in some cases the lists are lengthening.  A comprehensive plan has not been put in place to meet the future crisis of AIDS and structural reforms have not been implemented in the delivery of health care.  Unless the Minister acts decisively immediately, the next winter will see another crisis in the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a certain weariness in rising to speak on what for many is an annual ritual.  Since I was appointed Labour Party spokesperson on health in 1987 I sought to evaluate the effect of Government health policy and financial allocations on the quality of the health service that had been built up to be the pride of Ireland.  All of us shared pride in our health service.  The year 1987 when I was appointed to this portfolio turned out to be a significant year.  The year was characterised by health cuts and savagery which has since shaped all our discussions and arguments on health issues.  The shock waves of that cruel year still reverberate around this country.  I get no satisfaction in July 1990 from saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  I predicted as far back as 1987 the consequences of a policy which had a fiscal core and no health strategy, one that was devised not in the Department of Health but in the Department of Finance and implemented by a Minister who decided that he need not have a health policy at all.  All of Ireland saw my predictions become a reality.</P>
      <P>We are a caring people.  It is part of our uniqueness that we care for one another and particularly for the weak and the sick.  It is a tribute commented upon by people who visit this country.  If we have a national consensus about anything it is that health care above all else is a basic human right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospitals which this Minister closed in 1987 remain closed and the beds he closed remain shut and out of service. The staff that were available then are no longer at the service of the Irish people. However, I still have a duty and a <Col N="1457" /> responsibility to continually highlight the facts whenever I have an opportunity to do so in this House in the hope that the situation will be redressed.  We have had some success in the last few years in highlighting the most glaring defects and deficiencies in the health services so that the Minister can try to redress them.  We have had many debates on specific issues that have been touched on since.</P>
    <P>One of the earliest decisions of the Minister was to establish a Commission on Health Funding and this important group presented a detailed and valuable report to him towards the end of last summer.  The long promised response from the Government to this report is still awaited.  The Minister, instead, saw fit to respond to a no confidence motion in February of this year by establishing two more working groups to give him yet more time.  One group is chaired by Mr. Noel Fox and it will look into the efficiencies of acute hospitals.  The second group, chaired by Mr. David Kennedy, will examine admission policies, out-patient arrangements and discharge arrangements in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House last February that these initiatives would produce results within that Dáil session and allow him to bring more detailed and specific plans to the Government before the summer recess.  Where are the plans? Where are the legislative proposals that must follow the detailed survey and analysis that the working groups carried out? When we hear from the Minister we hear about plans to establish committees or set up review groups.  He has been in office for three-and-a-half years, a period longer than many of his predecessors, and he continues to try to avoid responsibility for his actions and to refer to previous administrations.  He continues to avoid making clear policy decisions.  Tonight the Minister told us about Professor Kennedy's review but I should like to known when we can expect to get the Minister's view, or the view of the Government, on the legislative proposals they have, if any, to address the crisis that has existed for years in the health service.  The Minister <Col N="1458" /> should remember that he has had statutory and legal responsibility for more than three years.</P>
    <P>The Minister's main legacy to date has been his axe-wielding.  I finally received at the end of May a reply to my parliamentary question of January 30 concerning hospital bed closures.  In conjunction with that I received a letter from the Minister outlining the number of beds closed from 31 December 1986 to January 1990.  The Minister told me that the number of hospital acute beds closed was 2,331, that 323 geriatric beds were closed and that 221 district hospital beds were closed.  It was not surprising that the Minister in the covering letter urged me to exercise caution in dealing with those figures.  The result of those closures is evident to all Members and citizens.</P>
    <P>Today I asked the Minister to indicate the number of people on the waiting lists in each health board area for hip replacements or other orthopaedic procedures, and he told me that the waiting list for hip replacement in the Eastern Health Board area was 840 and that there are 2,700 on the waiting list for other elective procedures in that health board area. There are hundreds in each health board area awaiting hip replacement and other elective procedures.  The Minister cannot deny that; he supplied me with the list today.  Among the thousands of people on the waiting lists are people who are suffering.  I wrote to a constituent of mine this week who has been waiting for some time for a hip replacement.  After contacting the orthopaedic surgeon in my area I had to tell that person that the chances of getting a hip replacement were virtually nil.  I told that person that she had been on a routine waiting list since 21 April 1988 and that the list included patients who had been waiting since October 1986.  I told that constituent that until her doctor certified her as an absolute priority there was no hope of her obtaining a hip replacement.  I know that that person is suffering.  Doctors, in trying to determine priority cases, must test one person's suffering against that of another.</P>
    <P>At Question Time today the Minister <Col N="1459" /> acknowledged that there are 20,000 children waiting for orthodontic care and he had the neck to boast that fewer than 600 cases are being dealt with annually because of his extra allocation.  That is a big deal.</P>

      <P>I have said in the past that health cuts adversely affect women in particular, and they are the cares in our society.  I am not asking the House to take my word for that but to consider the contents of a letter I received from the secretary of the midwives section of the Irish Nurses Organisation who could not be described as a militant with an axe to grind.  The secretary asked me to bring the contents of her letter to the attention of the Dáil and to the notice of Dr. O'Hanlon.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>The midwives section of the Irish Nurses Organisation deplore the downgrading of health services for women.  As a nation we value motherhood so highly that we have enshrined the contribution women make as mothers in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The letter lists the services that have been savaged and continues:</P>
      <P>Women are now expected to travel long distances to avail of essential antenatal care.  Prior to the health cutbacks maternity hospitals and units funded &ldquo;satellite clinics&rdquo; where the maternity team rendered appropriate antenatal care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latter is no longer available.  The letter referred to the lack of follow-up after a birth and pointed out that it was now common practice to discharge women after 48 hours into the ill-equipped community services.  It pointed to the lack of trained and experienced neonatal nurses, the lack of advice in relation to fertility and the ever-extending waiting lists for gynaecological operations. In fact, I received three pages of complaints from the INO in relation to <Col N="1460" /> the services for women.  I have files upon files on the Minister's failures.</P>
    <P>I referred to the need for services for the mentally handicapped at length in the course of a debate earlier this year, but the residential places I called for have not been provided and we need respite care for those who shared 24 hours of every day looking after mentally handicapped people.  What does the Minister intend to do about them?  AIDS has virtually disappeared from the agenda and we only had a passing reference to it tonight by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I will end my contribution on health policy with a quotation from the Council for Social Welfare of the Catholic Bishops' Conference.  They said:</P>
    <P>Health policy in Ireland is at a critical point: either firm decisions are taken now about the kind of health care system we want or the drift of recent years towards a markedly two-tiered system will continue and, indeed, accelerate.  The council's submission to the Commission drew attention to the fact that the trend towards a greatly expanded private system and the widening gap between it and the public system, had emerged without any public or political debate signifying that the community actually wanted it.</P>
    <P>The people want a public health service, the Minister has failed to provide it and I demand that he respond to the real crisis that exists and not delude himself any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that I will be opposing the Estimate as The Workers' Party consider that the amount allocated is inadequate to meet the health needs of our people. The structural and financial problems of the health services, which led to such chaos in our hospitals last winter, have not been addressed.  Another outbreak of 'flu next winter will almost certainly mean a repeat of that problem with beds in corridors and patients in need being turned away.  The Workers' Party have never suggested that additional money on its own would bring about a better <Col N="1461" /> health service.  However, combined with I a restructuring of the service, additional funding could give the Irish people a health service that would be among the best in Europe.  The reality is, however, that the proportion of gross national product we spend on our health service has been steadily falling and unless there is a decision to bring the level of spending back up in a planned and phased way the problems will remain.</P>
      <P>Health spending in 1983 accounted for 7.61 per cent of GNP and was gradually brought down to 7.1 per cent by 1986.  It fell to 6.6 per cent in 1987 and 6.24 per cent in 1988.  By 1989 it was down to 5.72 per cent and this year it will be around the same figure.  The average spending on health in OECD countries is about 8 per cent of GNP.  We believe that spending on health in this country must be raised in a planned and phased way to this level.  Even with this increase there would still be a need to control expenditure and to plan the most efficient possible use of our resources especially as the demand for health services is likely to grow with the changes in our population structure and the increase in the proportion of elderly people.</P>
      <P>One of the major failings of our national health policy over the years has been its lack of long-term planning.  It has been expanded where necessary on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and has been cut back on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis when the pressure came on for cutbacks in Government spending.  We need a proper long-term plan and strategy both in regard to the provision of services and how they should be financed. It is not as if we are short of studies or reports.  There are any amount of them, but what has been lacking on the part of successive Governments has been the will to make the decision on long-term strategies and stick to them.  The most recent example is the report of the Commission on Health Funding.  This report which was the culmination of almost two years of work by the members of the commission amounted to more than 400 pages.  It was published last September, but since then seems to have totally disappeared off the Government agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> During the debate on the noconfidence motion in February, the Minister for Health announced the appointment of two further committees or initiatives, as he described them &mdash; one headed by Mr. Noel Fox and another by Mr. David Kennedy.  Six months later nothing else has been heard of these initiatives.  The time is gone for committees or examinations, what is required now are decisions and commitments.  I hope that as contained in the Minister's statement here tonight there will be action in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another promise made by the Minister during the no confidence debate, was the establishment of a national patients charter. Again, nothing further has been heard of this. The Workers' Party has long sought a Charter of Patients Rights which would guarantee the right to equality of treatment on the basis of need, equality of access and care when in hospital, and information and access to personal medical records.  The health services are there to serve the needs of the patients, and the Department of Health, the medical and nursing professions and the administrators must never lose sight of this important principle.</P>
    <P>One sector, which very often seems to lose sight of this principle is the consultants. When the Gleeson Committee recommended last month huge increases in the salaries paid to consultants &mdash; providing in some cases for salaries of up to £50,000 per year &mdash; I was prepared to support them given that the other changes recommended in their contracts might lead to an improved service for the members of the public.  Now we find that the consultants have rejected the proposed new contract as they consider that it might interfere with their right to earn more from private practice.</P>
    <P>I believe that the time has now come to take a strong stand with the consultants. There must be no question of paying the increased salaries unless the consultants are also prepared to accept fully the other recommendations regarding the new contract. Consultants with public appointments should be required to treat all <Col N="1463" /> patients, whether public or private, on the same basis and in the same manner, that is in the same room or out-patients department, under the same conditions and from the same waiting lists.  GPs in the GMS are obliged to see patients on this basis, and consultants should be subjected to the same requirements.  Consultants have had a vested interest in ensuring that services for public patients were inferior to those for private patients, so that more people would be encouraged to take out private insurance and thus boost their incomes from private practice.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister at this time to look again at the eligibility level for medical cards.  Many people who badly need medical cards are being excluded on income grounds &mdash; especially when the tax on PRSI is not deductible in assessing eligibility.  Consequently many young couples rearing small children, and who are marginally over the limit, are not in a position to pay their general practitioner or to pay for drugs.</P>

    <P>Recently I welcomed the new agreement between the Department of Health and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, which will lead to a 10 per cent decrease in the price of drugs supplied under the GMS to hospitals and health boards.  I described the price reduction then as long overdue, as Irish drug prices have been among the highest <Col N="1464" /> in Europe.  Drug costs constitute the biggest single item of expenditure in the GMS and hopefully the money saved will allow for improvements of services in other areas.</P>
    <P>Many patients, however, will not benefit from the reduction in price which, it appears, will only apply to drugs supplied through the GMS.  Those who have not got medical cards and who buy prescribed drugs in the normal way from their chemist shops will, apparently, have to pay the existing prices.  I would ask the Minister for Health to pressurise the drug companies who have been allowed profiteer for too long at the expense of the sick and the taxpayer, to reduce drug prices for all patients.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the child care case that arose in the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice in the Supreme Court criticised the absence of legal aid in cases concerning the care and custody of children.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill, The Workers' Party representative sought to introduce an amendment to provide a comprehensive scheme of separate legal aid and advice for both parents and children in such cases.  The amendment was ruled out of order on the basis that an Opposition party was not entitled to propose an amendment which constituted a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I am now advising the Minister that there is no restriction on him and there is a clear obligation on him to act in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at the half way stage of 1990.  Progress had been made by the Minister for Health and by certain other Departments in managing our health services.  Progress was made on important legislation including the Child Care Bill, which has passed the Committee Stage, the Nursing Homes Bill, which is currently being considered by the Seanad and the passing of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill, which passed all Stages in both Houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health announced additional allocations totalling £10 million to improve services for the elderly, the mentally handicapped and dental services.</P>
      <P>The £5 million allocated to services for the elderly is being used to strengthen home nursing and home help support services, to provide increased day care, short-stay and long-stay care for the elderly and to provide additional home nursing places for the relief of families caring for dependent elderly people at home. Of the £3 million allocated to dental services, health boards have received £1 million to date in respect of the period March to June.  Each health board has been asked to supply details of the use to which the additional funding was put. The focus was on treating urgent orthodontic cases and improving the services available to eligible adults and children.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million of the £10 million was allocated to services for the mentally handicapped.  The emphasis has been on providing additional places in residential care, respite care, day care and family support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional co-ordination committees are drawing up five-year plans in accordance with criteria provided by the Department of Health.  It is expected that <Col N="1466" /> these plans will be available in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The special allocation provided in the 1990 budget has already made a significant improvement in dental services. More than 5,000 adults have begun courses of routine dental treatment through the new arrangements put in place by the health boards.  It is hoped that at least an additional 15,000 will benefit from the improved services during the current year, bringing to at least 20,000 the number who will benefit from the special allocation during this year.</P>
    <P>Part of that special budget allocation was used to begin the orthodontic treatment of a further 1,300 top priority cases from the orthodontic waiting lists, in addition to the 600 we initiated earlier, bringing the total to 1,900 and not 600 to which Deputy Howlin referred earlier. That is the number for whom treatment has commenced due to special allocations made by the Minister for Health in the past six months.</P>
    <P>The health boards have also adopted a planned strategy for the delivery of dental services for children based on the routine assessment of children in specific school classes.  This approach will help to provide a better routine service for children, with early diagnosis of problems, and should eliminate differences in the delivery of services identified in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is expensive.  It is only possible to provide the most expensive fixed, appliance-type therapy where the orthodontic problem is of sufficient gravity to warrant the treatment.  All children who apply for treatment will be assessed in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department with priority given to those children with the most serious conditions.</P>
    <P>The conditions attached to the posts of consultant orthodontists are at present under review to render them more attractive to suitable candidates.</P>

      <P>I might deal very briefly with some of the points raised. Deputy Howlin implied that I do not have a health policy.  He also accused me of buying time by establishing groups such as those led by Professor David Kennedy and Mr. Noel Fox.  I resent these assertions; they are untrue and distorted.  Indeed if the Deputy could bring some objectivity to bear on the issue he would accept that, after a period of particular and unavoidable difficulty, I might add, caused by the Coalition Government in office before us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will not be argumentative but I have to point out the facts.</P>
      <P>One thing I would like Deputy Howlin to do is give me the name of the patient he maintains has been waiting since 1988 for treatment because I will be glad to investigate that.  It has not been my experience that people now wait that long on the orthophaedic lists.  Indeed in this House a member of Deputy Howlin's party came in here one morning and spoke about a patient having travelled 40-miles, fasting to hospital, and having sat there all day, returning home without having anything done for him.  When my secretary telephoned the Deputy in question asking for the name of the patient, he said there was no such patient but that was the sort of thing that might happen.</P>

      <P>We would want to be careful that that does not recur.  I have <Col N="1469" /> worked to a policy since assuming office. I rationalised the hospitals.  We have built up the larger hospitals with those no longer needed being closed.  The Deputy is wrong in saying that all the hospitals that were to be closed have been closed. A number of them, such as Kilrush, Ennistymon, Brownswood in the Deputy's own county, are all open at present.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when we improved the agreement.  As I have already said, the drugs refund scheme will be of particular value to all patients with chronic illness including asthmatics.</P>
      <P>The psychiatric services have been developed on a community base over the years despite the restraints on finance. My colleague, the Minister of State, has already referred to mental handicap. While there has been a 13 per cent increase in inflation there has been a 25 per cent increase in the allocation to the voluntary organisations dealing with mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to AIDS, when I assumed office there was a mass media programme which had been ready for a number of <Col N="1470" /> months beforehand.  The then Government were afraid to introduce it; the two parties in Government could not agree on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £128,767,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal, I cannot hope to do more than highlight some aspects of my Department's work which are particularly important.</P>
      <P>To begin with I should highlight my main priorities at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> In the first place, we have had a successful Presidency of the European Community. Long-term unemployment has been put back on the Council's agenda and a programme for the implementation of the Social Charter has been drawn up.</P>
    <P>As regards the Community Support Framework, over £1 billion has been pledged by the Commission for the period to 1993 in respect of training activities.  This massive investment will further enhance our potential for economic development and growth.</P>
    <P>While there has been much activity in relation to European Community affairs, this has not hindered progress at home. Strike activity has fallen dramatically and the Industrial Relations Bill has passed all Stages in this House.  The Bill has been one of my main priorities since assuming office.  Its enactment will make a major contribution to improving industrial relations practices and procedures.</P>
    <P>As regards employment and unemployment the Live Register figures have fallen substantially.  Employment has begun to increase in the past few years, in contrast to the position in the early eighties.  With regard to training activities, major advances can be reported in respect of certification, apprenticeship and improved programmes for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Other areas in which considerable progress can be reported include safety measures and the establishment of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health and positive action for women.  I am also preparing, as a major priority, a Bill to provide for the extension of all labour legislation to part-time workers.  I intend to have a Bill drafted shortly.</P>
    <P>To complete this summary of main events, let me emphasise the overall progress which has been made in the past few years in economic and social development. A few years ago the very nature of our political institutions was being questioned as our inability to find solutions to our economic problems led to an air of hopelessness.  We have, however, effectively put the economy of this country <Col N="1472" /> back on its feet.  As we come to the end of the current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we stand at a crossroads.  The places on one sign are well known to us: high inflation, losses in real wages, job losses and debt traps.  The other sign points to a new programme for economic and social progress so that, once and for all, we can solve the problems which still remain with us and conquer the scourges of unemployment and emigration.  The choice is in our hands.  We have no option but to choose the road of consensus and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the issues I have mentioned in further detail.</P>
    <P>First, the main focus of activity during the first six months of this year has been the Irish Presidency of the European Community.  The huge amount of work involved has, I believe, been fully justified by a successful Presidency, which has drawn the attention of the other member states to Ireland and heightened awareness here of the European Community.</P>
    <P>My two priorities from the beginning were action to help the long-term unemployed and measures to implement the Social Charter.  I was very pleased that both my Presidency Resolution on Action to help the long-term unemployed and the Presidency timetable for the action programme were accepted by the Social Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Presidency programme we pursued was ambitious and broad in scope.  An additional major factor was introduced by the rapid developments in Eastern Europe.  These inevitably had an impact on the business of the Presidency, and they will continue to play an important part in Community matters for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say, however, that the Irish Presidency, with the full co-operation of other member states, dealt successfully with all the social affairs issues raised during its period of office.</P>
    <P>Turning now to economic development at home, we are receiving a massive injection of investment from the European Community through the Community Support Framework negotiated by the <Col N="1473" /> Government with the Commission last year.  Already since 1973 we have been approved for assistance from the European Social Fund alone of over £1,437 million.  For the period to 1993, the Commission has pledged a sum of £1 billion under the reformed European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to continue to make optimum use of the Fund for vocational training, for improved technological education and for schemes to train and rehabilitate the long-term unemployed.  This will further enhance our potential for economic development and growth.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations have a major part to play in supporting a climate conductive to investment.  Over the last few years there has been a marked improvement in the industrial relations environment.  Last year indeed was an exceptional year; the number of days lost through strikes was only 41,400, the lowest since 1944.</P>
    <P>Over-ambitious expectations could jeopardise this.  While the economic forecasts are optimistic, we are a small economy, exceptionally vulnerable to international economic developments in an increasingly competitive world.  We simply cannot afford the luxury of domestically generated policy mistakes.</P>
    <P>I have been anxious to ensure that the legislative framework on trade unions and collective bargaining makes a positive contribution to good industrial relations. In line with my commitment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, after extensive discussions with employers and unions, I introduced the Industrial Relations Bill to this House last December. The Bill has now passed the House and I am confident that its proposed measures will make an important contribution to better industrial relations in this country.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has led to major progress on a wide range of issues and the targets which it contained have been achieved and indeed in some areas far surpassed.  The success of the programme demonstrates the advantages of co-operation between the Government and the social partners, <Col N="1474" /> working together towards the attainment of common goals.  However, if we are to build on the achievements already made, it is essential to put a successor in place. I know it will not be easy to negotiate but, given commitment and goodwill on all sides, I know that we can achieve a programme for economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>1989 was the year in which the economic recovery began to yield a significant increase in real employment.  All the economic commentators are now agreed that total employment increased by between 10,000-12,000 net in 1989, or just over 1 per cent.  The prospects for 1990 are even more encouraging.  The ESRI is forecasting that total employment this year will be 16,000 higher than in 1989, while the Central Bank is only slightly more cautious.</P>
    <P>A heartening feature of the employment performance during 1989 was that fewer jobs were lost than at any time since 1979.  According to official statistics gathered by my Department, notified redundancies were down to 13,395 as against 23,037 in 1988.  This was the lowest annual total since 1979.</P>
    <P>This welcome development has continued during the first four months of 1990, with the number of notified redundancies almost 25 per cent lower than in the corresponding period in 1989.  If this trend lasts for the full year, it will ensure that the net employment effect of new jobs created will be even stronger than in 1989.</P>
    <P>By far the largest part of my Department's Vote over £114 million, will be spent this year on training and employment services.  This will given training and job creation places to 54,000 people in 1990.  This expenditure contributes significantly to the achievement of greater employment levels and to helping the unemployed.</P>
    <P>FÁS is developing certification for all its courses in conjunction with the City and Guilds of London.  This should enhance the attractiveness of FÁS courses for the unemployed and improve their job prospects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> The question of &ldquo;standards reached&rdquo; is also to the forefront in the apprenticeship review currently being undertaken by FÁS.  I am looking forward to receipt of the FÁS proposals for a revised apprenticeship' system later this year.</P>
    <P>In the case of the hotel and catering industry, demand for trained people now exceeds supply.  CERT has a very important role to play in meeting the targets set for tourism in the run up to 1993. CERT are expanding their training to over 9,000 in 1990.  More than 1,000 of these will be recruited from among the unemployed.</P>
    <P>A number of FÁS programmes are targeted particularly at the disadvantaged. These include Youthreach, the integrated programme of education, training and work experience for early school leavers.  In 1989 over 3,000 young people who had left school with no qualifications started on Youthreach.  While it is too early to assess the programme fully, I am confident that it is addressing the real needs of early school leavers.</P>
    <P>For the long-unemployed, I would like to mention in particular the social employment scheme, which is being expanded this year by 50 per cent to 15,000 places.</P>
    <P>Teamwork has been continued in 1990, despite the fact that assistance from the European Social Fund is no longer available. The employment incentive scheme has also been targeted more closely towards this group and other disadvantaged persons.</P>
    <P>The general measures to help the long-term unemployed, such as the social employment scheme and the employment incentive scheme, also provide assistance for employment blackspots.</P>
    <P>Additional measures are directed specifically at urban areas.  The end result will be that local facilities will be improved to the benefit of all residents.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Labour, I am committed to the improvement of the status of women in employment.  While the legislation relating to equal pay and equal treatment can only provide a framework, <Col N="1476" /> I hope to introduce proposals for improving this legislation by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>An effective programme of positive action in education, training and in the workplace is also essential.  In the training area, I recently launched a new two-year positive action programme in favour of women for FÁS.  In the workplace, positive action is also required.  Some companies are already operating such programmes and in order to give them some public recognition I launched a new company award scheme in May called &ldquo;Equality Focus&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Turning now to occupational safety and health, the progression from the limited scope of earlier health and safety legislation to the point where all workers are comprehensively covered will be difficult and can only be achieved on a phased basis over a number of years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the three-year programme of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, and in particular its planned activities for 1990, will make a significant contribution towards the creation by employers, in co-operation with their workers, of a safe and healthy environment in all our workplaces.</P>
    <P>For labour legislation in general, it is my intention to bring the amending legislation on unfair dismissals and payment of wages before the Oireachtas by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that I have carried out a review of the issues of part-time working.  I expect to put my final proposals for legislative change before the Government in the near future.  I hope to bring forward a Bill later in the year which will significantly improve the level of protection afforded under labour law to regular part-time employees.</P>
    <P>My Department also enforces the 14 Employment Regulation Orders made under the Industrial Relations Acts. These orders give important protection on minimum pay and conditions in traditionally low-paid or unorganised areas of employment.  I have made provision in the Industrial Relations Bill for this system to be improved and strengthened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> In conclusion I would like to highlight the overall improvement in economic life as illustrated by patterns of emigration. As a result of the upturn in the economy, all the indicators are now showing a rapid decrease in outward migration.  The annual rate of net emigration this year is forecast to be about 25,000 compared with about 45,000 for 1989.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to accelerating the pace of job creation to the point where no-one should feel obliged to emigrate out of economic necessity.  I will continue to direct my Department's activities towards measures supporting and assisting this resurgence in employment in every way open to me.</P>
    <P>I commend this Vote to the House.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying that we hope to have various papers in relation to a second programme for national and social progress during the summer months.  Much of this work has already been done.  We will be looking at the economy and at the share we hope people will obtain from the relative wealth that we have succeeded in maintaining under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I am adamant that in this and in any programme, at least a share of the benefits must be passed on to workers and their families.  The rewards of the stability we have had in the economy as a result of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be passed on in whatever way possible.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a wide discussion of the trade union movement and employment to find out the areas where we can deliver back some of these rewards. Some I have mentioned.  There are many more that I would like to speak about.  I would like to go more into the subject of worker participation during the year.  I also want to thank the House, since it is Estimate time, for their help and co-operation in regard to the safety Bill before Christmas and the Industrial Relations Bill since.</P>

      <P>I thank the spokespersons for the other parties who did not remind me that the Minister <Col N="1478" /> had taken two minutes of somebody else's time, but the House seems to be happy about it.  I now call on Deputy Monica Barnes, who has ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's sense of urgency with which he introduced his comment on the Estimate because it is a vast subject.  I would like to think this House will devote much of the next session to completing some of the long-awaited legislation that is so necessary.  There is still outstanding legislation on part-time workers.  We still have to come to grips with low pay which must be one of our biggest concerns. There is still a very high number of workers in our country being exploited at very low wages and with very little protection of their working conditions, creating a marginalised section of people who can be used as a cheap labour force, maybe, on the integration of the European market.  I will be saying a little about that later.</P>
      <P>It would be cyncial and dishonest of us to claim that we have achieved a sound economy when the levels of unemployment and emigration remain at such an unacceptable level and that the outdated and redundant structures that did not include all those who wanted to work, and never put an end to the haemorrhage of emigration, will be replaced by creative and effective training and job creation programmes to cater for the needs of our young people and those who wish to return to the workforce, including two hidden groups, the long-term unemployed and those working in the home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief few moments available to me, I wish to discuss the Estimate for the Department of Labour which amounts to £128,750,000 compared with last year's Estimate of £117,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I wish to put on record my thanks to the Minister for the many hours of assistance he has given me in my constituency in dealing with very difficult situations and in settling many disputes, and particularly for his help in saving <Col N="1479" /> jobs in Barlo's of Clonmel.  My colleague, Alderman Seán Lyons, the Mayor of Clonmel would also like to join in that vote of thanks and also to say that we appreciated the Minister's intervention and assistance in settling the dispute. Likewise, my colleague Deputy Brian O'Shea appreciates the efforts the Minister has made in the tragic strike at Waterford Glass, which will lead to redundancies, but we welcome the settlement that has been reached.</P>
    <P>We wish the Minister luck in the negotiations at the Irish Press Group and we feel the situation requires the Minister's personal attention.</P>
    <P>Having concluded with the niceties &mdash; I know the Minister deserves our appreciation &mdash; I have to look at the overall performance of the Department of Labour in the area of job creation and unemployment.  In the document, <i>Economic Background to The Budget 1990,</i> the main features of the economic prospects for the year were outlined as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Growth in domestic output of about 4½ per cent,</P>
    <P>&mdash;An increase in private consumption approaching 4 per cent,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Continuing strong expansion in investment,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Continued progress in industrial output and exports,</P>
    <P>Growth in non-agricultural employment of about 16,000,</P>
    <P>&mdash;A reduction of about 10,000 in the number on the Live Register. </P>
    <P>We must ask how that economic outlook relates to present conditions?  I am stating what Deputy Spring, the Leader of the Labour Party would have said if he had the opportunity to say it during the Private Members' time, but other debacles precluded the debate.</P>
    <P>Our current level of unemployment is socially unacceptable.  A recent European Commission study referred, in particular, to the acute problem of joblessness in Ireland, stating that the problem of long-term unemployment <Col N="1480" /> seems to have become entrenched in the eighties.  The recent alarming increase in the number out of work illustrates blatantly the Government's inability &mdash; indeed failure &mdash; to deal with this major problem.  The Government's economic policy must be viewed as inexcusably weak and <i>ad hoc</i> in its approach to our entrenched unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>This problem is interlinked with the continued economic extradition of our people.  There are signs that the total number who will emigrate this year will be much lower than last year's record levels.  While that may be true it is still unacceptable that so many people have to emigrate.  The latest ERSI mediumterm review, for instance, forecast emigration this year of 36,000 people, and this figure is not contradicted by the last quarterly bulletin from the same body despite the forecast of economic growth in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Emigration at this level represents a major failure of this Government's economic policy.  We wonder whether the Government are prepared to continue playing the role of the nation's bookkeeper at the expense of the human dimension of the Minister for Labour's portfolio.  Is the Minister prepared to face up to the fact that the Government's economic policies, despite the figures, have failed to address and conquer the problem of high unemployment?  The time has come for the Minister to actively pursue radical policies which will bring home to the people of Ireland the economic pluses in real terms that he repeatedly quotes.  This raises the question of the numbers unemployed or in low paid employment.  Why did the Minister, within the context of the EC Social Charter, reject a proposal for a statutory minimum wage?  This affects not just a handful of workers but over 75,000 people, mostly young men and women workers.  In rejecting this proposal, the Minister has sold short the vulnerable and weakest sections of the labour force, favouring those employers who wish to continue to use these workers as a pool of cheap labour.</P>
    <P>In objecting to the introduction of a <Col N="1481" /> statutory minimum wage, which is the only means of removing slave labour in any society, the Government also rejected proposals to deal with the abuse of working hours and the conditions of employment of temporary and part-time workers.  There are thousands of service sector workers who are not protected by minimum rates.  The EC Social Charter in its undiluted form would have provided an opportunity to tackle the endemic problem of low pay in member states. With such Victorian attitudes still prevalent in our society how can the Government claim in this House that all is going well with their economic policies?</P>
    <P>Condemnation of the Government's policies is not confined to the political arena because other bodies, such as the Combat Poverty Agency have highlighted the effects of Government policy. The Combat Poverty Agency highlighted their findings in the presence of the Minister for Social Welfare a few days ago and I will quote from their account of child and family poverty on page 11 of their 1989 Third Annual Report:</P>
    <P>Closely related to the issue of unemployment is the growth during the 1980s of child and family poverty.  With over 300,000 adult and child dependants of people registered as unemployed, this is scarcely surprising. Households with children have a particularly high risk of poverty &mdash; between two and three times as great as for those with no children.  Furthermore, the risk of poverty increases as the number of children in a household increases.  The combination of research reports and first hand evidence from voluntary and community organisations, local women's groups and family centres emphasise how serious the situation is.</P>
    <P>Poverty is intrinsically linked to high levels of unemployment.  The report also deals with low pay and poverty and it states:</P>
    <P>During the past year the relationship between low pay and poverty has come <Col N="1482" /> increasingly to the fore.  The conference on the issue organised by the Agency and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in December 1989 drew further attention to the fact that work is not always an escape from poverty.</P>
    <P>Low paid work is linked directly to poverty. Even though social employment schemes are excellent, there have been hiccups expecially with team work schemes as they apply to the mentally handicapped and the case of the mentally handicapped.  There also have been some problems with the appointment of caretakers under the scheme &mdash; and I had hoped to raise the question of an anomaly that has arisen over the employment of caretakers resulting from a dispute about making ordinary caretakers redundant. Normal schools like Powerstown national school, Clonmel, which cannot fund the cost of a caretaker are now placed in a dilemma.</P>
    <P>In the remaining minute let me say that the Government are putting their stock on a new programme for national recovery. There are groups outside this House who will have a major input into the preparation of that programme.  Given the insulting manner in which the Government have treated the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in recent weeks in relation to the Broadcasting Bill, in particular, with its implications for major job losses, one wonders if Congress can expect to be treated favourably by the Government when they enter negotiations. This is a huge challenge and in this regard we must have creative, original and, above all, adaptable and flexible structures.  Many of us are concerned that, particularly in an economy such as ours, small enterprises and businesses may not create a great number of jobs.  Collectively these businesses could provide a sound economic base for job creation.  People have the motivation and commitment to set up such small enterprises and busineses.  Women in particular have a great sense of motivation and entrepreneurial spirit in this regard.</P>
    <P>One thing that concerns me &mdash; and I am sure it is of concern to all the other <Col N="1483" /> Members of the House &mdash; is that our large funding structures do not seem to have changed fast enough to accommodate these businesses.  Small businesses in this country have an unacceptably high failure rate, not through lack of expertise or indeed energy or motivation on behalf of those who set them up but because of the obstacles that are placed in their way such as VAT, high overheads and so on.  The lack of small business units is a cause of great concern.  Financial support during the first months or years of these businesses is very important and we must take another look at the funding of these enterprises.</P>
    <P>The amount of money involved in this Estimate is considerable and we have to consider how best to use it.  If real jobs are to be created, the IDA must concentrate on the service and technology industries.  A recent survey has shown that by the year 2000 the manufacturing industry will account for only 8 per cent of employment.  Ireland is well placed to set up businesses with our young trained and skilled people &mdash; many of whom have to emigrate.  Our workforce are well trained and have the intelligence to compete in the service and the technology industries but the whole funding arrangements must be radically changed to ensure money is directed to those areas rather than focusing on very large multinational industries at huge costs.  I believe we have the potential and the resources to create jobs at reduced costs but support and information should be provided and, when the businesses are set up, they should be monitored.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to consider setting up a task force with expertise to monitor, supervise and fund this type of activity.  If we are to create jobs, this kind of support is necessary.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about employment and jobs, an area which overlaps with the work of other Government Departments. There are opportunities for job creation in agri-business.  The very definition of agri-business does not appeal to many enterpreneurs and people in rural communities.  They cannot see <Col N="1484" /> themselves as part of this large and rather threatening business.  Perhaps we could set up agencies that would attract people to this area and create jobs in business to replace these that are being lost in agriculture and the more traditional industries, which were the backbone of many towns.  Those industries have to be replaced quickly and that can be done by improving our skills and maintaining high standards and excellent services.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned FÁS and the central role they must play in the next ten years or so.  Perhaps FÁS might branch into non-industrial areas such as equestrian training.  They should leave themselves open to the kind of training that tourism and agri-business demand rather than get caught up in traditional apprenticeship training.  I am not in any way taking from their work.  They have to adapt quickly to the changing times.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed we are finishing this session without an opportunity of considering equality legislation.  When this legislation is being prepared, provision should be made for affirmative action. We should give full attention, not just here but in Europe, to drawing up directives on child care, family leave and part-time workers.  At all the Council of Ministers meetings, Ireland should be to the forefront in ensuring that we push for these directives and no country should be allowed delay them.</P>
    <P>Not alone should changes be made as regards training but our whole second level education system should be improved.  We should ensure that our young people have a greater sense of enterprise and they should be given encouragement and information.  On the question of funding, particularly having regard to the Structural Fund and the European Social Fund, we should be guided by the needs and priorities of the unemployed.  Direct funding should be provided for these people rather than letting agencies decide their priorities. These people should be included rather than excluded, and if that means changing eligibility clauses and standards, let us do that.  At present, many of our mainstream programmes exclude people who <Col N="1485" /> are in greater need of training than some of those who take part in them.  I would ask that, when the social partners meet, the poverty stricken and the long-term unemployed should be considered.</P>
    <P>I appeal to those involved in the negotiations for a new programme to ensure that proper respect and concern is shown to the one million people living below the poverty line, the many low paid workers caught in the poverty trap, the 30,000 persons on local authority housing lists, the thousands waiting for medical treatment, to whom Deputy Howlin referred in his contribution on the previous Estimate, and the many thousands in our society who are alienated and marginalised by the monstrous policies of this Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The Government may be interested in pleasing their financial masters in the short-term but they are neglecting their responsibilities to those at risk, for example, the unemployed and their families. This problem cannot be addressed by increasing the number of people on the social employment scheme.  In spite of the Minister's hopeful economic outlook and the statements made by the Minister for Finance in last night's debate there has been a continuing rise in the number of people who are unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter referred to in the Minister's introductory comment concerning his successful piloting through of the Industrial Relations Bill is his major achievement.  I should like to join in the congratulations which have been offered to him on that achievement.  As a trade unionist I opposed some sections of the Bill and continued to do so right up to the very end of the debate because I believe they will shift the balance of power in favour of employers.  Nonetheless, I recognise the achievement that after all the years of talk the Bill has passed all stages in this House and is now before the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to be associated with the congratulatory remarks to the Minister concerning his intervention in the very difficult and important dispute at Waterford Crystal.  I welcome the inclusion in <Col N="1486" /> the Minister's introductury remarks of his commitment to introduce a Bill for the protection of part-time workers, hopefully before the end of the year.  The Workers' Party introduced such a Bill in Private Members' time, which unfortunately the Government voted down, but which secured that commitment from the Minister, which I am glad he has repeated.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour is one of the major economic Departments and perhaps the Minister was the midwife of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which is a cornerstone of the Government's economic policy.  I will refer to that point later.  I cannot associate myself with the Minister's self-congratulations on his period as President of the Social Ministers and specifically the achievements in respect of the Social Charter which I believe has been diluted to the point that it is virtually meaningless.  I greatly regret this.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is unquestionably the major matter on the agenda of the Department of Labour. I believe it would be folly for the Government to expect the voluntary sacrifices made by workers and their families over the past three years to be repeated.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was negotiated against a background of economic crisis.  It is true that a great deal of progress has been made on the backs of the workers who have made the sacrifices but who have not shared in the benefits.</P>
    <P>The very concept of a programme for national recovery is dead and what is now required is a development programme which will set clear and specific priorities which are capable of being rigorously monitored, will provide the necessary mechanisms for the translation of some of that prosperity into the creation of actual jobs and will allow direct negotiation at plant level so that workers can share in the benefits of technological advances and the fantastic increase in productivity we have seen.  I believe many successful employers used the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as a shield from doing business directly with their workers in terms of allowing them to <Col N="1487" /> participate in the benefits accruing from the constraints in the programme.  The frustration of workers in that situation has been exacerbated by a fact acknowledged by the Minister himself, that is that the pay restraint has not led, in the case of many of our leading companies, to the creation of jobs.  The Minister has stated this quite clearly.  I believe the analysis is correct and it is the big defect in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The trade union leadership currently acknowledge that there is a growing feeling on the shop floor that the people who contributed most to tackling the economic crisis benefited least and those who made the least sacrifices benefited most. It has been a period of extraordinary success for the barons of industry but it has been a period of hardship and uncertainty for a third of our population, including the 228,700 people in the workforce whose families are living on a pay threshold of £130 or less per week.  While Ireland remains a low pay economy it will never generate the wealth and dynamism necessary if the Minister's aspiration to put all our people back to work is to be realised.</P>
    <P>Is beag de bhiseach atá le feiceáil.  Má bhíonn clár náisiúnta eile ann, caithfear na buntáistí a roinnt níos leithne ná mar a deineadh go dtí seo.  Cá bhfuil na jabanna? Cá bhfuil cuid na ngnáthdhaoine? Níl sé le feiceáil.  Chonaic daoine i gCluain Dolcáin, i dTamhlacht agus gach áit eile na ranganna móra sna scoileanna, na scuainí ag na hospidéil agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this recovery that Governments continue to trot out is evident in this two-thirds-one-third society we have created.  It may have been a very good period for those in the two-thirds group but there is very little evidence of national recovery for those who are living in poverty, those who are trying to make ends meet and stay out of the grasp of moneylenders, those who had to take the boat during 1989, the period of highest emigration since the low point of 1955, and those people coming on to the job market.  Notwithstanding the job creation performance the Minister spoke <Col N="1488" /> about, they still fall a long way short of creating sufficient jobs to cater for the additional input into the labour force.</P>
    <P>It was remarkable to hear the Minister for Finance once again last night as the Government tend to do, take refuge in the nebulous statistics and make-believe world of economic miracle that the Government would have us believe exists.  That is not the reality in the economy outside.  Perhaps all the indicators are coming right, but unemployment is not coming right.  We still have a crisis in unemployment &mdash; there were 6.500 more people on the live register last Friday, the biggest increase for a number of years.  That is the real economy.  With high emigration, unemployment, poverty and low pay and with 28 per cent of the workforce having to live on less than £130 per week, I do not think the economic crisis has been turned around.  We have had tax improvements but we do not have tax reform.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to expect the Minister for Labour to deliver a new social and economic programme against the background of the failure of our industrial policy to put our people back to work. You cannot generate prosperity in this economy while there is such a large dependent sector and so many unemployed and old people.  It has been a failure of our industrial strategy to generate those jobs.  The Workers' Party attempted recently to address that question by publishing a new strategy for industrial development.  I regret that the House will rise for the summer recess without our having had the opportunity to look at the publication on the triennial assessment of industrial performance which the Minister for Industry and Commerce promised to bring before the House a couple of months ago.  It is very difficult to expect the Minister for Labour to deliver a new consensus against the background of the costly failure of existing industrial strategy.  It should be the priority of this House to address that matter at the beginning of the next session because, unless we get our industrial policy right, we will not tackle some of <Col N="1489" /> the problems which are endemic in society.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for his successful intervention in the Waterford dispute and I join Deputy Ferris in seeking his personal intervention in the case of the <i>Irish Press.</i> I was very disappointed yesterday that the Minister for Education, acting in loco for the Minister for Labour, made a statement to the House which effectively could have been drafted by the management of the <i>Irish Press.</i> Such a partisan assessment of that dispute is not helpful and nothing but the personal intervention of the Minister can avert disaster.  The conditions being imposed by the new owners of the <i>Irish Press</i> must make us all gloomy in regard to the continued success of those three reputable newspapers and for the 700 jobs involved.  I ask the Minister to personally involve himself in ensuring that the deadline draws no closer before a formula is worked out which will save that enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Labour Estimate. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte's words of commendation and praise to Minister Ahern for the invariable fair-mindedness and common sense which he brings to bear on industrial relations disputes.  He has been singularly successful in intervening at crucial times in key industrial issues.  I should like to pay a substantial tribute to him for his successful intervention and for keeping his finger on the pulse throughout the Waterford Glass saga.  It would have been an enormous tragedy if Waterford Glass had gone to the wall or if the work had been transferred elsewhere and was lost to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish the Minister well in relation to his ongoing talks and interventions in the <i>Irish Press</i> dispute.  I have never claimed to be a great admirer &mdash; or an avid reader &mdash; of the <i>Irish Press</i> although from time to time it has deviated from its so called aim, the truth in the news.  The late James Dillon said that one would read more truth on the back of <i>Pravda</i><Col N="1490" /> than in the <i>Irish Press.</i> Perhaps that was an exaggeration.  The newspaper has given a lot to Irish life and it has been part and parcel of what we are.  Indeed, in latter years, it managed to steer a middle course and to get away from its original political origins.  I hope that the dispute is resolved and that the newspaper will be preserved, continue to thrive and to be part and parcel of the Irish journalistic world.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Minister to intervene in the area of apprenticeships.  I remember a time when vast numbers of people were trained by the semi-State organisations; I remember the days when CIE, for example, took on several hundred young people for coach building and mechanical engineering and taught them the various skills which were part of CIE before they were broken up into Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way from the days when the ESB took on a huge number of people from vocational and secondary schools to train them in the whole area of electrical engineering.  The Air Corps used to take in dozens of young people every year to teach them aircraft maintenance.  A system also operated on the bogs where Bord na Móna trained young people in all aspects of technology relating to their activities.  Telecom Éireann &mdash; when they were the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; trained a huge number of people as technicians. Last, but not least, Aer Lingus trained many people in aircraft technology, workshop theory and practice.  Unfortunately, AnCO &mdash; and latterly FÁS &mdash; have made it virtually impossible for young people to get direct training.  You cannot get into a FÁS workshop, except in very limited circumstances, unless you are sponsored by an employer.  Unemployment levels have made it impossible for employers to sponsor young people because the whole scheme is so bogged down by bureaucracy, red tape and difficulties in regard to retrospective and delayed payments, that there is no inducement.  The result is that we are not training people in anything like the numbers heretofore or in anything like the numbers in which people deserve to <Col N="1491" /> be trained if they want to go abroad and ply their wares else where.  In the past we prided ourselves on having a high level of apprenticeship training.  These people could go abroad with the same kind of confidence as someone who had a degree from one of the national universities and confidently expect to get jobs elsewhere. Apprenticeship training is virtually at a standstill and I appeal to the Minister to intervene with the semi-State organisations and make it mandatory for them to take on a stated number of people to train in basic skills.  They have the resources and the manpower; most of them make substantial profits and there is no reason for them not to discharge their obligation to the national labour pool by training young people.</P>
    <P>One of the basic problems is that we never seem to gel what we have with what we need.  There are 215,000 people out of work although there is a huge amount of work to be done.  However, we have not managed to marry the twain.  One of the major problems facing the Minister Deputy Ahern in relation to reducing the ever present dole queue on the first Friday of every month when the unemployment figures are announced is how to put together some kind of formula, scheme or work practice to relieve unemployment.  If the Minister can do that &mdash; I am not saying it requires the skill of Houdini to do it &mdash; he will be well on the way to becoming leader of the party and the Government one day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to some of the points raised.  Deputy Barnes referred to enterprise and job creation. We are endeavouring to move into the enterprise area and to trying <Col N="1492" /> to assist, through employment incentive schemes, as many people as possible.  We have given incentives and allowances to employers which should help in this area. Small and medium size firms tend to create jobs in the enterprise area.  At the end of last September we made a number of changes to our incentive and allowance schemes to try to assist in that.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure yesterday of attending a FÁS incentive scheme in Drogheda which also involved the handicapped, so we had enterprise for workers entailing keeping up to the quota of handicapped people.  The scheme started only in 1987. It operates on grants with some assistance from the chamber of commerce and now has 60 jobs in Drogheda to its credit. Deputy Barnes is right, that is the way to go.  You will get failures and wastage but that is inevitable.  You can get those in multinational companies, too.</P>
      <P>We have about 54,000 people between training and job places involved in FÁS schemes.  In good times a higher proportion of them in Youthreach schemes or with employable skills or whatever have the opportunity to get jobs and in bad times they do not.  There has been a good run in that recently.  As Deputy Ferris and Deputy Barnes said, it is important that training be flexible.  We have made every change possible in FÁS schemes to allow for that, almost to the stage that sometimes we are accused of having schemes which will lead nowwhere. Not long ago I approved a small scheme, I believe in Deputy Barnes's constituency or not too far from it, to give encouragement to people who can cut out a career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the ESF, there was a great deal of talk in this House prior to the negotiation of the Structural Funds sugesting that the Social Funds would lose out badly.  Speakers in this House said we could not avert this but we have got £1 billion for human resources and it is important that we spend that properly.  I cannot put my hand on my heart and say every penny of it is spent properly but there is a permanent battle to ensure it is used.  One of the fundamental changes made by our European colleagues is that <Col N="1493" /> any money we spend now has to be used with employment as an end product.  The social end, contrary to the name, is not as social as it used to be.  You have to verify the value for money and the fact that it leads to employment.</P>
    <P>On industrial development Deputy Rabbitte and I have probably not too many disagreements.  I might not agree altogether with his policy documents but neither would I agree with some of the criticisms of them.  I can see the sense in many points in those documents.  I will not have time to argue the detail.  Unfortunately, one of the disadvantages of being Minister for Labour is that you have the Labour problems but you have not control of the employment agencies that generate the jobs.  Only the other day I spoke about some of my disappointments in the employment areas and I would ask the employer organisations in the autumn to look at the statistics.  During this session we have not disagreed on that matter.  I do not want to be hypocritical, but our exports have increased by 50 per cent since 1986, our inflation is one of the lowest in western Europe and our interest rate is still far lower than those of our competitors.  We have been lectured for years at various business lunches up and down the country about that magic word &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo;. Take all those factors into account and I still have to defend my position on how many jobs will be created.  Yes it is an increase, it is an improvement, we have achieved what was in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, but when it is thrown into the computer the figure should be higher. Not only employers are to blame for that. One thing that galls me &mdash; and it takes a good deal to do that &mdash; is that both workers and management will jointly do everything but take on more people. They will increase the productivity bonuses, switch around the Saturday and Sunday bonuses and treble the bank holiday payments.  The latest I heard recently is that you can get four days' pay for a bank holiday.  It is difficult enough for some people to get one day's pay.</P>
    <P>Other things come to me as Minister <Col N="1494" /> for Labour such as pay in 1990 in Ireland and how employers get around the tax net in collusion with the workforce.  That is great if you have a job.  It is not just employers.  It is difficult to convince people who are working and doing well &mdash; not to mention many notable groups I have dealt with in this session in the Dáil &mdash; that they are not doing too badly.  I concur with Deputy Rabbitte and others that employers are part of that but there is a work element in it as well and we see it as we head towards the national programme.</P>
    <P>People who are doing well, the groups who should be saying they are prepared to sacrifice a little, are the very groups &mdash; workers in this case &mdash; with some help from their employer organisations &mdash; who are saying they must get the maximum out of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> they should not be bound by restrictions, they should have productivity and flexibility.  If they get all the freedom, productivity and flexibility, who will suffer?  It will be their brothers and sisters in the trade union movement who are not in employment.  Deputy Rabbitte will probably agree with me on that.</P>
    <P>On the Social Charter, whatever arguments took place on what was in or out of it took place before the Irish Presidency. In the Presidency we pushed hard to get on with the timetable.  The dossiers and documents that will come forward in the next six months in the Italian Presidency will be important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £31,882,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Marine, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The amount provided for in the Marine Vote this year represents a 17 per cent increase approximately over the provisional outturn given in the Book of Estimates for 1989 when the £90 million regarding the Irish Shipping reimbursement is included.</P>
      <P>As I have very little time I want to say that the Government in their <i>National Development Programme 1989-93</i> recognise the importance of the marine area and with State support and EC new Structural Funds intend to take advantage of this very important part of our economy.</P>
      <P>The Department and BIM have a solid programme for advance in sea fisheries. It is our purpose to prepare the fish processing and marketing industry to compete successfully in the internal market when it is completed in 1992.  Increased employment and productivity in fish processing and marketing generate economic growth in less developed peripheral coastal regions of the country and stimulate balanced and sustained growth in the Irish fishing industry in general in line with the objectives for the industry outlined in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have in place a whole range of programmes such as strengthened marketing, plant modernisation, aquaculture development and the provision of adequate infrastructure and facilities at ports and harbours to service the fishing industry.  Many of these programmes have been submitted to the Community for aid and are designed to improve efficiency and competitiveness in the <Col N="1496" /> fishing sector.  Substantial progress has already been made and we intend to continue that progress.</P>
    <P>The emphasis will be on marketing shellfish, salmon and the very lucrative herring roe.  We have developed a herring roe market in Japan.  Herring roe of a fine quality is much appreciated by the Japanese and it is not purchased by them unless it is of top quality.  We are also concentrating on trying to develop markets for new species to shift the industry away from a commodity basis to a valueadded basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to our Presidency of the European Council we made significant progress on many of the international agreements necessary in EC activities particularly with regard to Canada and the newly independent Namibia, which has declared that the fishing waters around it are not open, without substantial research, to the European people who traditionally fished there.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of our deliberations during the period of the Presidency related to the integration of the German Democratic Republic in the common fishery area.  Here I pay tribute to Dr. Van Gelderen the Minister for Fisheries of the Federal Republic of Germany who came to Dublin and in the Council indicated the Federal Republic of Germany view in relation to unification. There were problems considering that the East German fleet is one and a half to twice the size of the West German fleet.  There were fears that they might make inroads into our quotas.  We have been assured by Dr. Van Gelderen that this would not happen and this was a source of comfort and joy to us in Ireland.  We also made progress with regard to agreements with third countries in the southern hemisphere.  Other agreements were renegotiated or extended.</P>
    <P>In relation to technical conservation measures, the secretary of my Department headed a top level group to make recommendations to the Council with regard to conservation measuresd in the North Sea.  Pollution and overfishing have caused grave problems in this area <Col N="1497" /> and Ireland made a very significant contribution to the study of and recommendations to deal with this problem. Coming from the recent Council meeting we had increased total allowable catches for sole and other species in the Irish Sea.  We also made an arrangement which freed our Irish fishermen timewise with regard to the very lucrative horse mackerel fishery which was developed recently, particularly since the Japanese began to purchase horse mackerel for human consumption.</P>
    <P>It is our policy to maximise agriculture's contribution, in harmony with environmental excellence, to job creation, exports and consequently, to improved economic growth.  In 1989 production from the industry was worth almost £30 million, with 850 full-time jobs and 1,300 part-time jobs in the aquaculture area.  The ambition for 1991 is to have £71 million worth of production and about 3,500 jobs.  I would emphasise that properly placed and controlled this industry is a clean industry despite the fact that some misinformed criticism seems to indicate that it is not.  We have set in motion a systematic information programme to bring order and control into the industry and to make sure that there is no damage to our environment.  The Department with BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta are trying to maximise the contribution from the European Community. A sum of £1.8 million from the Exchequer in grants and loans is being made available and in the April tranche from the Community, £1.6 million was received for nine Irish aquaculture ventures.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries is one of our great resources, the only tourist resource in my region.  Funding of the inland fisheries is very important for the development of this natural resource.  I have reached a formula to transcend the antagonisms that developed over the last couple of years via development co-operatives.  I have provided 31 per cent more money this year for inland fisheries than was provided in 1989.  I want people to cooperate in fisheries to develop this great industry.  I have the Bill practically ready <Col N="1498" /> for this House.  I am glad to say the fishing is continuing very successfully during this summer.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the officers of the South Western Board who lost their lives in pursuit of their duty, go ndéana Dia trócaire orthu.  I express my appreciation to the House, particularly the spokespersons in this House for the tributes they paid to the people who lost their lives.  I am glad they resisted the temptation to seek publicity on the deaths of four servants of the people, particularly in relation to an issue which was irrelevant to what happened over the week-end.</P>
    <P>In relation to the marine environment the incidents involving the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Tribulus</i> brought home to us how important it is to be in a position to preserve from danger the fishing, the aquaculture and the tourist value of our coastal regions.  The protection of life on stricken vessels and the prevention of pollution, in that order are our priorities.</P>

    <P>With regard to coastal protection I have provided £950,000 for the north Arklow beach to repair storm damage.  I was on a subcommittee which decided to make £3 million available for harbours, piers and coastal installations.  Commercial harbours took 79 per cent of our trade volume and 65 per cent of value in 1989.  We have a large investment programme for the ports and we aim to provide adequate port facilities in the tough competitive period that lies ahead.  I want <Col N="1499" /> them located strategically, the big ones, Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork, near the main transport arteries, that is to say, railways and roads.  Substantial expenditure up to £60 million will be spent on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in extending sympathy to the families of the men who died in the Ballycotton tragedy.  I compliment the fisheries officials on the work they do with a restricted budget.  I do not agree with the other sentiments expressed by the Minister in his speech.  If I was a visitor to the House and was listening to the Minister I could not help but come to the conclusion that the Department of the Marine were progressing very favourably.  The Minister told us that the Government have great aspirations in regard to sea fishing and mentioned the prospects for marketing, processing, creation of employment and the great economic growth that will come from our sea fishing industry.  However, he did not tell us that there are 240 applications for sea fishing licences with his Department and that only three licences have been issued.  As a result 237 applicants do not have sea fishing licences.  I do not know how the Minister <Col N="1500" /> can see employment generated in that area when our fleet is being reduced.  The Minister should explain how he intends performing that miracle and there is no doubt that he will have to perform a miracle if he is to fulfil his aspirations.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's sincerity in trying to resolve the rod licence dispute but, despite numerous promises in the House that an amending Bill would be before us during this term, the appropriate Bill has not been published.  Are there difficulties in relation to the drafting of that Bill in the Attorney General's Office?  The Taoiseach, during our EC Presidency, was anxious that peace should reign along the shores of our lakes and I am concerned that next season the rod licence dispute will erupt again.  I must come to the conclusion, as the amending Bill has not been published, that something peculiar is happening somewhere.  The Minister should explain the position to the House because many people are concerned about the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the development proposals in regard to aquaculture. He has told us that he has established a working group to consider fin fish operations in fresh water but I appeal to him to stop those operations because they have proved to be most unsatisfactory. The Minister should await the report of the working group before permitting the operations to continue.  A thorough investigation must be carried out of existing operations.  The Minister told us that a working group on mandatory codes of practice was established last year and a report from that body is long overdue. The House should be given an opportunity to examine their report before long.  The group investigated a contentious issue.  There is no doubt that development can take place but it must be done in harmony with the environment. The Minister should establish a management resource plan for our coast taking into consideration the location of fish farming sites suitable for farming particular species.  I should like to stress the need to call a halt to the issuing of more licences and to cease locating in fresh water any further operations.  It has been <Col N="1501" /> proved that fin fish operations in fresh water are not good and the Minister should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>One obvious omission in the Minister's speech was the air-sea rescue service. Last February the Minister received the report of the review group on that service. On 7 and 20 June the Minister told the House that he expected to present a report on the issue to the Government before the end of June but I understand that that has not happened.  Why is it that the Government have not received that report?  If decisions are not taken we will not have a proper air-sea rescue service when the bad weather comes in October and we may be talking about the loss of more lives or more lives being put in danger.  The Government must act immediately on this.  I am concerned that there is no provision in the Estimate to improve that service.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that he has given £100,000 to the RNLI, the same amount that he gave them last year.  The allocation is not adequate.  The RNLI provide a great service around our coast but in order to do so they must raise money voluntarily.  An allocation of £100,000 is only a pittance when one considers the service that group provide.  The Minister should consider increasing their allocation substantially in October.</P>
    <P>A sum of £150,000 has been included in the Estimate for coastal protection but that is far from adequate.  I appreciate that an additional £4 million was provided during the course of the year following the storms but that amount was not adequate to repair the damage done.  In some instances the minimum of repairs were carried out.  We have a major problem in regard to coastal erosion on the east and there is an onus on the Department to prepare a coastal protection plan and formulate a priority list for remedial action.  I am dissatisfied with the submission made to the EC for Structural Funds to deal with coastal erosion because I do not think a serious analysis of the coast was carried out, particularly of the eastern seaboard.  Piers and fishing and leisure facilities around our coast <Col N="1502" /> were badly damaged in the storms last year.</P>
    <P>At Cabinet level the Minister should fight for a substantial increase in the Estimate for his Department.  The amount allocated does not indicate any regard for the work done by the Department.  We should remember that when the Department were established the Taoiseach stressed that it would be doing important work.  Words must be backed by money and that has not happened as far as the Department of the Marine are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the Marine Institute.  Second Stage of the Bill establishing that body was passed by the House and we were promised that Committee and Final Stages would be put through the House by the end of this session.  We were told that the institute would be established in the latter half of this year but I cannot see how that will take place when the Bill is unlikely to be dealt with until late in the next session. It is important that the Government establish such a body to carry out essential research on our fish stocks and prepare our case for fish quotas.  At present we depend on other countries to provide us with the information we require to argue our case.  The officials of the Department are doing an excellent job within the resources available to them but they are unable to do something positive because of budgetary constraints.  I urge the Minister to consider the salmon fishery review which has been with him since 1987.  He should introduce amending legislation in the next session to change the position in relation to salmon fisheries. There is no doubt that that is the most contentious issue facing the Department. There is an onus on the Minister to take positive action in regard to salmon fishing.  Unless the Minister takes action we will have difficulties at all levels of salmon fishing.  The Minister should have the courage to stick his neck out on this contentious issue and tackle the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a sense of gloom and deep sorrow that I deal with the Estimate before us this evening.  Over the weekend four people lost their lives off the Cork coast.  Indeed, another person lost his life off the west coast today.  I compliment the Minister for instructing that an inquiry be held immediately as answers must be provided. One of the four countymen of mine who lost their lives was a very close neighbour of mine, Dominic Meehan, a young man of 45.  It is with a sense of anger that I deal with this Estimate and while I have no wish to pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry answers must be given.  As the Minister quite rightly said, these men were not out searching for monofilament nets but rather for poachers.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to get involved in a discussion on this matter now as we do not have the time to do so but the Minister and his Department must grasp the nettle as we do not wish to see a confrontation between fishermen and fishery officers.  I am sure the staff of the Minister's Department have examined the problem in relation to monofilament nets and poaching but if the law has to be changed, let us change it.  Furthermore, those who enforce the law are entitled to the backup services they require.  I will let the matter rest there as I have no doubt we will return to it at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech was very comprehensive and I do not have the time to <Col N="1504" /> evaluate it properly but he has indicated that the report to which Deputy Taylor-Quinn referred will be presented to the Government next week.  As I and many others in this House have heard that one before I urge the Minister to ensure that it is presented to Government next week and decisions are made rapidly.  We will not always be able to rely on the RAF to come to the assistance of people in trouble off our coasts, be they fishermen or merchant seamen.  We have well trained people in our Air Corps; all they need are the proper facilities.  I have no doubt that they would provide a first class service if they were able to avail of those back-up facilities.  I have the greatest confidence in them.  They are properly trained and are very enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>The financial allocation to the Department of the Marine is completely inadequate. During the past 12 months they have become a Cinderella department the Government are inclined to forget.  It is a second class Department and I hope the Minister will use his influence to secure a substantial increase in the autumn or next year.</P>
    <P>One of our greatest natural resources is our coastal waters.  Attempts are being made to ensure a proper service is provided, but as yet we have not exploited to the full the seas off our east, south and west coasts.  I have no doubt that if we do, we would do a tremendous amount of good for our young people living along the south and west coasts whose only option appears to be to get on the bus and head for Britain or the United States. We have failed these people and tend to allow foreign interests exploit these seas. While we come down heavily on our own fishermen it seems we are prepared to tolerate Spanish trawlers, as happened on a number of occasions in recent months, entering our coastal zone and ramming our ships time and again.  The Minister has indicated that he has protested to the Spanish authorities but what we need to do, and I have said this before, is call in the Spanish Ambassador to tell him this kind of action is not acceptable to the people.  I hope the Minister will make some move in this direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> I would now like to refer to the rod licence dispute.  On looking through the Minister's speech I fail to see any mention of this dispute.  Last year we tabled a Bill in this House to amend the Fisheries Act but were told that it was the Government's intention to introduce amending legislation in the House.  People who come to this country to fish are, technically, breaking the law.  It is absolutely ridiculous that people, such as Jack Charlton, could be fined but this could happen under the law as it stands.  While the Minister made some good progress in discussions over a long period, he should have gone one step further and introduced amending legislation in the House to resolve the problem once and for all. It is absolutely ludicrous that people could be prosecuted if they fish without a licence.  The law has not been repealed and, even though he promised to do so, the Minister has not yet come up with an answer.  Like Deputy Taylor-Quinn, I am very concerned that this will be an ongoing problem.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the Marine Institute.  On reading the Bill to establish the Marine Institute I felt the Minister had got it right and we had much to look forward to.  I note, however, from the Estimate that a sum of £110,000 is to be made available but this is a trifling sum given the importance of the Marine Institute. I hope the Minister elaborates on this matter when replying because I have always felt that such an institute could advance marine research.  Again, when it comes to marine activity we are a second class nation.  We tend to allow the Spaniards, French, Dutch and Germans do the work we should do ourselves.  If encouraged, many young people would get involved in such research with the result that jobs could be created for many thousands of young people who would then not have to go abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was very comprehensive and I have not had an opportunity to go through it.  I await his comments on the air-sea rescue service which is totally inadequate.  The least our fishermen are entitled to is a proper air-sea rescue service which meets their <Col N="1506" /> needs.  Such a service is not available even though, as I said, we have many well trained people in the Air Corps who would provide an excellent service if the proper facilities were made available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister and my colleagues in extending my sympathy and that of my party to the families and friends, including Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, of the Fisheries officers who were drowned so tragically at the weekend.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Estimates, in the short time available to me, I would like to concentrate on one aspect, the cost to the taxpayer of the liquidation of Irish Shipping, the consequences for the economy of the Government's failure to reconstitute a national deep sea merchant fleet and the continuing failure of the Government to make moneys available for <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy payments to the 350 former employees of the company.</P>
      <P>When Irish Shipping was put into liquidation six years ago, it was big news. There were protests, not unlike those we have seen in recent times by the staff of RTE.  There were feature articles in the newspapers and current affairs magazines. The dismissed employees were given the red carpet treatment by the present Taoiseach and Minister for the Marine when they were in Opposition. The present Minister for the Marine came into this House on 25 June 1985 and proposed at column 1863 of the Official Report that:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann, in view of the loyal service given by employees of Irish Shipping to the people of Ireland until the liquidation of that company in November 1984, calls on the Government to&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  pay adequate compensation to the staff of Irish Shipping of six weeks salary per year of service and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  restore the pensions of all former Irish Shipping staff to their pre liquidation level, and further <Col N="1507" /> calls on the Government to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep-sea merchant shipping fleet and to provide for the reconstitution of such a fleet'.  </P>
    <P>Six years later, two changes of Government later, the Irish Shipping story has slipped out of the news and in this evening's address does not even merit a mention.  When the former Irish Shipping workers come to Leinster House now, it is not for a pre-arranged photo-call with the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Marine, but to protest at their failure to honour the specific promises which they made to them prior to the 1987 general election.  When over the past 12 months I and my colleagues in The Workers' Party have attempted to question the Minister on the issue, he has dived for cover by claiming that it is <i>sub judice.</i> He has relied on the same legal niceties as his predecessors, of whom on 25 June 1985, he himself said, &ldquo;get under my skin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental questions about Irish Shipping, which have never been answered.  Why has the unnecessary liquidation of Irish Shipping cost the Irish taxpayer over £120 million?  Why has it cost more to liquidate Irish Shipping than it would have cost to keep it going?  Why, therefore, was Irish Shipping liquidated in the first place, when it could have been rescued and restored to profitability by 1987?  Who, or what was responsible for turning a consistently profitable company into a massive loss maker over an 18 month period between 1982 and 1984? Why did the company enter into long term chartering arrangements in a business which is a cyclical one and at a time when freight prices were dropping?</P>
    <P>Why has nobody ever been called to account for the serious indictment in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies of 3 April 1985 which says:</P>
    <P>The Committee indicts:</P>
    <P> (i)  The Board of the Company <Col N="1508" /> with failure to keep itself informed on the chartering developments</P>
    <P>(ii)  The senior executives involved in the chartering agreements with acting without authority and apparently independently of the Board and</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Finance with failure to adequately monitor the situation. </P>
    <P>When will the citizens of this country be given an explanation for the scandal of the <i>Irish Spruce,</i> which cost twice as much to build at Verolme, £28 million, as it would to build elsewhere; which cost the taxpayer £60 million to get out of the leasing arrangements and pay for maintenance at Marseilles and which was eventually sold for a mere £3.75 million?</P>
    <P>Why at the height of the company's financial troubles, were some of the senior executives swanning around the major maritime cities on seemingly bottomless expense accounts?</P>
    <P>Why, considering the subsequent fate of the company's employees was a deal done with the Executive Chairman of the company to retire him off with a generous golden handshake, £66,000 plus pension, only a few weeks before the company was liquidated, despite the fact that the Cabinet had decided to liquidate the company nearly 12 months previously, as revealed in the recently published diaries of the former Cabinet Minister, Gemma Hussey?</P>
    <P>This country lost £120 million and its stratgegic shipping fleet with the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  In no other democratic state, would these serious questions be still unanswered, six years later.</P>
    <P>There may be an unspoken mutual interest among past and present Government Ministers, some senior civil servants and some former senior executives of the company to cover up the scandalous story of Irish Shipping.  The Irish public is entitled to have the answers and I am repeating the call, which was first <Col N="1509" /> made six years ago, for a public sworn inquiry into what happened in Irish Shipping and why the taxpayer has lost so much on it.</P>
    <P>The most immediate aspect of the case concerns the fate of the 350 former employees.  Since the company's foundation in 1941 until its liquidation in 1984, not a single day was lost through industrial action.  Irish Shipping workers risked their lives to keep our people supplied with necessities during the war years. They were skilled, diligent, loyal servants of this State.  They were the biggest losers of all &mdash; they were dismissed with only statutory redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>No other public servants, no other redundant employees of a semi-State company have been treated as shabbily as the Irish Shipping workers.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Labour, told these workers in September 1985, that Fianna Fáil, if returned to power, would compensate the workers of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>Back in power, the present Minister for the Marine told the Dáil in March 1987 that the Government would produce a report concerning the question of compensation for the former employees.  On 31 March 1987, he said it would be produced within &ldquo;a reasonable time&rdquo;.  On 20 October 1987, Minister Daly said it was still &ldquo;early days&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By 24 November 1987 the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gallagher said that the question of providing financial assistance for the former employees of Irish Shipping raised complex and sensitive issues.  On 5 May 1988, the same Minister said &ldquo;I expect to have the examination of the issues completed and conclusions brought to the Government for consideration shortly.&rdquo;  By 4 May 1989, we were back to the same argument as was used by the previous Government &mdash; that there were &ldquo;complex and sensitive legal issues&rdquo; and that there was a risk of claims from unsecured creditors.  Like the grand Old Duke of York, the Minister had led the former Irish Shipping workers back to where they had started.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates before us a sum of <Col N="1510" /> £60,000 is provided for <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to certain pensioners of Irish Shipping Limited.  If it is possible to make <i>exgratia</i> payments to some 23 pensioners, why is it not possible to pay all former employees proper redundancy settlements by way of <i>ex-gratia</i> payment?  What are the so-called legal difficulties?  The Minister has received legal opinion from lawyers representing the former employees, that there are no legal difficulties? Surely the Minister is not going to see the former employees of Irish Shipping, whose cause he once championed, have to take their case before the courts in order to secure their settlements.</P>
    <P>I ask him now, to please drop the <i>sub judice</i> excuse, to negotiate a settlement with these workers, to honour his pledge to them, to be a man of his word, to bring in an Estimate, making provision for <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to the former employees of Irish Shipping who surely deserve them six years after their company was liquidated.</P>
    <P>I would like also, a Cheann Comhairle, to refer briefly to one or two aspects of the Estimates.  I would like to comment particularly on subhead E.3 which deals with State harbours in which I note there is a 9 per cent reduction in the allocation of approximately £1.5 million in 1990, over the provisional outturn of £1.7 in 1989.  As this is the item which covers Dún Laoghaire harbour, I would like to ask the Minister specifically if this means that there is a reduction in expenditure on Dún Laoghaire harbour.  If so, that is something I would be greatly concerned about in the first full year in which the Department of the Marine have responsibility for that harbour.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the comments the Minister has just made in relation to investment on harbours. While I welcome the statement he has made about the possibility of investment to the tune of £60 million in four major harbours, I am greatly disquieted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said overall it was £60 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister <Col N="1511" /> would clarify it because he did emphasise four harbours in particular and he excluded Dún Laoghaire harbour which is the major passenger port in this State. That is something I am very concerned about and I would like the Minister to clarify it.  As he is aware, the interim harbour board which he established earlier this year has been working away, examining the various proposals for development at Dún Laoghaire harbour, and, no doubt, will report to him in due course.  It is quite clear to me that the project requiring to be advanced most urgently is that relating to the upgrading of passenger facilities for the car ferry service.  Obviously that will require investment.  I should like the Minister to confirm that some of the £60 million to which he referred will be invested in Dún Laoghaire harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief comments on this Estimate.  Like yourself a Cheann Comhairle, I am a landlubber, and living in a county far removed from the sea.  Nonetheless the Minister's responsibilities extend to inland fisheries, as they relate to some rivers in my constituency. I am thinking of the River Ara, the Aherlow, the Suir, some of the best known trout and salmon fishing rivers in the country with the possible exception of the Blackwater and a few others.  We have a problem in the area <i>vis-á-vis</i> the implications of fish farming for inland rivers.  In the Glen of Aherlow there is a well known fish farm, one of the first fish farming enterprises in the country, operated by a Mr. Leonard, which has been extremely successful.  Were it not for that inland fish farm it would have been almost impossible for people living in counties far removed from the coastline to have access to fresh fish on a regular basis, particularly in the western part of Tipperary, where people have to travel some 20 to 25 miles to Clonmel or Limerick in order to gain access to fresh fish markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister co-operate with his Cabinet colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1512" /> and Food, Deputy Kirk, under the aegis of Bord Glas with regard to the marketing of aquaculture, horticulture and mariculture, benefiting consumers within land-locked counties and giving them access particularly to fresh sea fish.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should seek greater co-operation with local authorities who at times have to come to grips with levels of pollution in some of our inland rivers leading to major fish kills, even as a result of accident, as was the case recently within my local authority area.  They have admitted to this accident and, in consultation with the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works, have entered into negotiations on restocking the relevant fish waters.  In spite of recent legislation in the area of pollution control there are still many accidental fish kills to which the Minister and his Department should devote particular attention.  There is a useful task to be undertaken, working in co-operation with the various State agencies and local authorities &mdash; who are the local development agencies &mdash; by way of input to job creation and the development of tourism associated in a very real way with the inland fishing industry in County Tipperary.  While the Minister's Department has specific responsibility for the marine, their responsibilities do have a bearing on all the tributaries flowing through the various counties to the sea.</P>
    <P>Within the overall development of the Minister's programme &mdash; referred to by my colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan &mdash; in co-operation with the Marine Research Institute dealing with Marine biology, I hope the Minister will not forget that inland counties have a direct relationship with the coastline.  In addition, in those inland areas there is potential for employment creation and the development of tourism following on the useful application of the Minister's energies in these areas.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Taylor-Quinn, Gerry O'Sullivan, Gilmore and Ferris for their contributions.  I want to take up the various points made by them.</P>
      <P>I want to tell Deputy Taylor-Quinn and the House that the question of licensing is a very serious one, that we have an obligation to reduce our tonnage by 3 per cent annually until we reach the figure decided by the EC as the appropriate one for our fishery tonnage here.  I regret to say that this is based on the figure which originally was given by this country and which was too low.  That constitutes the big problem.  As far as licences are concerned, there is no problem in granting a licence when it is a question of replacing the exact same tonnage in the fishing fleet.</P>
      <P>I promised to have the rod licence legislation introduced here.  I worked very hard to have it introduced.  I indicated to the House what the position was with regard to that legislation.  I heard Deputy Taylor-Quinn call 44 quorums since approximately 7 June in this House. I do not think that was in any way helpful to getting legislation before this House.</P>

The Minister there does not condone the behaviour of any of the Spanish trawler owners with regard to interference especially in the hake grounds of our fishermen.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The salmon review group was set up in September 1986 by the then Minister for Fisheries and published their report in November 1987.  The group recommended the lifting of the ban on the use of monofilament netting for salmon fishing.  They made this recommendation in the light of the fact that the law could not be effectively implemented as far as large boats were concerned, and that the fisheries protection officers could only apprehend small boats fishing close to the shore.</P>
      <P>That is the nub of the problem facing us today and for many years past.  The small inshore fishermen are being victimised whereas the large trawlers fishing long distances from the shore are able to use monofilament nets and thus exploit our salmon stocks without being apprehended by the fisheries protection officers.  It is a case of the big man being able to get away with blue murder while the small inshore fishermen have to pay the price for the big man's sins.  Entire coastal communities have been harassed and hounded during the past number of years because they use the only method of fishing which enables them to make a living &mdash; monofilament net fishing.  The review group admitted to that fact in their report, and it is a disgrace that the Minister will not accept their recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salmon review group were quite representative.  They were a high powered group, the chairman being the Secretary of the Department of the Marine, Mr. Fionán Ó Muircheartaigh and the other members included the chief officer of the Central Fisheries Board; a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána; the commander of the Irish Naval Service; an inspector and scientific adviser from the Department of the Marine; a principal officer from the inland fisheries section of the Department of the Marine; an assistant principal officer from the Department of Justice acting as an observer; an inspector and an engineer from the Department of the Marine; a principal officer from the wildlife service of the Office of Public Works; and another assistant principal from the inland fisheries section of the Department of the Marine together with an <Col N="1523" /> inspector of fisheries from the Department of the Marine &mdash; all people of high repute and standing.  They recommended in November 1987, that drift net salmon fishermen should be allowed to use monofilament nets, yet nothing has been done since that date to implement their recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have come into this House on numerous occasions and have advocated strongly during debates and at Question Time that the findings of the group be implemented.  I have been greeted by a wall of silence both from the Minister for the Marine and the Minister of State at that Department, who gives the impression they could not care less.  I would like to ask them who advised the experts who drew up this report?</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on the Order of Business yesterday.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Marine were highly offended that I dared do such a thing.  I know we have had a recent tragedy but the problem has been with us for some time.  The expert group recommended a solution two and a half years ago but nothing has been done in that regard.  In recent months, six people have died on the south coast and I am saying they died specifically because nothing has been done to implement the findings of the report of the salmon review group.</P>

      <P>On 10 May last I referred in the House to the two young fishermen who were drowned off Bunmahon, County Waterford, while they were fishing. I do not believe those accidents would have happened if the law had been amended in the way recommended by the committee.  How many more people, fishermen or fishery protection officers, will have to die before the committee's report is implemented into law?</P>
      <P>The committee, who are the real experts, fishermen, representatives of the fishermen and editorials in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> have advocated that the law should be changed so that we will have a reasonable regime whereby people will be able to fish and earn a living without having to suffer the consequences of their actions, be it drowning, imprisonment or fines which they cannot pay.  Thousands of people who live around the coast, including hundreds in my constituency, are affected in this way.</P>
      <P>This is not a subjective matter; it is a matter of right and wrong.  How can we expect people to make a living when they are not allowed to use a catching mechanism which will actually net fish?  The old nylon net is obsolete, ineffective and is not capable of earning a living for even the most hardworking fishermen.  It is a disgrace that the inshore fishermen, who work in open boats in all kinds of weather are put at the mercy of the sea and at the end of the day may not catch any fish, have their nets confiscated and have to go to prison for their efforts.  Is it fair that this should be allowed to continue to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, <i>The Cork Examiner</i> has been more than adequate in its reporting on this matter by way of staff reporting and editorials.  This very impartial group <Col N="1525" /> of people have come down steadfastly in favour of allowing monofilament netting to be used by fishermen.  I ask the Minister to listen to the pleas of fishermen, their representatives and the members of the committee who compiled the report and who heard submissions from individuals and interest groups throughout the country for months on end.  Will the Minister listen to the people who know?  I want to again ask him why nothing has been done in this regard and how many more people will have to die.</P>
    <P>Nobody envies the fishermen or the fishery protection officers who have a terrible job to do.  The Garda Síochána, the Naval Service and the fishery protection officers are constantly in conflict with the fishermen.  Both sides know the rights of the matter but they are in conflict because the laws are outdated and no effort has been made to change them. The fishery officers, the Garda and the Naval Service have to implement the law as it is laid down.  This inadequate law should be scrapped and replaced by something meaningful, useful and reasonable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> They <Col N="1527" /> had the opportunity of doing something but they did not do it.</P>
      <P>The background to the long-standing prohibition on the use of monofilament netting in fishing for salmon was set out fully in my reply to a previous Adjournment Debate on this issue on 20 November 1989 and I do not consider it necessary to go over the same ground again here tonight.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the Salmon Review Group.  I want to refer to their report which was published in January 1988.  This was a wide-ranging report which dealt comprehensively with a whole range of issues involving the conservation, exploitation and development of salmon stocks.  It was not, as the Deputy tried to convey to this House, a selective report.  The recommendations in the report on the future management of the salmon resource made a number of specific proposals in relation to the drift-net fishery in the sea which accounts at present, as it has done for the past 20 years or so, for the vast bulk of the Irish Salmon catch.  These proposals &mdash; I want the Deputy to listen carefully to them &mdash; which have to be taken together as a whole, would involve (a) introducing a system of quotas and tagging of all dead Salmon; (b) introducing a system of log books; (c) shortening the season for drift netting by six weeks; (d) tightening up the regulations for observing the weekly close time when no commercial salmon fishing is allowed at weekends &mdash; Saturday and Sunday &mdash; and possibly extending the duration of that close time; (e) restricting further the size of boat to be used in salmon drift netting; (f) reducing the zone in which drift netting is allowed progressively from 12 miles to nine miles, then to six miles and possibly to three miles from baselines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and <Col N="1528" /> (g) introducing a number of other measures regarding licensing of fishermen and agents, grant-aiding the purchase of vessels and marking and identification of same.</P>
      <P>The actual recommendation of the group on this matter was, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Provided agreement is obtained from the fishermen and the industry and that they operate this new regime, and that for as long as they comply with the provision of such a scheme in practice, the ban on monofilament should be Suspended.  If on adoption, co-operation and compliance with the new regime is not forthcoming the Group believes that the only remaining credible management and conservation option that would achieve the objectives set out would be complete banning of drift netting.</P>
      <P>All this was in the context of an earlier recommendation, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The primary objective of Government policy should be the rehabilitation of salmon Stocks and their rational management.  This necessarily involves firstly the regulation and secondly the curtailment of drift net fishing effort at sea.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report submissions were invited from interested parties on the contents of the report as a whole and, in all, submissions were received from 77 parties.  These submissions revealed that a lack of consensus existed on some of the central elements of the report's recommendations and, in particular, those dealing with drift netting and the use of monofilament.  In the absence of the kind of broad-based agreement envisaged for the regime in the report the Minister could not proceed with these complex arrangements.  That remains the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this very important matter which was brought to my attention by many people in farming and its business side.  The takeover of Halls by Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society was brought about by the Stock Exchange as a result of a bid by the company and successfully convincing the shareholders and the patrons of Halls that they were in line for a takeover.  It now means that there will be a monopoly in the importation of feedstuffs.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, for coming in to reply to this debate, and the Fair Trade Commission who met a deputation in the last few days.  The Fair Trade Commission were prepared to listen to all views expressed by a number of people who approached me because of their concern. Monopoly in the market of imported feed ingredients is the major problem here; 80 per cent of the industry, in terms of importation, will be controlled by the new merger which will raise many question marks about the feed import business. There will be a problem in regard to quality and the source of ingredients. The main ingredients involved at present are protein and cereal imports to make up the shortfall at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major change will take place at farm level because of new technology, a breakthrough in mixing and milling and changes in all other spheres of activity in industry.  At present farmers have greater resources at their disposal, such as new machinery, and they are now in a position to mix and mill.  It is vitally important that the source of ingredients is not closed to them.  Quite recently, a number of people told me that they had to buy through a third party such as a merchant or co-operative.  These people used to be able to buy in volume and were given favourable terms and conditions.  They also need a choice of ingredients which <Col N="1530" /> will not be available if there is a monopoly. Farming has become very sophisticated and there has been criticism of the feeds given to animals which can cause problems in regard to the finished product.  Farmers should have a choice in buying ingredients.</P>
    <P>If farmers cannot purchase directly from the importer there will be an added cost on the production of our livestock, which we cannot afford.  We cannot have an island monopoly and this is where the real problem lies &mdash; as we face into 1992. Halls and the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society could have 80 per cent of the market which would be quite dangerous. The position is quite different in Denmark, Holland and Germany.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we must have licensed compounders in the animal feed industry.  However, the licensing is necessary to protect the consumer, on whose behalf I raised this matter.  The farmer is the primary producer and he could now do this job himself because of new technology. However, in relation to costs, he would be at the wrong end of the scale by about £10 per tonne, which is not acceptable to the people I represent.  The value of agricultural output in 1989 amounted to about £3.3 million and the cost of feed imports &mdash; compounds and &ldquo;straights&rdquo;&mdash; was an estimated £550 million, the equivalent of 20 per cent of a total output.</P>
    <P>The intensive livestock sector feed ingredients are approximately 75 per cent over the farm gate value.  Our agricultural exports were valued at about £3.41 million in 1989.  I am talking specifically about the pig industry.  Competitive costs for feedstuffs are crucial <i>vis-á-vis</i> our main competitors.  In 1989, 2.4 million tonnes at a cost of £425 million was added to the cost of home produced cereals and &ldquo;straights&rdquo;.  That meant that the cost of home produced cereals amounted to £135 million.  A further breakdown revealed that cattle meal came to 1.4 million tonnes and about 500,000 tonnes in regard to pigs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> Poultry is a very important sector which also depends on the importation of ingredients.  Many Members, especially on the Opposition benches, have made speeches about the sheep industry and the problems associated with it.  Horses and other animals are also affected.  You can see the importance of the importation of feedstuffs.  In 1987 &mdash; the last year for which I have figures &mdash; Halls imported about 60 per cent of the total feed requirements of the country.  The IAWS were a smaller importer made up mainly of the co-operative movement.  They were the main shareholders until it became a plc company and went on the market.  They have broadened their base which further changed the scene.  There has been a lot of talk here recently about levelling the playing field.  Halls are a traditional firm in the import business and have been recognised for many years as being a reputable and influential company in the feed business.</P>
    <P>I have a stake in the pig breeders and that is why I was called upon to try to defend the situation.  People are very concerned about the monopoly resulting from the merger.  Only about 20 per cent is left, made up of a number of people. One group import 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The major problem that will arise is control at the port of entry.  The two companies I refer to, IAWS and Halls have the monopoly of the port of Cork, the main importing facility there.  I understand they have New Ross, Waterford and Dublin and a concern in the North, in Belfast, known as Barnetts, part of the Halls operation.  With those amalgamated into one company, the business is at risk.  Some of my people have been told in the last few days that in the new circumstances they will have to purchase through third parties.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I want from the Minister tonight an assurance that safeguards will be written through the Fair Trade Commission into any agreement or compromise reached <Col N="1532" /> so that the people who want to purchase feed are free to do so through that now importing company without hindrance or having to go through any third party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ned O'Keeffe for his contribution.  At the outset, I would like to say that I understand the concern expressed by the Deputy and by others in relation to the implications for competition, particularly in the animal feed ingredients import businesses, in relation to the proposed take-over of R &amp; H Hall, plc, by the IAWS group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I wish to confirm that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has received notifications under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987 by each of the enterprises involved in the proposal.  As indicated in the Minister's statement on 22 June 1990, in accordance with the powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under these Acts, the Minister has decided to refer the proposal whereby the IAWS group propose acquiring the whole of the ordinary and preference share capital of R &amp; H Hall, plc for investigation and report by the Fair Trade Commission.  The proposal was referred to the commission on 22 June 1980 and the Minister has asked the commission to report to him by 23 July 1990.  On receipt of the report of the commission, the Minister will then decide what further action, <Col N="1533" /> if any, is warranted by the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987 set out to control mergers and take-overs involving any two or more enterprises, coming under control, where at least one carries on business in the State, and where they each exceed certain financial thresholds as defined in the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>Where a merger or take-over is proposed which falls within the scope of the Acts, notification of the proposal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is obligatory.  A merger or take-over cannot be concluded until the Minister has stated that he does not proposed to prohibit it either absolutely or conditionally, or in the abscence of such a statement, until a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, or from the date of receipt of such further information as the Minister may require.  In the case of this proposal, the period within which the Minister can take a decision under the Act will expire on 20 September 1990. However, with a view to removing business uncertainties for the parties concerned, I would hope that a decision will be possible within a much shorter time scale than this.</P>
    <P>Under the 1978 and 1987 Acts, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has discretion, initially, to approve a proposal without further investigation, or to refer it for investigation to the Fair Trade Commission.  The commission are obliged to investigate every proposal referred to them and report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on their investigation.  The report of the commission must state their opinion as to whether the proposed merger or take-over would operate against the common good in respect of the criteria set out in the Schedule to the 1978 Act.  These criteria comprehend such matters as the effect on competition in the marketplace, the interests of the consumer, the effect on continuity of supplies or services, the <Col N="1534" /> effect on employment and on employees, the interests of shareholders, the impact on regional development, and whatever economic benefits might arise for the enterprises and the industry involved.</P>
    <P>Having received a report of the Fair Trade Commission, the Minister may then approve the proposal, but he is also empowered to make an order prohibiting a proposed merger or take-over, either absolutely or except on certain conditions specified in the order.  It is, of course, also open to the Minister, in allowing a notified merger or take-over to proceed, to secure the agreement of a party or parties involved in the proposal to undertakings or assurances in relation to areas of concern.</P>
    <P>The IAWS Group, from their origins in 1897 as a wholesale supplier of materials and services to co-ops and merchants throughout the country, have become a leading manufacturer and supplier of inputs to the Irish agricultural industry, and an emerging force in the downstream food manufacturing and distribution business operating in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and England.</P>
    <P>R &amp; H Hall are involved in the importation, storage and distribution of grain and animal feed ingredients.  These two enterprises are, by far, the largest importers of animal feed ingredients, and because of the implications of the take-over proposal for competition in this area in particular, the Minister has referred the matter to the Fair Trade Commission. Another area which I would expect the commission to investigate would be the question of access to ports and port storage facilities to competing importers, following the proposed merger of the two major players in the animal feed ingredients import business.</P>
    <P>I should mention, of course, that there are likely benefits which may accrue from the proposed merger.  The economies of scale which would be achieved by combining the complementary activities of <Col N="1535" /> IAWS and Halls should bring major benefits to the Irish economy, particularly to the livestock and feed sector.  Both companies have significant interests outside Ireland and the enlarged group would be in a much stronger position to take advantage of the international growth opportunities in the context of the Single Market in 1992.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the proposal under the mergers legislation, and taking the report of the Fair Trade Commission into consideration, the Minister will have to see whether any such benefits would outweigh any costs arising out of any restriction on competition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> As I have already indicated, the Minister has referred the proposed take-over of R &amp; H Hall by the IAWS Group to the Fair Trade Commission for investigation. He will be receiving their report in due course and I want to assure the House that a balanced consideration will be given to the matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to record thanks to Deputy O'Keeffe for his contribution to this debate.  His extensive knowledge of the business in question will be of use when this matter is considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.40 a.m. on Thursday, 12 July, 1990 until 10.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I have no such specific statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of general practitioner services to private patients.

      <P>I am aware of public concern about the suggestion that a BSE type disease might spread from animals to humans.  I accordingly commissioned the Food Safety Advisory Committee in July 1989 to investigate the issues and to report to me on the outcome of their findings.</P>
      <P>The Committee is an expert advisory body established by both my colleague, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, Minister for Agriculture and Food, and me to provide advice on all aspects of food safety and on diseases transmissible from animals to humans.  The range of expertise covers human and veterinary medicine, bacteriology, toxicology, environmental health, food analysis and food science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1990 the report of the committee was presented to both the Minister for Agriculture and Food and myself. That report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that BSC or scraple is transmissible to humans.  In arriving at this outcome the committee had regard to various studies carried out including the February 1989 UK Department of Health/Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and food working party report on bovine spongiform encephalopathy and also to conclusions reached at international fora such as the December 1989 meeting of <Col N="1318" /> the foot and mouth diseases and Other Epizootics Commission of the Office International des Epizootics in Paris.</P>
    <P>The committee in addition endorsed the action taken to date by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in making the disease subject to compulsory notification and in requiring that all infected cattle be slaughtered and destroyed and their owners compensated.  The committee agreed to keep abreast of developments, legislation, research findings and other information relevant to BSE.</P>
    <P>I am maintaining close contact with the Minister for Agriculture and Food on this matter in order to ensure the safe-guarding of public health.  He has advised me that the EC Scientific Veterinary Committee examined the issue as recently as 6 June and has affirmed that meat derived from bovine animals in countries which BSE has been recorded is not considered to be of danger to public health.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the confirmation of spongiform encephalopathy in cats has raised further fears among the public about the possibility of transmission from animals to humans.  I have asked the Food Safety Advisory Committee to re-examine the matter and I understand that the committee's second report will be completed by the end of July.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 15 which I answered on 21 June 1990 &mdash; Official Report, columns 791-792, <Col N="1319" /> volume 400 &mdash; the cases of bacterial meningitis reported to the Department of Health under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, do not show any significant increase in the incidence of the disease.</P>
    <P>These notifications show that the reported incidence of bacterial meningitis has fluctuated but it is recognised that there has been a slight increase in its prevalence both in this country and in the UK over the past ten years.  Most of the cases which have occurred in this country have appeared as isolated cases with no recognised relationship to each other.  Following the diagnosis of a case it is usual that the local health personnel investigate the family situation and other contacts with the patients and arrange for prophylaxis, where required.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the situation regarding all cases of meningitis be monitored closely so that the necessary prophylactic and other control measures can be introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The following figures in respect of Cork city and South County Cork are as follows: 1988, six cases; 1989, ten cases and 1990 (to date), five cases.</P>

In co-operation with the National Youth Council the unit is currently completing the development of a special programme on drink awareness and youth.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the Department of Education the unit has developed comprehensive resource materials on AIDS for use in schools and these will be available in the autumn.  Further school based programmes which are being supported are a health education project in schools throughout the Mid-Western Health Board area and the development of health education materials to support teachers.</P>
    <P>One school initiative of particular importance was the very successful national lifestyle poster competition for primary and post-primary schools which helped provide a new health education focus in schools.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, the unit is developing resource materials for a community based programme on healthy lifestyles, <Col N="1322" /> currently being piloted in the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Financial support is provided by the unit for the community based Kilkenny health project &mdash; a pilot programme to modify risk factors for heart disease.  The unit is also supporting a range of voluntary organisations providing financial and other assistance for health promotion activities and is also continuing to distribute to the public a wide range of health promotion materials.</P>
    <P>This list is not exhaustive but merely illustrative of the various health promotion activities in which the unit is currently involved and I am sure the Deputy will agree that, together, they represent an active and comprehensive health promotion programme.</P>

      <P>The plans for the development of psychiatric services in County Roscommon involve the provision of a new 30 bed acute psychiatric unit at the County Hospital, Roscommon.  I have provided the necessary capital resources to enable this unit to be completed and the Western Health Board have agreed to open this facility as soon as possible.  My Department have issued formal approval to the Western Health Board to provide hostels, workshops and day centres in various locations in County Roscommon, including the provision of a new sector headquarters, day centre and workshop in Castlerea.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, will continue as at present to cater for mentally infirm patients who need longer term care and approval has also been given to the upgrading of part of the hospital for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The deployment of speech therapists employed by the Western Health Board is a matter for the board to decide having regard to the competing needs to be served.  I understand that only a small amount of speech therapy time for people with mental handicap was possible under the earlier arrangements.  Following review of speech therapy services undertaken by the board, decisions were taken to ensure a better managed service.  The board felt that it would be more appropriate for speech therapy services for people with a mental handicap in Roscommon to be provided by the Brothers of Charity, who are the major provider of mental handicap services in the country.  The Brothers of Charity have provided increased speech therapy sessions in the county following the board's decisions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Information on waiting lists for ear, nose and throat services is collected on a hospital basis.  It is possible that a patient resident in one health board area would be on a waiting list for ENT treatment in another health board area.</P>
    <P>I have been particularly concerned about the problems of child deafness and I specifically targeted funds to alleviate this problem.  The position has been improving as the information from Temple Street Hospital bears out.  In 1988, 976 ENT cases were treated.  In 1989, the number rose to 1,189 and in 1990, the projected activity is 1,800 ENT cases treated at the hospital.  I am particularly pleased to note that children needing grommets are attended to within six months.  I might also add that, at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork, the regional centre for ENT in the Southern Health Board area, there is now a throughput of ten children per week for this procedure following on the special allocation of additional funds.</P>
    <P>With regard to ENT generally, very satisfactory results are being achieved. For example, the waiting list for ENT surgery at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital has been reduced from over 1,000 in October last to 363 at the end of May 1990.  In the Midland Health Board area a new regional ENT service was established at Tullamore General Hospital in 1989 and the first permanent consultant ENT surgeon has recently taken up duty at the hospital.</P>
    <P>These are specific, tangible results which are being achieved as a result of the initiatives taken last year.  They are part of an on-going, programme of eliminating undue waiting times in any particular speciality and I propose to continue to build on the progress already made.</P>

      <P>The Government's view is that the most effective way at present for them to work for a satisfactory conclusion of the Birmingham Six case is to pursue the matter directly with the British Government. The Government have repeatedly and forcefully conveyed their views and their deep concern about the case to the British authorities.</P>
      <P>I informed the House a number of times in advance that it was not the Government's intention to raise the issue at the Copenhagen CSCE Conference on the Human Dimension.  However, during the Conference in Copenhagen the Irish delegation met the Non-Governmental Organisation representing the Birmingham Six and facilitated them in every way possible.  When asked by the NGO concerned for assistance in raising the case at the Conference, the delegation referred to the decision taken by the Government not to raise the issue there.</P>

    <P>It is, of course, open to NGOs to raise their concerns with the delegations of other participating states which receive them and this, in fact, took place.

      <P>As I indicated in a reply on 22 May, 1990, the general rule about names on passports is that passports are normally issued in the name on the applicant's birth certificate.  Where the applicant wishes to use a name other than <Col N="1335" /> that on her-his birth certificate, and this differs significantly from the latter, evidence will be required showing that the name in question has been used by the applicant over a reasonable period of time.</P>
      <P>This rule obtains irrespective of the basis for the name which the applicant wishes to have on her-his passport.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is fully associated with the Twelve reaction to current developments in Albania.  The Twelve are concerned that human rights and the fundamental principles of international law are being violated there.  On 5 July the Twelve issued a statement expressing their deep concern at the gravity of the situation which has led to thousands of Albanians seeking refuge in foreign embassies in Tirana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this statement, the Twelve &ldquo;strongly urge the Albanian Government, first, to take the necessary measures to ensure the physical safety of the persons who <Col N="1336" /> have taken refuge in embassies, to refrain from reprisals against their families, to allow them to receive such assistance as is necessary and to guarantee their free departure from Albanian territory, and secondly, to respect international law and the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as regards the inviolability of diplomatic missions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The statement adds that &ldquo;moreover, the Twelve express the hope that the Albanian authorities will rapidly adopt the reforms and measures necessary for Albania to become engaged in a process of democratisation bringing about a situation in which human rights are fully respected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Twelve recall in the statement that respect for human rights and the principles of international law is an essential condition for the establishment of normal relations with the Community.  The statement also makes clear that the events taking place in Tirana are in contradiction with the expressed wish of the Albanian authorities for their country to draw closer to the CSCE process.</P>

      <P>In recent years the ECU has become a major international financial currency and is increasingly being used in commercial transactions.  Irish Government securities have been issued in ECU denominations.  In this country the ECU is, in general, subject to the same restrictions as apply to all foreign currencies but it does receive preferential treatment in certain circumstances under the exchange control regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no immediate plans for significant changes in the present status of <Col N="1337" /> the ECU in the member states of the Community.  The future of the ECU is being examined in depth, however, in the context of the continuing discussion on the final stages of economic and monetary union.  It is too early to give any clear indication of the likely role of the ECU and its impact in the member states when full union is achieved.</P>

In this case one of the two nights of employment is a Saturday every second week.</P>
      <P>During a review of claims of this nature, the error was found and has been corrected.  As a result the person concerned is now receiving her correct weekly entitlement of four days benefit each week; previously she was receiving five days benefit in every second week; that is, she was paid incorrectly in respect of the Saturday nights.  There are no arrears of benefit due to her.</P>
      <P>As the error arose through a misinterpretation of the regulations, the amount overpaid will not have to be repaid to my Department.</P>

      <P>Any disallowance of a claim for disability benefit is made by a statutorily appointed deciding officer who has considered the case in the light of evidence available to him arising from a medical referee examination.  Once the deciding officer decides that a person is no longer incapable of work disability benefit cannot remain in payment.</P>
      <P>Where a person appeals against the deciding officer's decision and the appeal is successful, disability benefit is restored with effect from the date on which the deciding officer made his decision.</P>

      <P>As the Commission indicated in its Seventh Report, 1984 (laid before the Oireachtas on 5 July 1985 &mdash; pl. 3313) some of the recommendations contained in the working paper referred to in the question were proper for consideration by the Superior <Col N="1345" /> Courts Rules Committee.  The Commission therefore decided to defer the preparation of its final report until the matter was considered by that body.</P>
      <P>Since then the Rules Committee drew up and published the Rules of the Superior Courts (S.I. No. 15 of 1986) which came into effect on 1 October, 1986 with the concurrence of the then Minister for Justice.  Under the provisions of Order 84 (Rules 18 to 27) the former conditional order system of application for relief in the nature of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition or quo warranto has been replaced by a system of &ldquo;application for leave&rdquo;.  This new procedure implements substantially the provisional recommendation of the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The present system for the acquisition of intoxicating liquor licences has its origins in the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902. The policy in that respect of the 1902 Act and subsequent Licensing Acts has been to stabilise and, in certain circumstances, reduce the total number of liquor licences in the country and to facilitate the movement of licences from areas of low population to higher population locations.</P>
      <P>I consider that, in general, these policy objectives are being met both in rural and urban areas but, as with any such system with countrywide application, there may be anomalies in some areas.  As I have already informed the Deputy during the course of my replies to supplementary questions on 30 May, 1990 &mdash; Official Report, columns 800-801 &mdash; I have no proposals for a general review of the licensing legislation.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that adequate arrangements are now in place throughout the country for the investigation of alleged cases of child sexual abuse and for the treatment of children who have suffered such abuse.</P>
      <P>As far as the Eastern Health Board area is concerned, units for the investigation and management of alleged child sexual abuse were established early in 1988 at Temple Street Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>During 1988, a special allocation of £0.5 million from the national lottery surplus was made to each of the other seven health boards to enable them to establish appropriate services in their areas.  Services are now in place in each health board area; some of them are based in a particular hospital in the region while others are provided on a community basis.  An allocation of £0.5 million from the national lottery was made in 1989 for the continuation of these services and I am about to issue further allocations for the 12 month period up to June 1991.</P>
      <P>Information concerning the identification and management of child abuse, both physical and sexual has also been provided in the child abuse guidelines which were issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied with the range of assessment/treatment services that are now available, I am conscious of the need for improvements in the areas of child psychiatry and residential provision.  It is my intention to develop new and improved services in these areas as available resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention that the Child Care Bill, 1988, which has now completed its passage through Committee Stage, contains a number of provisions which are relevant to the problem of child sexual abuse.

      <P>I have asked the Mid-Western Health Board to prepare a multi-annual plan for the development of mental handicap services in consultation with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee. This plan will cover the next five years and will form a regional programme to be implemented in accordance with available resources for this purpose.  The submission from the Limerick Parents and Friends Association, which I have received, will be taken fully into account in the preparation of the plan.</P>
      <P>This year approximately £13 million will be spent on services to people with a mental handicap in the mid-western region.  Earlier this year I allocated a sum of £150,000 for the provision of an extra 55 day places, six residential places and two community nurses to meet immediate priority needs.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> Information regarding orthopaedic waiting lists is collected on a hospital basis.  It is possible that a patient resident in one health board area would be on a waiting list for orthopaedic treatment in another health board area.</P>
    <P>Priority in elective orthopaedics is being given to increasing the throughput of hip replacement operations.  As a result of the special measures taken last year, the output for this procedure increased in 1989 from the projected target of 1,900 to 2,200, an increase of over 15 per cent.  The throughput of 2,200 for 1989 can be compared favourably to the throughput of 1,600 in the early eighties. It is hoped to reach a target of about 2,700 hip replacements this year.  With regard to elective orthopaedics generally, it is projected that activity will be increased by nearly 22 per cent in 1990 over 1989 levels.</P>

      <P>A survey of the educational provision for the children of travelling families was carried out by my Department's primary school inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The report shows that 5,000 traveller children of primary school going age were availing of primary education.  The survey also shows;</P>
      <P> 1.  30 per cent approximately of the pupils availed of special classes;</P>
      <P>2.  36 per cent approximately availed of additional assistance on the withdrawal basis to pupils who were partly integrated; and</P>
      <P>3.  The remainder availed of special classes for travelling children in ordinary national schools and the special capitation grant in respect of such classes has been increased substantially.  There are now 143 special classes in operation throughout the country.  </P>
      <P>Over recent years increasing emphasis has been placed on the provision of pre-schools and 560 children approximately drawn from over 390 families attended these pre-schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that the children of travelling families should derive full benefit from the national educational system.  I asked my Department to issue a circular in May 1988 to boards of management and principal teachers of national schools urging them to make a special effort to enrol traveller children and to cater for their needs.  I am satisfied that every possible step is being taken by <Col N="1357" /> my Department to provide in association with the individual school authorities involved a high standard of educational facilities for traveller children at primary and pre-school level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Strategy for achieving the Government's tourism targets which include a doubling of tourist numbers in the period 1989-93 involves: increased public and private sector investment in the development of a more extensive and attractive tourism product range through the use of EC Structural Funds and other incentives such as the business expansion scheme; improved competitiveness of the tourism product in terms of quality and price; increased market penetration by Bord Fáilte, with the assistance of the industry, including entry to new markets and greater niche marketing and improved packaging and distribution of the tourism product in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Structural Funds available under the Operational Programme for Tourism (1989-93) will be the main incentive for encouraging and priming tourist developments up to 1993.  The tourism industry in County Mayo, as well as in other counties, can maximise its share of the growth targets by co-operating with the tourism agencies who are responsible <Col N="1360" /> for the administration of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>I am advised by Bord Fáilte that County Mayo features strongly in their marketing plans and, with the benefit of Knock Airport and its associated promotional drive, County Mayo is expected to achieve substantial growth over the next few years.  The bord have also advised that the newly restructured Regional Tourism Organisation will assist the industry in County Mayo in planning and formulating additional promotional campaigns in order to ensure that the county will gain the maximum exposure to overseas tourism markets.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Central Statistics Office that data on tourist numbers and revenue is not available on a county basis.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte publish estimates of tourist numbers and revenue on a regional basis only.  These estimates are compiled using the board's own surveys which are applied to national CSO figures.</P>
      <P>Data on visitor numbers and revenue for 1989 in respect of the Western and North-Western Regional Tourism Organisations which include the counties of Connaught are shown in the table which is being circulated in the Official Report.  Directly comparable data in respect of the years 1987 and 1988 is not available following a revision of the regional boundaries.</P>
