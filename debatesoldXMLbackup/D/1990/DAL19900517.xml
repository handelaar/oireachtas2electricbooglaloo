      <P>I seek permission to raise on the Adjournment a number of matters.  I will not refer to any Garda investigation, but specifically I seek permission to raise on the Adjournment the reason the Minister for Tourism and Transport has asked Aer Lingus to take disciplinary action, where appropriate, in the light of the accountant's recent report in view of the fact that the chief executive of Aer Lingus was the chairman of the subsidiary company until 1988.  Second, I also wish to raise on the Adjournment the reason there is no accountant in the Department of Tourism and Transport. Third, I would like to ask if any action is to be taken against the auditors of the company concerned.  Finally, may I ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>You raised the question whether the arrangements for taking the Finance Bill were satisfactory and in <Col N="2019" /> order.  I have to put it to you that they are very far from that.  We are faced with a situation of gross disorder so far as the arrangements for the taking of the Finance Bill are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order for ministerial amendments to be circulated so late when the arrangements for guillotining the discussion had been agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is <Col N="2021" /> receiving amendments at very late notice in connection with the Finance Bill and seeks to facilitate both sides of the House in that regard.  My staff are working overtime in respect of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters I would prefer you would raise with my office instead of wasting the time of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Your office, as you have just said, Sir, is under great pressure from other quarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I not at this point, and within the order of this House, draw to your attention the fact that while the Labour Party have complied with the legal requirement to have the Finance Bill completed by a certain time, it is unacceptable to the process of democracy to have the Minister for Finance circulate amendments the night before they are to be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise on the Adjournment the treatment of some Irish citizens seeking visitors visas to the US. Would I be in order in raising this matter on the Adjournment on the basis that I will be requesting the Minister to seek clarification from the US Government as to why this is happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the guidance of the Chair whether I should raise the following matter by way of Private Notice Question or by way of question on the Adjournment this evening.  It relates to a serious security matter at Lifford Bridge in County Donegal.  The bridge has been closed for two days because there is a bomb sitting on it.  The British authorities will not move in until they get an assurance from the Irish Government that their lives will be protected and the people of east Donegal and west Tyrone are extremely angry that no action is being taken by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission I would like to raise on the Adjournment the fact that the Swiss Cottage in Chair, the only one of its kind in Ireland and which was opened last September, has been closed to the public for the past eight months.  I understand it is the intention of the Office of Public Works to have this <Col N="2023" /> major tourist amenity in our area open for just three months of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Tourism and Transport to tell the House that, when he instructed the board of Aer Lingus to take appropriate civil action, he intended that Stokes Kennedy Crowley would be the company against which the action should be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday morning I sought to raise on the Adjournment a disturbing matter relating to defects in local authority dwellings in my constituency and was ruled out of order as it was not the responsibility of the Minister.  I want to question that and I would like to raise it on the Adjournment.  The Minister has responsibility because it is his responsibility to raise the finance.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Deputies time to have a look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 32 continues the policy of reducing the standard rate of corporation tax while at the same time eliminating accelerated capital allowances.  With effect from 1 April 1991 the standard rate of corporation tax will be reduced from 43 per cent to 40 per cent.  The standard rate will then be a full 10 per cent lower than the rate of 50 per cent which applied <Col N="2032" /> prior to the implementation of the policy of phased reduction in the rate.</P>
    <P>The provision of the Second Schedule ensures that the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing companies will be unaffected by the reduction in the standard rate to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The rate of corporation tax will remain at 43 per cent for the first three months of 1991.  It will also be 43 per cent for the year 1990 and will be 40 per cent for the last nine months of 1991 and for the year 1992.  Paragraph (i) provides that the periods 1 January 1990 to 31 March 1991 &mdash; 15 months &mdash; and 1 April 1991 to 31 December 1991 &mdash; nine months &mdash; shall be treated as financial years for the purposes of section 6 (3) and the proviso to section 13 (1B) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  Where an accounting period straddles two financial years with different rates of corporation tax, section 6 (3) provides for the apportionment of the amount of the profits and section 13 (1B) provides for the amount to be included in profits in respect of chargeable gains. Strictly speaking, since an accounting period cannot be longer than 12 months, the accounting period including 1 April 1991 could not commence earlier than 2 April 1990, or cease later than 31 March 1992.  However, it is simpler and sufficient to have the first deemed financial year set out in subparagraph (i) (a) commencing on 1 January and the second deemed financial year set out in subparagraph (i) (b) ceasing on 31 December.</P>

      <P>We have been talking as though it was included.  This section is confined to the reduction in corporation tax from 43 to 40 per cent.  The Labour Party oppose this section.  They take the view that the corporate sector is one of the most favoured sectors of taxpayers. They have the benefits of the 10 per cent reductions, allowances and so on, albeit somewhat reduced by the Minister in later sections and that is welcome, but what is not acceptable is a reduction in corporation tax from 43 to 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>There was a lot of talk yesterday about resources being available, about the poor and about people in poverty traps.  It was stated that when the time comes the poor will be provided for but apparently, according to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael spokesmen, the Minister and Deputy Noonan, the poor must wait.  In an amendment moved yesterday, Deputy Noonan would have gone out of his way to support increases in the exemption limits when resources would be available. Here we are giving, in a year or so, £14 million to £20 million to the corporate sector.  That money should be used to increase the allowances for people on the lower end of the scale.  On the one hand, it cannot be said that the resources are not available to give very basic allowances to those at the lower end of the scale while, on the other hand, reducing corporation tax from 43 to 40 per cent. Where is the logic in that?  Deputy Noonan moved an amendment yesterday which the Minister told us would have involved a loss in tax of £200 million.</P>

      <P>I want to register the strongest protest about the fact that important matters in this Finance Bill have not been dealt with here and we have had no opportunity to discuss them, matters which affect the everyday lives of people, their standard of living, their tax payments and their take home pay. All sorts of important matters are just being bundled together and disposed of. There is no need for this reduction in corporation tax.  The corporate sector are not paying enough tax and that is why the PAYE sector is being crippled.  The corporate sector is favoured in every possible way.  They have all the tax advice and all the ruses available to them, just as the upper echelons have with the Business Expansion Scheme and I have grave doubts about that also.  We did not even have an opportunity of discussing the Minister's changes in the Business Expansion Scheme.  I hope we will have an opportunity to do so on Report Stage when I resubmit the amendment.</P>
      <P>The corporate sector are paying very little, relatively speaking, in tax.  They are availing of all the options, all the trickery and all the devices open to them under the legislation; they pay enormous fees to tax advisers and tax consultants who are doing extremely well.  As we are discussing this Bill they are going through the various sections and subsections working out their tax avoidance schemes and plans.  There is no need whatever for us to come in here and aid them by reducing what was an acceptable rate of tax at 43 per cent and bring it down to 40 per cent.  We cannot support it and we oppose the section.</P>

      <P>I totally reject Deputy Taylor's allegation that the Minister is engaged in some sort of manipulation of this Finance Bill.  It is rather amusing to hear Deputy Taylor complaining about the fact that large sections of this Bill are not being taken on Committee Stage. The reason we are not able to debate large chunks of this Bill on Committee Stage is because the Opposition Deputies spent almost the entire day yesterday debating section 1 and amendments to <Col N="2037" /> section 1.  Since I came into the House, eight years ago, I have complained about the procedure whereby the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill takes place.

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Taylor in a minute.  As a result of that, large chunks of the Bill go undebated. On Second Stage I asked the Minister &mdash; I have not yet had the opportunity to read his reply on Second Stage &mdash; if there was some consitutitional or legal prohibition which would prevent the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill being handed over to a special committee of the House to see whether we could deal with it in that way.  In that way we would at least get through all the sections.  Deputy Taylor's point in regard to accountants, tax advisers, etc., finding loopholes in the legislation is, of course, correct.  If we had the opportunity to debate the Bill section by section we would be able to foresee and close off some of those loopholes. This is not the first time the Committee Stage of a Finance Bill has been dealt with in this way, where we have had to pass large parts of the Bill without debate.  It happened every Finance Bill from 1983 to 1987 when Deputy Taylor's party were part of the Government.  I did not hear a peep from Deputy Taylor between 1983 and 1987.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in reducing the rate of corporation tax.  This must not be seen in isolation.  As well as reducing the rate of corporation tax the Minister is phasing out accelerated capital allowances.  That means the incentive in the corporation tax system is being moved away from the more capital intensive industries.  Of <Col N="2040" /> course, the reduction in the rate of corporation tax means that both labour intensive industries and capital intensive industries will benefit equally from the reduction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor quoted the maxim that the poor must wait.  The poor will be waiting a lot longer unless rates of taxation in business are brought down to levels which will encourage business people, entrepreneurs and investors to go out and invest, to put their money where there mouth is, to set up businesses and create jobs in Ireland.  That is what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the remarks made by Deputy Taylor on the Order of Business this morning that the time to cope with this legislation is short enough without getting an additional sheaf of amendments &mdash; some of which were further rowing back by the Minister &mdash; at 9.45 this morning.  It is pertinent to record at this stage that more and more the philosophy and measures announced by the Minister on budget day are becoming no more than bargaining counters. Apparently it is now accepted practice that what the Minister announces on budget day will not necessarily be enacted in the Finance Bill, that it is merely an invitation to the various professional lobbyists to seek changes favourable to their particular lobby group.  That is what we are looking at in terms of section 32, having spent a good deal of yesterday dealing with the personal taxation area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody remarked that one cannot talk about taxation in isolation.  It is a totality.  The State needs a certain amount of revenue if it is to operate.  If the burden of tax is to be shifted from the PAYE sector revenue must be got elsewhere.  Effectively what is being done here, in the short term, is that the rate of corporation tax is being reduced.  I draw an entirely different message from the one drawn by Deputy O'Dea.  Maybe Deputy Noonan's sensitivity to the superior culinary tastes of his colleagues meant we did not vote at 1.30 p.m. and at 4.30 p.m. on section 1 as we might have.  Nonetheless, it was necessary to <Col N="2041" /> debate section 1 in detail yesterday, because it developed into a discussion on the personal taxation area.  The message is that each section or at least each major chapter deserves that kind of detailed debate in this House.  It is extraordinary that the Minister and his officials can find time to have that kind of debate with the professional lobbyists but not with the Opposition spokespersons in this House because we do not have time.  We face the guillotine.  Deputy Taylor adverted to an area that I was interested in last night, which was the BES section 29 arrangements. I wanted to make a submission on that but again it was guillotined, as were a number of other important areas.</P>
    <P>In Britain on the very day the budget is published the Revenue officials hold a briefing on the tax implications of the budget and they are announced there and then.  This minimises the scope for the professional lobbyists to get to work to cause the Chancellor of the Exchequer to row back.  The Minister has rowed back in a number of significant areas, as was predicted, within days of the budget. Now one can have on one's desk within hours a professional assessment of the budget and comment on the areas on which the Minister is likely to relent. Needless to say, it is always in the same direction the Minister eases off.  After all our discussion yesterday about our concern for the people caught in the poverty trap and people on low pay, it is in the corporate sector that the changes are made.</P>
    <P>I am not greatly excited one way or the other by section 32 and the change from 43 per cent to 40 per cent.  I suggest the Minister's figures bear out that it is not a matter of great moment, because corporation tax in any event yields so little comparatively in this economy.</P>

Most chartered accountants would laugh at you if you said you were paying tax at 43 per cent. Not even the banks with £400 million profit in a year, which in the Irish context is a significant, handsome profit by any standards, pay it.  They avail of the various mechanisms Deputy Taylor referred to in order to minimise their tax liabilities. The section 84 clawback is a very good example of that.  Therefore, 43 per cent, 40 per cent, whatever, is not really a matter of great moment, but it shows the way things are going.</P>
      <P>For that reason I regret my own amendment, which sought to introduce something like the American ACT system, was ruled out of order.  It would have provided an alternative minimum tax irrespective of the allowances, that there would be a level at which if you were making profits you could not fail to pay tax.  That idea ought to be taken on board here.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I argued in any event for an effective tax rate of 10 per cent on the manufacturing sector and 20 per cent on the rest.  I would be quite happy if that was applied rigidly without availing of all the allowances that are there to minimise it.</P>
      <P>For the record, the amendment I sought to introduce related to section 1 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, and reads:</P>
      <P>In page 39, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Section 1 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> '(1A) Notwithstanding subsection (1) and any other provisions of the Tax Acts, the amount of corporation tax payable by a company in respect of an accounting period ending after April 5th, 1990 shall not be less than an amount equal to the alternative minimum tax amount as computed in accordance with subsection (1AA) below.</P>
    <P>(1AA) The alternative minimum amount shall be computed as a rate of 20 per cent.  On the annual profits of companies, such profits being arrived at on the basis of normal commercial accounting principles, but excluding franked investment income, provided however that in the case of companies qualifying for relief under Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 1980, as amended, the proportion of the alternative minimum tax amount referable to the profits from activities qualifying for relief shall be reduced by 50 per cent.'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that the Minister, who indicated yesterday that he is familiar with the concept, might consider &mdash; I know very well he is not going to do it in this Bill &mdash; the notion of an alternative minimum tax.  As Deputy Taylor said, and Deputy O'Dea knows more about the detail of this than most of us, the minimum contribution made by the corporate sector is scandalous.  We are wasting our breath here when we talk about equity in the tax code unless we raise tax revenue from other sources.  The corporate sector is one such area, and we are not going in the right direction.  Every accountant worth his salt knows that the number of mechanisms to minimise the tax levied are such that any company paying tax at 43 per cent need their heads examined.  Indeed, any company stupid enough to do that would not be making a profit in the first place.</P>

There is no appreciation or acknowledgment of that.  We have had the old ritual of turning on statements like I should not do this or I should not do that or that the notice given to the House is short.  I would not attempt for one moment to say that the way the business of the House is conducted is perfect, or anything like it; it certainly is not, but to cry crocodile tears about this is another matter.  I was on the Opposition benches for four years as spokesman on Finance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked how much we rowed back from the corporation taxpayers.  From that comment it is obvious he has not studied the Bill.  The following sections will result in increased corporation tax &mdash; sections 27, 28, 29, 33, 64 and 67.  I give that information to the Deputy for his guidance. The Deputy suggested that I was reducing corporation tax but I suggest he should look at the range of sections where it is being increased.  He suggested that I should look at the minimum corporate tax that applies in the United States.  I should like to tell him the reason minimum corporate tax exists in the United States is that companies were taking advantage of measures like accelerated capital allowances, section 84s, group reliefs and so on to reduce their corporate tax.</P>
      <P>I told the House yesterday that I was going at this in the reverse order.  Accelerated capital allowance is being phased out from 100 per cent to zero and section 84s are being dealt with.  Group relief restrictions are being dealt with and there are many of them in the Bill.  When one eliminates all the areas for reducing the corporation tax rate one automatically has an effective corporation tax rate.  We do not need a minimum corporation tax rate; we do one or the other.  The Deputy is advocating that I should go about this in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a change in the definition of &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;.  I am amazed that some Members hold the view that that will not bring in additional corporate tax.  I am surprised at all the lobbying, the letters and the amendments that have been suggested in regard to that issue.  The yield from corporate tax will increase, the yield from the banks will increase because accelerated allowances are being brought down and eliminated and group relief is being restricted.  We will not get a yield from those measures overnight.  Deputies Taylor and Rabbitte are advocating that <Col N="2051" /> I should change the rules of the game overnight but I am not prepared to do that for the obvious reason that it would have a detrimental effect on investment. Without investment we will not get jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that I introduced alterations since budget day.  I did and I do not make any apology for doing so and I shall give the reasons later.  However, I should point out that if those changes were not made there would have been a serious impact on jobs and investment.  If we are interested in jobs we will have to play by the rules of the game.  We should not make cheap, political capital out of matters like this.  I do not do anything under pressure; I do it for a good reason and I can defend my actions.  The reduction in the standard rate of tax to 40 per cent will be beneficial because in future jobs will come from the service industry, which includes a wide range of projects. This is part of a package that takes away accelerated capital allowances and gets rid of section 84 loans reliefs.  Part of that increased yield will be used to reduce corporate tax in an area in which jobs will be provided in future and will be partly applied to the reduction of personal tax.  That is the philosophy behind the measure and I do not understand why people cannot see it.</P>
      <P>The ending of export sales relief on 1 April this year is a further mechanism to increase the yield from corporate tax in line with international and European trends.  This will, as I said, benefit the service industry in which in future jobs will be provided.  Most people would go along with the philosophy, thinking and policy behind it.  I have dealt with all the matters which have been raised.</P>

      <P>At the same time, the Minister made the suggestion that I had not properly studied the effects or implications of the Finance Bill.  I spent many long hours researching and preparing a fairly substantial number of amendments to a very complex area of the law &mdash; finance and tax legislation &mdash; which I had to do without any Civil Service back-up. It is slightly irritating, to say the least, to find that researched and carefully thought out amendments &mdash; many of them intended to be helpful and to improve the legislation &mdash; are not even discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate now to discuss the new block of amendments.  Some Members have been debating them but I will make certain submissions when we come to them as to whether they are properly before the House.  Let us look at corporation tax and its relationship to section 84 loans.  We are not abolishing capital allowances, let us not get carried away in this regard.  Capital allowances will still be there and corporations will still be getting their full write-offs.  I know that the tax will not be accelerated, it will be spread over a period of three, five or seven years depending on the circumstances, but they will still get the full allowances.  This is not a major giveaway; to hear some of the talk in the House one would think capital allowances were being abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy Taylor think that they should be abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are doing &mdash; and it is welcome as far as it goes &mdash; is abolishing the accelerated element and ensuring that the capital value of the investment of these items will be written off over a number of years.  However, they will still get the full value and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of section 84 loans is being reduced somewhat although the reduction is not as great as we were led <Col N="2053" /> to believe in the budget.  It is welcome but the section 84 loan concept was a scam in the first place.  It was an unacceptable tax avoidance device and that is why the Minister is getting rid of it on a gradual basis.  We recognise that it should not have been there in the first place and that is why we are getting rid of it, not because it is a major imposition on the corporate sector.  They have made millions out of it over the years while people have been struggling on PAYE and social welfare payments.  We are just making a start at getting rid of something which should not have been there in the first place.  I am not detracting from the Minister's actions but, relatively speaking, the tax take from the corporate sector, even at 43 per cent, is still unsatisfactory. There certainly is no basis for reducing it to 40 per cent; if that was the case corporations and companies would be laughing their heads off and their profits would escalate.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by all this talk about jobs.  As the Minister said yesterday, if the money and the profits are there companies should pay the relevant tax.  If companies see that there is business to be done and money to be made the tax rate will not deter them.  If they see that they can make £1 million on a certain project they will certainly not step back from it because of the tax rate.  The corporations have done very well in this country compared to the PAYE sector who carried the can all along.  This is a regressive measure although I support what the Minister is doing in relation to section 84 loans.  I also support the reduction of accelerated capital allowances. However, this section dealing with the reduction from 43 per cent to 40 per cent is not acceptable and we oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Deputy Taylor intended to shift his ground but he did not.  As somebody who, like Deputy Taylor, also studied the legislation without the benefit of advisers, I share his sense of frustration that certain sections have not been dealt with.  This is not the first occasion that that has happened; it happened every year since I became a <Col N="2054" /> Deputy and I am sure it happened before that.  The Minister's reference to accelerated capital allowances in section 84 arises from the fact that there is a clear indication in Deputy Taylor's initial remarks &mdash; and what he said just now &mdash; that the Bill represents a bonanza for the corporate sector.  Clearly, that is not the case.  The Minister made the point &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that the yield from the corporate sector will be significantly increased as a result of the provisions in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand Deputy Taylor's reference to capital allowances.  We should not imagine it is some sort of big deal to abolish accelerated capital allowances.  The abolition of accelerated capital allowances means that, in each year, the write-off will be less because the asset will be written off over a longer period.  I thought I detected an implication in Deputy Taylor's statement that the Minister should have gone further and abolished capital allowances altogether.</P>

      <P>Of course, that is a farcical argument.  I am glad that Deputy Taylor did not mean to imply that because one can tax people only on their profit.  People have to purchase capital equipment to put into their businesses to earn profits in the first place.  If one lengthens the period over which one can write off that investment one increases the yield from the corporate sector; that is simple arithmetic.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor that the provisions of section 84 were used as a tax avoidance device.  Because the loophole is being closed by the Minister the yield from the corporate tax sector will increase.  What the Minister is doing &mdash; and I agree with his strategy &mdash; is shifting the incentive element within the corporation tax system away from more capital-intensive industry to labour-intensive industry where we want to create jobs and encourage investment.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on closing the loophole on the manufacturing side.  This has been a scam of scandalous proportions.

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that and will not detain the House.  The abolition of accelerated capital allowances is a move in the right direction.  As Deputy O'Dea said, hopefully it will result in more labour-intensive, less capital-intensive industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the section 84 relief abolished.  I had an amendment tabled to that effect which was disallowed. However, I oppose the reduction in corporation profits tax from 43 per cent to <Col N="2056" /> 40 per cent.  I contend there is no need to do so.</P>

Deputy Taylor has already drawn the distinction between the accelerated element in the capital allowances remaining. The accelerated capital allowances themselves are not abolished in respect of urban renewal areas, the Custom House Docks site, the Shannon Free Airport development, or whatever; they remain in respect of those sites; is that not correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I submit, in all seriousness, that amendment No. 73a and all the other amendments on this green sheet headed Additional Amendments are out of order because the time for filing amendments to the Finance Bill closed on Monday night; I was in the Bill's Office with an additional amendment at about 9 o'clock on Monday night and they refused to accept it saying it was too late and that the time for amendments to the Finance Bill had passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This additional list of very complex amendments was presented to us only this morning thereby making it impossible for any Opposition spokespersons to have an opportunity to examine them and give a considered response to them.  The <Col N="2059" /> timing was wrong.  My additional amendment on Monday night was ruled out of order, and that was a relatively simple and straightforward additional amendment. Here is a number of major complex amendments &mdash; nine or ten pages &mdash; which were submitted to us at 9.30 this morning.  This is untenable; it is out of order; it is no way for the House to run its business.  I object to it in the strongest possible terms and I am asking you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to rule them out of order on that basis.  If the Minister wishes to resubmit them on Report Stage he could certainly do so.  At least between now and Report Stage we would have a opportunity to make some realistic approach to these very complex and substantial amendments.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor appreciates that we have Standing Orders and we have precedent, and I will give him first the benefit of what is in Standing Order No. 95:</P>
      <P>When a Bill is to be considered in Committee, proposed amendments shall be notified in due time, and shall be arranged in proper order: Provided, nevertheless, that, in the discretion of the Chair, amendments may be moved without notice. </P>
      <P>What Deputy Mervyn Taylor complains of has been established by precedent over the years and I would ask him to accept without question that what appears on the Order Paper now in the form of amendments, is in order.</P>

Is it one rule for the Minister's amendments and a different rule for anybody else's amendment?</P>

If you communicate with the officials of the Bill's Office I have no doubt they will confirm that.  I have to ask you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as the protector of Members here to ensure that our rights are sustained.  How can it possibly be that an Opposition spokesperson on Finance can present an amendment at 9 o'clock on Monday and be told that it was too late but at 9.30 a.m. on Thursday it is not too late.  It cannot be right.  It does not add up.  It does not make sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 73a:</P>
      <P>In page 39, before section 33, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33.&mdash;Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1989, is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (3) (a) of `6th day of April, 1991,' for `6th day of April, 1990,'.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is purely a technical amendment.</P>
      <P>The 1988 and 1989 Finance Acts introduced major changes in the basis for calculating tax credits in respect of dividends paid by companies within the 10 per cent scheme of corporation tax.  The basis attributes a mix of normal and reduced credits to dividends paid by companies within the 10 per cent scheme.  The mix of credits is calculated in proportion to the mix of 10 per cent and standard rate income of the company paying the dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial part of the new 1988 and 1989 provision is devoted to specifying the accounting period for which a dividend will be treated as made.  In general, the new basis treats interim dividends as paid out of the profits of periods preceding their date of payment.  This is <Col N="2062" /> necessary for the purposes of accurate calculation of the tax credits.</P>
    <P>However, some difficulties have arisen in relation to the treatment of interim dividends, under the new basis, particularly in relation to international financial services companies which are continually paying such dividends in the normal course of foreign funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, extending a transitional measure introduced by section 25 of last year's Finance Act for a further year to allow further time to review the appropriate treatment of interim dividends. Accordingly interim dividends paid on or before 6 April 1991, may be treated as paid out of the profits of the period in which they were paid if the paying company so elects.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <Col N="2063" />&ldquo;exploring for scheduled minerals&rdquo; means searching in the State for deposits of scheduled minerals or testing such deposits or winning access thereto, and includes the systematic searching for areas containing scheduled minerals and searching by drilling or other means for scheduled minerals within those areas but does not include operations which are operations in the course of developing or working a qualifying mine.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subject to subsections (3) to (5), for as long as a company&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  is an exploration company,</P>
    <P>(b)  does not carry on a trade of working a qualifying mine, and</P>

    <P>it shall be deemed for the purposes of sections 2, 3 (4), 6 and 7 and the other provisions of the Tax Acts, except the other provisions of this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  to be carrying on a trade of working a qualifying mine,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to come within the charge to corporation tax in respect of that trade when it first incurs the said capital expenditure, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  to incur for the purposes of that trade the said expenditure incurred on the provision of plant and machinery, </P>
    <P>so that all allowances or charges which fall to be made for an accounting period by virtue of this subsection and section 2, 6 or 7 shall be given effect by treating the amount of any allowance as a trading expense of that trade in the period and by treating the amount on which any such charge is to be made as a <Col N="2064" /> trading receipt of that trade in the period.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where, by virtue of subsection (2), a company is to be treated as incurring a loss in a trade in an accounting period, the company&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b)  subject to subsection (4) (b) (ii), shall not otherwise be entitled to relief in respect of the loss or to surrender relief under subsection (1) of section 116 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, in respect of the loss. </P>
    <P>(4) (a) Any asset representing exploration expenditure, in respect of which an allowance or deduction has been made, by virtue of subsection (2) and section 2, to a company shall, for the purposes of section 245 (11) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be treated as an asset representing capital expenditure incurred in connection with the mine which the company is deemed to be working by virtue of subsection (2), and the company shall not cease to be deemed to be carrying on the trade of working that mine, so as to be within the charge to corporation tax in respect of that trade, before any sale of such an asset in the event of such a sale.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where a company begins at any time (in this paragraph referred to as the relevant time) to carry on a trade of working a qualifying mine and, accordingly, ceases to be deemed to carry on such a trade, it shall be treated as carrying on the <Col N="2065" /> same trade before and after that time for the purposes of&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  any allowance, charge or trade receipt treated as arising by reference to any capital expenditure incurred before the relevant time, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  relief, other than by virtue of subsection (3), under section 16 (1), of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, for any losses arising before the relevant time, in so far as relief has not already been given for those losses by virtue of this section: </P>
    <P>Provided that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply where there is a change in the ownership of the company within a period of&mdash;</P>
    <P> (I)  twelve months ending at the relevant time, or</P>
    <P>(II)  twenty-four months beginning at the relevant time. </P>
    <P>(c)  The provisions of the Fifth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1973, other than paragraphs 8 and 10 of Part I thereof, shall have effect for the purposes of supplementing this subsection as if the references therein to section 39 of that Act were references to this subsection. </P>
    <P>(5) (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Tax Acts, if an allowance or deduction has been given by virtue of this section in respect of any expenditure, then no other allowance or deduction shall be given by virtue of any provision of the Tax Acts, including this section, in respect of that expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b)  Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 35 of the Finance Act, 1986, shall apply to a company for as long as it is deemed by virtue of subsection (2) to be carrying on a trade of working a qualifying mine, as if &ldquo;who is not a company within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the payment&rdquo; were deleted from that paragraph.', <Col N="2066" /> and the said subsection (2) of section 3 and subsection (1) of section 4 (other than the proviso), as so amended, are set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person who commences to carry on a trade of working a qualifying mine after the 6th day of April, 1974, incurred exploration expenditure on or after the 6th day of April, 1967, and that expenditure was not incurred in connection with the said qualifying mine, then in taxing the said trade for the chargeable period in which he commenced to carry on the said trade, there shall be made an allowance of an amount equal to the amount of that expenditure.</P>
    <P>(1)  Where exploration expenditure, in respect of which an allowance may be claimed by virtue of section 2 or 3, or section 2 as applied by section 7A, is or has been incurred by a body corporate (hereinafter in this section referred to as the exploration company) and&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  another body corporate is, or is deemed to be, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the exploration company, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the exploration company is, or is deemed to be, a wholly-owned subsidiary of another body corporate,</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>the expenditure or so much of it as the exploration company specifies&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  in the case referred to in paragraph (a) may, at the election of the exploration company, be deemed to have been incurred by such other body corporate (being a body corporate which is, or is deemed to be, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the exploration company) as the exploration company specifies,</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the case referred to in paragraph (b) may, at the election of the exploration company, be deemed to <Col N="2067" /> have been incurred by the body corporate (hereinafter referred to as the parent body) of which the exploration company was, at the time the expenditure was incurred, a wholly-owned subsidiary or by such other body corporate (being a body corporate which is, or is deemed to be, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent body) as the exploration company specifies, </P>
    <P>and in a case where the said expenditure was incurred on a date prior to the incorporation of the body corporate so specified, the provisions of this Act shall apply, in relation to the granting of any allowance in respect of such expenditure, as if the said body corporate had been in existence at the time the expenditure was incurred and had incurred the expenditure at that time:&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This amendment gives effect to the Government decision to encourage exploration activity by: (1) rendering exploration expenditure of prospecting companies deductible from any income or gains of such companies; and (2) abolishing the ten-year time limit on set-off of abortive exploration expenditure.  No repayment of DIRT will be made to exploration companies.  To qualify for relief the business of a company will have to consist primarily of exploring for scheduled minerals in the State.</P>
    <P>The minerals exploration industry is in a healthy condition at present &mdash; a number of prospects with possible development potential have recently been identified.</P>
    <P>A welcome feature of this upsurge in activity has been the appearance of a number of small new Irish exploration companies.  These have helped boost the native side of the industry by providing work for Irish geologists and those Irish laboratories and drilling companies which service the industry.  The mining industry currently gives direct employment to about 1,500 people, and this rises to about 3,000 if indirect employment is taken into account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2068" /> Under existing law because exploration companies are not carrying on a trade for tax purposes, they get no relief for exploration expenditure against income arising on the investment of the funds financing their exploration. Exploration companies are essentially involved in expenditure and it is inappropriate to consider the income of such companies in isolation.  This amendment will allow the set-off for tax purposes of the exploration expenditure of such companies against their income.</P>
    <P>It also abolishes the ten-year time limit on set-off of abortive expenditure. Whether or not exploration expenditure yields a viable mineral deposit, it is a real expense of such companies and should not be eventually ignored if exploration companies are prepared to take a long view and persist in their exploration.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these changes are justified.  I am confident that they will reinforce current interest in exploration leading to increased employment in that activity and ultimately further employment and revenue from the development and working of new ore bodies.</P>
    <P>The new section deals with the treatment for tax purposes of exploration expenditure: it is accordingly made applicable in respect of expenditure incurred on or after 1 April 1990.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (a) and (b) delete ten-year time limits on set-off of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.</P>
    <P>I will go through the paragraphs if Deputies so require.</P>

Deputy Taylor and I know from our membership of the Public Accounts <Col N="2071" /> Committee that, in a case where there were major lead and zinc ore finds in this country, the companies proved very adroit at writing off their expenses to the extent that they virtually made no return to the Exchequer over a period of 17 or 18 years.</P>

      <P>to the 31st day of December, 2000;.&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already explained at length in the course of Second Stage the approach which has been adopted in narrowing the definition of manufacturing in this section. I have assured the House that the vast bulk of activities which now qualify for the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing <Col N="2074" /> will not be affected.  Action had to be taken, however, to confine the 10 per cent rate to the activities for which it was intended.</P>
    <P>In view of the representations and discussions which have taken place since the Bill was published, I have now decided to introduce a number of drafting amendments to the section.  These give greater clarity without undermining the objectives of the section.  The amendments I have put forward fall into four main groups: Firstly, I am amending the section so as to extend the 10 per cent rate to data-processing and software development projects which are grant assisted by SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta. This removes an anomaly <i>vis-à-vis</i> similar IDA grant-assisted companies who already have the 10 per cent rate.  I note that Deputy Noonan had also put down an amendment to this effect; secondly, there are a number of activities which are specifically mentioned in the section as qualifying for the 10 per cent rate.  They have, in fact, always had that rate.  The listing is done for technical drafting reasons so as to avoid any doubt about their status in the new situation and does not prejudice the position of the generality of manufacturing activities which may qualify for the 10 per cent rate.  I am extending the list so as to include fish processing, certain computer equipment activities and to clarify the coverage of film-making and of aircraft repair and maintenance, two areas which in more recent times have developed fairly extensively and are continuing to develop; thirdly, there is a group of amendments clarifying the new provisions which exclude certain activities from the 10 per cent rate.  The amendments make clear the intention that, for an activity to be excluded, it must primarily fall into one of the five excluded categories at (5) (a) (i) to (v).  The amendments also tighten up the wording of the first category dealing with products, produce and material acquired in bulk for sale or distribution, and remove the industrial buildings clause which had caused considerable uncertainities for <Col N="2075" /> certain genuine manufacturing operations and was not, in any event, a key clause in the section; fourthly, the transitional arrangements for companies which may lose the 10 per cent rate are extended to cover any section 84 loans and leasing arrangements at present enjoyed by those companies.  Finally, there is an amendment extending the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing to the year 2010 in accordance with the announcement which I made on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> These sections which the Minister is now amending have aroused a lot of interest. I received more representations on this section than on any other sections of the Bill.  Great uncertainty has been created by the Minister's budgetary announcement and subsequently by the sections of the Finance Bill which seek to confine the 10 per cent rate.  It is fairly clear that activities which would involve dividing, cutting, purifying, drying, mixing, sorting, packaging, branding, testing or applying any other similar process to any product, produce or material that is acquired in bulk to prepare the goods for sale or distribution, or any combination of such processes, are ruled out in general terms.  When it comes down to the specifics, there is great uncertainty felt by people in different activities in that they do not know whether they are included or not.</P>
      <P>The assurances given by the Minister, both in his introduction and his reply to Second Stage, do not match the layman's interpretation of the sections.  The sections are not very complex.  The meaning jumps from the page.  You do not need to be a tax expert to realise where the cuts are being made, or at least that is how it appears.  Yet the Minister's assurances would suggest that the effect is much narrower than the normal interpretation of the sections by the ordinary reader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the other difficulties is that the Minister approaches this matter in two ways.  He makes the exclusion in general <Col N="2076" /> terms but clarifies the inclusions in very specific terms.  He says this is for technical reasons but, of course, that is not the case.  We know what hinges on the maintenance of aircraft and so on. Aer Lingus have a project for Dublin Airport and Shannon Aerospace have just announced one for Shannon.  Not alone is it not technical but we can name the principals involved in these companies. When it comes to meat processing, the same applies.  This is not being included for technical reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for technical reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They qualify for the 10 per cent already.  It appears that one group of people involved in a set of activities are having their position put beyond doubt by law while another group are still in an area of doubt because the exclusions are set out in a general rather than in a specific way.  We know quite clearly that if one is involved in maintenance of aircraft or other ancillary activity, in meat processing, or in film making, especially on the creative and the non-advertising side, one will qualify for the 10 per cent. As a result of the Minister's statement, if one is involved in fish processing one will also qualify for the 10 per cent.  We know that light assembly work in the computer industry, such as repair of computers or other repair process, is specifically included within the remit of the 10 per cent, as a result of the Minister's amendment this morning, even though there was a serious doubt about any repair activity.  The general sections excluded all repair activity but now the repair of computer systems is included again.</P>
      <P>What about the whole area of processing? We will start with the breaking down of bulk.  Since the sections where the specific inclusions are made are clearly related to certain companies which we could name, we will have to go very close to naming companies.  Would the Minister consider the taking of water out of the ground and putting it into bottles as the breaking down of bulk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> Would branding and marketing of that bulk in smaller quantities be included? That seems to be a normal interpretation of the activity?  If that is so the whole bottling water business which now enjoys the 10 per cent regime will go back up to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to grain drying?  There is a fairly strong lobby from the cereal growers.  It seems to me that grain drying and similar type activities will be ruled out.  What about vegetable processing?  What happens in the case of a company that has a contract with farmers to produce peas, asparagus or cauliflower?  Obviously, at the farming end those products have to be grown, produced and saved.  When they are supplied to the factory they have to be graded and sorted, foreign bodies have to be taken out, pebbles, bits of earth etc. They have to be washed and, perhaps, frozen or dried.  Finally they are broken down from the bulk product, packaged and sold.  It appears to me that that activity is excluded for the purposes of the 10 per cent under the Minister's definitions. It is very hard to justify or to explain on grounds of equity as between sections why one particular activity is included and another excluded.</P>
    <P>What is the situation regarding milk production?  One of the court cases which expanded the definition of the 10 per cent was the Strand Dairies case.  The finding was that pasteurising and bottling milk would be a 10 per cent activity.  I understand from the definitions now that the pasteurising and the bottling of milk is excluded and will be rated at 40 per cent on profits in the future.  On the other hand it is also correct to say that the co-ops are free from tax.  Will we now have a situation where a company which is instituted as a plc &mdash; again we can name names &mdash; Food Industries or Kerry, Kerry; if they are a plc they are excluded, if they are a co-op, notionally they will not receive the 10 per cent any longer, they will get the 40 per cent rate, but since they do not pay tax in any event it is irrelevant.  What will happen to the people supplying the liquid milk market in Dublin?  Will it now be the case that if a <Col N="2078" /> dairy delivering milk to the supermarkets and shops in Dublin is organised as a plc they will have to pay 40 per cent tax, but that if they are organised as a co-op they will have to pay no tax?  There is no clarity on the scope of these sections.  I could not say where the line will ultimately be drawn.  There seems to be no good reason for one particular activity being included and another excluded.</P>
    <P>The processing of fish was included this morning as a 10 per cent activity.  Meat is also a 10 per cent activity.  What happens if one processes peas or beans or if one is involved in any other kind of food process?  Where will the line be drawn?</P>
    <P>Regarding sand and gravel what will happen to the fellow we know in every parish in the country who extracts gravel and turns it into readymix concrete or concrete blocks?  Will he be involved in a 10 per cent activity from now on, or is he simply breaking down bulk into more saleable commodities?  Is adding water and cement in that context regarded as a manufacturing process?</P>
    <P>In relation to the sawmilling industry, if one brings trees from the wood in trunk form, runs them through a circular saw and sells the wood in rough planks or in more refined planks this is only breaking down bulk, but breaking down bulk and putting it into more marketable commodities is now excluded.  I am extremely unhappy about this section, not with the intent of the Minister.  We know the background, that this was brought in as an incentive to manufacturing industry.  We know it was extended by court decisions and by decisions of the Revenue Commissioners based on previous decisions of the courts.  It has gone further than the policy intent of the Government who introduced it in the first place or the policy intent of subsequent Governments. It creates a major problem now. My difficulty is not with the principle of what the Minister is doing but with the practical effect of what he is doing.  I could not, with any degree of confidence, tell a business acquaintance in all that area of breaking down of bulk and food processing whether he is included or excluded.</P>

Since you can only qualify for the Business Expansion Scheme if you are a 10 per cent company and since it is no longer a Business Expansion Scheme company does the 10 per cent fall as well?  I note that the Minister has excluded section 84 loans this morning. I welcome that amendment.  I was contacted by somebody in food processing. <Col N="2080" /> They told me that their tax advice was that they would be clearly excluded even though they are in the business of contracting to farmers and going through the whole sequence of the preservation and marketing of vegetables. Their biggest problem was that they were financing through section 84 loans. The loss of the section 84 loan would mean an additional £400,000 to their bank charges as a result of their no longer being defined as 10 per cent companies.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Barry who has been involved in the tea blending business for a long time assured me that tea blending was always considered to be a 10 per cent activity and that the benefit of the 10 per cent manufacturing relief did not derive from either <Col N="2081" /> court cases or interpretations by the Revenue Commissioners based on court cases.</P>
      <P>What about the blending of whiskey? There is a theory coming from primary school geography books that distillers get tonnes of barely, that they are involved from the primary production of alcohol to the production of the bottle of Bush-mills or Paddy or Powers.  Most of the time they are buying in bulk alcohol. They are not producing alcohol.  Effectively what they are doing is blending. Will all the activities of Irish Distillers be ruled out?  There is no clarity about this.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very specific when he is putting beyond doubt what is to be included and that is fair enough but, in the exclusions, he makes no attempt to define &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;.  His advice from the Revenue Commissioners and his officials was to avoid that like the plague&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;because any definition of &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo; would provide a bonanza for the legal profession who would drive a coach and four through it.  Whatever else he does he should not do that.  Then the Minister had a problem.  He had to exclude areas of activity by general statement. It is very difficult to do that.  I have dealt with the bulk ones but the other exclusions to which I have referred are methods of preservation, pasteurisation, maturation, similar treatment of foodstuffs, etc.  The Minister assured the House on Second Stage that there would be no problem with most of the activity in the food processing industry.  That is at total variance with any ordinary person's interpretation of the exclusion section.  It seems to me that every food processing activity involves preservation, pasteurisation, maturation or some combination of the three, and I cannot square the Minister's assurance that there is no problem with the normal interpretation of the Bill.  I accept the provision regarding cooking, baking, preparing food or <Col N="2082" /> drink for human consumption which is intended to be consumed at or about the time it is prepared whether in the building in which it is prepared or to which it is delivered after being prepared.  It was a frightful scandal that certain fast food units in this city and elsewhere had the kitchen set up as a separate company and the place where the burgers were sold was set up as a different company, with one company selling to the other &mdash; and we know the relative cost structure underpinning that.  All the profit would derive in the kitchen and they got manufacturing relief at 10 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have no problem with that, but what about the generality of fast food places?  Will they go straight onto the 40 per cent?  There are other activities.  Consider the small pork butcher who is selling over the counter but, at the same time, making sausages and pudding at the back; his activity at the back qualifies for the 10 per cent.  This is quite legitimate.  He is selling them over the counter but he is selling them also to other outlets.  He is caught now by this provision.  A great many people are going to be very surprised. The big players will know about this immediately because they can afford to pay for the best advice, but some of the small players will get a very rude awakening when it comes to assessment time.  &ldquo;Improving or altering any articles or materials without imposing on them a change in their character&rdquo; is very general and is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have introduced a couple of amendments seeking to confine further in general terms and to provide that if more than one product is involved in the process it comes within the 10 per cent regime and if there is a clear change of form it should be within the 10 per cent also.  At the moment this is very unclear. The only way I can deal with the questions I am being asked is to ask the Minister whether the sand and gravel and concrete block business is included.  Is <Col N="2083" /> sawmilling included?  Is general food processing and packaging in or out?  What about the plcs and co-operatives?  This is a difficult area.  I am glad the Minister has taken out the definition of &ldquo;factory&rdquo;. I understand from his amendments that he is no longer insisting that these activities should take place in a factory building. Did he say that in his amendments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That would have created enormous difficulties. There was a court case taken by various people to get themselves excluded from rates.  For example, some companies were involved in large silos and, according to the court, they were no longer defined as &ldquo;plant&rdquo; and therefore they got rates exclusion.  There was a kick back on the other side because if they were not &ldquo;plant&rdquo; they were not in the factory building, and if the manufacturing process was in the open air, in silos or whatever, they were excluded.</P>
      <P>I did not catch the full implications of the amendment referred to this morning about the factory building.  Will the Minister clarify the provision regarding manufacturing activity in the open air? Certain activities such as the sand and gravel business, concrete block business and so on, are usually done in the open air.  Secondly, where the process would be in a silo or tank, how would that work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has excited a certain amount of interest and there is a great deal of talk about it.  I am sure the Minister has received the kind of submissions that I have and has been referred to cases.  I understand that in 1951 the High Court in Northern Ireland &mdash; in the case of McDermot and Porter &mdash; held that certain activities in vegetable processing were manufacturing.  The judge said that the company's process of sieving, rotating, hopping, fanning and cylindering rye grass seed which resulted in the removal of certain substances such as stones, straw, oats and other impurities, represented a major change in the nature of the product.  Furthermore, he indicated <Col N="2084" /> that the product after it had gone through these processes was a marketable product which prior to that it was not.  The people I am talking about in the food processing industry who have been in communication with me have been involved in similar activities, such as taking out small pebbles and bits of earth, cleaning and preserving either by dehydration or by freezing, packaging, banding and selling, and seem to be excluded.</P>
    <P>If we carry this definition of &ldquo;manufacturing industry&rdquo; to its ultimate we are going to allow only primary manufacturing processes to be caught within the definition.  At this stage of development of our economy, further down the line where there is more added value, the emphasis should be on industrial policy. It seems a retrograde step to put back the bulk of the incentives and to target primary manufacturing activities as the area which will benefit from the 10 per cent rather than the down the line added value activities.  There is more added value in blending whiskey than in producing raw alcohol.  There is much more added value in blending tea than simply importing tea and selling it.  There is much more added value in selling planks out of a sawmill than selling trees out of a wood.  A peculiar industrial philosophy seems to be coming forward here, as if we were a far greater economy and should be back in primary manufacturing processes and selling to those economies that would finish the product.  It seems totally out of line with what the Department of Industry and Commerce and a series of Ministers have been saying and what the IDA have been advocating.</P>
    <P>The repair of computers is excluded by the Minister's amendment and those involved in that activity will enjoy the 10 per cent.  What about a very highly skilled area in manufacturing industry?  I presume most Deputies are aware that toolmaking is one of the key activities in manufacturing industry, and it is difficult to get tool makers; there is probably a shortage of them.  The repair of tools in the general sense was always considered to be within the 10 per cent but is now <Col N="2085" /> excluded.  Therefore, taking-down the assembly line in a plant, taking it to another location and repairing and refurbishing it, is excluded now.  If one goes to the office, takes out the computer and repairs it, that is included.  There does not appear to be any great logic in that. What about the repair and refurbishment of furniture?  What about the restoration of antique furniture?  They seem to be excluded.</P>
    <P>The Strand Dairy case brought in pasteurised milk, and that was not the intention of the policy-makers of the day or subsequently.  Another case brought in the ripening of bananas.  The test in the Supreme Court went far beyond the intention of the policy-makers in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Revenue Commissioners then had to take into account the court decisions and they brought in the grading of coal, the drying of grain and so on.  However, the matter is very unclear.  The Minister also proposes to extend manufacturing relief to the year 2010.  We have had an argument about why the amendment was not produced sooner but a number of other serious issues arise in regard to that amendment.</P>
      <P>My first question relates to the way the decision was made.  We are talking about a major decision on how industrial policy is developed here.  We are looking at something that will only trigger in in the year 2000 and which will run until 2010. We are establishing the taxation base which will operate for manufacturing industry, as newly defined by the Minister, in the next century.  That is serious and it seems to me, with the elimination of section 84s, accelerated depreciation and the movement away from aiding plant and machinery to getting involved in employment grants and so on, that the main thrust and incentive of industrial policy is moving away from being grant-based and grant-related to being tax-based and tax-related in general terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget day the Minister did not <Col N="2086" /> mention this although he spoke for almost two hours.  The Finance Bill when published did not contain any mention of it but the press statement that accompanied the Finance Bill referred to it.  When the list of amendments to the Finance Bill were produced there was no sign of it in the bulk of them but it emerged in the amendments we received this morning.</P>
    <P>If this was a considered decision I cannot understand why it did not arise in the talks leading to the budget and why is was brought in at the back end of the decision making process.  Obviously, it was decided in Government at the time when the draft Finance Bill was circulated by the Minister.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is obliged under our industrial policy to carry out three yearly reviews of that policy.  We are in the third year and the Department of Industry and Commerce should be in a position to produce their review some time before the summer.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept that.  I do not see the need for the rush to introduce this amendment.  If the review by the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicates that there will be a change in attitude, and if that change in attitude makes it necessary to extend the 10 per cent regime, that would be the time to introduce the change.  When the report is published a commitment could be given to make the change and it could be introduced in next year's budget. There are all the signs of a dirty hurry about this.  It does not reflect very well on our decision making process when a major plank of industrial policy is brought before the Oireachtas in this fashion.  I wonder if the Minister has obtained permission from the EC Commission to extend the 10 per cent regime beyond the year 2000.  I presume he does not need it for manufacturing industry as duly defined but I understand that he will need it for the service industries.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Therefore, the other matter is left in the air. Yesterday, we had a good debate on different themes of taxation.  They were hanging on the first amendment to the Bill but, effectively, we debated personal taxation fully.  The Minister made a major contribution to that debate and provided a lot of new information, particularly about the difficulties of introducing tax credits and so on.  However, a number of Deputies, including myself, pointed out that finally this all came down to choices.  If we want to take low paid workers out of the tax net we must ask <Col N="2088" /> ourselves where we will get the money to do so.  If we want to give extra benefit to farmers we must ask ourselves where will we get the money.  If we want to bring down corporate taxation, and that means a loss to the Exchequer, where will we get the money?  Where will we get the money to transfer wealth either between one set of taxpayers and another or from those who are well off to those who are poor?  Where do we get the resources to keep the State running?  Where will we get the money for our health boards, the education system and so on that cost so much?</P>
      <P>We are all tricking around the margins of where we will get the money but, the corporate side pay little enough if one is to go on the evidence produced by the Minister and the speeches of Members yesterday.  The statistics produced by the Department of Finance indicate that 88.5 per cent of everything is paid for by the PAYE sector.  Now, in an unconsidered way outside the context of the budget, and the publication of the Finance Bill, a huge area of potential revenue is preempted right up to the first decade of the next century with not so much as a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>The amendment was produced last night and manufacturing industry, as redefined by the Minister in the Bill, will pay tax at a maximum of 10 per cent until 2010.  That will be on the Statute Book and, more than that, every contract signed by the agencies, such as the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás, from now on will include that condition.  There will be a contractual position between the State, the IDA as its agent, and any concern setting up a plant in the country between now and 2010.  All Members, and those elected in the next six or seven elections, will have one source of possible revenue excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That maybe the right thing to do.  The 10 per cent policy worked fairly well at the end of the seventies and into the eighties.  There is a fair level of interest in the pipeline and it is a good idea to have tax-driven industrial policy rather than grant-driven industrial policy. However, I object to the casual manner <Col N="2089" /> in which such an important decision was made.  We have had a few moments this morning to debate a package which, once it leaves the House, will run quickly into a myriad of contractual arrangements between investors and the agencies.  It will be out of our hands.</P>
    <P>There has been another example of making choices when we should ask where the priority should lie.  A group has been appointed to look into the reform of local government but the one thing they cannot do is consider how we should finance local authorities.  There has been a lot of talk about making choices but how can one make choices if the areas that could finance the choices are precluded, in this case, precluded for the next 20 years?</P>

I should like the Minister to address the specific question of exemptions because the Bill will shortly be guillotined and we will not be any the wiser.  Constituents will telephone Members asking if their food plant or other industry will attract a rate of 10 per cent or 40 per cent and they will have to tell them that the Minister said they will be all right but that, as the Bill has been passed, only the Revenue Commissioners can decide.  We should have an enabling section which would <Col N="2090" /> permit the Revenue Commissioners to make up their minds on a case-by-case basis because it would be as precise as what is before us at present.

This whole hotchpotch in the 10 per cent area will be a free-for-all in litigation and I hazard a guess that the volume of litigation on this issue up to now will be nothing compared to what it will be in future.  Constitutional questions will arise as to why one facility is included while another, with basic similarities, is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the 10 per cent.  I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Noonan said, but I am doubtful about his remark that the 10 per cent tax has done wonders.  Has it?  Our employment record over the years has not been very good and it is not good at present. Unemployment is at an incredibly high rate and the same applies to emigration. Neither of those phenomena is new: going back to the foundation of the State our unemployment rate has been appallingly high.  After all the 10 per cent manipulation, all the inducements and the employment it is supposed to provide, Ireland is at the top of the unemployment league in the EC.  Where is the great success?  What has it done for us?  It is not providing employment for our young people, they have to go abroad.  After all the mollycoddling of private industry over the decades our young people are still going abroad in massive numbers to find employment.  I mentioned that we were at the top of the unemployment league in the EC and that also applies to OECD countries.  Where is the employment bonanza that all this was supposed to have produced?  It may have produced <Col N="2091" /> a bonanza for many of the firms who operate it but, as a policy, it has been an abject failure.  The unemployment figures over the years speak for themselves.  The 10 per cent was not a panacea in regard to unemployment.  I wonder why certain select industries are put in the special position of having their profits reduced to the artificially low rate of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the course of a debate on a different section the Minister said &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that the basic principle of taxation is that when you make profits you pay tax on them and if you do not make profits you do not pay tax.  The Minister has gone out of his way, for what he calls a technical reason &mdash; about which I am puzzled &mdash; to write into the Bill confirmation that the meat processing industry &mdash; and we know, as Deputy Noonan said, to whom this refers &mdash; have the benefit of a 10 per cent rate.  This is an industry that makes millions in profits each year and I fail to understand the rationale behind taxing profits of that kind at only 10 per cent instead of the normal rate of 40 per cent as it is now, or 43 per cent as it was until recently. What is the thinking behind that?  It may be necessary to bring in regulations to control the meat industry, but to say that such a lucrative industry should have the bonanza of a 10 per cent tax rate, in contrast to other service industries, is puzzling.</P>
    <P>The whole area of the tax regime is lobby-ridden.  The lobbyists exercise a greater pull, push and input to what eventually emerges in the Finance Bill than we do.  As backbenchers in Opposition we are lobbied and the mind boggles at the level of lobbying to which Ministers and Government backbenchers are subjected to secure benefits.</P>
    <P>Has the 10 per cent had its day?  Should the whole matter be re-examined?  There must be a better way because the system up to now has failed.  There is no point in saying we have had good results, because the whole thing has been an abject failure looked at in terms of employment provided for our people in industry and in terms of those who have had to emigrate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2092" /> Do not let anybody say that things are going well and that if they are not they will be better next year.  There is no point in spending our time just talking about it.  The reality is that it has been a failure. We ought face that fact and accept it.  If that is the principle on which we have been operating all these years is it not time for us to sit up with a jerk and say: &ldquo;We have to think up something new here.  There must be some other way&rdquo;. What is so special about this country that we have to top the league of unemployment within the OECD countries? Is there some strange facet about our characters that we must have the dubious honour and privilege of being at the top of that league?  I do not think so.  The policies we have been operating just have not worked.  Private industry here has let us down over the decades notwithstanding the grants and tax concessions &mdash; be they grant-led or tax-induced, as Deputy Noonan put it.  They have had all of those concessions in a generous mixture.  Yet the end result for us has been an abject failure.  It is time to examine it; there must be some other way of doing it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan so far as latching onto the year 2010 is concerned. That should not be done because it is pre-empting new circumstances that may arise over the next few years.  The Minister should have a rethink about that because that would be a grave mistake. It may result in commitments and responsibilities which future Governments may well wish were not there. They may look back with some degree of surprise, perhaps anger, at what was done in 1990 when they find themselves locked into circumstances when new ones arise which would render these concessions totally unacceptable.  We are very happy about this position so far as these provisions are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  I shall not detain the House very long because I subscribe to a great deal of what has been said by Deputies Noonan and Taylor.</P>
      <P>The point is that, if we agree there is a need to examine the whole question of tax reform, then there are a limited number of areas only in which one can raise additional tax.  If one is going to shift the burden of tax from one set of taxpayers to another then the area we can explore is limited.  I suggest that one of them is the corporate area.  I might refer the Minister to his remarks on budget day when he drew our attention to the fact that the total yield from corporation profits tax for 1989 was £303 million, or 4 per cent of the total tax yield.  He went on to make the qualitative judgment, with which I agree, saying:</P>
      <P>This yield is still very low by international standards.  It is not necessary to go back over the debate on that; that statement stands as a matter of fact, that the yield from corporation profits tax in this country is low by comparison with any of our counterparts within the OECD group or whatever. </P>
      <P>When the Minister then moves to effect some changes, as he does here, hopefully not only will that put an end to some of the outrageous scams that have been taking place but will raise some additional taxation.  Then those of us who have been calling for that find ourselves in circumstances in which we must be disposed to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan said, it is very difficult &mdash; I do not want to retrace the ground on this because he dealt with it in some considerable detail &mdash; for any <Col N="2094" /> Member of this House to hazard a guess at precisely what is now excluded as compared with what was the position prior to the introduction of this Bill.  I must admit I find it very difficult.  Like other Members, I have received many representations. For example, I know that Deputy Taylor has had representations, like myself, from a particular company in our constituency involved in the tea business.  Recently they made a not insignificant investment in the Tallaght area, employing quite a number of people. They have advised us that they would not have made that investment had this restriction been operable at the time of that investment decision and so on.  That is always a dilemma when one is faced with that kind of position.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether people are not making a case in the hope that some concession will be forthcoming.  After all, as has been said, one is liable to corporation profits tax only if one is making a profit.  That is the fundamental point. In that respect I should like clarification from the Minister.  Do I understand that the position with regard to tea blending, as compared with putting tea into tea-bags, is different, that there is a distinction? Is that the case?  Deputy Noonan dealt with a whole range of processes to which I do not think we will be able to get answers.  Nevertheless, I look forward to the Minister's clarification when replying.</P>
    <P>It is hard to argue for a greater yield from the corporate sector and then when the Minister tries to bring about that greater yield as a result of the restrictions being implemented here, it is difficult to argue logically against it.  I tend to support the thrust of it.  It may well cause some difficulties.  I have instanced a case in my constituency.  Nonetheless I contend this advantageous rate of 10 per cent should never have applied to some of the companies who have been availing of it. It is not merely the area selected by Deputy Noonan as being particularly transparent, in terms of the abuse being perpetrated in the fast food area; there are other areas that not by the wildest <Col N="2095" /> stroke of the imagination could be called or described as manufacturing areas.</P>
    <P>On an earlier section the Minister referred to the fact that the structure of our economy was changing, that more and more emphasis was being placed now on the services sector, as distinct from manufacturing and so on, that we ought to have regard to that.  That is true to a growing extent but the facts of the matter are that it is still the traditional manufacturing sector that creates wealth in this economy.  Hence the importance of the. IDA programme; hence the importance of trying to develop an indigenous manufacturing base.  In the heel of the reel it is the manufacturing sector that generates the wealth off which the services feed.  I know that in recent years the nature of the services sector itself has changed inasmuch as there is beginning to be an element of the services sector that is also creating wealth.  But, in the heel of the reel, the manufacturing sector is the important one in terms of the generation of wealth.  Therefore I contend it is proper that it ought to have an advantageous tax rate as compared with other sectors.</P>
    <P>That raises something I want to retrace briefly &mdash; Deputy Noonan referred to this &mdash; concerning the question of the extension of this advantageous rate to the year 2010.  I, too, am surprised it has been announced in this cavalier fashion.  I am not certain of the eventual view my party will take of it.  I recognise the necessity, not to mention the desirability, of attracting foot-loose international capital here, especially since we have failed to develop an indigenous sector ourselves.  But it is extraordinary, when the dogs in the street know that there is a major review of industrial policy going on, the Minister should have jumped the gun in this fashion.  It is not merely the triennial report to which Deputy Noonan referred that is due for publication.  The Minister knows from his days as Minister for Industry and Commerce that he himself commissioned a special report on industrial policy, which I do not think has been published.  I have been fortunate enough <Col N="2096" /> to be able to read it.  It was prepared by Mr. Frank Roche of UCD.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House are now agreed that there is no element of partisan politics in this statement &mdash; that our industrial policy has been an expensive failure.  We simply must look at value for money and the questions posed by Deputy Noonan, whether the advantage should go to tax-driven policy as compared with grant aid and so on.  These are questions central to the whole issue which will have to be examined.  While that examination is taking place I contend it was wrong for the Minister to presume the conclusion &mdash; as he has done &mdash; in making this announcement.</P>
    <P>I understand, and the Minister may wish to comment on this, that the report on triennial policy is ready for publication and may even be published this week.  I also understand there is a difference of opinion in Cabinet about it and that it contains some radical proposals for change.  I further understand that positions are being taken on this.  To go ahead at the behest of the IDA, or whoever and grant an extension to the year 2010 at a time when something fundamental to the lifeblood of this economy's industrial policy is being debated and reviewed in a major way for the first time in a great many years, is to cut off some of the options we might have had. Like Deputy Noonan, I am not saying that following this debate I will necessarily conclude that the extension of this tax advantage might not have to stay &mdash; it might.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the total amount of money being spent on industry in terms of tax foregone and grant aid to see if we are getting the best return for it.  I sometimes think the relationship between the IDA and the Government or between the IDA and the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a bit like the relationship between Opus Dei and the Vatican &mdash; they are a bit too pure for us, but nonetheless, in the heel of the reel they dictate policy and we must go along with it.  For example, one can see the hand of the IDA in the rowing back of the section 84 facility.  I have made critical <Col N="2097" /> remarks about the banks availing of the section 84 facility but, as I understand it, it is the IDA who have campaigned most aggressively for this.  In relation to the rowing back which the Minister has explained in his usual very persuasive style &mdash;&ldquo;is anybody saying that the contract which has been entered into should not be honoured and does the State not have to keep its word?&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot find the relevant section but the Minister is well aware that I am referring to the provision on binding contracts entered into before budget day; it refers to binding contracts in writing in respect of which negotiations were in progress between the borrower and the company before 31 January 1990. I can inform the Minister for sure that a great many contracts were precipitated by his announcement.  I only hope those contracts come to fruition and that jobs are eventually created.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not undermine the point being made.  The sections we are discussing raised the question of what is the best approach to industrial policy.  I do not wish to prolong the debate but, seeing that this provision was <Col N="2098" /> to run out in 1999, the Minister should have permitted us the time to sit down and discuss it.  I do not think there is a more important subject than this.  The House should have been given the opportunity to debate it in great detail before we find ourselves, as a result of the Finance Bill, 1990, in a position in which a great deal of leeway which we may choose to exercise has already been shut off.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations about supporting the position of Deputy Taylor in respect of the meat processing industry. Admittedly, it is hard to see why it is necessary to write into the Bill that this industry will be able to avail of the 10 per cent rate.  I am confused about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The meat processing industry touches on an area of the economy in which, if we do not develop it to our advantage, there is very little hope of creating jobs.  It is a matter of great concern, having regard to our natural advantages in terms of natural resources in the agricultural-agri business area, that we have not managed to exploit its industrialisation potential.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, just like everybody else here, I do not have a <Col N="2099" /> crystal ball but I anticipate that there will be difficulties as a result of the restrictions. I do not think one can argue for a greater yield from the corporate sector on the one hand and oppose it on the other.  I would like to see us minimise the employment given to chartered accountants to discover new loopholes, exploit old loopholes and use all the tax avoidance measures that are there.  For example, last night, while the President of the ICMSA watched the Fine Gael beckbenchers from the gallery, I should have quoted his predecessor who made a remark which has always stuck with me, that in a particular year in the eighties chartered accountants were paid £40 million by the farming community to teach them how to avoid paying tax and in the same year they paid £32 million to the Exchequer.  This is crazy and is something which ought to be terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me answer Deputy Rabbitte's last question first.  The meat industry is included in the Bill because it may be excluded under the new definition of manufacturing.  The Government have decided that it should be able to avail of the 10 per cent rate and this is why it has been included.  With regard to aircraft and other items specifically excluded and which do not fall within the legislative definition, the Government have made a decision that the 10 per cent rate of tax should be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan looks for certainty but, as we are all aware, it is impossible to achieve this in legislation.  If we were to try to achieve this in all legislation enacted by this House there would be no need for the courts.  Deputy Noonan went into great detail and asked if various processes are in or out.  Not only could one enumerate the processes we are talking about but we could also enumerate an infinite number of different ways in which those processes could be conducted.  For instance, Deputy Noonan asked if one put in a pinch of salt or changed the mix would they change the form.  If we were to try to outline what is to be included we would never be able to write an Act <Col N="2100" /> long enough to cover it.  I suggest that the Minister ask the Revenue Commissioners to set out broad guidelines and indicate what they think should be in and what should be out.  Those guidelines would not have force in law but they certainly would have more force than a Minister's parliamentary reply in this House.  The people who will be affected by the legislation will then have an indication of what the Revenue Commissioners are or are not prepared to accept.  It will not have the force of law but will certainly give clear guidance and direction to the people who will be affected.</P>
    <P>We must look briefly at the history of this.  The Government decided that a special low 10 per cent rate of tax should apply to manufacturing industry.  It was decided not to go ahead and define manufacturing because that might create uncertainties and ambiguities.  The word &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo; is in common usage. Everybody has some idea of what we are talking about when we use it.  The matter was left to the courts to interpret.  I am not saying the courts got it wrong but they certainly came up with an interpretation which included items which were not intended to be included by Parliament and which could not, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, be described as manufacturing.  Consequently the Government were in a dilemma and were forced to write in a definition of manufacturing in order to ensure that what came within the 10 per cent tax rate was what was intended by Parliament.</P>
    <P>In addition to that the Minister has used the opportunity to include a number of other activities which the Government have decided should be within the 10 per cent rate.  Deputy Taylor said that the section would be a licence for litigation. I have no doubt that it will give rise to a certain amount of litigation, perhaps not as much as Deputy Taylor fears.  I do not think, however, that is necessarily a reason to object to this legislation. Deputy Taylor also spoke about employment. The reality is that taxation is a tool of economic management.  The level of employment for industrial development <Col N="2101" /> does not depend solely on the taxation system which is but one element.  The Minister should take up my suggestion that the Revenue Commissioners should be asked to issue broad guidelines of what can and cannot be included.  I think that is the best way around this problem.</P>

      <P>Of course there would be litigation.  There was litigation in relation to the last legislation in this area.  No matter which way we turn on this there would be litigation because the courts have said that whether a process is manufacturing is a question of degree. As Deputy O'Dea rightly says, it has to be interpreted by somebody.  As Deputy Noonan said, the McDermot case in Northern Ireland in 1951 was really the basis of all the trouble in this area in that they set out to define manufacturing and it went on from there.  Many processors have, over the years, got in under the 10 per cent either by going through the courts, by appeal to the Supreme Court or by going through the Revenue Commissioners' appeals mechanism.  I cannot be the interpreter.  It is not my job.  Our job is to legislate.  The Revenue Commissioners will interpret it as an appeals mechanism and the courts are always there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the House, in response to the argument Deputy O'Dea put forward, that the Revenue Commissioners propose to issue a statement of practice on the provisions of section 33.  The issue <Col N="2103" /> of a statement of practice will provide further reassurance for genuine manufacturing companies and will also clarify the position for companies which may consider themselves marginal cases.  The Revenue Commissioners have administered the scheme since 1980 in a responsible and reasonable way.  The cases which qualified for the 10 per cent rate as a result of court decisions are evidence of that approach.  Activities such as the ripening of fruit and the bagging of coal would hardly be classified as activities which should be given the reduced rate without challenge.  The commissioners will continue to administer the scheme in a reasonable manner.  It is proposed that the administration of section 33 would be monitored centrally by senior officials of the Revenue Commissioners.  This will ensure consistency of application to all companies.</P>
    <P>In regard to uncertainty, section 33 in itself does not cause uncertainty.  The real uncertainty has been caused by the speculation about the provision in this House and elsewhere.  Every effort has been made to avoid uncertainty.  An alternative approach to that adopted might have been to introduce a comprehensive test in the form of a general definition of manufacture.  This would have caused a great deal of uncertainty as all processes, not just those marginal cases, would have to examine their entitlement to the 10 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>The approach adopted in section 33 was intended to cause the least amount of uncertainty.  In my reply to the Second Stage debate I assured the House that genuine manufacturing, that is a company which makes a product, will not be affected by this provision.  I now repeat that assurance.  In a further effort to avoid uncertainty, the Revenue Commissioners intend to issue a statement of practice.  This will reassure all genuine cases and will help the marginal cases to determine whether they continue to qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>Last year's Finance Act contained general anti-avoidance legislation.  It was claimed somewhat emotively at that time <Col N="2104" /> that business would suffer seriously from those provisions and that they would cause great uncertainty.  Neither has happened. The Revenue Commissioners have taken a reasonable and responsible approach to that legislation and the initial fears have proved ill-founded.  I have no doubt that section 33 will be administered in the same reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>Why meat processing is included seems to be on some Deputies' minds.  The whole approach to section 33 was one of minimising uncertainty as far as possible. Meat processing was specifically included in the section to allay any fears that it might be treated as a produce acquired in bulk and divided and packaged to prepare it for sale.</P>
    <P>Meat processing as a term has a very wide meaning and can include a wide range of activities.  Some of these may constitute manufacture while others may not.  It is clear that the activities carried out in a building approved under the regulations constitute manufacture. There are certain aspects of this area that any reasonable person would agree were never manufacturing, could never be considered to be manufacturing and consequently should never have been left in.  For example, subparagraph (a) (i) rules out everything.  Subparagraph (i) must be read in the context of a product, produce or material acquired in bulk to prepare it for sale or distribution.</P>
    <P>All of the words &mdash; dividing, purifying, drying, mixing, sorting, packaging, branding, testing or other processing &mdash; are in the context of a material acquired in bulk to prepare it for sale or distribution. If the product which is acquired is merely broken down into smaller quantities of the same product, the company would not qualify for the 10 per cent scheme.  If, on the other hand, the product which is sold is a product which has resulted from the process carried out by the company and is a different product from that which was acquired in bulk, then clearly a manufacturing process has taken place and subparagraph (a) (i) would not apply.  Very few processes of dividing bulk would consist of one only of the processes involved in subparagraph (a) <Col N="2105" /> (i).  If &ldquo;any combination&rdquo; were not included, the subparagraph would have no effect.  For example, very few traders would divide bulk material without packaging it.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the phrase &ldquo;or any combination&rdquo; is included in each separate subparagraph.  It does not govern the processes in all subparagraphs. Accordingly, it is not possible to combine processes from different subparagraphs.</P>
    <P>Many other questions were raised on specific areas but I know the statement of practice will allay a lot of uncertainty. However, there is another aspect I wish to refer to, which is very important, and that is the question of including an amendment on the 10 per cent corporation tax.  I do not have time to deal with this in detail except to say the following. It was signalled at the time of the Second Stage debate and was dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on Second Stage.  I have not read the Second Stage debate.  Perhaps Members did contribute.  The case was studied for quite a considerable time and international consultants studied Ireland in relation to centres abroad and everybody will agree that we need to watch our position as a peripheral State as we approach the Single Market.  The study was not completed at the time the budget was being discussed in this House. As a consequence, it was subsequently decided by the Government and announced in this House.  As I have said, Deputies had the opportunity to discuss it on Second Stage and they will again have the opportunity during the debate on industrial policy.  I have plenty of arguments that I could put forward in relation to other aspects but I do not have the time to discuss them in detail at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> I hope I have allayed some of the fears and uncertainties that have been raised. I predict this will not give rise to the uncertainty that people expect.  It is the process of manufacturing that is important and that is what the issue will be for anybody arguing the case against the Revenue Commissioners.  The fact that this legislation will be passed does not automatically disqualify anybody from applying for the 10 per cent rate of tax.  If they are not allowed this concession by the Revenue Commissioners they can go before the appeals process and can go to the courts as well.  It is they who will interpret the law and not the legislators.  We produce the legislation and provide the best guidelines we can to the Revenue Commissioners and the courts but it is up to them to interpret it.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to draw the attention of the House to amendment No. 73f, which contains a reference to Údarás na Gaeltachta Act, 1970.  This of course should be a reference to the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act, 1979.  I would request that the amendment be debated as if the reference in the amendment were a reference to the Act of 1979.  This is the same point that arose last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 91 and 93 are related and therefore it is proposed to take them together for discussion purposes.  Is that satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 91:</P>
      <P>In page 62, before section 59, but in Chapter VIII, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;59.&mdash; The provisions of sections 59 to section 68 inclusive shall not apply to persons whose tax liability arises under case I or case II of Schedule D.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>There is general agreement in the House with the Minister's proposal to remove accelerated depreciation for capital allowances.  The initial decision was taken by his predecessor, Mr. MacSharry.  Until this year one could depreciate 50 per cent.  Now the Minister is proceeding to bring that rate down to zero.  That set of policy proposals has general acceptance because it derives from a belief in the House that there should be a bigger contribution from the corporate sector.  We discussed those arguments yesterday and today and we are generally in favour of them.  Something that is not generally realised is that accelerated depreciation also applies to income tax payers.  It applies to case I and case II of Schedule D; in other words, all small traders, farmers and professional people, and they too are losing their accelerated depreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The firm of solicitors that installs a computer system and a lot of expensive software will be able to write it off over the next five years if we accept the provisions of section 59, but they will no longer be able to accelerate the depreciation, or 50 per cent of it, in the first year.  In the case of small traders, that can give rise to serious cash flow problems because one of the methods of reducing the outlay of funds for the sole <Col N="2110" /> trader or for the professional person is to be able to get 50 per cent of the amount invested back in the first year against tax. It would apply also to engineers, doctors, barristers to a lesser extent, solicitors and any of the professions who would be involved in computerising their systems. It also applies to farmers, for example, a farmer buying machinery or a new tractor. He will no longer be able to depreciate 50 per cent of the cost once the Minister's proposal becomes law.  It applies to all sole traders as well.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 91 seeks to exclude from the restrictions on accelerated depreciation people who pay income tax under case I and case II of Schedule D. I accept the Minister's proposal that these restrictions should apply to corporation tax but I do not think it was ever the policy position of people in the House that it should apply to income tax.  It has been almost an accidental cross-over.  I recall that, when the former Minister, Mr. MacSharry, brought in the proposals initially, there was surprise in the House when, in the middle of Committee Stage, Deputies realised that the proposals also impacted on income taxpayers because there was the perception that we were doing something to get a bigger take from the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>From the figures given this morning I accept that, if the Minister is to accept this amendment, a reasonably large chunk of tax would be foregone in the next year or two.  Perhaps the Minister can give us those figures now.  Quite a lot of tax is foregone in providing this relief to Schedule D taxpayers.  If the Minister thinks he cannot go as far as I am suggesting on amendment No. 91, I would like to recommend amendment No. 93 to him.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 93 has the same intent but would confine the benefit to investment on pollution control by a person whose liability arises.  The House is aware that over the last 18 months or so, and continuing over the next 12 months, farmers will be incurring expenses in controlling pollution.  They will be involved in investment in plant and machinery and upgrading of buildings to control, in particular, flows <Col N="2111" /> of effluent from their yards.  If, by coincidence, the ability to depreciate up to 50 per cent of the investment is taken from them this year, that will impact very seriously on the programmes now in place, which are proceeding well, to control farm yard pollution.  I need not remind the House of the problems of pollution.  There is the public perception that pollution has all to do with Sellafield and dirty industry.  An enormous amount of pollution is caused by neighbours in the countryside whose farmyards, for one reason or another, either through lack of awareness or through lack of investment, are not fitted out properly to prevent silage effluent flowing into the neighbourhood stream and down into the river. We had numerous instances, particularly last year, with the very fine summer, of fish kills all over the country. The photographs in the newspapers, or if one walks along the river bank and sees thousands of dead fish in the local clear stream, are a clear reminder to everybody of the impact of pollution on the quality of life.  What I am suggesting here would cost very little under amendment No. 93.</P>
    <P>If investment on the control of pollution could be exempted for the time being; if the full depreciation could be allowed in the same manner as he is allowing the Custom House Docks site, or certain Shannon activities, and so on &mdash; I am not arguing that the amendment I have put down is drafted sufficiently tightly to ring fence the activity I have in mind &mdash; I would accept any amendment which the Minister would come back with on Report Stage to fulfil this intent.  It is a very good amendment and involves very little cost.  Even if the Minister ties it in to allowing it to people who qualify for the appropriate grants from the Department of Agriculture and Food, that would not be a problem and would tie it in very tightly.  Then only legitimate schemes sanctioned by the Department for farmyard activities to control pollution would be caught within the exemption I am advocating.  If <Col N="2112" /> I could get an indication from the Minister that he would proceed along these lines on Report Stage I would withdraw the two amendments.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that amendment No. 91 involves a serious cost element but there is hardly any cost involved in amendment No. 93.  This is a provision which we need not have in the legislation for all time.  If it was suggested that it be removed in four or five years there would be no problem because the bulk of the pollution work would be done in the farmyards of Ireland.  The proposal happens to coincide with the time when about half the work is done and is well under way to put the remainder of it right.  There is now a great awareness among farmers and the farming organisations that farmyards must be put in order.  There is an acceptance now that fish have been killed by farm pollution.  There is a willingness to make the investment.  The State has backed it fully and there are now grant provisions available from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I would ask the Minister to amend the section in the manner I suggest so that the good work done by his colleague in the Department of Agriculture and Food and the concerns of all of us who have become increasingly aware of environmental issues are not set at naught by this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add to what my colleague, Deputy Noonan, has said in relation to amendment No. 91.  I would ask the Minister to take note of how Deputy Noonan put that amendment. It is very important at this stage not to impede the progress of controlling pollution.  I would say it was an inspired decision in the Department of Agriculture and Food to make grants available for pollution control.  A problem arises where 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent of top-class farmers, because they are the better off farmers, have decided on the investment because it needed to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another category are applying on the second division and they are not nearly so well off.  First, they do not have <Col N="2113" /> the financial resources.  If we do not look closely at the depreciation aspect many of those people will be unable to avail of the pollution control package Deputy Noonan spoke about.  The Minister for Finance could put several controls on that scheme which would be quite acceptable to all farmers.  Nobody expects a blank cheque on an occasion like this.  The controls could be tied to the Farm Development Service and approval for grant aid as Deputy Noonan suggested.  That approval could be limited, if so desired, to a certain investment per farm to make sure it would not be open-ended.  Above all else it must be absolutely controllable and workable and it must be possible to police it without employing an extra civil servant, perhaps by means of one extra page only on the approval document from the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Against that background I ask the Minister to take note of this provision.  I do not know whether he can quantify the cost, but I assume it will be very little, though there is a huge investment in all that area.  From an investment point of view no doubt it is quite costly and that is why a great number of farmers are unable to proceed with the pollution control measures despite the fact that a very reasonable grant is provided at the moment.  I put it to the Minister that he might decide on this aspect and, if he cannot decide on it today, he might give some idea next week of what he can do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of antagonising not only Deputy Noonan but many of my colleagues in the legal profession, I have to say I cannot support his amendment No. 91.  In all fairness and equity I see no reason for people carrying on trades or in professions, making substantial investments in plant, being singled out to receive the accelerated capital allowances. It is acceptable that they receive capital allowances and are in a position to write off the cost of the equipment they obtain in the normal manner at whatever percentage it is per year.  As I said this morning, capital allowances are not being <Col N="2114" /> abandoned or disposed of in this legislation; it is accelerated capital allowances that are being disposed of.  It is progressive that we revert in this Bill to a position that applied for many years under which a percentage of the cost of investment in new plant was written off. That could affect me and my colleagues personally adversely but, in the overall context of tax equity, it is not an unreasonable provision.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot support the Deputy either on amendment No. 93. Of course pollution control is extremely important.  I understand grants are available from the Department of Agriculture and Food, generous grants at that, as Deputy Connaughton indicated.  I do not know whether it is suggested that people who are running dirty industries of one form or another and have to control them from the pollution point of view should have it both ways, on the one hand by getting grants from the Department of Agriculture and Food and, on the other, getting tax concessions from the Department of Finance.  A person who runs a dirty industry or who, in the farming sector, produces pollution of one form or another is obligated as part and parcel of his task to control that and must control it to preserve the environment.  There is no inherent base for saying taxpayers generally have to supplement a proper and normal running cost of such business or farm.  To say otherwise would be to open the floodgates, and where safety measures of a different kind are needed, such as provision of fire escapes or alterations for fire safety purposes, the same argument could be put, that the cost of doing that would entitle one to the accelerated capital allowances provision.  That is not reasonable.  I see no substantial argument or basis for supporting either of these amendments.</P>

      <P>Let me delay the proceedings for a second while I report to the House and Deputy Taylor that, following his intervention this morning when it appeared to me there may have been an insinuation that the Deputy sensed he had suffered in respect of the <Col N="2115" /> submission of amendments <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister or any other Member, I want to assure him, having examined the matter, that there is absolutely no basis for what he suggests.  The Deputy's amendment was submitted late on Monday evening at which stage I understand he was advised that one way or another one half was out of order.  As an indication of the common sense that operates, it was indicated to him that, even though it was late, in so far as the other half corresponded with amendments already in, his name would be added thereto.  In respect of that amendment the Deputy can be quite sure no amendment was accepted at a later date than the date on which his was rejected. I know Deputy Taylor will accept that as a statement of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proving very difficult, although we have managed to pack quite a bit into the short time available to us, to discuss this important Bill; to debate one section in isolation from another.  It all has to do with the total tax take at the end of the day, and on this section on capital allowances I find it difficult to reconcile the discussion and the rhetoric, if that is not an unkind word, that we have had about tax equity with some of the amendments that have gone forward.  At the heel of the reel amendment No. 91 proposes that people who are called professionals should be excluded from the restriction on accelerated capital allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt on Second Stage at some length with the question of anti-evasion measures and the necessity for them to be tightened up and policed more rigorously by the Revenue Commissioners.  If I have an image of one section of the community who do most &mdash; to put it kindly &mdash; to limit their tax liability it is the professionals, doctors, barristers, solicitors, accountants and all the rest.  They would regard one as mentally deficient if one was to suggest that they should pay tax as the rest of us.  They do not believe in doing that and they do not do it.  How Deputy Noonan can recommend that not only <Col N="2116" /> should they get the benefit of capital allowances, which they receive and continue to receive, but that they should do so on the accelerated basis I do not understand.  I do not think that can be reconciled with the Deputy's earlier remarks on the need for tax equity.</P>

      <P>The reduction in the prices of cattle and sheep in recent months took place against the background of the achievement of record price levels for these products in 1989.  Cattle prices are, <Col N="2117" /> however, well above the levels for the period up to 1987.  Cereal prices have fallen slightly reflecting a trend in world prices; as the tight markets brought about major shortfalls in production in North America have weakened.</P>
      <P>Volume increases for cattle, sheep and cereals which are expected this year should largely offset the effect of the price reduction.  Furthermore, additional subsidy payments for catle and sheep should help to protect the incomes of producers of these products in 1990. Total payments under the ewe premium scheme, for instance, are expected to exceed £130 million in 1990 as compared with £65 million in 1989.  For cereal producers, income levels should be maintained in 1990.  Regarding lamb prices I am glad to note that some recovery has occurred this week.</P>
      <P>The recently agreed price package should also help.  For cereals, the various elements in the package should more than offset the automatic effects of the stabiliser mechanism to apply from 1 July.  For beef, intervention prices should be improved as a result of the reduction in the payment delay period to 45 days and there are commitments from the Commission in regard to the export marketing possibilities for Community beef and to better support for internal market prices.  The Green £ adjustment will increase the ewe premium payable in 1991 and the special premium supplement of £3.40 will apply from that year also in respect of ewes in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>From the Minister's reply it appears that he is the only man in Ireland who believes that farmers will not lose money in 1990.  He is the only person I met in Ireland in the last six months who holds that view.  Will the Minister give an indication of the effects of the price talks which he has described as successful in so far as the £70 million to £80 million is concerned?  Will the Minister tell the House why it is that most factories are not quoting for beef?

      <P>The Deputy deals with the price package in that question. With regard to beef, the Deputy will be aware of the fact that the adjustments in the agri-monetary position and the reduction in intervention payment delay have had the cumulative effect of bringing about 3.5 to 4 per cent increases in the beef sector.  The market has not been buoyant and, were it not for those actions, the reduction in beef prices would have been very significant.  Those actions have ensured stability in the market place.</P>

The Minister gave us to understand that Irish farmers would be no worse off this year than they were last year despite all the comments to the contrary, some of which emanated from his Department. Will the Minister explain how he can come to this conclusion when everybody is aware that cattle are fetching £100 per head less?</P>

      <Quest>if, in the light of the outcome of the recent EC farm price talks, he will support the principle of a supply/management programme to protect the livelihood of thousands of Irish cereal growers; and if he accepts that many Irish grain growers will be forced out of farming this year because of present policies.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreement on EC agricultural prices for 1990-91 was reached on the basis of a Presidency compromise on 27 April last.  The final package is generally recognised to have been both fair and balanced and to represent a successful outcome achieved in difficult internal and international circumstances. Overall, the 1990-91 agreement involves a significant improvement in support for farmers' incomes throughout the Community, but for Irish agriculture specifically, its value is more than £50 million greater than the amount available under the Commission's original proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Presidency compromise addressed the demands of cereal growers in particular. Accordingly, it provides for a reduction in the intervention payment delay period from 110 days to 30 days which is equivalent to a price increase of about 3 per cent; an increase in the monthly increments equivalent to a price increase of close to 1 per cent and a Green Pound adjustment of 2 per cent.  These adjustments will more than offset the <Col N="2120" /> automatic effects of the stabiliser arrangements to apply from 1 July.</P>
    <P>I have always supported supply management as the most effective way of dealing with the problems of the cereals market.  The prices decision recognises to some extent the need for more action in this regard.  As well as undertaking to promote non-food use, effective and balanced set-aside and incorporation in animal feed, the Council has asked the Commission to evaluate the implementation of the European Council's stabiliser decision of February 1988 and to make appropriate proposals in time for implementation in the 1991-92 marketing year.  This is as much as can be achieved on this front at this stage.</P>

      <P>One of the major constraints, and I am sure all Members will recognise this, has been the decision taken by Heads of Government two or three years ago.  That decision binds the Commission, and the Council of Ministers. The Deputy will be pleased to know that, as President of the Council of Ministers, I got agreement to have the Commission evaluate the implementation of that.  If we can succeed in having that decision reviewed the other matters I discussed, including the set aside and the whole range of optional uses for cereals, will be more effective.  I am not convinced, and neither is the Commission, that a strict supply management policy would be in the interests of the Community or Ireland.</P>

      <P>Under ACOT, local farm advisory and training services were managed through a district system within counties under the Senior Agricultural Development Officer (SADO) grade.

      <P>In agreeing to the general proposal, approval was given in January last, for 25 posts of CADO in Teagasc on the basis that Counties Cork and Tipperary would require two such posts but that it was possible to amalgamate a number of the smaller counties under one CADO.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Director of ERAD that while the establishment of a task force could be of assistance to the disease eradication effort in the longer term, the creation of such a force would require considerable manpower reserves and could not be put in place in the short term.  The immediate objective is for all those concerned to fully co-operate in all aspects of the existing programme and to ensure that the available resources are used as effectively as possible to this end.

      <P>I indicated recently that the Government's review of the disadvantaged areas scheme has resulted in a decision to lodge a detailed application with the EC Commission in relation to the extension of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The application covers the extension of the present disadvantaged areas by adding new areas to the list of less severely handicapped areas; the designation of certain coastal areas as areas suffering from specific handicaps &mdash; the first two proposals will result in an extension of about 2 million acres &mdash; the reclassification as less severely handicapped of those areas now designated mountain sheep grazing areas, 255,000 acres; the reclassification as more severely handicapped of certain areas, 1.3 million acres, now designated as less severely handicapped; and restructuring the scheme to provide for an increase in headage rates and for greater modulation of payments to reflect differing degrees of handicap.</P>
      <P>There is adequate provision in the Community Support Framework 1989-1993 to finance these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of the present disadvantaged areas requires a Commission proposal to the Council of Ministers and agreement by a qualified majority in the Council.  The other proposals require the approval of the EC Commission.  Until the relevant procedures are completed it is not possible to indicate the level of Exchequer funding which will be required to implement the measures to be approved.  When fully implemented, the new proposals, together with the abolition this year of the off-farm income restriction, will increase headage payments from £60 million to £100 million a year.  In addition to receiving increased headage payments, farmers in the newly designated areas will benefit from <Col N="2126" /> increased investment aids, exemption from the milk co-responsibility levy and the special supplement to the ewe premium.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of thanking public representatives, county councils, farming organisations, local interest groups and individuals who made about 1,000 submissions in connection with this most recent &mdash; the fourth &mdash; and most comprehensive and extensive of all boundary reviews of the disadvantaged areas to date.  The field work for the survey covered an area of 6.68 million acres, a total of 1,636 district electoral divisions and over 20,700 townlands in 22 counties.  Almost 49,000 holdings or 57 per cent of the total submitted were visited by the Department's agricultural officers and surveyed in detail.</P>

      <P>My Department have not introduced any new regulations regarding copy deeds or folio numbers to the cattle and sheep headage schemes in disadvantaged areas.  Applicants for these schemes are required to declare the area of land used by them for forage purposes.  Since there are limits on the amounts of grants that can be paid per forage hectare devoted to the different types of livestock it is necessary that the accuracy of declarations be checked, especially in the case of new applicants or in the cases where the forage area for sheep headage purposes differs from that quoted for cattle headage purposes or where areas differ from year to year without any obvious explanation.  The European Commission do not stipulate the precise nature of the legal documentation required, although various EC auditors have commented on discrepancies in <Col N="2128" /> areas quoted on applications from year to year.  We are obliged to implement controls to eliminate these discrepancies.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have noted that I said: We are obliged by the European Community auditors to implement controls and regulations to ensure proper certification of the applicant's title, the land he possesses and indeed also his entitlement in terms of the numbers of animals in respect of which he is claiming.  The reality is that, since the EC provide the bulk of the funds, they are entitled to lay down those requirements. I did not say &mdash; perhaps the Deputy misunderstood &mdash; that we do not require evidence of title.  I said the Commission do not specify exactly the evidence that is required but they do require us to satisfy them as to the controls we are putting in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>As the western package &mdash; under which aid is provided for drainage which is ancillary to land reclamation &mdash; is due to expire early next year, arrangements are now being made to phase it out.  Aid for land reclamation will continue to be available under the farm improvement programme.  There are no proposals at present to introduce any further scheme of grants for land drainage work.  The question of aid for drainage was not discussed at the recent farm talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Would he not agree that excellent work was done under the western drainage scheme that has been aborted prematurely?  Is he aware that <Col N="2132" /> there are 150,000 hectares of land &mdash; which would otherwise have lain fallow, idle or swamped &mdash; which have been brought into production and that in many cases, particularly in the west, these have meant the difference between viability and non-viability?  In view of the fact that there are now over 7,000 applications on file that will not be dealt with, would the Minister agree that the Department would appear to be aborting the scheme well in advance of its true maturity date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the western drainage scheme, which came into operation in January 1979 and was terminated on 31 December 1988, grant aid of approximately £64 million was paid to farmers in respect of 150,000 hectares of field drainage.  The cost of that was funded on a 50:50 basis by the Community and the Exchequer.  Aid will continue to be available under various other headings in respect of which aid will be available for drainage, which will continue under the terms of the farm improvement programme, provided it comprises part of a land reclamation project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with the import of Deputy Higgins's question, that there were approximately 150,000 hectares &mdash; on which I am open to correction &mdash; and that the Agricultural Institute identified at least 240,000 other hectares in this country, which could benefit from a scheme such as the western drainage scheme?  Would he not agree that there is need for a field drainage régime or grant scheme here given those facts established by the people most competent to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>We must examine this question in the context of our membership of the Community and its attitude to the question of expenditure on land reclamation or drainage and the implications of bringing more land into production. While this may not suit our circumstances, as members of the Community we are subject to the constraints imposed by the Community.  We must <Col N="2133" /> remember the agriculture industry are net beneficiaries of the Community's various payments.  It is not anxious to make generous grant aid, which was available previously, available in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the scheme he has referred to is essentially a dry land reclamation one, covering the removal of fences and scrub and so on, but which fails to address the question of drainage?  Furthermore, would he not agree it makes very little economic sense to bring 150,000 hectares into production without, at the same time, providing maintenance grants? Inevitably, it will fall back to its original state unless money is made available on an ongoing basis to drain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>

      <P>It is not intended to propose amendments to the eligibility terms of the programme for the control of farmyard pollution which was approved by the EC Commission as recently as last August.</P>
      <P>The off-farm income limit under the headage schemes has been dropped from 1 January 1990 at a cost of £12 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in 1988 12,000 farms were surveyed throughout the country to determine the risk of farmyard pollution?  Of these 23 per cent were considered to be in the high risk category while 22 per cent were considered to be in the medium to high risk category.  It was pointed out at that time that many of these farms were in the hands of farmers with off-farm incomes. We often find that those farmers who modernised their farms in recent years have off-farm incomes and that they used their better income for capitalising the farm.  However, these farmers will not be <Col N="2135" /> able to avail of this scheme.  Does the Minister agree with this?  Would it not be better, during the so-called Green Presidency, to extend this scheme to all farmers in the same way that all farmers will now be able to avail of the headage schemes, which is long overdue?  In this way we would tackle the problem of farmyard pollution in a far more realistic way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the western package I accorded priority to anti-pollution programmes.  That was a major development and I would like to acknowledge the co-operation I received from the farming community and their organisations in making this scheme a success.  It forms a major element of the programme.  Secondly, I should point out to the Deputy again that the off-farm income limit under the headage schemes has been abolished as and from January this year which will be of substantial benefit to the people he is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be of considerable help to them in meeting the costs of any pollution control programmes and should also lead to extra income.  In the nature of things, there are many full-time farmers on low incomes outside the disadvantaged areas.  I am anxious to strike a balance and to consider their interests also.  I hope that by doing things in stages we will be able to tackle all of these issues.</P>

      <Quest>if any areas in County Kildare have been included for consideration in the context of any proposed extension to the disadvantaged areas; the consultations which took place with agencies in County Kildare in determining the extent of any such submissions; if the EC Commission has accepted all or part of these proposals; if he will outline the projected cost benefit of the proposals in respect of County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 9, 14, 44 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government decision has been taken to lodge a detailed application with <Col N="2138" /> the EC Commission seeking their agreement to the extension of Ireland's disadvantaged areas by about two million acres and also to the reclassification of about 1.3 million acres from less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped status and some 0.26 million acres from mountain sheep grazing to less severely handicapped areas status.</P>
    <P>My Department have this week furnished the EC Commission with details of the proposed extension and reclassification of areas and have had initial discussions on the matter.</P>
    <P>Pending an EC decision on those proposals, however, I cannot disclose which areas are being included for designation as disadvantaged or for reclassification in any particular county, as it has been the custom in the course of previous surveys to await the final EC decision on the areas involved before publishing full details of those areas.</P>
    <P>The extension and reclassification submissions are very detailed and comprehensive and take into account the reasons given by the Commission for rejecting the proposal lodged with them on 4 February 1987.</P>
    <P>In relation to one point raised by Deputy Durkan, however, I can say that all areas submitted in County Kildare by public representatives, farm organisations or individual farmers before commencement of the nationwide survey were, in fact, surveyed.  Indeed, overall almost 1,000 such submissions were received which led to an extremely extensive survey of about 6.68 million acres in 22 counties and to proposals to increase our disadvantaged areas by over 19 per cent and carry out large-scale reclassifications. As this is the largest ever proposed increase in our disadvantaged areas and will benefit some 29,000 farmers, I believe it is a very satisfactory outcome to the fourth review of our disadvantaged areas and I will make every effort to ensure early EC acceptance of this very favourable result.</P>

      <P>There were five elements in the submission.  Extension was one and reclassification was another. Modulation in existing areas was another. Change from mountain sheep to handicap was another and, finally, coastal zones was another.  I cannot say when the Commission will have completed all of this because it is very comprehensive. I am confident that we will get a decision at least on the extensions early in the second half of this year and probably on the reclassification as well.  I cannot, however, say that definitely because it is a major job and it is not for me to tell the Commission when they should complete it.</P>

When this is done, they will submit their views on the industry to the policy review group which I set up in December 1989 to review policies in the agriculture and food industry generally.

The cattle herd has recovered very significantly since that period so they will not reach that conclusion. The rest is speculation.

I hope we will get a dynamic enterprise approach from this group in relation to this very important sector of our economy.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that 68 <Col N="2147" /> per cent of the national kill is going into intervention and private storage, is the Minister worried that the outbreak of the mad cow disease in this country and in Northern Ireland may lead to a huge number going into intervention?  May I ask the Minister what he is doing to reassure the beef eating public about the safety of the product?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>The Deputy has said mistakenly and, I might add, imprudently that there was an outbreak of the mad cow disease.  There has been no outbreak of mad cow disease in this country.  It is outrageous that any Deputy should suggest to the contrary.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, since we were first notified, we have taken the lead in the European Community that this should be a notifiable disease and that any animal that contracts the disease anywhere in Europe should be slaughtered. Since then, 19 cases have been identified out of a total cattle population of seven million.  Of those 19 cases, at least ten have been identified as having come across the Border and others have been identified as coming from herds that were imported because they were special category herds; in three cases we were able to trace the cause to imported feed.  Let me assure this House &mdash; everybody wants to know this &mdash; that of all cases there is certainly not even a trickle in Ireland and that is a very important status to us.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the total budget provided for CBF for 1989 and 1990; and the markets which they exclusively operated.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 18, 20 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>CBF's total budget was £3.7 million in 1989 and is estimated at £4.1 million for 1990.  The Exchequer grant amounted to £0.5 million for both years and the remainder is made up of statutory levies contributed by producers.</P>
      <P>Marketing of beef and lamb is a commercial matter for the firms concerned. The functions of CBF are to develop, promote, encourage and coordinate the export of livestock and meat.  They provide valuable services to the meat industry which improve the effectiveness of our meat companies in the market place.  It is my intention that these services should continue and, indeed, be enhanced in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the current difficulties being encountered by Irish lamb producers due to a fall in market prices but I am glad to note some recovery has occurred this week.  The drop in prices is due to a number of factors including the advantage to British lamb exports to the French market caused by the drop in the value of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the French <Col N="2150" /> franc, the lower level of clawback on British lamb exports and increased slaughterings both here and in Britain. The 1990 ewe premiums will compensate Irish producers for income loss sustained this year.</P>
    <P>The ewe premium for 1989 was fixed at £17.75 at the Sheepmeat Management Committee on 4 May.  Payments of the 1989 premium will be made when inspections are completed in early June.  The estimated total value of the 1989 premium will exceed £80 million.  This benefit to Irish producers should maintain confidence in the sector and assist farmers in dealing with present difficulties. In addition to the payment of the 1989 premium, two instalments, each representing 30 per cent of the estimated 1990 premium, will be paid later this year.  Total ewe premium payments this year should exceed £130 million.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that, as part of the EC prices package, which I recently negotiated, an additional premium of £3.40 per ewe will be paid from 1991 onwards for all eligible ewes to beneficiaries in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The common organisation of the market for the sheepmeat sector provides for private storage aid arrangements. Monthly tenders have been in operation since the beginning of this year for those regions of the Community where prices fall below the 70 per cent benchmark level.  The private storage arrangements should provide an important safety measure for the sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the price level is a relative term, that perhaps he will not be compensating farmers for the low price of lamb, that there is a ceiling which prevents him from doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said the best guarantee is the price level, and I think every Deputy recognises that.  For reasons I have mentioned, there are what I might call certain temporary distortions in that market, for instance, because of the situation in Britain at the moment. Our priority is to maintain a floor through <Col N="2151" /> the operation of the ewe premium which I have mentioned and that increases as the market price or the reference price decreases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course. Its purpose is to make up the difference between the reference price and the market price at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is a stabiliser in place on the ewe premium.  Farmers who are losing up to £20 per head on their lambs this year due to a fall in lamb prices on the French market will not be adequately compensated via the ewe premium. Surely the Minister must understand that.  He is giving the clear impression that farmers will be no worse off this year as a result of the low prices for lambs.</P>
      <P>Is there not something very peculiar about the system that has operated in this country for the last three or four years, or maybe longer, whereby we promote actively the idea of farmers getting into sheep, when two years ago the Minister slashed the allocation to CBF, the Meat Marketing Board, by half &mdash; they were getting £1 million and now they are getting £500,000?  Where is the consistency or the good sense in that?  Is it not now we want the markets?  As far as I can see, CBF have not got the financial resources to market our lambs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Would the Minister agree with the view expressed by many farmers that CBF are very important when things are going well but if there is a crisis they do not seem to be able to do anything and are irrelevant?  Some farmers feel they are paying money for nothing and that CBF are not there to help them when a problem arises, as is the case at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>CBF launched a quality programme in lamb and sheep production a year and a half ago not too far from the area the Deputy represents, in Hacketstown, which has been eminently successful.  It is a code of conduct for producers, hauliers, drovers and processors which has resulted in much better prices for Irish products, particularly on the French market.  I do not believe CBF are important to farmers only when things are going well.  They have done an excellent job.  I acknowledge that they do not have unlimited resources and I am considering possibilities of supplementing their resources, but the producers must do the same, particularly having regard to the quality image they promote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that our exports of lamb are restricted to one country and that we must sell to other countries in the future if we are to develop further and ensure continuity of the market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to <Col N="2153" /> recognise that there has been great concentration on the French market, which is vitally important, and they appreciate the quality of Irish lamb.  It is equally important to recognise, as Deputy Leonard suggests, that there are other outlets.  There has been an increase in the sheep population generally in the European Community and that, as well as world conditions, has given rise to a reduction in the world market price.  I assure the House that through the operation of European Community instruments, such as the ewe premium and so on, I will try to ensure that prices remain buoyant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the crisis in the British meat market arising from &ldquo;mad cow&rdquo; disease there and the massive vote of no confidence by the British public in their meat industry creates an opportunity for Irish meat sellers?  In that context would the Minister not agree that it is necessary to increase the funding to CBF to enable them to market effectively labelled, safe, clean, &ldquo;green&rdquo; Irish meat which is available in abundance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That has always been, and will always be, a feature of the promotion of Irish meat &mdash; safe, clean, &ldquo;green&rdquo;, as the Deputy calls it, from an unpolluted natural environment.  My officials maintain constant liaison with CBF.  The House will not be surprised to know that we had discussions with them yesterday and today in relation to all market possibilities.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in asking CBF to promote the quality of our product, I cannot be seen to suggest that the quality of other products is contaminated.  The quality of our product will be promoted in a very positive way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McGrath's question the Minister indicated several reasons for the reduction in sheep prices this year.  As Deputy Connaughton said, farmers are receiving £20 or £25 a head less for their lambs now than they were this time last year.  The <Col N="2154" /> Minister did not give any indication of a possible cartel controlling these prices.  If such a cartel exists, what is the Minister doing about it?  The fact that there has been an increase in the sheep population in Ireland is no reason for factories to club together and control prices as they have done recently in announcing 92p a kilo as the price of sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the operation of what he calls a cartel or monopoly is not my responsibility but that of another Minister. I am very anxious to ensure that the market buoyancy is passed on, particularly to the primary producer.  If I had any evidence of groups operating to reduce prices I would certainly do everything within my power to deal with it.  If the Deputy or any Deputy has information to this effect I would be glad to get it.</P>

      <P>Under the modified arrangements for intervention for skim milk powder agreed in 1987, buying-in may be suspended as soon as the quantities offered for intervention in the European Community as a whole and not just in Ireland exceed 100,000 tonnes.  Stocks of skim milk powder in the Community now stand at 51,276 tonnes of which 8,806 tonnes are held in Irish stores.  The Commission has not yet indicated its intentions as to the steps it will take if the 100,000 tonne limit is reached.  I am pressing the Commission to agree on the <Col N="2155" /> action to be taken to maintain market stability in the event of the 100,000 tonne ceiling for the EC being exceeded and announce the details at an early date in order to avoid uncertainty and unnecessary recourse to intervention.</P>

      <P>Prices in international markets for dairy products <Col N="2157" /> improved significantly in 1988 and remained buoyant throughout most of 1989.  The recovery of the world dairy market in 1988 and 1989 was a direct result of the actions taken by the EC in reforming its milk regime through the imposition of quotas on milk production, restrictions on intervention intake and the elimination of intervention stocks. However, world market prices started to weaken in August 1989 and the decline has continued into 1990.  There are a number of factors involved in the decline, the primary one being the fall in butter consumption worldwide.  The reason for the decrease in the price of milk is the weakening of the world price for dairy produce.  Producer returns have started to feel the effect of the downturn in the commodity markets just as they benefited from the exceptional market buoyancy in the past two years.</P>
      <P>I approached the Commission in early January seeking stronger market management measures to alleviate the problem and action on a number of fronts has since been taken.  Recently I again requested that the Commission improve their internal disposal schemes, which I believe could do much to assist balance in the market.  I am hopeful that further action in that regard will be taken.  The successful outcome of the recent EC price negotiations of course, should also help firm up the market.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, of course, the protection of dairy farmer incomes and job security will depend on action by the industry itself in regard to rationalisation, product mix and the effective promotion and marketing of its products.</P>

      <P>I would want to see that trend stopped.  Because of that, I approached the Commission and had detailed negotiations with them at the beginning of the Presidency.  They took a number of actions then.  I will not be satisfied until they take other actions, where necessary.  I can give the Deputy some indications of what they have done. They increased the export refunds for butter, butter oil and buttermilk powder, they reintroduced intervention, which did not exist previously, with a total of 88,000 tonnes of butter and 51,276 tonnes of skimmed milk powder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving this reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice who is away on official business.  The facts of the matter <Col N="2161" /> raised in the Private Notice Question, as related to me by the Garda authorities, are as follows:</P>
      <P>In the early hours of Tuesday last, 15 May, at 12.50 a.m. approximately, a taxi company in Strabane received a call to collect a fare in Lifford, County Donegal. On arriving at the Lifford location the car was, in effect, hijacked by a number of men, at least three, all of whom were masked and at least one of whom was armed.</P>
      <P>These men proceeded to place a number of objects in the taxi which shortly afterwards was driven to the Border and abandoned just off the Lifford bridge on the Northern side.  The Garda immediately diverted traffic and the area was sealed off on both sides. Extensive searches have been carried out on the Southern side by gardaí backed up by an Army explosives team.</P>
      <P>Meetings have taken place between an explosives officer on our side, the Garda, the RUC and an explosives officer from the British Army to discuss how best the problem can be approached.  In the interests of safety, a decision was taken to evacuate the Lifford hospital patients. This has been done.</P>
      <P>Following the detailed discussions and liaison on a North-South basis that have been ongoing since Tuesday, the British side have undertaken to deal with the situation as quickly as possible.  In accordance with the usual procedure for dealing with such devices on the Border, every possible facility has been provided from our side to enable the vehicle concerned to be removed.</P>
      <P>The suggestion in this question to the effect that the British authorities are awaiting some security steps to be carried out on our side before tackling the abandoned vehicle is totally unwarranted. Nothing is being left undone to ensure that no danger lies on our side of the Border for those who will eventually, when it is safe to do so, move in to deal with whatever device may have been left in the taxi abandoned on the northern side of the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To those who are inconvenienced because the abandoned vehicle is still <Col N="2162" /> there today, Thursday, let me point out the need for extreme caution in dealing with these devices.  Apart from the obvious possible danger which is presented by whatever devices may be in the taxi, there remains the possibility that this is a deliberate ploy to lure a bomb disposal team towards the vehicle.  In layman's terms it may be a &ldquo;come-on&rdquo;&mdash; to enable further devices to be triggered thereby causing possible loss of life or serious injury.  In these circumstances I trust that the reason for the delay will be understood on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would like to emphasise the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Garda have the necessary resources to enable them to prevent these occurrences where possible, and where they do occur, to enable as much co-operation as possible to be afforded to their counterparts north of the Border to enable these devices to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I know that the House will join with me in condemning such activities and in giving our full support to the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in tackling them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister appreciate that the last time I raised a question on a similar occurrence I pointed out to the House that irresponsible people who call themselves Republican IRA or Provisional IRA &mdash; let us be honest, everyone knows who they are, the dogs in the street are barking their names, they do not have to be hooded, but that is beside the point &mdash; could do this every day of the week unless there are proper security arrangements on the Lifford side of the Border?  That is glaring to any ordinary person.  We have a number of gardaí in Lifford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to appreciate that a number of gardaí in Lifford are available for extra duty but are not allowed to work overtime because <Col N="2163" /> of cutbacks.  A patrol car is often unavailable in an area right beside a military post.  Would the Minister agree that three miles up the road at Clady Bridge there is a checkpoint provided by the Garda though the volume of traffic on Lifford Bridge is much greater than on Clady Bridge?  Why is there not a checkpoint at Lifford Bridge to prevent the mischevious and outrageous conduct that is the subject of my question?</P>

      <P>There has not been a cutback in the provision.  The deployment of resources is a matter for the Commissioner, as Members on all sides of the House will recognise.  Mobile patrols and temporary checkpoints are provided, and some three sergeants, 23 gardaí, one detective sergeant and five detective gardaí, one patrol car and one Detective Branch car are stationed at Lifford.  The policy is a matter for the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána do not favour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will realise, the Minister has provided additional funds for overtime.  That provision is continued in this year's Estimates so the extra resources in that sense have been provided for the Garda.  In terms of policy the Garda, for their own operational reasons, do not favour permanent checkpoints. They have their own reasons for deciding on operational procedures.  The deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  The Government are committed to ensuring <Col N="2164" /> that the Garda have the resources they need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>At the bottom line in all this, can the Minister give the House an assurance that he will provide adequate security to ensure there is no recurrence of that outrageous behaviour?  That is the undertaking I want the Minister to give to the House, to the people of Lifford and of County Donegal generally, including the patients in Lifford hospital.  It is no good rattling off statistics which are meaningless to the people who cannot use the bridge.</P>

Ultimately jobs may depend on the reopening of this bridge.  It has been closed now for three days.  Can the Minister give an accurate prediction as to when we can expect this thoroughfare that is so important to the economic life of Donegal to be reopened?

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this disruption initially occurred on the morning of the Cardinal's funeral when the political controllers of the people responsible had the hypocrisy to attend his funeral in Armagh, and we can judge their seriousness in terms of what they stand over?

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 62, before section 59, but in Chapter VIII, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;59.&mdash;The provisions of sections 59 to section 68 inclusive shall not apply to persons whose tax liability arises under case I or case II of Schedule D.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned the debate I was dealing with pollution and the professionals, not necessarily in the same vein.  I was referring to the diagnosis of mental infirmity that would attach to any lay person who dared to have the naivete to suggest to the professionals Deputy Noonan spoke about that they should pay their fair share of tax.  I should like to repeat the point that people like doctors, barristers, solicitors, accountants and dentists do not pay their fair share of tax.  One could say, as a minimum, that they avail of every legal <Col N="2190" /> method of tax avoidance to minimise their tax liability.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult, against the background of the debate we have had about the necessity to introduce greater tax equity, to go along with the amendment that seeks to have applied to those professionals exemption from the restrictions that the Minister is introducing in respect of accelerated capital allowances. What is being sought is that these people should continue to have in their capacity as company directors, or whatever, the benefit of capital allowances.  The only restriction being suggested is that they should not have the benefit of the earlier write-off that was allowed under the accelerated capital allowances system.</P>
      <P>I suggest that those who in their corporate capacity are benefiting from the accelerated capital allowances system should not benefit in their Schedule D capacity from the elimination of this provision. It is contrary to any principle of equity that they should benefit in that way.  To suggest, for example, that lawyers ought to benefit because they decide to install a particular labour-saving device to more accurately compute their legal fees seems to me extraordinary.  Is it suggested that the PAYE worker who may consider that a personal computer would greatly assist him or her in the conduct of his or her business should get accelerated capital allowances?  A PAYE worker who invests in a personal computer does not receive a capital allowance.  If one invests in a video to keep one up to date with what is happening in the world is it suggested that that purchase should be eligible for accelerated capital allowances?  I cannot take this argument seriously.  I have every confidence in the creative accounting ability of the people to whom I refer to ensure that they will not be over-burdened by taxation.  Therefore, I do not think the amendment is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 93 deals with pollution. Anything that assists in the elimination of the scandal we witnessed last summer when our rivers and lakes were <Col N="2191" /> polluted ought to be encouraged. However, if I understand this correctly, the plant that must be invested in by farmers to deal with pollution qualifies for capital allowances in the ordinary way.  If there is one thing that is permanent here, and that is here for the long haul, it is the farmers.  They can wait for the five or seven years to benefit fully from the allowances that exist rather than getting the write-off in the first or second year.  If one looks at the other side of the balance sheet one will see that substantial grants are available from the Department of Agriculture and Food to assist in the installation of pollution control methods. The taxpayer is making a fair contribution towards assisting the farming community and encouraging their sense of social responsibility to the rest of us. Deputy Connaughton admitted that the grants package was a generous one and he welcomed it.  If it meets the rigid criteria that Deputy Connaughton would apply others should accept it as adequate. Amendment No. 93 should not be encouraged.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 91 it is presumed that the Deputy's reference to a person is intended to refer to an individual and that the intention is that the section should now apply to individuals charged under Case I or Case II of Schedule D.  Accelerated allowances are restricted for all taxpayers to 25 per cent on 1 April 1991 and to nil on 1 April 1992.  The corporation tax rate is being reduced to 40 per cent from 1 April 1991. However, the Deputy should not forget that significant reductions are also being made in income tax rates and both the top and standard rates of income tax have been reduced by 5 per cent in the last two years.  In those circumstances there is no reason not to apply the restrictions on accelerated capital allowances to individuals chargeable under Case I or Case II <Col N="2192" /> of Schedule D.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 93, I should like to point out that the tax system gives favourable treatment in the area of pollution control.  Tax relief is available by way of capital allowance for expenditure incurred on pollution and effluent control equipment and related buildings.  The relevant plant and machinery accelerated capital allowances at the normal maximum rate of up to 50 per cent can be availed of up to 1 April 1991 with the balance claimed by way of annual allowance or rates varying from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, depending on the type of plant and machinery involved.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on industrial buildings or structures and accelerated capital allowances of up to 50 per cent are similarly available with an annual allowance of 4 per cent.  Under section 26 of the Finance Act, 1978, contributions to a local authority towards the capital cost of plant or a building for the treatment of trade effluent qualify for the same capital allowances as expenditure on a company's own plant or industrial buildings; 50 per cent level of accelerated capital allowances will remain in place until 1 April 1991 and they will be at a level of 25 per cent for a full year thereafter.</P>
      <P>The normal wear and tear allowances are unaffected by the changes in this year's Bill.  This treatment is already sufficiently supportive of expenditure incurred in investment in pollution control and waste treatment.  I do not see the necessity for a long transition period in relation to accelerated capital allowances in this regard because 50 per cent is available until 1 April next year and 25 per cent after that.  The type of work to which Deputy Noonan referred to be carried out by farmers would not have a long transition time and, consequently, they can avail of the 50 per cent between now and 1 April next year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I appreciate the Minister's arguments in relation to 1991 that there is still scope in the sections.  With regard to the amendment on pollution, I am not interested in getting extra allowances for people who carry out pollution control work as they will get a grant and will still have their capital allowances.  If they carry out the work before 31 March next year they will have the grant of 50 per cent and, for another 12 months, the grant will be 25 per cent.  The people about whom I am concerned are those who will not do the work because they will not have the cash. If they were in a position to get the full write-off &mdash; or even half it &mdash; extra work would be done.  I am trying to encourage more people to clean up their act in the farmyards.  People would like to invest in plant, machinery and scrapers but they cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>Between now and Report Stage will the Minister consider allowing the 50 per cent to remain in force until 31 March 1992 for pollution related work on farmyards for those who qualify for the grants from the Department of Agriculture and Food as it would involve only a minor cost?  This would not be an ongoing commitment; the whole emphasis of the policy from the Department of Agriculture is to get it done this year and next. It is a once-off investment and there is a very strong case to be made, especially in the very limited way I suggest, for the Minister to introduce an amendment stating that for the purposes of investment and pollution control for farmers, the 50 per cent would apply to 31 March 1992 and that after that capital allowances would be claimed in the normal way but that there would be no acceleration or depreciation.  I would appreciate if the Minister would examine this.</P>

I do not even know if it is possible to do as the Deputy suggested, but I will look at this matter between now and Report Stage without commitment. It is desirable to tackle pollution but I cannot figure out why this work would not be done.  I would have thought, since 50 per cent of the cost is available, that anybody who intended to do this work would start it soon rather than putting it off to a time when the grant would be smaller.

The period is very short in relation to planning, sanction for the grant and so on.  If you extend the 50 per cent for another year and then draw the line it will encourage further anti-pollution activity.  There will be a tiny loss in terms of revenue but it would have a strong impact.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the merits of the case, there is a perception that the elimination of accelerated appreciation will have a very big impact on farmers carrying out anti-pollution work, a view put forward by the main farming organisations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 92:</P>
      <P>In page 62, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (a)  This subsection applies to a capital expenditure incurred by an employer on the provision of a nursery, crèche or other facilities for the care of children of his employees at their place of employment during the hours of such employment.</P>
      <P>(b)  Expenditure to which this subsection applies shall be regarded as an expenditure on plant provided for the purposes of the trade or profession of that employer.</P>
      <P>(c)  In this subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>`children' means children who are under five years of age;</P>
      <P>`employer' and `employee' have the same meaning as they have in the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.&rdquo;.   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides that expenditure on such a facility would be regarded as expenditure on plant provided for the purposes of the trade or profession of that employer.  The <Col N="2196" /> position, as I understand it, is that expenditure by an employer on crèche or nursery facilities for employees does not fall under any available capital allowance. The amendment would allow such expenditure to be deducted as expenditure on plant.  We have been debating the Finance Bill for two long days, this is a very reasonable amendment and I am sure the Minister will sympathise with it.  I do not know what it would cost.  I imagine the cost would be minimal.  But whatever its cost, I am sure that for very many women workers the provision of nursery and crèche facilities for the care of their children at their place of work would be a tremendous boon and would enable many to carry out their duties free from worry about their children.  This amendment could be a factor in inducing employers to provide this facility.  It has been pressed for by very many women's organisations.  I am seeking support for it across the floor.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House very long.  This is a very interesting amendment which I should like to support. There is no pre-school infrastructure in the country.  We pay a great deal of lip service to equality.  It is very difficult in any meaningful way, other than talking about it, to advance principles of equality without this kind of facility being available to parents, women in particular.  The amendment is worthwhile and would have broad, social support. Many women are still forced out of the labour force because there is no provision for child minding.  There is no pre-school structure and, notwithstanding the lifting of the bar on employment, women have to give up work, leave the workforce, because the facility for looking after children does not exist.  This would be a progressive development which would greatly encourage employers to invest in the provision of this kind of facility.  Indeed, the workforce, as a whole, would be the better for enabling women to remain in the workforce and have their children looked after.  I think it could be regarded as expenditure on plant and that the usual reliefs would apply, which would be very worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the proposed amendment is intended to extend capital allowances to créches provided by <Col N="2198" /> employers for their employees.  Section 241 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which is being amended in section 59 of this Bill, is concerned with capital expenditure on the provision of plant and machinery for the purposes of a trade.  Expenditure on crèche or nursery items which fall into the category of plant would qualify as expenditure incurred for the purposes of the trade of the employer.  Capital expenditure on durable items, such as desks, chairs and so on, would qualify for capital allowances.  Expenditure on items such as chalk, paints, crayons and the like would be deductible as a revenue expense.  I am not disposed to accepting the amendment on the grounds that it is not necessary.  It is provided for under section 241 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which is amended by section 59 of this Bill.</P>

The six categories in question are: (1) qualifying companies in the Custom House Docks area of Dublin; (2) qualifying services activities in Shannon Customs-free Airport; (3) the special building incentives under the Finance Act, 1986 for designated urban areas; (4) contracts entered into on or before 27 January, 1988, budget day; (5) projects approved for grant assistance by the industrial development agencies before 31 December 1988; and (6) machinery or plant provided for the purpose of a new hotel or hotel extension where a builidng contract was entered into on or before 31 May 1988.</P>

      <P>A number of points arise in connection with the proliferation of designated zones.  Does the Minister consider that he has a role to play in this respect or is it a matter for the Minister for the Environment?  There seems to have been a certain arbitrariness about the new areas so designated.  For example, the citizens of areas like Ronanstown and Blanchardstown are concerned that the facilities made available to Tallaght for which provision was made in the budget last year are made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt the giving of this incentive to Tallaght, and thankfully development is now well underway, is a competitive obstacle to any development taking place in Ronanstown or Blanchardstown, where similar town centres are planned and where such development is desperately needed.  The intention was that these would be three new satellite towns on the western side of the city but only in Tallaght is the projected population target of 100,000 being achieved.  It was given a belated boost by the measures announced in the budget of last year which are now coming to fruition. However, no such facilities have been made available to Clondalkin and Lucan, <Col N="2206" /> for which I am using the generic term Ronanstown, and Blanchardstown. There was great disappointment that provision was not made in this year's Finance Bill to provide such facilities in those areas.  Such a project will not be taken on by private enterprise if they are not allowed to play on a level playing pitch. Specific proposals are under consideration at Dublin County Council, who are the local authority concerned, in the context of the review of the development plan.  Can the Minister give us any indication as to whether either of these areas with projected population targets of 100,000 are being considered?</P>

    <P>In relation to the question raised by Deputy Rabbitte, it is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment. Why one place was chosen as against another is not for me to comment <Col N="2207" /> on.

      <P>It is not possible to calculate that.  Any figure I could produce would not have any real meaning because I would have to guess what sort of development would or would not take place.  In some areas in the past little or no development took place.  In other places there was quite significant development.  It is only in retrospect, when it is applied for, that one can give figures.  If my memory serves me right, the figure given at Question Time one day was £20 million or £25 million in tax foregone.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the incentives for the designated urban areas were brought in the idea was that they would be very strong tax incentives which would encourage people to develop sites which would not otherwise be developed.  It followed that the areas designated had to be quite small.  If too many acres in any town or city are designated, then the developer will build on the best sites but not on the worst.  This was a strategy to develop the worst sites; I am worried now because I think the extension is far too wide in Dublin, for example.  Several hundred acres have been designated in Dublin on both sides of the Liffey.  There is such a choice of sites there now that the better ones will be developed and there will be kind of pock-mark development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have no doubt about what I am saying.  Even in my own city, where another 40 acres have been designated, the latest extension has moved away from what I would call the &ldquo;development of the worst site&rdquo; strategy and unless the worst sites are caught and developers are encouraged to develop them, this will not work.  The only way it can work if, say, 20 acres are designated is if the whole 20 acres are developed.  If only ten or 12 acres are developed that will be fine from an economic point of view and to stimulate the building industry, but it will do very little for urban renewal.  This kind of pock mark development is not what was intended at all.  I really do not understand the situation in Dublin.  The quays should be the elegant backbone of Dublin, but they are a disaster.  The approach from Islandbridge to O'Connell Bridge and further is an absolute disgrace in any modern European city.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is but it is a frightful shambles.  I do not know what the answer is.  Widening the designation in Dublin before that spine has been dealt with will result in a transfer of resources to more desirable sites and we will be left with the backbone of the city &mdash; on the water front &mdash; in a very bad state.  If we contrast that with Paris, Florence or any of those cities where the river is the focal point of the development, we certainly have a long way to go.  This area in Dublin is an absolute disaster.  We do not have time to develop that point now but maybe we will have next week.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite <Col N="2209" /> right.  The planning authority have a very important role.  In Dublin County Council we have made our case.  The practices to date have led to the development of raw unfinished satellite towns.  There are 55,000 people in the greater Lucan-Clondalkin area and these areas are not being finished.  Vast amounts of money have been allocated for services in this area but they are lying dormant; if this area does not get services such as a town centre, there will be no further growth in residential development. Blanchardstown/Clondalkin should get favourable treatment although maybe not as favourable as Tallaght, so that we can get these satellite towns finished.  We cannot leave 100,000 people in green field sites.  I would urge the Minister to recognise these requirements and to focus on them.</P>

      <P>First I wish to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your permission to raise on the Adjournment this very important matter in my constituency, that is the closure of the Swiss Cottage in Cahir.  I must initially convey to the Minister the frustration, dismay and almost disbelief of the people not only in the town of Cahir but all over south Tipperary at the lack of access to the Swiss Cottage, not only to them but to the many tourists who visit Cahir throughout the year.</P>

    <P>On 1 September 1989 we were honoured to have the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, in our constituency to perform the official opening of the Swiss Cottage in Cahir.  On that occasion he stated how impressed he was with this splendid and magnificent building.  In particular he remarked on its rustic simplicity and its picturesque appearance. Apart from its obvious charm and enchantment it is unique of its kind in Ireland.  On that occasion, too, the Minister spoke of its tremendous potential as a tourist attraction, complementing the nearby Cahir Castle in the area.  Sadly, I regret to inform the Minister that Deputy <Col N="2213" /> Daly was one of the few who had the privilege and the opportunity to visit the cottage and experience its splendour, situated as it is in a romantic, secluded location.</P>
    <P>Since that official opening day on 1 September 1989 the Swiss Cottage has been open to the public for just two weeks, that was about eight months ago. I consider this to be a disgraceful abuse and misuse of a major tourist amenity in our area.  We in south Tipperary are determined to share this cottage with the many visitors who come to our county. Having checked with South Tipperary County Council I understand it is intended by the Office of Public Works to have the Swiss Cottage open from mid-June to September, just three months of the year, and in those three months, from Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with no bus tours allowed on Sundays and no school tours allowed at all. Compare this to Cahir Castle which is one mile upstream and which is open all year round as it should be.  Sadly the Swiss Cottage is not an isolated case in this area.  There are many such instances of major tourist attractions that are closed for the majority of the year.</P>
    <P>Are we serious about our tourist industry and its potential considering that places of such interest are not even open? Where is the logic in spending up to £300,000 in renovating, restoring and refurbishing the Swiss Cottage, accepting the generosity of an American lady called Sally Auld who was generous enough to sponsor this renovation, and then to have it locked for three quarters of the year? I must further ask &mdash; and this too is a serious question &mdash; how we can justify publicising the Swiss Cottage and other such amenities in holiday brochures and recommending it to our tourists as a place to visit when it is not even open?  I contend that there are no grounds whatsoever for treating the Swiss Cottage as a seasonal amenity.  It is as beautiful in winter as it is in summer.  It is a place where, irrespective of the weather, one could go to enjoy an afternoon.  It is absurd and bordering on the ridiculous <Col N="2214" /> to have the Swiss Cottage closed while Cahir Castle is open.</P>
    <P>Last September we in south Tipperary welcomed with enthusiasm the completion of this project because it would complement Cahir Castle.  We thought it would be a major tourist asset to Cahir and to the south of Ireland.  I am asking the Minister to make provision to have the Swiss Cottage open at the same times as Cahir Castle and to utilise both amenities to their full potential.  I visited the Swiss Cottage last Saturday, bringing some friends with me to see what I had described to them as the jewel of the south but found, to my astonishment, that it was closed.  However great my embarrassment, it was increased when a tour bus carrying 40 tourists also had to leave the cottage disappointed.  Furthermore there were other casual visitors in the area.  We all left totally frustrated and disappointed.</P>
    <P>I am sure that even the Minister is surprised and shocked that this splendid piece of architectural beauty is locked and totally inaccessible to tourists.  While I welcome the provision of guided tours during the summer, I believe the full potential of the Swiss Cottage can be achieved only by its complementing Cahir Castle as there is just one mile between them.</P>
    <P>I would also add that neither are we utilising the full potential of the Swiss Cottage.  There is a tremendous potential for a boat trip from Cahir Castle up to the Swiss Cottage and back again.  Yet this is not being utilised at present.  As well as extending the opening hours of the Swiss Cottage the Minister should provide that amenity.  This area would then be a place of interest for tourists and would attract many visitors.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue in south Tipperary. We are proud of the Swiss Cottage. We welcomed it with enthusiasm but we believe it should be open and accessible not only to tourists but to local people.  I can never understand why, in April and May such an amenity is closed when there are many family occasions, such as Confirmation days <Col N="2215" /> and first Communion days, when people have visitors to their homes and they would like to visit one of the local attractions.  We will be very disappointed if the Minister does not extend the opening hours of the Swiss Cottage to coincide with those in Cahir Castle so that we in Cahir and the surrounding areas of south Tipperary can utilise this splendid, attractive amenity of which we are very proud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> I am glad that this matter was raised.  I thank Deputy Ahearn for her commitment and very wise suggestions which I will gladly bring to the attention of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Daly.  I welcome this opportunity to discuss the opening arrangements in respect of the Swiss Cottage in Cahir, County Tipperary.  As the House may know, the Swiss Cottage was opened to the public on 1 September 1989 on completion of the restoration works which were largely funded by the Court Royal Foundation.  This was done with a view to facilitating visitors before the end of the tourist season.  An opening period of two weeks was envisaged but this was extended until Sunday, 24 September 1989.  A notice to this effect was printed in a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>It is the practice of the Office of Public Works to close all but a small number of national monument sites during the winter months.  In relation to the Swiss Cottage, arrangements could be made for groups to visit the site during the off season if they contacted the caretaker, well in advance of their proposed tour. The suggestion made by Deputy Ahearn that groups, for example, Confirmation day groups, be facilitated in the offseason can be met by giving notice to the caretaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the 1990 summer season.  The guide information officers <Col N="2216" /> for the Swiss Cottage will attend a full training programme in the next few days. The cottage will then open to the public with a full guide information service from the bank holiday weekend of 2 June 1990. The site will remain open until late September. I should point out, however, that the cottage will be open from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. from Tuesday to Sunday, inclusive.  The cottage will be closed on Mondays, except for bank holidays.  The reason for the closure on Mondays is to allow necessary light maintenance works and cleaning duties to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I also want to inform the Deputy that the Office of Public Works are investigating the possibility of a weekend service for the period late September until early November.  The points raised by the Deputy are being investigated.  I am conscious of the demand for the service and for the extended opening hours.  I assure the Deputy that the points she has raised will be brought to the attention of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Daly. I hope he can accede to the Deputy's requests.  They will be considered very carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the resale of Carysfort College which is of great importance to my constituency, especially to the Blackrock area.  When Carysfort College was first put on the market last summer I asked the Minister for Education to ensure that the college be kept in public educational use I specifically suggested that Carysfort should be the location for the long-promised DunáLaoghaire RTC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of an Adjournment debate here on 20 July 1989 the Minister undertook to reopen discussions between senior officials of her Department and <Col N="2217" /> the Sisters of Mercy Order and to keep local Deputies informed of progress.  I regret that the Minister did not succeed in keeping Carysfort for the public and that she used the excuse of a third party legal case to deny to me information about progress on the discussions.  As we now know, Carysfort was sold.  The Minister, instead of securing it for the State and for the future, settled for less than adequate compensation for the taxpayers' investment in the college. Indeed, the amount recovered was in real terms about one-fifth only of the real value of the investment.  Since then, the new owners have obtained outline planning permission for 550 houses in Carysfort grounds and have put the college and approximately 20 acres back on the market.  Reports in a number of newspapers suggest that the sale is about to be completed.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a case to the Minister for Education that she purchase the college and the 20 acres and that she should further consider purchasing as much of the remainder of Carysfort park as comes back on the market.  I have three main reasons for my request.  First, there is widespread concern in Blackrock at the environmental impact of another 500 to 600 houses in an already densely populated area.  Such a large scale development will place an intolerable burden on the already over-used roads, sanitary services and schools in the area. The problem for the planning authority is that in the seventies, for reasons which I cannot understand, Carysfort park was zoned for housing.  Notwithstanding the current appeal to An Bord Pleanála it is virtually certain that planning permission will eventually be granted for some kind of housing development in Carysfort park.  The only way this can be reduced or avoided is by the State purchasing as much of the property as possible.</P>
    <P>Second, the needs of the people of Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire will not be <Col N="2218" /> met by another up market housing development but rather by open space recreational facilities.  Only today I heard of yet another football club in the Blackrock area which cannot be allocated a playing pitch because there is no ground available. There is a critical shortage of outdoor playing facilities for sports clubs, expecially for girls' clubs.  It would be a great shame to see Carysfort park covered in concrete when there is such a need.  It has been described as the last green lung in Blackrock; build on it and it will be green no more.</P>
    <P>In the past few years all the big green spaces in Blackrock, St. Helen's in Booterstown, the Dominican lands and now Carysfort, have been bought up for development.  All this will choke Blackrock with additional houses and traffic. Carysfort, or at least part of it, can still be saved but only if the Minister acts quickly.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we need additional third level places for our young people.  All the reports from the HEA and other bodies show that there is a critical shortage of third level places in Dublin and especially for non-university courses.  This is what contributes to inequality in education and to discrimination against the children of PAYE workers and low income families whose taxes are paying for the education service in the first place.  Dún Laoghaire has been promised a regional technical college but the plans for a Dún Laoghaire RTC are covered in dust in the Minister's office.  Carysfort provides the Minister with a readymade facility which, with adaptation, could become the Dún Laoghaire RTC.</P>
    <P>There is now some talk of a private educational concern acquiring Carysfort. Today it is reported that an Opus Dei-backed foundation may acquire the property. While a private college would keep Carysfort in education, it will be a poor comfort to the many young people from Dún Laoghaire, south Dublin and north Wicklow who would never be able to afford its exclusive fees and who are <Col N="2219" /> denied educational opportunity because there are no places.  The Minister on 22 July expressed her wish that Carysfort be kept in public education.</P>
    <P>The Government have already failed Carysfort twice, first by allowing it to close and, second, by allowing it to be sold.  Please do not fail Carysfort a third time.  Do not miss the opportunity to buy the college and grounds.</P>
    <P>I see in a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the developers, Devmac, have already given the Minister an opportunity to acquire the building and 20 acres at terms which they describe as favourable.  I appreciate that to purchase Carysfort is now an expensive option but only because the Government have failed twice to save it for public interest and have allowed it to be exploited for private speculative gain.  It is very easy to point out that because of stretched public finances we cannot afford to buy Carysfort, but can the Government afford not to buy it?</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply to my Dáil Question on Thursday last gives me little cause for optimism.  She effectively said she will wait until Carysfort is sold, until there is another private interest involved, before she does anything about it.  It will be too late then.  Unless the State buys Carysfort &mdash; some of it is now on the market and on offer to the Minister &mdash; Carysfort College will not be a public educational facility, Carysfort park will become grey with houses within five years and Blackrock will be choked with the additional traffic which will be generated.</P>
    <P>I am making this final appeal to the Minister.  Do not let Carysfort sink for a third time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, and I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising the matter.  I had an informal discussion with him this morning and made sure he was aware I wished to answer the matter in the Dáil myself.  He raised several issues.  Let me <Col N="2220" /> lay some of them to rest immediately because, though put forward with great integrity, they are based on misconceptions.</P>
      <P>First the Deputy questioned the right of the Sisters of Mercy to sell their own property &mdash; he did not say so openly but that was implied.  I would like to put on the record of the House that of course it was the private property of the sisters. Last summer my concern was that I would guarantee the State interest in that property, which we did with quite a struggle and the Deputy played his part in that as did other Deputies in the House when I highlighted the issue here.  Eventually a valuation to safeguard the State's interest in it was agreed and that sum of money will be conveyed to the Department of Education in July when the sisters leave the property.  The amount has been publicly declared and was arrived at by common consent.  I do not deny that there was quite a bother, so to speak, to get it, and it required discussions, sometimes heightened, in public to bring about an amicable solution.  However, in the end we were all in agreement and I thank the nuns for the ending of that phase.</P>
      <P>The second question is about the wider ownership of the Carysfort land.  With naivety or, if I may say so, a pretence of naiety, the Deputy asked me to ask the Government to purchase the whole area which is zoned for housing.  I put it to Deputy Gilmore that Dún Laoghaire Corporation have agreed to the plan for housing, and that it was open to them to alter their development plan materially if they so wished&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to preserve the land.  The public representatives of Dún Laoghaire agreed to the planning of 500 houses.  To bring that to the door of my Department and to tell them to undo what was done by Dún Laoghaire Corporation is nave in the extreme.  I suggest <Col N="2221" /> that is a matter for which the local authority members and executive of Dún Laoghaire Corporation have shouldered responsibility.  Whether we agree with their decision is another matter.  They saw fit at a properly convened, statutory meeting to take that decision.  There is an appeal against it by An Bord Pleanála and the Deputy has admitted that that appeal would really have not much basis because the area was zoned for housing in the seventies.  Be that as it may, it is disingenuous in the extreme to put forward that the Department of Education should now foot the bill for a planning decision made by Dún Laoghaire Corporation to allow 500 houses to be built.  That disposes of the second issue.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record the commitment of the Mercy Order to the training of teachers over so many years.  The benefit of their work will extend into the next century.  We are inclined to overlook that and to consider that they have been the only gainers.  The country and the world have gained through the training of so many fine primary teachers by the nuns who gave up their lives and, in many cases, their salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third issue is that of the buildings and the surrounding 20 acres which the Deputy said, rightly, were the subject of discussion between my Department and, first, the convent authorities and, later, the group who took over the whole enterprise.  Last autumn a group of technical people from my Department examined it in the light of the proposal to have an RTC located on that site.  I have stated publicly the technical advice given to me and on which I place reliance because in technical matters one has to take account of the expertise of the people involved.  It was to the effect that most of that building was not at present suitable for, nor would it be amenable to conversion to a regional college, that because of its nature a regional college requires rooms of particular sizes which must be adapted to technical equipment, heavy equipment and so on.  All of the older building and <Col N="2222" /> much of what would be termed the newer type building would not be suitable for that.  That was the basis of the plea from Deputy Gilmore and other Deputies.  I want to commend Deputy Brian Hillery who met with me repeatedly in regard to Dún Laoghaire education requirements, and Deputies Andrews, Monica Barnes and Seán Barrett, who all joined here one evening in a common debate on the subject.</P>
    <P>The question arose: what was to be done with the property?  There is an ongoing need for third level places and for accommodation for all sorts of activities. I take the point the Deputy made about the need for Dublin and greater Dublin, which have the second lowest participation in third level education, to get more third level places.  That is borne out by Clancy's report which is there for all to see.  Sometimes I have little patience with other areas who come in with demands for third level educational facilities when I know the Dublin area has the least participation in that regard.  On that basis we instituted the college at Tallaght. It was serving a population need.  Third level educational needs in Dún Laoghaire were evidenced in the earlier decision to build an RTC on the Carriglea site.  The site was purchased and then the College of Art was established.  The general third-level needs of the greater Dublin area have been kept under constant review, though the Government coming in in 1987 took a decision to defer the provision of further third level places pending the interdepartmental report which is nearing completion now.  In tandem with those decisions, we have always kept an eye on third level needs throughout the country.  The Clancy report, my thoughts on the matter and the Government decision arising out of all that led to the establishment of the Tallaght college and its building has commenced.  The College of Art, the very fine and exciting development there in the School of Animation and the Ballyfermot centre have all rightly achieved very favourable notice <Col N="2223" /> and hold out great promise for future employment for creative young people.</P>
    <P>Currently talks are in progress, I understand, between the owner of the whole property and sub-sets who wish to purchase the school properties, the training properties and the surrounding 20 acres for use as education-training development.  I assure the Deputy and the House that, while I am not formally involved in those talks, I am informally kept informed about what is happening. It might be said I have my eye very much on the matter.  That is against the background that the college would not be suitable for conversion to an RTC and my wish to keep in mind the third level needs of the country and the Dublin and greater Dublin area in particular.</P>
    <P>I understand that the report in the <Col N="2224" /> newspapers this morning suggests that a particular group have bought the property but that is not true.  Matters should reach a conclusion within the next couple of weeks when I expect there will be a wider and more open debate on the issue.</P>
    <P>To sum up, Dún Laoghaire Corporation have given their assent to the building of 500 houses, the religious order will repay to the State in July the amount of money and the buildings cannot be easily converted to a regional college. I accept the points made by Deputies Gilmore, Hillery, Andrews and others that there is need for a critical look at the provision of third level places in Dún Laoghaire but that is a wider issue and a matter for further debate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 May 1990.</P>

Five were imported animals and our investigations into the remainder suggest an association with imported meat and bone meal.  Prompt and effective action was taken to deal with the problem. The disease is a notifiable one and affected or suspected animals are slaughtered immediately and their carcases destroyed.  Routine monitoring is carried out at our meat plants and suspected cases are referred for diagnosis.  In all instances, that diagnosis has yielded negative results.

      <P>In evaluating this expenditure account must be taken of the essential role of the TB eradication scheme in preserving market outlets for livestock and livestock products and of the effects on productivity in agriculture of the removal of tens of thousands of diseased animals together with the prevention of disease spread.  On that basis the expenditure I believe has been necessary and worthwhile.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have ERAD amend a present aspect of the TB eradication scheme whereby cattle whose tags are lost in the transporting of them from the farm yard to the factory are not being slaughtered and are sent back to the farm, thereby restricting that herd until there are two clear subsequent tests even though those cattle may have had a clear test a short time before being brought for slaughter; if he agrees that it would be more appropriate that the cattle be slaughtered and await inspection for lesions after slaughter, or, alternatively, that arrangements be made for retagging within the factory premises before such cattle are slaughtered, given that the factory premises are regarded as a restricted area under the regulations.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the director of ERAD that the provisions governing cattle arriving at meat factories without ear-tags are essential elements in the disease eradication programme. Since the initiation of these procedures in March 1989 the number of animals without ear-tags being presented at meat plants has been reduced to minimal levels.  In order to accommodate herd-owners to the greatest extent possible ERAD have recently introduced arrangements for the recognition of secondary identification in cases where the second identification has been correlated to the scheme tag by a veterinary surgeon and the DVO notified accordingly before the animal is moved out of the holding.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be <Col N="2176" /> aware, the Common Agricultural Policy aims to ensure both a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and that food supplies should reach consumers at reasonable prices.  I am extremely conscious of the need to reconcile these aims to the maximum extent and have thus been prepared to accept changes in the CAP designed to ensure better market orientation, provided these changes are balanced by measures to safeguard rural incomes.  Primary responsibility for the tabling of proposals relating to guaranteed prices under the CAP, is, however, a matter for the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>EC institutional support prices for agricultural products have, generally speaking, not increased since 1984.  In Ireland's case, of course, some element of farm price increase has resulted from &ldquo;green&rdquo; currency adjustments.  Over recent years, however, these adjustments have tended to be modest and have had a far less than proportionate impact on consumer prices.  Accordingly, increases in food prices are not out of line with the general rate of increase in the consumer price index.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply on 1 May 1990 to the Deputy's question concerning the purchase price of the site, £3 million is being provided via the Exchequer and the Structural Funds for the construction, fitting out, etc. of CERT's new headquarters and training centre.

      <P>An underlying principle of the social insurance scheme is that, to establish entitlement to benefit, persons must have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for a certain length of time.  The requirement in the case of treatment benefits, for persons aged 23 years, or over, is a minimum of 208 weeks.</P>
      <P>However, recognising that younger claimants may have only recently entered insurable employment, persons under 23 years require only 39 weeks contributions to qualify for benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned had reached 23 years of age before making his claim for dental benefit on 14 February 1990.  He did not have the required number of <Col N="2179" /> PRSI contributions at that time and his claim could not, therefore, be approved.</P>
    <P>Any changes in the current conditions for receipt of treatment benefits involving an improvement in the scheme would have financial implications and is a matter for consideration in future budgets.</P>

      <P>The number of those who are actually in receipt of a payment is not readily available by employment exchange. However, the number in payment would normally amount to approximately 95 per cent of the numbers signing on the live register.  Similarly, the number of long-term recipients of unemployment assistance at each employment exchange is not readily available.  Approximately 80 per cent of all unemployment assistance recipients are long-term recipients.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for undertaking any works on the network of non-national roads, including the provision of the necessary finance, is primarily a matter for the local authorities.  County councils may use the discretionary grants for non-national roads paid by my Department to supplement expenditure from their own resources on regional and county roads. The discretionary block grants, apart from those for Dublin County Council, have been allocated strictly in proportion to the mileage of regional and county roads in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 State road grants for Westmeath County Council amount to £11,161,000.  The provision comprises £9,746,000 for national roads, and <Col N="2186" /> £1,415,000 for regional and county roads, including discretionary block grants amounting to £1,345,000, a regional road bridge strengthening grant of £20,000 and a discretionary grant of £50,000 for the repair of damage caused to public roads and bridges/culverts during the severe storms and flooding in February this year. Altogether, the 1990 discretionary grants to the local authority represent an increase of 41 per cent on the level of equivalent grants to the local authority for 1989.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Westmeath County Council have received their fair share of the funds available to me for road grants in 1990.  The 1990 road grant provisions have been fully allocated and there are no funds available at this time for additional road grants.</P>

    <P>I am aware that there are equipment requirements at Mallow General Hospital. In this regard I would like to point out that I am at present preparing a five year capital programme, the main objectives of which will be to ensure that the physical infrastructure is in place to meet the service goals which we have set ourselves while ensuring that the fabric of existing services is maintained.  The position in relation to Mallow General Hospital will be considered in this context having regard to the many competing <Col N="2187" /> demands and the priority requirements of other hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the absence of specific X-ray equipment at Mallow arrangements had been made with other hospitals within the Southern Health Board area to cater for patients referred from Mallow.  The Southern Health Board are now reviewing the situation with a view to ensuring that the arrangements are adequate for patients requiring X-ray screening.</P>
