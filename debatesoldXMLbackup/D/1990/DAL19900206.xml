      <P>The person referred to employed by my Department is appointed on the standard contract that he may not engage in private practice or be involved with any outside business which would interfere with the performance of his services as Press Officer. Neither he nor any other such person, therefore, is debarred from private work provided it is done in his own time and does not interfere with his services as Press Officer.</P>

      <P>May I express some surprise at the response given by the Taoiseach to my question?  When I asked a supplementary to a question asked by Deputy Dukes last week the Taoiseach informed me that this contract was exclusive and that the person employed is employed exclusively by the Government. However, the Taoiseach is now telling us that this person can do other work.  It is my understanding that the sum of money provided in the Estimates for this new office, including the person I am asking about, is in the region of £500,000. Can the Taoiseach tell us what amount of money this person is getting for the six months?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. The cost of employing the additional press officers is, I think, about £175,000, but I will check that for the Deputy.  I will also check what exactly the individual referred to is getting.  However the Deputy should know from his own knowledge <Col N="592" /> that, traditionally, persons employed in the public service, provided their other activities do not interfere with their public duties, have been entitled to engage in those other activities.  Some of the best literature in this country has been produced by civil servants, as the Deputy well knows.</P>

I ask the Taoiseach again to tell us exactly how much money the person in question is getting for his six months part time employment.  Second, is there not a danger of this person being paid twice as I assume there will be little difference between the memoranda that will be submitted to the Taoiseach and what we read on a regular basis in <i>The Kerryman</i> for whom this man is a columnist. I assume he is being paid by Independent Newspapers for his fortnightly contributions.  Is there not a danger that he will be paid by the State for the same contributions?</P>

      <P>There is a fundamental misconception in what the Deputy is saying.  This skilled journalist is not being employed in my interest.  He is being employed in order to service a media corp of 1,500 persons for the duration of our Presidency.  We are providing to the best of our ability a skeleton service in an endeavour to meet all the enormous demands of the world press arising out of our Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the Council of Ministers has its own press service which serves every Presidency and is extremely competent? Therefore would he tell me why the Irish Presidency needs to have a special press officer seconded in Brussels and another one, the man to whom we are referring, in Strasbourg, in view of the fact that there is constant traffic between those two cities?  In other words, why do we need two separate press officers on the Irish Government's payroll in view of the fact that the Council of Ministers already has more than adequate media facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the services provided by the Council of Ministers.  Every Presidency provides, of necessity, additional facilities to cope with the requirements of the world press during the tenure of the Presidency.  I <Col N="594" /> have already explained to the House that when I was in Paris for the special Summit meeting called by President Mitterrand just before Christmas, I got some idea of the enormous demands made on the Presidency for the time being by the world press.  As I said already, there were 1,500 journalists there.  I know that the French Presidency, even though they normally would have enormous media resources at their disposal, extended those facilities during the course of their Presidency.  So far as I know, every EC country by force of circumstances, has to provide additional press facilities during the course of its Presidency.  I cannot understand what objection there can be, for a limited period of six months, to providing in two key centres, Strasbourg and Brussels, additional press facilities to enable us to respond in as satisfactory a way as possible to the innumerable requests which arise during the course of the Presidency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Apprentices in the Permanent Defence Force are required to live in barracks and due to the lack of suitable accommodation it has not been found possible to date to provide for an intake of female apprentices.</P>
      <P>Since 1980 a total of 28 female cadets, 40 female recruits and nine specialist or technical officers were recruited to the Defence Forces.  A further intake of about 30 female recruits will be enlisted in the near future.</P>
      <P>A reply has been issued to the Employment Agency in relation to recent representations received from them.</P>
      <P>I am agreeable in principle to the recruitment of female apprentices and it is my intention that when a competition for apprentices is next advertised it will provide for an intake of women.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Defence is well aware, we are in the era of equal opportunities employers.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is a favourable answer, that this is now being done and when this is done it will mean the whole range of employment within the Defence Forces will be open to females. This was the only outstanding one with regard to apprentices.  The accommodation is now being made available. When the next competition takes place the advertisement will seek applications from female applicants and the matter will proceed from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 43 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to similar questions on 22 November 1989, preparations are being made for the establishment of a new structure in the Defence Forces for ongoing consultations and information on remuneration and related matters.</P>
      <P>Last July, as announced at the time by the Taoiseach, I instructed the Chief of Staff to make preparations for the establishment of the new structure.  The relevant studies which have since been taking place include consultation with personnel throughout the Permanent Defence Force.  The proposals submitted by the individual NCOs and privates last year through the Chief of Staff are being taken into account in the examination of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with my instructions to the Chief of Staff, an examination of the position in other countries is being carried out.  Information has been obtained in relation to a number of <Col N="602" /> countries and three countries &mdash; Britain, Denmark and Italy &mdash; have been visited.</P>
    <P>I personally met the members of the three teams which were assembled for the purposes of the independent Pay Commission and advised them that there would be consultation with them and with military personnel generally in regard to the proposed new representative structure.</P>
    <P>Subsequently outline proposals were circulated to the teams and members of the Permanent Defence Force generally and the comments thereon are now being assembled by the military authorities.</P>
    <P>In general terms, what is visualised is that representative groups will be established on the basis of elections by secret ballot.  This in itself would be a major and fundamental development and is the essence of the new system which is contemplated. The representative groups will be able to submit proposals direct to a process of independent adjudication which will be provided to deal with such proposals.  The representative groups will also be able to make submissions in regard to other conditions of service excluding such matters as discipline, operations, command and organisation.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the submissions by military personnel to the independent Pay Commission, separate groups &mdash; one each for privates, non-commissioned officers and officers &mdash; may be the appropriate mechanism rather than one group for all ranks.  While there may be something to be said in the interest of cohesion for one group, on balance and for the sake of not giving rise to the perception that senior rank is being used to the disadvantage or detriment of lower rank, three separate groups &mdash; in the first instance at any rate &mdash; are indicated.  This is particularly important in an organisation where rank and hierarchy are vital characteristics.</P>
    <P>In the nature of things, the representative groups would be unassociated with any body outside the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The proposals which I have outlined comprehend the essentials of whatever scheme is put in place.  It is important that the House should be satisfied that the <Col N="603" /> proposed arrangements strike the correct balance between giving the members of the Permanent Defence Force a clear voice in pay etc. matters on the one hand and, at the same time, maintaining proper controls in the operational and command areas; there must be no erosion of the essential integrity of the force.  In that connection it is important that no steps should be taken which would, in effect, be seen to pre-empt the decision of the authorities &mdash; civil and military: that situation could not be accepted.</P>
    <P>I expect to be submitting the matter to Government shortly with a view to having suitable proposals brought before the House when Deputies will have a full opportunity to debate this very important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information given in the reply. However, is he not aware that the people responsible for the setting up of the PDFORRA have been extremely careful not to breach any Army regulation or any constitutional provision?  In view of the fact that 8,000 people have joined this organisation, does he not think he should afford it recognition now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention &mdash; and I have to watch this carefully &mdash; of pre-empting the democratic decision that would be taken by members of the force. I think it is very important that we first set up electoral procedures that are satisfactory, allow the elections to take place on a democratic basis, await the outcome from which will emerge the appropriate representative body or bodies which will fit into the mechanism I envisage.  This will all form part of a Bill which I hope to have before the House very shortly and which will be debated in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want a plethora of such bodies.  We want to establish by way of legislation and regulation a procedure that allows for the establishment of representative bodies that are truly representative of the force.  The body, or bodies depending on variations with regard to rank, will be representative of <Col N="604" /> the force as a whole.  Its officers will be elected democratically, the body or bodies will operate as a permanent organisation which will deal with a variety of matters which it is envisaged it should be associated with, welfare, credit facilities apart from pay and conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us he has had consultations on this with members of the Defence Force.  Is the Minister not aware that the only consultation which took place was the circulation of a document, on which various members of the force were asked to comment, that they were not entitled to give opinions on matters outside the scope of the document, and that that type of consultation is, quite frankly, a farce.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with that. As I said in my statement, I personally met and addressed the members of all three teams after they had made their submissions to the commission which was examining Army pay structure.  I told them that the next step is what we are talking about now &mdash; the establishment of a representative structure or structures. The Army will be submitting their final recommendation, which I am expecting in the next couple of days, and there will be further discussion.  I will then come to this House and we can debate the matter fully.  That is the way to proceed.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that morale will remain low until the problems in the force are resolved?  While I acknowledge some progress has been made, I suggest that the Minister should state he would meet with those who have already signed up and joined the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association.  The Minister should try to get them involved at this stage so that at the end of the day the Bill before the House will reflect the representative view of Army personnel. I think this is the way to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I have met the representative groups from the various ranks who went before the Gleeson Commission on Pay and spoke to them about this aspect. Very shortly, I will receive a document from the Army in regard to this matter after they have had discussions within their ranks.  They will then have democratic elections.  I do not want to pre-empt the results of their elections.  Once we devise a democratic structure within which the various tiers of the Defence Force &mdash; the three I have already mentioned &mdash; go through the democratic process of electing their representatives we can then proceed to do business.  The legislation will go through the House side-by-side with this process and this will be of enormous benefit to the body or bodies that will emerge from the democratic process and which will be legitimised by regulations and legislation. They will also be legitimised by the process of election among the men but that has not happened yet.</P>

      <P>What the Minister has told us is that it is his intention to impose a structure on the Army who have decided that the best method to proceed is along the lines of the PDFORRA &mdash; the organisation which they had set up themselves. Let me ask the Minister a key question; will the organisation which he will set up be an internal organisation or an independent organisation?  In other words, will it be funded by the members' own contributions or will the Army insist on funding it and keeping control over it?</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy's suggestion because we have been very helpful in keeping him <Col N="606" /> informed.  I am not setting up any organisation. The House will debate new legislation which will enable the men to set up their own organisation through an electoral procedure.  I am not going to impose any form of organisation on the Defence Force or the personnel of the Defence Force; let the Deputy focus on that.</P>

I am not pre-empting any such circumstances.  I would be pre-empting the position by allowing this, that or the other organisation to be regarded as the organisation speaking for the men or for the various ranks.  What I am doing is setting up a clear-cut democratic procedure under which the men will elect their own structure or structures with which I will then proceed to deal.  But we have got it the wrong way round.  We must first allow the men to choose their representative body.</P>

      <P>If PDFORRA represent the sort of numbers the Deputy is talking about.  The Deputy should not be chasing labels but, if they have the numbers the Deputy suggests, they will fill these posts. Whoever is elected through the democratic procedures agreed will automatically form the new organisations with which the Government and I as Minister for Defence, will be very pleased to deal.  It is very clear-cut.  The Deputy should not be looking for difficulties that do not exist.  I was more than anxious to get this finally settled so that this will never recur as far as all future Governments are concerned and so that there will be a clearly elected representative body or bodies with whom ongoing Ministers for Defence can deal on a sensible, rational basis.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in the first two parts of the question is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to non-commissioned personnel Defence Force Regulations provide for continuance in service after age 60, subject to medical suitability, for a period not exceeding one year so as to permit of 21 years' qualifying service for <Col N="608" /> pension purposes.  A man who wishes to be retained in service is required to submit an application for retention to the Adjutant-General.  Normally there are no changes in the duties of personnel so retained.</P>
    <P>Any officer who wishes to be considered for retention in service beyond the normal retirement age for his rank may submit an application in the matter. Approval is granted in the case of officers who are selected by the Chief of Staff to fill specific appointments and in regard to whom the Minister for Defence is satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the service if they continued to serve beyond the ages prescribed in regulations for retirement.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, as one of a number of urgent measures to conserve the numerical strength of the Permanent Defence Force, and in the context of a shortage of Junior Officers, Defence Force Regulations were made which permit that line Commandants and Captains may be retained in service up to 60 years of age. Commandants and Captains retained under this scheme fill administrative appointments appropriate to the ranks of Captain and Lieutenant, respectively, so that Junior Officers filling designated administrative appointments can be released for operational duties.</P>
    <P>The position of line Lieutenant-Colonels was also reviewed against the background of a much-expanded Permanent Defence Force and new operational requirements of the Defence Forces.  As a result of this review Defence Force Regulations were made which permit the retention in service of Lieu-tenant-Colonels up to 60 years of age. Lieutenant-Colonels retained under this scheme fill temporary appointments supernumerary to establishments. Following is the statement:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Retirement ages for members of the Permanent Defence Force</P>
    <P>Part I</P>
    <P>Defence Force Regulations prescribe that the normal retirement ages for members of the Permanent Defence Force shall be as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 31 together.  As Ireland is not a member of any military alliance the question of security co-operation between the Defence Forces and the armed forces of other European States does not arise.</P>
      <P>However, Ireland has, for a number of years been a participant in the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe &mdash; known as the CSCE &mdash; which seeks to achieve more stable and secure relations between the 35 member states. Within the framework of that conference, Ireland is currently a participant in the negotiations on confidence and security building measures which opened in Vienna in March 1989.  As part of this process officers of the Defence Forces attend as observers at military exercises conducted in various States in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Chief of Staff participated in the Seminar on Military Doctrines held recently in Vienna.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is a difference here.  This is the Helsinki process, as it is known in Europe, which embraces all states of Europe under the umbrella of this Vienna conference now meeting and which met previously in Madrid, Stockholm, Belgrade and Helsinki itself.  This conference embraces all countries from the Atlantic to the Urals.  The USSR take part in it as well as all the Eastern European countries in addition to <Col N="613" /> Canada and the United States.  This conference is engaged in the whole process of <i>détente</i>, of reducing arms, of building up confidence measures such as human rights, economic co-operation democratisation and so on, all of which aspects are brought together at this Vienna Conference. Indeed events over the past six months in central and Eastern Europe have made this conference very relevant. This conference will provide the framework &mdash; and this is what Gorbachev and Mitterrand are currently talking about &mdash; within which a confederation of all the states of Europe will be able to participate in very useful measures of co-operation for the future, bringing the type of peace desirable in Europe as a whole.  It is within that framework I am talking.  In my view it is an important one now and will be in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  None of the areas mentioned by the Deputy comes within the ambit of our participation within this process.  Our participation is geared primarily to the establishment of con-fidence-building measures, the ways of investigating and monitoring arms reductions and what procedures should be adopted to ensure that everything is done by each country in accordance with decisions made at the conference.  In that context of course it is necessary that we have some knowledge of what is taking place and it is in that context also that our Army personnel attend the particular committee that is concerned with confidence and security-building measures. We do not attend another committee which is meeting at the same time and which is concerned with the direct armaments aspects but we are on the committee that is concerned with the <Col N="614" /> investigating and monitoring of the disarmament and the arms reduction proposals. This is an important committee in which we have an input.  Disarmament has always been a very strong international commitment of ours and we have always played this role within CSCE since the signing of the Helsinki Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is entirely concerned with setting up particular inspectorial procedures that can home in on commitments that are made in the course of the negotiations as to, for instance, the reduction of a particular type of weaponry. It is important that that commitment is made and observed and that procedures are established whereby a satisfactory process of investigation is instituted.  It is in that inspectorial area of making disarmament and arms reduction measures effective that we are primarily concerned.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for the name of this process that was established in Helsinki in the mid-seventies.  It is called the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and has been operating in various states of activity since then.  It has now been given a new lease of life, as it were, by reason of events that have made it very relevant at present.  I can assure the Deputy that the <Col N="615" /> Irish contribution is solely on concentration on this investigative and monitoring aspect.  We are in no way concerned with the actual practical requirements of scaling down.  That is outside our ambit and is a matter for the two defence organisations concerned. What we want to ensure is that when the member countries of these two defence organisations make commitments, they are observed and that we have effective disarmament and arms reduction.</P>

      <P>Superannuation benefits are granted to retiring officers of the Permanent Defence Force under the provisions of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, 1937 to 1989, made under the authority of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1975.</P>
      <P>The schemes are a distinct superannuation code designed to cater for the special requirements of the Defence Forces and are quite different from the codes applicable in other areas of the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the schemes, pensions for officers are not directly pay-related as such but rather are based on rank or appointment held on retirement, length of service in rank or appointment and overall length of service.  Maximum pension can be attained well before an officer reaches normal retiring age and generally represents 50 per cent of the maximum pay for the rank in which the officer retires. <Col N="621" /> In addition to pension, an officer retiring on age grounds or within two years of retiring age qualifies for a gratuity of one-and-a-half times his annual pay at retirement.  Lesser gratuities are payable to officers with not less than five year's service.</P>

      <Quest>the number of arrests made by the Irish Naval Service of vessels breaching fisheries regulations for each of the last five years; if he is satisfied that the trend disclosed is an accurate reflection of the effectiveness of fishery protection methods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of arrests made by the Irish Naval Service of vessels breaching fisheries regulations for the past five years is as follows: 1985, 67; 1986, 51; 1987, 70; 1988, 89; 1989, 57.</P>
      <P>During the year 1988, Naval Service vessels steamed a total of 100,611 nautical miles and spent 933 days on patrol. The corresponding figures for 1989 are 108,345 nautical miles and 1,034 days respectively.  In other words, patrolling increased by about 11 per cent.</P>
      <P>The disparity in the number of arrests in 1989, as compared with 1988, was not as a result of a reduction in days spent on patrol but more so of an awareness by foreign fishing vessels of the Naval Service's presence in the Irish Economic Exclusion Zone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a decrease as a result of the deterrent caused by the active presence of our naval vessels.  The big problem in recent years has been to build up an awareness of this presence.  Traditionally Spanish fishermen have fished heavily in this area and since they became full members of the EC their fishing has been cut drastically by quota arrangements.  It has taken a few years to get Spanish fishermen and the Spanish authorities to recognise that these fishing grounds are no longer open to them and that they are regulated by Community quota.  For all the reasons outlined, there is greater observance of the limits and there is greater adherence to the quota system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to say that there has been a decrease in the number of foreign vessels in Irish fishing waters or to say that, apart from arrests, a great number of foreign vessels took flight at the sight of Irish vessels, or to say simply that practically no foreign vessels entered Irish fishing waters?  Which is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Spain became a full member of the Community &mdash; and they accounted for the overwhelming number of foreign fishing vessels in our waters &mdash; and because of the increased enforcement by the Irish Navy and the British protection service where it obtains, there has been a substantial reduction in the Spanish fishing effort. When the Deputy is talking about foreign vessels he is mainly talking about his friends, the Spaniards.  I know the Deputy is a great romantic follower of the Latin ethos but when we are talking in this context we are talking about the Spanish fishing effort in waters adjacent to our coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the Minister's remark, and I am glad to know that the world's eyes that are on the Irish Presidency, for example, <Col N="623" /> include the Spanish speaking people.  I am sure that they are in a frenzy since we assumed Presidency of the Community. I will put my question to the Minister again.  Is he in a position to communicate to those Deputies concerned, particularly to those interested in the Irish fishing industry, if there is statistical evidence available to support his statement to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, but it is not easy statistical evidence to get because we are talking about landings that take place primarily in Spain from Spanish vessels moving from our waters.  On the advice I have and on observation, there has been a substantial curtailment of the Spanish fishing effort.  They are now circumscribed by quota arrangements and a European Community regime and they are further curtailed by the presence of our ships and those of the UK.  If one goes through the figures, it is obvious that most of the boats arrested have been Spanish.  All this adds to a deterrent aspect and, with a greater effort on the part of the Irish protection service, it is clear that the deterrent is beginning to bite with the result that the Spanish are now observing the fishery regime of the Community.  They are now responding to the strong presence of Irish protection vessels in the area which show no compunction about arresting Spanish vessels if they are caught fishing illegally in the area.</P>

At that time we did not have sufficient personnel but we are now recruiting extra men and the two new boats, as well as the other seven, will be operational in about a month.  We will also have air back-up when we receive EC funds for helicopters which will enable us to sweep the whole area and maintain contact with the vessels.  Air back-up is very important because a very wide area of sea is involved.  It means that foreign vessels fishing can be identified far more clearly and the information relayed to boats in the area.  We can never be complacent in this respect, there were several inadequacies last year and we are trying to remedy them.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you raised this matter in May 1966 and it did not have the desired effect. Obviously, in view of the Minister's attitude, it will not have much effect now either.  Is the Minister aware that there is no co-ordinated system for recovering a body which is missing in a river?  It is not the responsibility of the Department of the Environment because they do not have the staff &mdash; or the willingness &mdash; to do it.  I assume the Minister had the Department in mind when he referred to local authorities.  I recently heard of a case where a body was missing for four weeks which caused considerable trauma to the family.  Indeed, voluntary helpers put themselves in danger because they were not trained to do the job.  Now that the threat of nuclear war has receded and that Eastern Germany and other places have gone quiet &mdash; thanks to Deputy McCartan and a few others &mdash; will the Minister consider training Civil Defence personnel in recovering bodies?  The personnel are willing to assist in this operation and it would be a great relief, not only to the families involved, but to the whole community when incidents of this sort take place.</P>

      <P>Civil Defence personnel are frequently involved in mountain and river rescues.  This involvement has exceeded the scope and role which were originally assigned to the rescue service. In view of this, the Department have undertaken to carry out a full review of <Col N="627" /> the rescue capabilities.  This review is now coming to an end and it has involved various research projects such as experts meeting for discussions and trial exercises which have covered the full spectrum of rescue activity.  The study is currently defining the objectives of the review and this involves a realistic capability for Civil Defence units, bearing in mind the voluntary nature of that organisation, the limited time available for training and the limited resources of finance.  The review is expected to be finalised very shortly and, within a reasonable period, I expect to be able to come back to the Deputy with additional information as requested.</P>

      <P>A programme for the conversion of appropriate Defence Forces vehicles from the use of leaded petrol to use of diesel fuel commenced during 1988: Defence Forces vehicles purchased since July 1988 have been diesel engined and it is intended that vehicles acquired in the future will also be diesel operated or will be capable of using lead-free petrol.  The question of the installation of catalytic converters in vehicles is being examined.</P>

      <P>At 11.35 a.m. on Monday, 5 February, the UK authorities informed the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon that the Isle of Man registered bulk carrier <i>MV Tribulus</i> was holed and taking in water at a position 48.30 degrees north, 15 degrees west (270 nautical miles south-west of Mizen Head).  The UK Coastguard at Falmouth were responsible for co-ordinating the response, since this incident took place in the UK search and rescue region.</P>
      <P>The vessel is 68,000 gross registered tons and was carrying 122,000 tonnes of iron ore from Seven Islands in Canada to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.  Twenty-five persons were on board.</P>
      <P>Two RAF Sea Kings from Brawdy, South Wales, and one Royal Navy Sea King from Culdrose, Cornwall were dispatched to Cork to carry out the rescue.  One Sea King helicopter refuelled at the Irish Lights helicopter pad at Castletownbere and flew to the casualty which at that time (17.10 on Monday, 5 February) was 230 nautical miles south west of Mizen Head.  The two other Sea Kings remained on standby, one at Castletownbere and the other at Cork Airport.</P>
      <P>Ten crew were lifted off and brought to Cork at 22.23 on Monday night.  The rescue was carried out at the limit of the range of the helicopter and with exemplary courage and skill, given the sea conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current situation is that the vessel is making for Bantry Bay under its own steam at a speed of 7 knots.  Its expected time of arrival is 4 a.m. on Wednesday 7 February.   The vessel is being accompanied by the tug <i>Salano</i> which was <Col N="632" /> diverted on a voyage from Cobh to the Azores to assist.  In addition the <i>LE Eithne</i> is alongside.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps helicopter based at Shannon has been dispatched to Whiddy Island, Bantry where it is refuelled and on standby.  The vessel has approximately 550 tonnes of heavy fuel oil on board, which is leaking slowly.  Therefore, there is a risk of oil pollution from this vessel. A pollution operations group, under the chairmanship of a marine surveyor of my Department have been activated and will take responsibility for the direction and control of operations to prevent or minimise pollution damage.  The group are expected to convene at Bantry this afternoon. Counter-pollution equipment, at this moment, is being loaded at Cork on the Irish Lights tender <i>Gray Seal</i> for transport to Bantry Bay.  More is being flown in from Southampton.  I have asked for the help of his Excellency, the British Ambassador, in progressing this matter. In addition, Cork County Council and the Naval Service are putting their stocks of dispersant at the disposal of the pollution operations group.</P>
    <P>I consider that, unless there are grave reasons to the contrary, we should always provide shelter to vessels in distress.  On the basis of the information available to me following an inspection by the <i>LE Eithne,</i> I intend to permit the vessel to take refuge in Bantry Bay in the interests of safety of life.  If the vessel was refused admission there would be a serious risk to the life of the crew.  In the event of the crew abandoning the vessel outside a haven, the drifting vessel would present a major hazard to navigation and a possible threat to the Kinsale Head gas platforms. Moreover, as experience has shown with the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> there would be a greater threat of pollution damage to the environment from an uncontrolled vessel than from one manned and assisted by other vessels.</P>
    <P>Subject to weather conditions the arrival of the vessel in Bantry Bay will be planned to occur at dawn &mdash; that is somewhat later than in the normal course <Col N="633" /> of events &mdash; at which stage a final inspection would be made prior to clearance for entry.</P>
    <P>The owners of the vessel, Shell Oil Tankers, which is fully insured, have offered all possible assistance in dealing with the vessel and any threat of pollution. The UK Department of Transport are also helping.  At 1 p.m. this afternoon, the vessel was 100 miles south-west of Mizen Head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply.  Has he established the cause of the tear in the vessel, the condition and age of the vessel and if there is a danger of further damage to the vessel with a consequential risk of environmental pollution?</P>

      <P>In reply to the Deputy, the ten metre by three metre long plate of strong steel has split.  It is a plate covering a hatch which is not loaded. Hatches 2, 4, 6 and 8 are empty.  The in-between hatches are loaded with roughly 25,000 tonnes of iron ore.  Hatch 8, the one that is damaged, did not have iron ore in it so, consequently the damage to the plate &mdash; I understand with this type of steel that if there is a small crack it runs along &mdash; did not lighten the vessel, so to speak The hatch has been broken and that is now filled with the requisite tonnage of water.  The <i>LE Eithne</i> has reported that the damage cannot be seen except when there is a roll to port.  The damage is on the starboard side.  The ship is a product of one of the Japanese yards and is quite young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  In view of what he has just said, is he satisfied that this ship which I understand was built in 1982, is, in fact, seaworthy?  Is he not concerned that this purpose-built ship &mdash; and not a converted ship &mdash; should spring this leak in only galeforce 9 weather conditons? What action can he take, as a Minister in an island nation, to ensure that the seagoing vesels around this coast are safe and what sanctions are available to him in that regard?  What action is he taking <Col N="634" /> to ensure that no damage occurs?  In the event of any pollution damage occurring around our coastline what action is he taking to ensure that Shell Oil will meet the bill for whatever problems may arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The ship, as I indicatd, was on route from Canada to Rotterdam. It was outside of our territorial waters and, in the normal course of events, would not be of any concern to us.  Therefore, I do not think I can assume any responsibility for the quality of the ship. It was built by a reputable Japanese shipyard and is quite a young ship.  I must say that the Shell company have been more than forthcoming in the guarantees &mdash; including a guarantee in writing &mdash; that they will deal with any damage that occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the comprehensive reply to my question but I would also like to say that there are reports that the vessel is leaking oil. While the saving of life is paramount, is the Minister satisfied that he can cope with any pollution in the Bantry Bay area if the ship is allowed to berth there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can give that guarantee to the Deputy.  The <i>LE Eithne</i> reported that there is a light sheen of oil; they have sailed around the ship on a number of times and have inspected it as closely as possible.  With regard to protection in Bantry Bay, I have indicated what supplies are now on the way to Bantry Bay to confine any possible pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Perhaps a final question from Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to focus on that aspect.  While I accept, of course, that we have to render all aid to ensure the safety of the crew, I am concerned, too, about the pollution aspect in Bantry Bay.  While it is all very well to take action by way of having dispersants available, is there any way we can stop the pollution either by way of ensuring that as soon as the ship <Col N="635" /> arrives the leak is repaired or, alternatively, that the fuel oil aboard is offloaded? In other words, I want to prevent pollution.  I do not want our beaches in west-Cork destroyed with oil from this ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that action will be taken with regard to that point.  As I indicated to the House, there are 550 tonnes of oil on board.  This compares with 2,000 tonnes in the case of the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> to put the matter in focus.  However, it would be too many tonnes if it got into Bantry Bay and we are putting in place the dispersants and folding ramps &mdash; for want of a better name &mdash; to keep the oil tight to the ship. With regard to inspection, until it is anchored and until divers can get down to assess the damage and there is a list to port &mdash; it is at the watermark and does not show fully &mdash; no repairs can be carried out.  I can assure the Deputy, if he is worried about the pollution aspect, that second only to the saving of lives the control of the pollution is our concern.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank the Minister for his very full reply but I did not understand it fully.  It seems from the Minister's reply that the split on the particular steel plate is in a hatch which is empty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Consequently, how is there a leak of heavy fuel oil if the hatch is empty, or is there further damage about which the Minister has not informed the House or, is the Minister giving permission for a ship to come into Bantry Bay which is leaking oil from damage of which he is not aware?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so. As far as <i>LE Eithne</i> is concerned, they have identified a slight exhaust escape of oil. <Col N="636" /> They call it a light sheen.  There is no major spillage.  In my reply I indicated that there is a danger of spillage and we are putting in place arrangements to cope with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Returning to more mundane matters, it would be fair to say less than a week after the presentation of the budget that it was a non event.  It was the first time I listened to a budget being presented inside this Chamber although I had been in the public gallery when previous budgets were being presented. I can truthfully say that last week there was very little atmosphere in the House. There was no excitement or buzz which is usual on budget day.  Perhaps this was due in part to the leaks to the media in the weeks before the budget resulting from competition between the two parties making up the Government.  There was keen rivalry between them to see who would leak most and each tried to indicate their influence on the budget. Obviously, pressure was exerted by the smaller party, which has three Ministers in Government, to have some influence on the shape of the budget.  However, I do not see much evidence of the influence of the smaller partner in Government, apart from the Minister for Finance's proposal to increase VAT charges on the supply of electricity from 5 per cent to 10 per cent on 1 March.  I will deal with this matter more fully later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In presenting the budget the Minister for Finance spoke for almost two hours. Is it a record for a Minister for Finance to speak for so long without making any <Col N="740" /> reference to the provision of housing, the restoration of our county roads and the promotion of the tourism industry which is of vital importance to the economy of the west?  I welcome the indication that that famous longstanding rod licence dispute may be settled this week.  However, I will say no more about that matter now.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech hardly gave a mention to agriculture, with only a passing reference to the refund of VAT. However he did refer to the health services in detail.  This is a major topic, yet nothing was provided to improve our health or hospital services.  What about the patients in the corridors and those being discharged too soon?  What about the elderly who have to wait for years before being called for operations, such as hip replacement and cataract operations? What about the nursing staff who find themselves under severe pressure and the conditions in which they have to work with beds in corridors?  There is nothing in the budget for them.  Neither has anything been provided to shorten the waiting lists, and to open beds in hospitals, such as Merlin Park in Galway where 230 beds are closed and University Hospital where there are beds in the corridors? No indication was given that more doctors and nurses will be employed.  In other words, there was nothing in the budget which would lead to a restoration of public confidence in the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Last June the Taoiseach said that he did not realise that there were such problems in the health service.  Do we now find ourselves in the same position with the present Minister?  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health should realise that there is a crisis in the health service. I have been keeping in close contact with the service in my own area and I have visited University Hospital in Galway on a number of occasions since January where I spoke to doctors, nurses, patients and their relatives.  What I found there was very disturbing.  I found extra beds in the wards on a regular basis, beds taken up in the day room and beds in the corridors.  I am not speaking from hearsay but from what I found on my visit to <Col N="741" /> the hospital.  For example, the day ward should be reserved for admissions for minor operations, biopsies etc., but it is being constantly used for medical patients.  This is completely against good nursing practice, and I am aware of that because my wife is a nurse.  It leads to dangers of cross-infection, and all the extra beds put additional strain on the staff as there is no extra nurse to cater for them.</P>
    <P>Those extra beds in the corridors are putting great stress on the nurses in having to face patients and relatives under those circumstances, and they are causing a serious risk to the health of patients in that now if there is an emergency the necessary equipment cannot be got into the wards quickly enough because of the beds in the corridors. Often in such cases seconds are vital. God only knows what would happen if there was a fire on any of the floors.  You could forget about University Hospital, Galway, if there was.  I have witnessed patients going back to corridors after a general anaesthetic.  Again, this is intolerable. There is no emergency equipment in such areas and sometimes not even a plug is available to plug in emergency equipment when it can be got.  If that is not putting patients' lives at risk I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, blames the influenza epidemic at Christmas for all this over-crowding but I am informed reliably that very few of the patients admitted at that time were suffering from influenza when they came into the hospital.  However, many of them were suffering from influenza when they left the hospital as a result of being left in beds in corridors in draughts.  That is not fiction; that is fact. I witnessed one case where a family had to put coats on the end of a bed of an elderly patient in the corridor to keep away the draught.</P>
    <P>Because of the pressure on the beds patients are being discharged too soon with nobody at home to look after them. This is a vicious circle.  It is putting pressure on the hospital for beds and patients <Col N="742" /> have to be put out in order to make room for new patients.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case, and I have the permission of the family to use all details of this case where necessary, where on 1 January an elderly man from Connemara was admitted to University Hospital, Galway, for tests and he was considerably worse on 2 January than when he went in.  He was unable to walk or talk at this stage yet on 3 January his relatives were telephoned and told their father was fit to be discharged.  Two of the family came in and when they saw their father they thought he was not fit to be discharged. One of the girls asked how they could bring home their father when he was not able to walk.  The junior doctor in charge told her not to worry, he would be brought to the car in a wheelchair.  That happened and he was put into the car and driven 30 or 35 miles home to Connemara. When his wife saw him she was very alarmed and sent for her own doctor who insisted on having the patient readmitted that night to the hospital.  He was readmitted on 3 January, the day he was discharged.  He remained in a bed in a corridor outside St. Gerald's Ward for one and three-quarter days.  He died two weeks later.  I am not saying the treatment he got was a factor in his death but it is no way for a 74-year old patient to be treated in any of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I discovered on my visits to University Hospital that about a year ago the domestic staff were replaced by contract cleaners.  Previous to this there were three domestic staff on each floor in University Hospital, one in each ward and one working between the wards.  Now contract cleaners come in in the morning, prepare the breakfasts, clean the toilets, etc., wait for two hours and then they are gone.  This breaks up continuity for the patients.  Previously the same domestic staff brought breakfast, dinner and tea to a patient but for a patient staying a week or two in the hospital that pattern is broken.  The domestic staff are lost to the nurses because they were always a help to the nurses in rearranging beds where patients were discharged or died.  That <Col N="743" /> service is not there now and that is a deterioration.</P>
    <P>There is no use in being critical about the hospital services unless we can offer a solution.  I think there is a solution to the problem in Galway which I am sure would apply in other areas.  We have Merlin Park Hospital and we have another hospital under the auspices of the Western Health Board in the region. The solution to the overcrowding in University Hospital is the reopening of Merlin Park Hospital which has many units closed.  Unit 9 with 20 beds, unit 8 with 40 beds, unit 1 with 50 beds and unit 10 with 122 beds are closed.  If these 240 beds were brought back into operation it would alleviate the problem of pressure on beds in University Hospital and would lead to improved hospital services.  This is a simple solution staring the Western Health Board and the Minister in the face.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone should think it is not possible to do that, I quote from a press statement from the Minister for Health after he met the CEOs on 8 January 1990. He said that in all such situations local management and health boards and public voluntary hospitals have whatever flexibility is necessary to deal with the problem, and this was normal practice whenever there were unforeseen demands on the service such as those arising from major accidents or epidemics. That was the Minister telling the CEOs they have it in their power to do those things.  If the Minister or the Western Health Board cannot see their way to reopening units at Merlin Park, I demand that at least one unit should be open immediately to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>There is another solution.  Why not lease the units in Merlin Park to some of the nurses who are made redundant?  I know they are willing to take them.  Eight or ten nurses could run those units on a commercial basis.  The wards, equipment, kitchen equipment, emergency equipment are all there.  It is the best setting in the country.  It could be leased to nurses who could provide a service and charge for it.  They would be able to run it as a viable proposition and I have no <Col N="744" /> doubt it would be full of the type of patients who are now being shunted out of University Hospital to Merlin Park and back to University, Hospital.  Those patients could be catered for long-term there and patients after short stays in hospitals convalescing from operations etc.  Could stay for a few weeks in Merlin Park before going home.  This would be the solution to the problem where people are sent out of hospital before they are ready to go home.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  If it is successful there it could be tried in other hospitals such as the closed part of Castlerea Hospital, Roscommon Hospital or any other hospital where there is demand for this service.</P>
    <P>People are now living longer, and families are different from what they were ten or 20 years ago.  Often both husband and wife are working with nobody to look after old people in their homes.  The Minister in his budget speech made great play of what he called the carer's or the prescribed relative's allowance, but he failed to say it is almost impossible to qualify for this allowance.  To qualify for the prescribed relative's, now the carer's allowance a person would have to be looking after someone of pensionable age and be living with that person.  The person cannot be in receipt of any other income.  If the carer has an income from farming or any other source then he or she is disqualified.  Even an income from social welfare disqualifies.  The Minister for Finance said this allowance would be increased from £28 to £45 and he indicated details would be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  I listened very carefully to the contribution of the Minister for Social Welfare in the budget debate last Thursday.  He said very little by way of explanation except that the increase from £28 to £45 will be for full-time carers, which had already been made clear by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I am increasing from £28 to £45 per week the payment made in respect of certain relatives who care on a full-time basis at home for such persons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> The Minister for Social Welfare did not expound further on the matter except to say that the allowance is for full-time carers, is means-tested and will come into operation from 1 October 1990.  The Minister praised the work of dedicated carers to whom the community owed a debt.  I could not agree more but let us cut out the lip-service and get down to drawing up a realistic carer's allowance scheme for which it is possible to be eligible.  At present a farmer with ten or 15 acres of land with ten or 15 cattle who is caring for his father, mother, grandmother, grandfather, aunt or uncle would not qualify for the carer's allowance on the grounds that he had an income from farming.  In a year when he would have made a loss from keeping his ten or 15 cattle, he still would not qualify for the carer's allowance because he would not be considered to be a full-time carer, as he would have had to leave his house to count his cattle or throw them a bale of hay.  It is ridiculous that he or she could not be regarded as being eligible for the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>To make a big play of increasing the allowance from £28 to £45, without making it easier to qualify for it defeats the purpose of the scheme.  In other words it is a pretence.  This is a very important scheme in rural areas, in particular, and in urban areas where families mind their old relatives in their homes thus keeping them out of high cost institutional care.  I strongly urge the Minister to make it easier to qualify for the scheme.  The present allowance, announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget Statement is only a cosmetic exercise.  We have to advise a realistic carer's allowance which would be a beneficial saving to the State in the long term. For example it costs in the region of £350-£450 per week to keep a patient in institutional care.  If people could qualify easily for a carer's allowance of £100 per week there would be no difficulty in keeping a number of those people at home where they have lived all their lives with a member of their family looking after them.  This would be a great saving to the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> The Minister also made provision for an increase of £3 million for orthodontic treatment.  I say &ldquo;good on him&rdquo; because at present this service is a sick joke.  I will outline the situation in County Galway. At present children on the 1982 list are receiving treatment.  It has taken one and three quarter years to clear the backlog of the 1982 list and at that rate of progress it will be 15 to 18 years before children on the current waiting list are seen.  That defeats the whole purpose of orthodontic treatment.  The Government have decided to make a further £3 million available to the health board dental service. I am asking the Minister to appoint a full-time orthodontist to cover the 2,000 children on the waiting list in County Galway.  At present an orthodontist from Dublin visits the Shantalla clinic two days a fortnight on a Thursday and a Friday. If a full-time orthodontist was appointed the backlog could be cleared up in two to two and a half years, which is long enough to be on a waiting list.</P>
    <P>When referring to child benefit payments, the Minister said, and I quote from his Budget Statement:</P>
    <P>... and most importantly, I am increasing monthly child benefit payments across the board by 5 per cent or 75p for each of the first four children.</P>
    <P>A child would have to go very easy when putting the jam on the bread if the 75p was to last the full month.  Whoever wrote that sentence in the Minister's speech certainly intended to draw attention to the payment of 75p per month; perhaps it was a deliberate mistake but I do not think one should draw attention to such a payment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated in the course of his speech that pensioners over 80 years of age will be allowed to retain their free electricity entitlement when people come to live with them.  With respect, I suggest that a relative coming to live with an old and infirm person long before they reach 80 years of age and I think we could realistically reduce the age to 70 years and that cases could be <Col N="747" /> treated on their merits.  The free electricity allowance should not be discontinued in cases where a relative comes to live with an elderly person.  I do not accept that the qualifying age of 80 is appropriate in this regard.  When referring to the fuel allowance, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The allowance is also being extended to persons in receipt of smallholders' unemployment assistance who live alone.</P>
    <P>Why should not a smallholder with five or six children on unemployment assistance be entitled to a free fuel allowance?  In fact the mother of that family would have to have dinners ready at different times for children coming in from school, would have to dry their clothes in this type of weather and would have to provide light and heat when the children were studying. In fact I think that they should be entitled to free fuel.  There is no point in having the scheme and then discriminating against the people who would benefit most.  This anomaly should be redressed and thus smallholders with a number of children who are in receipt of unemployment assistance would also qualify for the fuel allowance.  In fact they might be more in need of the allowance than a person living alone.</P>
    <P>The Minister is allocating an additional £1.3 million for developments by voluntary housing associations.  While this is a very welcome provision it draws attention to the current housing situation which the Minister did not refer to in the course of his speech.  Members who are also members of local authorities will know that local authority housing is in a state of crisis.  There was provision in the Book of Estimates for £6 million plus the sum realised from the sale of houses to tenant purchasers.  This compares with an allocation of £120 million which was provided for housing in the mid-eighties. To put matters in perspective I will outline the situation in the local authorities on which I serve.  For example there are now 275 families who have been <Col N="748" /> approved for houses on the Galway Corporation housing list.  Yet we have built no houses in the corporation area since 1986, with the exception of 20 flats which were completed this year in the inner city area.</P>
    <P>I will now compare the allocation for housing in the years since 1983.  In 1983 we were allocated £3.5 million for the provision of local authority houses by the Fine Gael/Coalition Government and we were able to build 85 houses; in 1984 we received £4.32 million and we were able to build 122 houses; in 1985 we received £2.6 million and we built 72 houses; in 1986 we received £2.13 million and we built 68 houses; in 1987 our allocation was reduced to a miserable £210,000 by the new Government and no houses were built; in 1988 we received £500,000 to complete schemes, but no new houses were built; in 1989 we received £750,000, which in the main was for the provision of halting sites.  What is the Minister saying to the 275 families who are on the current waiting list?  Is he telling them they will have to emigrate or else put up with the conditions in which they are living?  The situation is no better in County Galway.  In 1986 we received an allocation of £4.45 million and 219 houses were built; in 1987 we received £1.734 million and 107 houses were built; in 1988 we received £212,000 and we built 20 houses; in 1989 we received £527,000 and we had 20 new starts, but that sum of £527,000 included moneys for the provision of a halting site in Ballygar.  As I have already said the provision for housing in the Book of Estimates this year is £6 million plus the money from the resale of houses, but this compares with an allocation of £200 million in 1985/86.</P>
    <P>Those people able or prepared to provide homes for themselves have had another blow struck at them in the provisions of this year's budget.  It is true to say that the average mortgage repayment has risen &mdash; as a result of a 4 per cent increase in interest rates &mdash; by approximately £100 per month.  There has been yet another blow for such people, namely the reduced income tax relief on the life <Col N="749" /> assurance content of mortgage endowment policies which increases their monthly repayments by approximately £8 to £10.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the increased VAT on electricity charges, from 5 per cent to 10 per cent from 1 March next.  The Minister say this will yield £11 million this year and £18 million in a full year. According to the Minister that cost will be absorbed by the ESB.  I contend that will not be possible.  Who does the Minister think he is fooling?  I am sorry the Minister for Energy is not present to hear what I have to say.  What is the point of imposing an additional 5 per cent VAT on electricity charges, contending that the cost will not be passed on to the consumer when the ESB are already in debt to the extent of £180 million to £190 million?  I contend that inevitably the £18 million in a full year will be passed on to the consumer; there is no other way out of the predicament.  It must be a serious blow to the Minister for Energy to have that passed on to him by his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is also the introduction for the first time of a 10 per cent VAT imposition on telephone and related services from 1 July next.  Indeed, the Minister in the course of his remarks on that subject did not appear to be so sure that that charge would not be passed on to the consumer. He said:</P>
    <P>I am confident that this initiative can be implemented without increased costs to telephone users, both households and VAT-registered businesses ...</P>
    <P>He would not appear to be nearly as sure about that charge not being passed on. This will do untold damage to the recent good work done in the provision of telephone services particularly for people in rural areas who had been encouraged to apply for such services.</P>
    <P>Under the heading National Environment Action Plan the Minister indicated the provision of an additional £20.1 million to meet the costs of that plan in 1990 announced by his colleague, the <Col N="750" /> Minister for the Environment the previous week.  Again, to quote from the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement, he had this to say:</P>
    <P>This plan sets out the action the Government are taking to protect and enhance Ireland's natural environment and to improve the quality of life.  I am providing an additional £20.1 million to meet the costs of this plan in 1990, of which £13.6 million relates to expenditure and £6.5 million relates to a taxation measure which I will deal with later.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of this money to meet the costs of this newly announced plan.  Indeed, it would be my hope that the Minister for the Environment could utilise some of those funds to sanction the Galway city sewerage scheme accompanied by full secondary treatment works, thus protecting Galway Bay from the serious pollution there at present.  I was a member of the deputation from Galway Corporation who met the Minister for the Environment last week on this matter when we impressed on him its importance and the enormous concern of the people of Galway, and indeed tourism interests in the west generally.  We impressed on the Minister the need to sanction this new sewerage scheme and secondary treatment works straightaway to allow Galway Corporation to design immediately a scheme for the secondary treatment works.  Indeed, such work will become essential by the year 1998 under an EC directive which stipulates that major seaside towns instal secondary treatment works before discharging sewage.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to only certain aspects of the budget in the time available to me.  The longer the interval since the introduction of this budget, the more time people have had to analyse the Minister's remarks and their implications, the more they realise it leaves much to be desired.  There is much work remaining to be done on ironing out various aspects of its provisions.  I have dealt with some only, such as the carer's allowance, free fuel schemes and so on.  I will endeavour <Col N="751" /> to tease out such matters with the relevant Ministers when the necessary legislative measures come before the House. It is all very well for a Minister for Finance to use flowery language in introducing the Budget Statements, contending that this or that will be done, that it is the intention to do this, that or the other, or contending that this or that tax will not impose any additional burden on the taxpayer, but, when one gets down to working out the implications of such measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I was particularly disappointed when the Minister for Social Welfare came into the House on Thursday last, he did not clarify any of the budgetary provisions, particularly the scheme in which I will take most interest, because of the overall health position, that is the carer's allowance.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to make the provisions of that scheme easily available to an ordinary family member caring for an elderly relative in their home. Indeed, he might well increase the maximum payment from £45 to, say, a realistic figure of £80 to £100 per week which would render it possible for somebody to leave their employment to take care of an elderly relative in their home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget builds the foundation for optimism as we enter the new decade. Its central thrust is the positive one of building on the economic and fiscal progress we have made, boosting job creation, in helping the disadvantaged and in improving living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It rests on the success of the Government in bringing the public finances into order.  The Government have achieved, three years ahead of schedule, the fiscal targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  We have now set new targets which would have been inconceivable only four years ago: to reduce <Col N="752" /> the debt-GNP ratio further towards 100 per cent and as part of this to achieve a broad balance on the current budget for the first time in 21 years.</P>
    <P>The progress of these three years compares more than favourably with the six previous years when the debt-GNP ratio jumped from 94 per cent to 130 per cent, the national debt doubled and we staggered under record budget deficits and interest rates.  This dramatic recovery has been carried out without relying on the tried and failed policy of increasing taxation. Indeed, we have actually reduced taxation rates significantly.  Income tax has dropped from 35 per cent in the standard rate, and from 58 per cent to 53 per cent in the top rate.  Corporation tax has been amended twice.  New tax collection methods have reaped sizeable rewards.</P>
    <P>We have paid particular attention to the plight of the poor, especially those with dependent children.  We have improved the family income supplement scheme.  We have increased the general tax exemption limits for the low paid. For instance, a married couple with two children can now earn £7,100 without any tax liability, an increase of nearly 30 per cent on the 1988 figure of £5,500.  Marginal tax relief has also been improved.</P>
    <P>Those with incomes less than £60 a week will not have to pay employee's PRSI either.  Their social insurance entitlement will not be effected and their employer will continue to pay employer contributions in respect of them. Between the two measures, well over 100,000 people will find they have greatly improved levels of take-home pay.</P>
    <P>For those who are unfortunately still dependent on social welfare, the Government have increased rates of assistance by amounts greatly in excess of likely inflation rates for the third year in a row. For instance, the standard level of assistance has gone up by 5 per cent, well above the level of expected inflation, and the level for the long-term unemployed has jumped by 11 per cent, bringing their rates some 35 per cent higher than in 1988 and much closer to the recommended <Col N="753" /> levels of the Commission on Social Welfare. The free schemes and the fuel allowances have been further improved.</P>
    <P>For families with dependent children, we have increased child benefit and child dependant allowance.  We have introduced a new clothing allowance to help out with the financial burden of preparing for winter.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the budget has been to intensify the already favourable movement in the economy and encourage job creation.  The Government have decided to take two further measures specifically to boost employment.</P>
    <P>First, the Government have decided to introduce, on a pilot basis, a new training for employment scheme to be operated by FÁS in conjunction with employers. The idea is to encourage employers who foresee an expansion of employment in the future to take on trainees earlier than they would otherwise have done.  An allocation of £1 million is being made available to FÁS in 1990 as the Government's contribution towards the cost of the scheme.  The details of the scheme have yet to be finalised but it will offer actual work experience plus a significant amount of general skill training.  I hope to be in a position to give more information within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to announce that the social employment scheme will be available to more participants than ever in 1990.  FÁS will provide places on social employment scheme projects for more than 15,000 people.  This represents an increase of over 50 per cent on the 1989 level.  This once again underlines this Government's commitment to help the long-term unemployed.  An expansion of this order will require the whole-hearted co-operation of the trade unions, local authorities, voluntary bodies and many other interests.  It will be facilitated by the child dependant allowance which was introduced with effect from 1 January, of up to £10 per week per child for participants in the scheme.  This allowance should attract far more participants with children to the scheme.  The new training for employment scheme and the expansion of the social employment scheme <Col N="754" /> complement the measures for job creation and assistance to the disadvantaged I announced last September on behalf of the Government.  You will remember that these included a new PRSI exemption scheme which incidentally expires at the end of this month, together with a variety of measures to promote job creation and to target assistance more clearly on the disadvantaged, especially in inner urban areas.</P>
    <P>Turning to the overall employment scene, 1989 has proved to be a year of great significance for jobs.  For instance, in Dublin alone, last year saw an actual increase in total manufacturing jobs, after almost ten years of decline.  Independent observers of the economy, such as the Central Bank, estimate that total employment increased by up to 13,000 in 1989.  A survey carried out jointly by the Federation of Irish Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry confirmed that most sectors expect employment to increase in the year to April, 1990 by an overall of 4.2 per cent. Employment among the firms surveyed had increased by 6,600 between April and December 1989.</P>
    <P>Indeed, private sector employment is now estimated to have grown by 35,000 to 40,000 jobs over the last two years, offset to some extent by declining public sector and agricultural employment and a lower rate of activity on FÁS programmes. This impressive performance demonstrates how effective the economic policies pursued by this Government and their predecessor have been.</P>
    <P>I am also very heartened to see the dramatic decline in the number of job losses.  My Department's records show that there has been a 42 per cent drop in the number of notified redundancies in 1989 over 1988; last year's level of 13,400 was about half that of the peak in 1984 Public sector job losses, which are not notifiable to my Department, are also likely to decline significantly.</P>
    <P>In 1990, the Government expect an increase in non-agricultural employment of about 16,000.  This is in line with the ESRI's <i>Quarterly Economic Commentary</i> for December 1989, published <Col N="755" /> last Tuesday, before the budget.  The overall thrust of this budget and the specific measures it contains will contribute to increased employment and reduced unemployment, as well as higher investment activity and living standards.</P>
    <P>This recovery in the economy and in jobs should help to slow down the rate of emigration.  Again the recent ESRI forecast supports this assumption, predicting a significant reduction in emigration to about 25,000 in 1990.  I expect involuntary emigration in particular to decline.  Encouraging signs exist in relation to young people without educational qualifications who have always been at risk of emigration.  My Department's school leavers survey shows that fewer people are now leaving school early, without qualifications.</P>
    <P>The training and employment scheme and the 50 per cent expansion in the SES are new incentives.  Of equal importance are the other FÁS programmes to improve the skills of our workforce.  The budget for FÁS will be £185 million, including European Social Fund assistance. This will enable FÁS to provide again about 14,500 activity years, in the variety of programmes essential to improve our national skill levels and to help the disadvantaged to find satisfactory jobs.</P>
    <P>I have always been anxious to ensure that the allowances payable to FÁS trainees should be maintained at an adequate level to attract people in training, particularly older unemployed persons with dependants.  In September last year, as part of the package of employment creation measures, I announced that a £10 weekly bonus would be payable to all trainees with dependants.  This bonus has been paid since 30 October 1989.  It is my intention to increase the training allowances payable to FÁS trainees in line with the social welfare increases which have already been announced.  There are two other developments by FÁS which I should mention: apprenticeship and continuing training by firms.</P>
    <P>At my request, FÁS conducted a <Col N="756" /> review of the Irish apprenticeship system during 1989.  The results of this review were published in a discussion document which was launched last December.  The purpose of this document is to encourage debate on the whole apprenticeship system and FÁS are anxious to receive submissions from interested parties before the end of March.  One of the main changes proposed is the introduction of a standards reached system of apprenticeship, rather than one of `time served'. I would stress that the proposals in the discussion document do not represent decisions taken by FÁS, who will take all views submitted to them into account when making final recommendations to me for a future apprenticeship system.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the need to ensure that Irish industry is properly equipped to meet the challenge which will be presented through the opening up of the EC internal market in 1992.  Up to now, considerable efforts have been devoted to the creation of new jobs but it is, of course, as important to protect existing jobs.  Continuing training for those at work is essential if workers are to be able to keep up with changes in skill requirements and other technological developments.  Employers and employees alike must become more aware of the importance of training.</P>
    <P>For my part, the Government have, at my request, allocated £4 million approximately to FÁS in 1990 for an industrial restructuring training programme to be directed at those in employment.  As President of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers, I am hopeful that a Community Action Programme on continuing vocational training will be adopted at the Council meeting in May.  The aim of the programme is to support and complement the policies and activities of the member states in the area of continuing vocational training and to involve all those concerned such as employers, employees and public authorities.</P>
    <P>The importance of tourism to this country is obvious to everyone, particularly for its potential in creating new jobs.  The Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> set a target of <Col N="757" /> 25,000 additional jobs for the tourism sector.  CERT have an important role to play in ensuring that we have the skills necessary to take advantage of the development of the tourist sector and the job opportunities becoming available.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of the hotel, catering and tourism sectors, CERT trainees are virtually guaranteed employment in the industry.  CERT non-capital resources in 1990 will be £7.5 million, compared with £6.186 million in 1989. They will provide training for a record 9,000 trainees.  CERT will also get £1.73 million for capital in 1990 for the development of their new headquarters in Amiens Street in Dublin.  This will make their operations more efficient, facilitate future expansion and will, at the same time, give a significant boost to Dublin's inner city area.  I should add that training allowances based on social welfare entitlements will also be increased.</P>
    <P>In the future development of the economy, the international dimension will play a vital role.  We now have a unique opportunity, through the Community Support Framework, to develop our economy, our infrastructure and our human resources.  With Community help, we will overcome the disadvantages of our geographical separation from the Continent and catch up with our fellow member states.  The objectives set out in our National Development Plan have been endorsed by the European Commission, and the levels of assistance to be provided through the Structural Funds have now been allocated.</P>
    <P>In the area of the Social Fund, which is the responsibility of my Department as national authority, the Commission has pledged assistance totalling £1,068 million to Ireland for the period 1989 to 1993. This is a significant increase in the annual level of ESF assistance to Ireland, which last year was approved for over £183 million. The general intervention rate of assistance for individual projects has also been increased, from 55 per cent to 65 per cent.  The injection of this additional money will enable us to expand and improve our training and job creation programmes to new levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> Under the Community Support Framework, the emphasis will be on plans and programmes, and on joint actions between the Structural Funds to achieve maximum impact and the most cost effective use of resources.</P>
    <P>Operational programmes have been drawn up for different developmental sectors in consultation with the Commission. Four of these programmes have already been formally approved by the Commission and I expect that the remaining four programmes will be approved in the near future.  Several cover joint actions, involving a number of funds.  The major programme is for industry and services of which some £378 million will be included for Social Fund support for human resource development.</P>
    <P>We are also discussing with the Commission a number of innovatory projects, to test out new approaches to training, and also technical assistance to make our systems more efficient.</P>
    <P>All of the operational programmes will be monitored by special monitoring committees. These will ensure that the programmes are proceeding according to plan and that they are achieving the objectives and standards set for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome, particularly, the partnership arrangement in these committees between the EC Commission and the various Irish interests involved, including the Government and the social partners.  This partnership reflects the reality of the substantial amounts of Exchequer funding involved and the need to integrate the resources of the private sector.  The wide range of interests represented on the committees will bring a wealth of experience to the task of monitoring.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of the effectiveness of the programmes will also be carried out so that we can refine and refocus them if necessary, as we learn from experience.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the increasing significance for Ireland of the international dimension.  These first six months of 1990 are particularly significant as we hold the Presidency of the European Council.  As President in Office of the Social Affairs <Col N="759" /> Council, I want to lay particular emphasis on the need to intensify measures to promote job creation and to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment.  The statistics alone are justification for giving a Community political focus to the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>About seven and a half million people in the EC have been without work for at least a year and over 15 million people live in households in which at least one person is long-term unemployed.  The human misery which lies behind the statistics and the huge economic costs entailed demand that we grapple effectively with this problem.  As the Community's economy returns to growth, we must ensure that the long-term unemployed are able to benefit from this recovery.</P>
    <P>While action to facilitate more jobs concerns the whole range of Community policies, not just the social affairs area, I intend to bring long-term unemployment to the top of the social affairs agenda.</P>
    <P>At the Informal Social Affairs Council next month here in Dublin, I will be chairing discussions on a Presidency paper drawn up by Ireland on the subject. A draft resolution will then be prepared, to be considered for adoption at the Social Affairs Council in May.  This resolution will deal with such matters as the role of the Community, member states, employers and trade unions; new initiatives and their financing; and action at local level.  While I do not want to go into too much detail about my other priorities in the social affairs area during the Presidency, I will be stressing the importance of progress under the Community Charter for the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.  The charter is an essential counterbalance to ensure that the single market is not solely weighted towards the economic aspects.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that real progress is made in drawing up and implementing the necessary Community instruments.  I will be consulting the next two Presidents in Office of the Council <Col N="760" />&mdash; my colleagues in Italy and Luxembourg &mdash; to agree a timetable for action.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a European training foundation, which will promote EC training assistance to Poland and Hungary, and possibly other Eastern European states, will be another major item to be finalised during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Apart from its Presidency role, Ireland as a country has a major contribution to make in the successful implementation of any proposals to assist these countries. In the area of vocational training, my Department are producing a report outlining specific proposals on how the Irish Government could contribute to human resource development in Poland and Hungary.  These proposals will now be the subject of more detailed discussions with representatives of the European Commission and the two countries concerned.</P>
    <P>Turning back to the Irish scene, I would like to welcome again the contribution of the social partners through the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to the economic turnaround over the last two years or so.  Business expansion has been made easier by the stable industrial relations climate and by the degree of pay restraint.</P>
    <P>My Department estimate that there were only 41 strikes last year, fewer than in any other year since the State was founded.  The number of work days lost was 41,400.  With the exception of 1944, this was also the lowest since 1922.  Only two of the 41 strikes were concerned with basic pay increases, further clear evidence of wage stability under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>This restraint by workers has had real results.  The statistics I gave earlier show that the jobs that were needed are being created and that people are very much less likely to be made redundant.  The income tax reliefs provided in this budget and the previous two budgets have helped to ensure that living standards have been protected.  Indeed, this budget will combine with the carry-over effect of last year's budget to raise real disposable <Col N="761" /> incomes by about 3.5 per cent in 1990, even taking likely inflation into account.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Industrial Relations Bill which I introduced in December last year to the Oireachtas will help to improve the stability of industrial relations further.  It will provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute resolution, and help create conditions favourable to employment-generating investment.  As I hope to take the Second Stage of this Bill in the House shortly, I will not go into the details now.</P>
    <P>However, Deputies will have noticed that an additional £1.273 million has been provided in my Department's Vote to cover costs arising from the amalgamation of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland.  This historic merger, into the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, is a major step towards the rationalisation of the trade union movement, again an important factor in attracting investment.</P>
    <P>Since taking office almost three years ago, I have been determined to ensure that the significant body of protective legislation administered by my Department is relevant and necessary to contemporary jobs.  In this I am giving priority to the preparation of legislation to protect part-time workers.  At the moment Ireland is one of the few EC countries which makes a distinction in protective legislation between part-time and full-time workers.  Part-time workers have been increasing rapidly and now make up about 8 per cent of the work force.</P>
    <P>Part-time work has many attractions, both for workers who have other commitments or interests and for employers who find that it gives them added flexibility. However the exclusion of 20,000 part-time workers from most of the protective legislation administered by my Department is inequitable and outdated. A further 20,000 are excluded from any statutory entitlement to holidays.</P>
    <P>It would be most undesirable to allow a dual labour market to grow up, with a core of privileged full-time workers and a surrounding disadvantaged group of marginalised, easily exploited part-time <Col N="762" /> workers.  I therefore intend this year to introduce a Bill to the Oireachtas which will give adequate statutory protection to most of those who are at present below the minimum thresholds.</P>
    <P>Work is also proceeding in my Department on amending legislation on unfair dismissals, employment equality, and the payment of wages.  I hope to be able to bring forward a Bill in each area this year. Legislation on working time is also being reviewed.</P>
    <P>Three months ago, I established the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority.  The board of the Authority is tri-partite, balanced so that employers' and workers' representatives will have a major input into the development and implementation of overall national policy on safety and health at work.  Perhaps the most significant features of the legislation, and of the role of the Authority, are its scope and its emphasis on prevention.  For the first time in Ireland, everybody at work is given statutory safety and health protection. Employers, in consultation with workers, must identify all hazards in the workplace, and take the necessary preventive measures to control and if possible eliminate risk.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the Authority will promote, advise and research on occupational safety and health.  Powers of enforcement are sufficient to provide a real deterrent to the carelessness or lack of proper concern that have often resulted in serious or even fatal accidents in the past.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago I was delighted to launch the Authority's programme of work for the next three years.  The speed of development of this programme augurs well for the enthusiasm and commitment brought to the task by the board and staff of the new body.  I particularly welcomed the progress the Authority have already made in planning their activities for the sectors now covered by the legislation for the first time.  I know that full implementation will have to be done on a phased basis, but a good start has been made.</P>
    <P>The real test will be the success of the <Col N="763" /> Authority's programme in reducing the number of accidents and ill health at work.  I am confident that significant progress will be made towards creating a safe and healthy environment for everyone at work.</P>
    <P>Finally, as we start the new decade, the forecasts are optimistic.  Our economy has been transformed by a steady reliable policy of caution and control, firmly grounded in the consensus between Government and the social partners embodied in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> runs generally to the end of 1990.  It has played a major part in the turnaround of the Irish economy in recent years and has been a central plank of Government policy. Increasingly, it has led to greater job creation.  It has served the real interests of the country and of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Taken with income tax concessions, it has resulted in a moderate and realistic level of wage inflation and has at the same time yielded significant real increases for workers.  Surely a sensible approach compared with the tired old discredited system we suffered for so long with double figure wage inflation, even higher price increases and lower real incomes. It has also given the trade unions and employers a significant role in influencing Government economic and social policy. The predictable claims of some for a return to a free-for-all does not make sense today.  It would be against the interests of the unemployed and the long-term interests of individual workers and the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government have reached or surpassed all their targets.  Industry has returned to growth and profit.  Steady progress has been made towards spreading the burden of taxation more equitably. People at work have benefited from rises in real take home pay.  And those without jobs will get extra money to help them live fuller lives and extra help to find a job in an increasingly buoyant economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> The formula has worked.  With the support of all of us, it can continue to work and to lay secure foundations for a prosperous decade ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister I wondered if he and I were living in the same country because, the general reaction of people I met in my constituency from different strata of society was that the budget did little or nothing for anyone.  At best some people thought their income would remain the same as last year and that the increases in social welfare barely matched inflation. Tax relief was offset by the increase in interest and mortgage rates.  Indeed, most people felt they will be worse off as a result of the budget.</P>
      <P>We are trying to convince ourselves in this House through our mechanisms and use of words that things are happening, which is not really the case.  We are becoming great architects of very nicely formulated sentences, paragraphs and general verbosity.  However, people will not benefit from the codology in this Chamber.  The Minister said that there was an upward trend in employment and that the emigration figures are down. However, 230,000 people are on the dole and last year about 50,000 emigrated. The Minister for Labour said just now that he expected 25,000 people to emigrate in 1990.  Unfortunately, few people are left to emigrate and it is those who are sitting their leaving certificates in June who will leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have not been sincere in their efforts to tackle the jobs problem.  They talk about job creation but we do not witness it in our respective constituencies.  Hundreds of people are emigrating every day all over the country and in rural constituencies, such as mine in Clare, it is frightening to see how many parishes have been denuded of young people. It is very depressing to see dozens of young people leaving rural parishes all over the country.  This also applies to urban areas and the working class areas of Dublin and other cities.  Verbal diarrhoea in this Chamber will not rectify the situation.  The Government must be <Col N="765" /> condemned for the manner in which they presented a whole series of bluffs to this House.  Nobody is any better off as a result of the budget.  One would not mind that if there was a substantial increase in employment because those who are in a position to pay tax would be willing to continue doing so if they felt that less well off people would be provided with jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour spoke about creating 25,000 jobs in the tourism centre with the help of CERT and Bord Fáilte. I question the Government's sincerity in this regard as the rod licence dispute is now entering its third year and they have done nothing to resolve it.  The dispute has cost millions to the economy and jobs have been lost.  This has happened in parts of the country which rely on the tourism industry.  The Taoiseach must be condemned in relation to this area because, last year, he was the major stumbling block to solving the dispute. Many people in the west have already lost their livelihood as a result of this dispute, yet the Minister has the audacity to say in the House that they are targeting 25,000 extra jobs in tourism.  It is the height of hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>The Minister also announced an additional £2 million to Bord Fáilte for extra promotional work.  I welcome the announcement and I hope Bord Fáilte manage to attract more visitors this year but the Minister did not give any extra money for tourism promotion to SFADCo.  After all this Government gave responsibility to SFADCo for tourism promotion in the mid-west region. The Minister also hit two areas &mdash; telecommunications and electricity &mdash; very badly.  He announced an increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent on electricity and 10 per cent VAT on telecommunications. If the Government are serious they should have a confident line of action if they intend to create jobs in certain areas.  As far as the Department of the Marine are concerned there is a haphazard, higgledy-piggledy approach in relation to compensation for storm damage.  In the budget speech, the Minister anounced that he was giving a sum of £100,000 to BIM for damaged boats. <Col N="766" /> I welcome that announcement as it is an acknowledgement of the fact that damage was done to boats at Kilmore Quay. What about compensation for storm damage on the south and south-west coast and up as far as Sligo? There has been no announcement in this regard and I hope he will do something about this in the weeks ahead.  The Minister announced a grant of £950,000 to the Department of the Marine for emergency coastal protection work.  That sum is welcome but the Government need to consider long term and sustainable solutions because we are an island nation and storms are an inevitable feature of our lives.  Constant damage is caused every year by storms and, therefore, we need to have a properly thought out approach in relation to tackling the problem.  Haphazard allocations here and there will not solve the problem in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not make any announcement in relation to the air and sea search and rescue service.  There was no provision for any additional moneys to provide proper facilities around the west coast.  Even today, we had an example of us not having facilities or co-ordinating services available to put in place a proper air and sea search and rescue service.  The Government should be tackling this in a constructive way but instead of doing that they paid £1.4 million to lease a jet for six months to ferry Ministers back and forth across Europe when there is a perfectly good scheduled service from our airports to all the major cities in Europe. What are the priorities of the Government? Is it saving lives off the west coast or getting Ministers to the various capitals of Europe? As an island nation transport is an integral part of our economy. If we are to compete on a satisfactory basis as a member of the European Community &mdash; particularly after 1992 &mdash; we need to be able to export our goods as quickly as possible.  We also need to be competitive in relation to the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>As an island nation we are at a disadvantage not having any land access to <Col N="767" /> other member states.  The Government do not recognise that and the Minister did not take any action to make allowances for it.  He did not announce any schemes to improve the facilities at our ports for loading and unloading and that is an indication of the Government's backward approach.</P>
    <P>On the question of transport, our hauliers find it more expensive than their Northern counterparts to purchase their lorries, haulage equipment and fuel because of the extent of our excise duty. Their Northern counterparts can get to the ports faster and at less cost than hauliers in the South.  The Government have not done anything to make life easier for our hauliers.  They have not given them any help to make them more competitive, to enable them to survive or help them create more jobs in the haulage business. As we approach 1992 the Government are being negative in their dealings with the haulage industry.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we need to improve the shipping services from this country.  We must have a speedy, efficient and economic service to all ports in Europe but the Government have not done anything in the budget towards that. They had an ideal opportunity to invest in shipping but failed to do so.  We cannot hope to succeed after 1992 if we do not have fast and cheap access to the European markets.  Unless the Government cop on very fast we will lose more jobs and more of our young people will be emigrating.  The Government's action is only higgledy-piggledy.  It appears from the Minister's speech that he is trying to satisfy many pressure groups and his backbenchers in his minimal gestures.  He did not take any positive action and that is unfortunate for the country.</P>
    <P>In my view the budget amounts to a series of tricks with the existing system. There is no doubt that there is a lot of inefficiency, duplication and bureaucracy and that was recognised by the Minister who indicated that he intended correcting that.  I suggest to him that there are some fundamental flaws in our administration and that he should correct them as soon <Col N="768" /> as possible.  Our Civil Service is efficient and most civil servants are aware of where the flaws exist.  However, it is a matter for the Minister to give leadership and encourage civil servants to highlight the inefficiencies and to take action to eliminate them.  It is not enough to ask them to do that work; they should be rewarded for their efforts to rectify the flaws.  The Minister should recognise that we must tackle the mountains of bureaucracy. It is up to him to get rid of the red tape.  That would benefit the population, particularly those who depend on the State.  I am referring to those in receipt of social welfare benefits and those who pay taxes.  The Minister should move to minimise the amount of red tape.</P>
    <P>For instance, there is a massive backlog of applications for licences to get involved in aquaculture with the Department of the Marine.  In fact, fish farms have commenced without the necessary licences from the Department.  It appears that the Department do not have sufficient resources to carry out the necessary preparatory work when applications are received. That procedure could be simplified.  There is no need to employ more people and the Minister for the Marine should consider simplifying the licensing process.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman on Justice, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, called on the Government to sort out the problems that exist in the Land Registry but they have not made a move on that proposal.  There are 26 county registrars in the country and many of them in the fifties, before the Land Registry Office was set up, were registrars of title but they do not do that work any more.  The Government should consider passing on a lot of the work done by the Land Registry to county registrars. There is room for improvement and rationalisation in all Departments and the Government should embark on such programmes.  Progress is being hindered because of bureaucracy.  Many people considering creating more jobs give up half way because of the extent of the red tape they must overcome.  Those with entrepreneurial skills move elsewhere and as a result we lose jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> There was no evidence in the Minister's speech of the prospects of more jobs being created.  The business community have expressed serious concern at the Government's decision to reduce capital allowances.  There is no doubt that that will curtail investment.  That was a negative move by the Minister.  The figures released by the IDA and SFADCo should be questioned.  I suggest that an independent body be employed to audit those figures annually.  It is ridiculous asking any institution to audit their own accounts or report on their work.  An outside body should be employed to question the veracity of the figures published.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the figures for jobs created in my constituency. I do not see any evidence of the jobs announced by those bodies.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to health which will come up for discussion later this evening and tomorrow.  There is a national crisis in the health services and the mismanagement by the Government of those services is nothing short of despicable. The health services are a national scandal.  The Minister failed to recognise the problems in those services, another indication of the Government's lack of concern for the health of our people. Those most affected by the health cuts are the poor, the old and the sick.  In the casualty department of Clare County Hospital in Ennis at present there are three chronically ill people lying on stretchers and they do not know if they will get a bed in the hospital.  I am aware of people who were sent home at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on winter nights when emergency cases were admitted.  That is unacceptable in a supposedly caring and Christian society.  We are bordering on the uncivilised in the way we treat the old and the sick.  The Minister for Health, and the Government, must respond to the complaints.  I wonder if they take us seriously when we complain about these problems.  Do they realise that people are suffering?  If they did realise it, I feel they would respond.  Unfortunately we have had no response from the Government on the health crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> Education is a very important area. The poorer, more isolated communities are again being deprived as a result of Government action.  There has been no improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio, although it was promised.  It is impossible for teachers to give the necessary attention to weaker pupils in large classes.  The position is totally unsatisfactory.  Again, it is the poorer, more deprived children and those with less ability who are being affected.  There have been promises about the appointment of remedial teachers and there is an outcry from every parish to have such teachers appointed. A recent survey produced frightening statistics in regard to the number of children leaving primary school who are not literate in the three Rs &mdash; the figure was in the region of 35 per cent.  Yet, no additional remedial teachers have been appointed and children are becoming further deprived.  Education is a vehicle of access to information and the developing of one's abilities and prospects for securing a job.  Unless basic education is provided for young people they will not have any prospect of improving their position if they come from poor and underprivileged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>When one visits different schools throughout the country, one is struck by the imbalance in the type of facilities provided.  These vary from the most luxurious, well-equipped classes to the most basic ill-equipped schools in other areas.  The Department must try to bring about some equality in building facilities and equipment.  We have seen no reaction by the Minister.  Instead there has been a series of pious platitudes on economic theory.  Economic theory does not correspond with the reality on the ground, a fact which the Government must quickly realise.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the Minister's statement that he hopes to create 25,000 jobs and how he has set about doing so.  It is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I come from County Clare, a west of Ireland constituency with many small farmers.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, who comes from west Cork, would recognise <Col N="771" /> many of the problems which arise in such a constituency.  The Minister for Finance, during the course of his budget speech gave no acknowledgment to agriculture. It is a major industry but is increasingly declining.  The constant drop in the number of farm families is alarming. There is also a fall in the price of cattle and an expected fall in the price of milk, which means that more small farmers will be forced off the land and become dependent on social welfare or emigration.</P>
    <P>A recent survey in County Wexford showed that the number of farmers earning less than £7,000 gross was about 2,800.  That is an amazing figure for County Wexford which shocked many people.  If that is the case in Wexford, can we imagine the figure in County Clare or west Cork?  There is a serious poverty problem.  What have the Government done?  They have hijacked the system of farm support schemes.  A feature of agriculture in my constituency is farmers looking for headage grants at the beginning of February which should have been paid to them at the end of November. They actually had inspectors inspecting their herds in November instead of being paid.  If they had any cattle to sell they were forced to do so at the end of September or the beginning of October because they could not afford to carry them any later.  A very substantial number of farmers have not received any headage payments.  Some of them had forward headage payments made, which is totally unacceptable.  When we were in Government there was pandemonium if all the headage payments were not sent out by the end of November and very few were outstanding.</P>
    <P>Any farm development grants have been stalled or are coming at such a slow pace that one would wonder if the Minister was manufacturing the money himself. The Minister is claiming greater economic buoyancy and says the books are balancing well.  The reality is that the books are balancing well because the Government have held back so much money which should have been paid <Col N="772" /> months ago.  That is true for the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Energy and any Department with which I have been dealing.  There has been a deliberate stalling of grant payments in order to keep the books balanced.  Let nobody be fooled about that.</P>
    <P>With that type of line being adopted, where are the jobs in agriculture?  What is the future of the small farmer with this Government at the helm?  It is a very pessimistic outlook.  Having heard yesterday what was going on in Europe, our farmers need to be extremely cautious and careful because the Government are directing them down the wrong road. That story will remain to be told.</P>
    <P>I now refer to my own constituency and the shenanigans which the Government have conducted in relation to the status of Shannon.  We have had the spectacle of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce and senior Fianna Fáil politicians making various pronouncements about the status of Shannon versus the status of Knock and seeking the removal of Shannon's special status as the sole trans-Atlantic airport.  It is imperative that Shannon should remain the sole trans-Atlantic airport.  Sixty per cent of passengers coming from the United States disembark at Shannon and move around the mid-west region.  This is very important to the economy of that region.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely integral to economic development in the mid-west region that the status of Shannon should remain. Any change could cause a massive upset in the economic structure.  It is important that the Government should recognise that setting up senior politicians within their own party to take a particular line will not weaken the campaign in relation to Shannon.  Using 1992 as an argument for removing this status is unacceptable because it has nothing to do with the EC. It is a bilateral agreement with the United States of America, not an EC matter. The argument being put forward is hogwash as far as we in the mid-west region are concerned.  Shannon has been the <Col N="773" /> trans-Atlantic stopover for many years.  It has developed industry and an economy around that fact and it is vital that it should remain as it stands.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to ensure that there is no change whatever in relation to the stopover at Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to intervene at this early stage in the debate to support a budget which I believe is well balanced and right for our present economic circumstances. I also believe that there is a number of measures which are of real benefit to the farming community.  In introducing these measures, the Minister for Finance has responded in a positive way to some of the major priorities which have been advanced by the main farming organisations and other interested parties who have made pre-budget submissions.</P>
      <P>However, before dealing with matters of specific concern to farming and the food sector, I would like to start with some general comments on the overall economic and financial thrust of the budget.  As the Minister for Finance said in his statement, this budget consolidates and builds on the major progress which has been made in the public finances and in the overall economy since 1987.  In the past three years we have seen economic growth return to the economy.  In 1989, we achieved 3¼ per cent growth in GNP, and the projected growth rate for this year is almost 4 per cent.  Increased domestic demand and continuing buoyancy in exports are the major factors responsible for improved economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased domestic demand is a combination of additional consumer spending, assisted by tax concessions and relatively low inflation in recent years, and the considerable increase in investment which has occurred.  The agricultural sector is making its distinctive contribution to this investment.  There has been a significant increase, for example, in cattle, sheep and pig numbers which will result in additional output in coming years.  There has also been major investment by farmers in pollution <Col N="774" /> control measures during 1989.  This investment has undoubtedly been assisted by the increased grants which were made available during the year.  I would estimate that a total of about £100 million was invested in pollution control measures and other on-farm investments during 1989 and that a further £100 million will be invested during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the fact that the budget continues down the road of improving the position of our public finances.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement has been reduced from 12.9 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 2.4 per cent of GNP in 1989.  In 1990 it should be no more than 2.1 per cent.  This is a major achievement.  We have in fact met the targets on the public finances set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> three years ahead of schedule.  We have now set ourselves the new target of reducing the debt-GNP ratio from the present 122 per cent towards 100 per cent for 1993. It is vital that we achieve this target, and if at all possible, surpass it.  Despite the major success of recent years our national debt still stands at about £25 billion and the servicing of this debt is absorbing about £2 billion annually &mdash; money which is desperately needed to assist job creation and tackle many of our major social problems.</P>
    <P>Continuing progress in reducing our national debt and in restoring order to our public finances is of major importance to the agri-food sector and to all farmers.  This is because of the link between these factors and our interest and inflation rates.  While interest rates unfortunately increased during 1989, this was mainly due to international interest rate developments.  We would expect some reduction in these rates and in Irish rates during 1990.  The vital importance of achieving the lowest possible interest and inflation rates will be clear to farmers who recall the period in our relatively recent past when high interest and high inflation rates contributed to a serious fall in farm income.  In 1990 we are facing into somewhat weaker markets for some of our major farm products and a tight <Col N="775" /> price-cost environment.  This is all the more reason it is in the interest of Irish farmers and food processors that Government policy remains absolutely committed to a prudent stance on the public finances and to a low inflation economy.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to some of the major aspects of the budget which are of particular interest to farmers.  The Minister for Finance and other speakers have dealt with the changes in the rate of income tax and in VAT.  These benefit farmers as taxpayers and consumers in the same way as other citizens, so I will note them but not dwell on them, other than to say that the income tax concessions aimed at helping low income farmers will be of particular relevance to many farm families.</P>
    <P>There are also, however, changes in the tax code which are specially targeted at farmers.  The VAT refund for unregistered farmers is to be increased from 2.0 per cent to 2.3 per cent.  This means that farmers who are not registered for VAT will now be fully compensated for the VAT paid on their inputs.  This continues the policy initiated last year and meets a consistent demand of the farm organisations.</P>
    <P>There are also some important changes in the capital acquisitions tax which will meet the concerns of many farm families, although the changes apply of course to all citizens.  The major change announced is that, in future, the thresholds which determine the value of capital which can be transferred before payment of the capital acquisition tax will be adjusted each year to take account of inflation. Taking the inflation rate of 1989 into account, applying this indexation will mean thresholds of £156,000 in the case of transfers between parent and child; £20,800 as between other family members and £10,000 for non-family transfers.</P>
    <P>An additional change in the capital taxation rules has also been made, which has not received the same amount of notice as the indexation of the thresholds. In future, gifts between spouses are to be <Col N="776" /> exempt from capital acquisitions tax and transfers of property from one spouse to another are to be exampt from stamp duty where such transfers have the effect of creating a joint tenancy in the names of both spouses.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of these changes in capital tax legislation should ensure that many solid and well capitalised farms can be passed within the family from one generation to the next without imposing a major burden on the inheritor.  Clearly a balance must be struck between a fair yield in capital taxation from the wealthier members of society and ensuring that we have an adequately structured farm sector which can compete on European and world markets in the years ahead.  The changes in capital taxation in the budget try to strike that balance.</P>
    <P>Finally on the taxation front, there is a change in rules for stock relief which is relevant to farmers subject to compulsory disposals under the disease eradication schemes.  For disposals of diseased animals arising after 5 April next, the period allowed for restocking before claw-back of stock relief comes into effect will be extended for another year.  This change will be of assistance where postponement of restocking is required under the statutory disease eradication schemes.  It will be of particular importance to the relatively limited number of hardship cases where depopulation has occurred.</P>
    <P>Moving away from the taxation field, there is a number of changes in the budget which provide resources to areas which the Government consider of importance for the future of the agri-food industry.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the vital importance of providing adequate training for those entering agriculture, an additional £600,000 from Exchequer funds and £1.1 million from the European Social Fund is being provided to TEAGASC for agricultural training.  This will go towards defraying the costs of residential training at agricultural and horticultural colleges. This allocation will go a considerable way towards removing the anomalies that exist as between the financial support given to agricultural and other vocational <Col N="777" /> trainees.  It should also encourage more young people to undertake full-time training in agriculture and horticulture.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased with the allocation of £3.5 million for each of the next three years to the Racing Board and Bord na gCon.  This represents about 1.5 per cent of the off-course betting turnover. This allocation will be used for the development of the horse and greyhound industries generally.  The distribution of moneys between the two sectors will be decided on later.  Payment of grants will be contingent on the approval by the Government of suitable projects to be prepared and submitted by the two boards.  This decision demonstrates the Government's commitment to the further development of these industries.  The allocations will do much to restore confidence in the industries which generate about 20,000 jobs in total, from breeding to training, racing and ancillary services. Resources invested in this way should strengthen our tourist potential and will, in a very practical way, promote rural development.</P>
    <P>Two other items announced in the budget are also relevant to our tourist potential and to rural development, in that they are part of the national environment plan.  A total of £450,000 has been allocated for the promotion of organic farming and £100,000 for environmentally sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, is setting up a special unit on organic farming in the Department of Agriculture and Food. The unit will have an overall co-ordinating role and will assess the opportunities for expansion in the sector.  It will assist in the production and marketing of organic products and liaise with the European Commission and other relevant organisations.  The budget makes a special provision of £450,000 designed to cover measures for the promotion and development of the industry as well as the expenses of the new unit.  Organic production is a small but growing sector of the agri-food industry.  Ireland is in an ideal position to capitalise on this development and the action now being <Col N="778" /> taken is designed to ensure that we realise our potential in this area.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the provision of £100,000 for the introduction of a scheme to protect environmentally sensitive areas.  The scheme will provide for the payment of annual premiums to farmers in such areas who introduce and maintain farming methods which protect the environment or maintain the landscape.  Our friends in Northern Ireland have experience in the operation of environmentally sensitive areas schemes and we will be glad to benefit from their experience.</P>
    <P>Finally, provision has been made in the vote of the Department of Agriculture and Food to support the recruitment of a specialist for the establishment of an agricultural unit within DEVCO, the State Agencies Development Co-operation Organisation.  The purpose of this unit will be to promote the use of skilled Irish resources in development programmes abroad.  The programmes for economic reform in Eastern Europe, as well as the many on-going programmes in developing countries, are putting a major emphasis on agricultural and rural development.  The agricultural unit in DEVCO will work towards matching the opportunities in these development programmes to the professional and technical skills which Ireland undoubtedly possesses in the field of agricultural and rural development.  I would like to see Ireland carving out a reputation not just for being the source of the finest quality food and drink, but also as being a provider of high quality skills and agricultural technology.  The allocation to DEVCO is a recognition of the potential which exists in this area and of its desire to promote Irish services abroad.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I welcome this budget in its overall approach of maintaining discipline on the public finances and of easing the burden of taxation in order to promote incentive and to enable people to retain more of their incomes.  From the specifically agricultural viewpoint, there is a number of changes introduced which meet key demands made of the Minister for Finance, in the field of the Capital Acquisitions Tax, the VAT refund and <Col N="779" /> support for agricultural training.  There is a number of imaginative proposals regarding the development of the horse and greyhound industries, organic farming, the environment and the promotion of Irish agricultural skills abroad. It is a budget which, in my view, strikes the correct balance between prudence and innovation and which has broad support throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt so good about it that I even felt a certain degree of affection for the then Minister for Finance.  It was a feeling that wore off rapidly when I got my first pay cheque in April and discovered that what I had thought was a great windfall did not make any difference at all.  That is an experience that will be shared by many people as a result of this budget.</P>
      <P>It is presented as a great giveaway budget with something in it for everybody. Ministers are emphasising the various giveaways contained in this budget and the extent to which people will be better off as a result of it.  The media appear to be confirming that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing that there has been little critical examination of this budget or of the environment action plan which was announced a couple of days beforehand and about which I intend to speak in detail later.  The State broadcasting services almost ran out of superlatives on budget night to describe this budget.  I do <Col N="780" /> not think there will be too many causes for apology on this issue.</P>
    <P>When all the hype dies down people will find that they are not better off, unless of course they are already well off. They will find that in the area of tax, for example, personal tax allowances are not being increased but are still at the 1988 levels.  There is no increase in PAYE or PRSI allowances.  Much of the Revenue buoyancy that was talked about will result directly from this.  In other words, spending by those on the lowest incomes will help to balance the budget.  There is no change in the 48 per cent tax bracket. The single earner earning £9,636, £1,400 below the average industrial wage, will come into the tax net at the 48 per cent band and, on any income over that, when various levels of PRSI are taken into account, will pay 53 per cent.</P>
    <P>Then there are the various clawbacks when one takes into account the extra charges for electricity and telephones.  It is dishonest of the Government to suggest that these increases will not result in extra charges to the public.  The increase in VAT on electricity and telephone charges will have to be paid somehow and they will be paid either by increased cost to the consumer or by the jobs of workers in the ESB and Telecom Éireann or some combination of both.  On top of all of that will come a possible mortgage interest increase in April as a result of the interest increases we have already seen.</P>
    <P>So, in a few short months most PAYE workers will wonder what on earth all the fuss was about and why the budget was presented as being of great benefit.  The Minister laid particular emphasis on his assessment of the economic indicators.  It is remarkable, therefore, that he did not comment on the contribution of Irish workers to economic growth.  Between 1980 and 1989 the productivity of Irish industrial workers increased by 130 per cent at a time when 50,000 industrial jobs were lost to the Irish economy, over a period when real earnings grew by only one-twelfth the rate of increase in productivity, or 11.8 per cent.  As productivity increased, profits to the corporate sector also increased, from <Col N="781" /> £1,739 million in 1980 to £2,815 million in 1986.  In return for that, corporation tax is being reduced.  As the ICTU convenes this week to consider their position on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> what is the message in this budget for the most productive workers in Europe?  The message is that those who have profited most from better economic growth will get the most concessions and those who have contributed most to that economic growth through their productivity and through their labour will get the least.</P>
    <P>There is a peculiar introduction in this budget.  No doubt it is to be welcomed that employees' PRSI is to be abolished for workers earning under £60 a week. What that also does, however, is introduce a second threshold, a second disincentive for workers who are low paid, very often working in part time jobs, to actually seek a pay increase.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann has no confidence in the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The first thing that should be said in this debate is that it is and must be a matter of regret that any Member of this House should have to stand here to declare that they have no confidence in another Member.  It is a matter of regret in a personal sense because I have never been treated in a discourteous manner or in an unpleasant way by the Minister for Health.  He has struggled with a difficult and onerous brief and has done so with a degree of personal dignity and courage. Many of the decisions he has implemented were decisions involving collective Cabinet responsibility and in that sense the motion I have moved and the debate that will follow today and tomorrow represents a declaration by many Members of this House that the handling of our health services not alone by the Minister for Health but by the Government and their immediate predecessor has been disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health was effectively disowned by the Taoiseach during the last general election campaign when he admitted on national radio that he had no idea of the impact of the health cutbacks <Col N="784" /> in the community.  In effect what the Taoiseach was saying to the entire community was that as far as he was concerned the crisis in health was the Minister for Health's fault.  Either the Minister had not told the Taoiseach about the pain, suffering, and anger caused or else he was falsely reassuring him that all this talk of pain and suffering was just hype and propaganda from the Opposition parties and individuals.  That was the message the Taoiseach set out to convey in his notorious radio broadcast in the midst of the last election campaign. The people did not believe it then and they do not believe it now.  They do not believe that the crisis in the health services is a figment of my imagination or those of the Members on the Opposition benches.  Why should they?  In virtually every home there is a story of individual hardship, delay, pain, and inconvenience.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House in regular contact with their constituents can tell a fresh story week in week out about the real crisis that plagues the health services. I could tell this House tonight about the ten years old little girl living in Dublin who needs orthodontic care, but who was told this week that at the present rate of progress through the waiting lists in the Eastern Health Board they will reach her when she is 28 years of age.  That makes it an 18 year waiting list.  I could tell this House about the middle-aged woman looking after two elderly relatives who developed an eye infection which became so bad that eventually she had to have her eye removed.  That woman was sent home within 24 hours of the operation having received no counselling about the traumatic effects of the operation and no back-up to help her cope with the trauma subsequently.  The hospital needed the bed for another urgent case.  They calculated that since the woman in question had been a nurse in her younger years she would be able to cope.</P>
    <P>I could tell this House about people who are getting letters from debt collection agencies hired by health boards to collect the £10 hospital charge which was introduced by the Government from those who did not have it when they came <Col N="785" /> into casualty.  There is now a new breed of vulture working on commission extracting money from people who are poor and frightened and who used to believe that they had a right to health care.  They do not believe that any more. Even charitable organisations, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, are now reporting to me that in some cases they have given money to people who need it to pay for casualty treatment.  I could, as could all of us, tell sensational stories for the duration of this debate, all of which are true.  They add up to two things.  First, they point to the extent of the failure of this Government to preserve the right to health care.  Second, they point to the fact that failure exists in our health services today.</P>
    <P>Every Fianna Fáil Deputy and every Progressive Democrats Deputy who will vote in favour of the Minister's position, who will vote against our no confidence motion tomorrow night, know they are supporting a Minister who has failed.  At the end of the day this debate is all about the failure of the Minister and his Government to understand certain fundamental things.  The first thing he has failed to understand is that access to health care is a basic human right.  He is a decent man, a kind and courteous man, but he does not understand it is his job, given by the Oireachtas, to protect that right and to protect it for every citizen in the land regardless of class or income.</P>
    <P>The second thing the Minister has failed to understand is that you cannot do the job he is supposed to do without a health policy.  This Minister for Health understands and accepts the need for a financial policy.  Indeed, he has been one of the most ardent advocates of Fianna Fáil's conversion in recent years to financial rectitude.  He has lectured everyone from consultant surgeon to patients' groups about the need for balancing the books, having less debt and smaller borrowings, and about the current budget deficit.  No doubt he has lectured the poli-cy-makers in health along the same lines. The consequences have been that the only health policy he has ever followed <Col N="786" /> has been to ask the Department of Finance how much they can afford to give this year and then to force the rights of Irish citizens to fit into whatever parameters the Department of Finance lay down.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, had a health policy when he was in Opposition.  When he was on this side of the House he had a view.  Speaking in this House in 1986 he said it would be wrong and unacceptable to have any more cutbacks in health care and that people could die if the then policy was continued.  He was talking at the time about a Minister for Health who was attempting to rationalise the service without increasing expenditure but who always refused to agree to cuts in overall health expenditure.  The Minister was the former Deputy Barry Desmond.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon, now Minister for Health, led the campaign of vilification Deputy Desmond had to endure, even though Deputy Desmond never closed a hospital bed without opening another one close by.  Recently when Deputy O'Hanlon, Minister for Health, was asked about the campaign he then led, he replied he had done so because Deputy Barry Desmond was too confrontational in his approach and that he would not engage in dialogue; this from the Minister for Health who sent one of his civil servants to sack a health official in Cork Airport, who spent £300,000 of public money to fire one of the foremost consultants from Beaumont Hospital and who last week told me at Question Time that he could not meet the parents of people with a mental handicap.  Those are the fundamental things the Minister for Health has failed to grasp about the job he was charged to do.  Those are the reasons this House must declare it has lost confidence in him.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day it is the Minister for Health and he alone who must carry the responsibility for losing sight of the right of every Irish citizen to enjoy equal access to health care.  It is no longer good enough for him or anyone else to argue that our health service can be treated as one might treat a beggar in the street.  We <Col N="787" /> cannot approach the provision of health care by saying we will allocate to health what we can afford as if it were throwing loose change out of our pocket. In this sense, while it would be easier to argue that the Minister for Health is a victim of collective Government decisions, that has to be seen from the health perspective as a whole.</P>
    <P>The first fundamental role of the Minister for Health is to inform the overall philosophy of the Government.  It is abundantly clear that this Minister for Health has failed signally to do just that. Instead, his philosophy has been informed by the Department of Finance and their mandarins, and the rights of our people have been thrown out of the window.  In the recent past I published a detailed analysis of the financial repercussions of this philosophy, the philosophy of going cap in hand to the Department of Finance, of telling us what we can afford and then deciding to carve the health services into those parameters. I spelled out in detail the repercussions of this lack of philosophy.  The Minister responded by calling this analysis false propaganda without indicating where it was false.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we examine and understand the facts and the scale of the financial cutbacks before we begin to have a picture of the damage that has now been done.  Before examining and outlining again these facts, I have to point out to the House and to the Minister that the only sources I have used or ever used to assemble the data I have published in statements or referred to in speeches in this House have been official sources. Figures for Exchequer health spending are published annually in the revised Book of Estimates and expressed therein as a percentage of GNP.  Figures for spending on individual programmes are published annually in the comprehensive public expenditure programmes. Inflation statistics are made available to anybody who inquires from the CSO, and the figures on the size of our national wealth are available from the same source.  The financial statistics I intend to <Col N="788" /> set out are all drawn from official sources and the Minister, therefore, cannot honestly deny their accuracy.</P>
    <P>Of course, Ministers use figures to suit themselves.  When the Department of Health were asked recently to supply health spending information to a national newspaper for a major article they supplied data which were misleading in the extreme.  As a result the figures published by that newspaper reflected total spending on health, including spending by bodies like the VHI and private spending and, as such, are totally unreliable measures of change and cannot be used for comparison.  The fact is that Exchequer health spending has been cut by 1 per cent of our GNP since the Fine Gael budget published in 1987.  According to the 1988 and 1989 Book of Estimates, health spending was 7 per cent of GNP in 1984, 7 per cent of GNP in 1985, 6.9 per cent of GNP in 1986 and it was cut to 6.6 per cent of GNP in the 1987 Fine Gael budget subsequently adopted by Fianna Fáil, it was 6.3 per cent of GNP in the 1988 budget and 6 per cent of GNP last year.  No official figure has been published yet for Exchequer health spending as a proportion of GNP for this year.  It is reasonable to assume that health spending will not rise, particularly having regard to the expected increase in GNP itself.  The value of 1 per cent of GNP is approximately £190 million.  To put it another way, if we were spending the 7 per cent of GNP that we held for so many years up to the end of 1986 we would be spending almost £200 million extra on our health services this year. That is the true dimension of the cut this Minister has visited upon the health services.</P>
    <P>The way in which that cut has been reflected in each of the health board programmes and the health programmes between 1986 and 1989 must also be considered. The figures I now intend to read into the record again all come from official sources.  I take account of the official increase in the rate of inflation between the end of 1986 and 1989 as being 10.8 per cent.  Let us look at where the cuts were made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> In the general hospitals area the total was a 5.3 per cent real cut.  For voluntary hospitals it was a 6.1 per cent real cut; for regional hospitals &mdash; a real cut of 2.1 per cent; district hospitals &mdash; a real cut of 2.8 per cent; county hospitals &mdash; a real cut of 6.7 per cent. The ambulance and transport service has been cut by 5 per cent.  The services in health board long stay hospitals and homes have been cut by 5.7 per cent.  The contribution to patients in private homes has been cut by 10.8 per cent.  Capital expenditure has been cut by 20.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the community health services area.  The total expenditure on community health has been increased by 8.5 per cent.  The drug subsidy scheme has enjoyed a massive increase of 46.2 per cent, which accounts for the general increase.  Nursing home services were cut by 6.1 per cent; the dental, ophthalmic and aural services, which are facing a crisis, were cut by 10.8 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on psychiatric services was cut by 7.1 per cent; the cost of administration was cut by 44 per cent while services were cut by 11.8 per cent. The total expenditure on services for the handicapped was cut by 2 per cent, but there was an increase in the provison for administration and support services of 29.2 per cent.  There was an increase in the provision for care in special centres of 4.4 per cent, but provision for care in psychiatric hospitals was cut by 10.8 per cent.  The provision for the assessment and care of blind, deaf and otherwise disabled persons was cut by 10.8 per cent; the provision for the rehabilitation services was cut by 10.8 per cent and capital expenditure in this area, which is crying out for residential places for the handicapped, was cut by 76.8 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>In the community welfare area total expenditure was cut by 3.4 per cent in real terms.  Cash allowances and grants were increased by 0.3 per cent but the provision for community social services was cut by 5.6 per cent, by 0.8 per cent for child welfare services and by 10.8 per cent for welfare homes for the aged.  That <Col N="790" /> is the litany.  It is important to put the statistical facts on the record.</P>
    <P>There is a number of points that must be made about the figures before they can be fully understood.  Increases in spending on community care are accounted for by the increased expenditure on drugs and the new contractual arrangements for general practitioners within the GMS scheme.  However, it is the Government's intention that ultimately the GMS will cost less as a result of the changes that were instituted last year.  It must be remembered that the VHI drug refund scheme was abolished so that the increased Exchequer spending does not imply any additional relief for poorer sections of the community. Indeed, although the Minister promised some considerable time ago that he would bring in a replacement drug refund scheme, we have yet to see sight or light of it.  Many organisations, in particular the Asthma Society of Ireland, are appealing to him to put in place the reformed drug subsidy scheme, which they were firmly promised last summer.  Seven or eight months later, they are still waiting and trying to cope with the horrendous bills involved in treating young children with this condition.</P>
    <P>An aspect of community care that has caused a great deal of controversy is the dental, ophthalmic and aural services. The reason is that funding for these services has lagged behind inflation to the tune of 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>The services for the elderly have been decimated.  It is clear that under such headings as district hospitals, ambulance-transport services, nursing home services and all services relating directly to elderly people, there has been a systematic cutback.  I welcome, and I make no bones about it the extra provision announced in the budget for this area and tonight I hope to hear details of where that money is to be spent.  The reality is that there are fewer permanent residential places for the elderly as more of our geriatric and county hospitals have closed since 1987.  Increasing numbers of people have to remain in the community without a <Col N="791" /> hope of a permanent bed and are dependent on the support services that can be provided.  One of the boasts of the last few years has been that whatever else has happened to the health services, the services for the mentally handicapped have been fully protected.  The figures show that the opposite is the case.  The virtual abolition of any capital expenditure in this area is a direct cause of the present crisis in residential facilities for the mentally handicapped.  Facilities for the physically handicapped have been frozen at their present level in cash terms, for three years, after several years of improvement and in real terms that represents a further cut of 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>One area not covered in these figures is the area of community protection.  The Minister for Health has repeatedly stressed that this is his personal priority.  In 1986 we spent a total of £22 million on this area &mdash; in 1989 that figure was increased to just £23.5 million &mdash; in other words a real cut of 3 per cent when we take account of inflation.  That figure accurately describes the Minister's commitment to community protection especially when set aside his decision to abolish the Health Education Bureau and replace it with a bureau operating under the constraints of his own Department.</P>
    <P>All of these figures take account of the recent Supplementary Estimate, which injected an extra £33 million into health care but without that injection that picture would be even bleaker.  Despite the 1990 Estimate, health spending this year will decline still further as a proportion of our national wealth.  All of this financial information, no matter how devastating, is only a part of the picture we must paint. In themselves they only tell one aspect of the story.  We must also examine what hospital closures have meant, the consequences of the removal of the beds, the sacking and non-replacement of staff.  I have had the opportunity in the past week or so to update the information available on some of these issues.</P>
    <P>When I said in my most recent statement that the Minister had closed 20 hospitals he reacted with outrage, &ldquo;false <Col N="792" /> propaganda,&rdquo;&ldquo;untrue and malicious,&rdquo; he said.  So I put down a parliamentary question to ascertain the Minister's position.  I asked him to name each hospital which had been closed.  The Minister's answer will surprise many Members of the House.  He told me that only a few hospitals had closed under his tenure of office, but 19 hospitals, in his phrase, &ldquo;had changed roles.&rdquo;  Some had been sold to private developers, some were day care centres, some were health clinics and so on but none of them &mdash; and this is something that has not yet apparently dawned on the Minister &mdash; is still a public hospital.</P>
    <P>I have to say that I find it incredible that this Minister is prepared to close hospitals but not prepared to admit it.  It is simply unbelievable that the Minister for Health is prepared to hide behind this type of language and to use it not only to defend himself but to accuse others of distorting the facts.  In the same parliamentary question I asked the Minister to give an up-to-date account of the bed numbers of our hospitals.  He was unable to do so.  Since the collation of such statistics is apparently a very complex and time consuming job he said he was not able to provide the answer.  I have to say that I find that extraordinary. When I wrote to the health boards, several were able to supply the information immediately and the others promised to supply it as soon as possible.  Within the past few days the Southern Health Board said in reply that since 1986 they have had to close 325 acute beds, 171 long-stay beds and 322 psychiatric beds, a total of 818 beds in three years.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board have lost 508 beds, the Western Health Board 615 beds and the North Eastern Health Board 147 beds but they have recently opened a 64-bed facility for people with a mental handicap.  The North Western Health Board have lost 331 beds and 30 per cent of their acute beds are closed for six to eight weeks each year.  Those five health boards between them have lost 2,500 beds since the present Minister became Minister for Health.  That is the most up-to-date information available.  I believe <Col N="793" /> that when the figures for the other health board areas and the major voluntary hospitals are available to me, they will show that the total number of bed closures under the Minister's tenure as Minister for Health is quite alarming.</P>
    <P>The final figures to be considered are those relating to staff.  There has been a certain amount of controversy about the figures I have used in the past.  The Minister has frequently accused his opponents of inflating the figures published. In a statement I issued on 11 January I said to the Minister that he had got rid of 5,212 staff across all areas of activity in the health field.  The Minister appears to think this is an over-estimate. Parliamentary replies dated 29 July 1988 and 30 January 1990 yielded the following information: total staff employed in 1986, 62,481; in 1987, 58,091 and in 1988, 56,357.  In other words, according to the Minister's own figures, there were 6,124 fewer staff working in the health services at the end of 1989 than there were when the Minister took office.  The recitation of these statistics is essential.  It is impossible to understand the root of the crisis without appreciating the extent of all these statistics.  I might reiterate that all of these statistics have been drawn from official parliamentary questions or from official reports.</P>
    <P>However, statistics alone convey only the cold back-drop to the problem.  We cannot forget that conditions have been worsened for people who suffer from spina bifida and hydrocephalus, mental handicap or psychiatric illness and to asthmatics, AIDS victims and a host of other particularly vulnerable people.  To their suffering must be added the hardship and indignity caused to the elderly and the infirm.  What all of these groups have in common is that they are, to a very considerable extent, defenceless.  It took a general election to bring home the reality of people's suffering to the politicians who caused it.  The politicians who caused this suffering are those who proposed the Health Estimates of the last three years and those who refused to oppose them.  For three years, three budgets, and three sets of Estimates, the <Col N="794" /> Labour Party have sought to bring home the extent and depth of this crisis to the previous Government and the other parties who were part of the consensus of the last Dáil.  It was not until that Dáil was dissolved and its members started to knock on people's doors, they began to realise that what we had been saying was true.</P>
    <P>I find that all the more remarkable, especially given the Taoiseach's extraordinary admission during the campaign that the response of the new Government to the crisis had been so pathetic.  It can only be described as even more pathetic in the light of the publication of the document <i>Let's Look Again</i> by the Joint Health Commission of the Catholic Church.  That document unequivocally describes health care as a basic human right, so basic a right that there is an explicit obligation on the community to discriminate positively in favour of the poor.  This view has been endorsed by the recently published report of the Commission on Health Funding.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I want to reflect on the reality of the impact of these cuts.  It was important to stitch in the figures for the Minister's attention but the consequences on the ground are being faced by all of us in our clinics, more especially by those unfortunate enough to be dependent on our health services.  An example that has struck every Member of this House, that has moved every Member of this House, was the story of Samantha Webb, the 22-year old handicapped woman who was left alone by the death of her mother and the long illness of her father, for whom no place could be found in any of the caring agencies in the Dublin area despite the repeated assurances of the Minister for Health &mdash; on one occasion in the debate on mental handicap in this House just prior to Christmas &mdash; that there would be a place for all people in that position. After all the publicity, the Minister told us that a place had now been found for Samantha by St. Michael's House and that the risk that she would have to be sent to Monasterevan had been averted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> What the Minister did not tell us was that a place could be found for Samantha only because one of the St. Michael's House residents died last week.  What the Minister did not tell us was that St. Michael's House have 22 other Samantha Webbs on their waiting list, profoundly handicapped adults in desperate need of residential care.  What the Minister did not tell us was that St. Michael's House have a priority list of 90 people whose need is almost as great as that of Samantha Webb.  What the Minister did not tell us was that the only additional residential accommodation in St. Michael's House since he became Minister for Health was the provision of one hostel capable of accommodating five people.</P>
    <P>Neither has the Minister told us that there are 260 severely handicapped adults in the Dublin area with no day service whatsoever available to them and that there are 100 children in the same position.  He has not told us that St. Michael's House have lost 36 staff since he assumed office.  Neither has his colleague, the Minister for Education, told us that all of the teachers' aides have been removed from the special national schools run by that agency even though those schools are now catering for more severely handicapped pupils than ever before.  Neither has the Minister told us that independence training, physiotherapy and speech therapy have almost ceased to exist as part of the services provided by St. Michael's House.</P>
    <P>St. Michael's House is only one of the agencies providing services for people with a mental handicap.  All of the others have similar tales of crisis management to tell if only there was an ear to listen. If that is his legacy is it any wonder the Minister is afraid to meet the Parents' Association for People with a Mental Handicap?</P>
    <P>If we are looking for an indictment of this Minister perhaps it is to be found in the story of the 14 people who travel three times a week from his constituency for urgent kidney dialysis treatment in the already over-crowded and over-worked unit in Beaumont Hospital.  His <Col N="796" /> failure to provide a treatment facility in the North Eastern Health Board area &mdash; one of only two health board areas where dialysis is not available locally in a special unit &mdash; has compounded the severe problems faced by the renal unit in Beaumont Hospital, supposedly the national facility.</P>
    <P>The renal unit in Beaumont caters for three types of patients &mdash; those who have just been diagnosed, those who are acutely ill from renal failure and those who have just had transplants.  It is essential in a unit of that kind that facilities be of the highest standard since every patient in the unit is more than usually prone to infection.  For the last two years that unit has housed an average of 41 to 45 patients each night in St. Peter's Ward, which is the designated ward.  But St. Peter's Ward has 31 beds only.  As a result some patients sleep in the treatment unit on trolleys each night, spending the rest of their days on chairs because there are not sufficient beds for them.  The best description that has been coined for the way in which these patients I have just mentioned are being treated was coined by one intimately involved with the unit, a patient himself, who described it as a &ldquo;battery hen unit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one could find one's best indictment of the Minister in the recent history of just one of our general hospitals. The treatment of the Clare County Hospital in Ennis is typical of that of many other hospitals.  In the 1989 General Election both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael gave a commitment that that hospital would be maintained at a minimum of 100 beds.  There are now 78 beds along with a six-bed intensive care unit in that hospital.  In 1987 the complement of beds in that hospital was reduced.  There is a 26-bed ward closed at present in the hospital.  During January 1990 the number of patients was 100 and the average number in a six-bed day care unit during January was 12 to 14.  Occupancy in the hospital on selected days in January was as follows: January 1, 112 patients; January 3, 103 patients as well as 15 patients in the six-bed day care unit; January 13, 95 patients as well as 14 patients <Col N="797" /> in the six-bed day care unit; January 21, 95 patients.  The health board estimate that it would cost £500,000 per year to reopen the 26-bed ward.  The local Fianna Fáil organisation have asked the Minister for Health to provide a 100-bed hospital in Ennis and have sought a meeting with him to pursue this objective but they have not had much luck so far in getting the assistance that is so obviously needed.</P>
    <P>When gathering the information I wanted to present to the Minister, I really did not know where to start or end.  I have files on every aspect of medicine and they all add up to a litany of dreadful hardship and suffering.  It is very hard to encapsulate into 40 minutes here the full degree of that suffering.  The last phone call I received from my constituency before I left Wexford this morning was from a mother who had hoped to get her mentally handicapped son who is 31 years old into Dawn House in Wexford, which the Minister opened last week, but unfortunately there is no room for him.  When I said I was going up to the Dáil to move this motion tonight she said: &ldquo;Go get him and tell him the extent of the suffering that is here&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do my best to disregard all the utterances from that Deputy.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, access to a proper health service is a fundamental human right.  A majority Labour Government would introduce a comprehensive national health service, phased in over six years.  We would switch the main emphasis on health care back <Col N="798" /> to health promotion and illness prevention, to primary care in the community, and we would reduce our level of dependence on institutional health care. We would also set health spending at a fixed proportion of our national wealth so that improvements in the quality and range of health care and related social services would go hand-in-hand with economic growth.</P>
      <P>Labour regard a two-tier health service as completely unacceptable.  In this connection we regard the development of 600 private beds in our health system at a time when between 4,000 and 5,000 beds are closed down as completely unacceptable. We reject completely the notion that the State can be used to subsidise such a development when it cannot afford to provide basic health services for ordinary people.  Access to a high standard of health care and to the maximum protection of human dignity should never be dependent on ability to pay.  The legacy of this Minister for Health has been an insult to human dignity.</P>
      <P>As I said at the beginning of my speech, I have no reason to believe Deputy O'Hanlon is other than a decent man but he has failed to protect one of the most fundamental rights of all our citizens. Because he has failed and because he has ignored the growing crisis that he and his policies have created, this House has no choice but to declare that it has lost confidence in him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The refusal by the Minister for Health to acknowledge the extent of the crisis in the health service and his failure to reorganise the delivery of health care are the principal reasons for this vote of no confidence.  The deterioration in health care over his period of office has been unacceptable.  The waiting lists for public patients for hospital treatment is too long.  For most public patients the waiting period for a hip replacement operation is three to four years and for a cataract eye operation it is two years.  Statements were made during the election by the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin to the <Col N="799" /> effect that people are going blind because of the length of the waiting list there.</P>
      <P>Mentally handicapped adults do not have assured access to full-time residental care when their parents pass on. There is no routine dental service for medical card holders and their dependants. Community care facilities are at best patchy and at worst non-existent in certain parts of the country.  Practical examples of this are inadequate care in the home for Alzheimer's patients, a total lack of access to speech therapy particulary for the handicapped, and a total lack of access to occupational therapy services.  Old age pensioners with medical cards, under the present Minister for Health, have to do without transport from out-patients clinics at hospitals. They are unable to get dentures on their medical cards and invariably they cannot get financial assistance, despite legal provision for this and statutory obligations on the health boards, if they are in a nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over recent months many individual health issues have been highlighted due to a lack of proper care and services. These include the growth in the AIDS epidemic where already 59 people have died.  It is reckoned that the number of people HIV positive is doubling every nine months.  Yet, when a motion was put down in this House in relation to haemophiliacs, the Minister assured us that within a fortnight, when a particular committee had reported, a national AIDS plan would be put into operation to meet the medical and welfare needs of AIDS patients.  Casualty departments are still overcrowded and patients often have to wait several hours before seeing a doctor.  There is no national programme for adequate places in workshops or sheltered employment for the physically disabled. Again, the Minister has failed to implement his much promised drugs subsidy scheme after the abolition of the VHI drugs refund scheme.  In February last year he promised in this House that by August there would be a drugs subsidy scheme in operation where people could go to their local chemist and would not <Col N="800" /> have to part with any more than £28 per month.  A year later that scheme still has not been set up.</P>
    <P>All of these different problem areas have been highlighted over the past two years.  However, what finally prompted this motion was the crisis in hospitals in the past two months.  Seriously ill patients were refused access to hospitals.  Others were piled up in corridors open to cross infection.  Others were prematurely discharged. The death rate rose in most key hospitals by an average of 60 per cent over this time last year.  Specifically the death rates rose over a given period in December by 129 per cent in Limerick Regional Hospital; 92 per cent in Beaumont Hospital, and 84 per cent in St. Vincent's Hospital.  No proper explanation has been given for these figures.</P>
    <P>The hospital crisis was so severe that what was termed &ldquo;routine admissions&rdquo; were cancelled on a widespread basis. Basically, this meant that people who had been waiting months and even years for hospital treatment had, at the last minute, their appointments shelved because their beds had been taken by patients admitted on an accident and emergency basis.  My office was inundated with calls particularly relating to Dublin hospitals, especially St. James's Hospital where patients had been told to fast in the first week of January prior to operations and were turned away when they arrived because the operations had been cancelled.  I will give one example arising from the chaos when we switched over to the 24 hour accident and emergency admission system.  I will quote from one standard letter from the Secretary-Manager of St. Vincent's Hospital to all ward sisters, consultant surgeons and physicians, dated 12 December 1989.</P>
    <P>We regret that once again we shall have to ask you to co-operate with the decision we are forced to make today, i.e. to cancel elective admissions for the present.</P>
    <P>This measure is essential because there are 28 `extra' beds in position today ... Requests for urgent admissions, when the crisis abates, should <Col N="801" /> be channelled through this office until further notice.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Until further notice&rdquo; in some cases meant until the third week in January. This was simply unacceptable.  Some of the cases outlined in the media and elsewhere has been unacceptable in terms of patients' rights.  Even more deplorable in the midst of this crisis was the Minister's response.  The Minister kept referring to aeroplane crashes and the unpredictability of a flu epidemic.  This is despite the fact that as far back as November, there was a rampant flu epidemic in Britain and Northern Ireland and medical laboratories here were predicting a similar occurrence here.  When it came, neither vaccines nor beds were available in sufficient supply.  The Minister for Health has consistently sought not to recognise the extent of this problem but rather to accuse politicians, consultants, doctors, nurses and the media of being hysterical and alarmist.</P>
    <P>I could quote many cases, some of them referred to by Deputy Howlin, in relation to the hospital panic we saw but I will give examples of two which landed on my desk one day.  These cases arose on 22 and 23 December and they bear testimony to the situation I refer to. When the debate is over I will forward this correspondence to the Minister so that he can have an inquiry into each case.  The first case relates to a family who were particularly concerned about the treatment of their mother.  I will give an outline of what happened in this case by reading extracts from a letter.</P>
    <P>On Friday 22nd December, our mother .. was discharged from your hospital ... When I arrived to collect her, she appeared to be extremely unwell, but I was assured ... that the doctor ... had examined her and that she was physically perfectly well and only depressed.  I brought my mother home to my house where she was to spend Christmas.  She was unable to sit up straight in my car and had to be helped up the steps of my house and up to bed where she remained.  My sister and I watched over her that day <Col N="802" /> and night as she appeared so ill.  She was unable to eat and we had great difficulty in getting her to take any liquid.  She was both delirious and incontinent.  Her breathing was very distressed and although she had not the energy to cough a lot of green matter emanated from her mouth.  We hoped by morning that she would improve but in fact she had deteriorated.</P>
    <P>Then on 23 December the GP was called.  But while waiting for him the woman involved became so concerned about the condition of her mother that she called an ambulance.  Just before the ambulance arrived her GP also came and agreed that the mother's condition was so critical that it was best to allow the ambulance to take her to casualty as soon as possible.  She was taken to the casualty department at 3.30 p.m. At 6.30 p.m. the family were told that their mother was being admitted to a ward.  At 7 p.m. the family called to the ward and were told that the ward was expecting their mother any minute but that she was still in casualty. They went down to casualty where they spoke with a number of doctors who at first appeared sympathetic.  About 9 p.m. the mother was examined by another doctor and while this examination took place the old lady was too weak to sit up without assistance.  She was very ill, being extremely dehydrated, not having had anything to drink for 48 hours.  The doctor said that she was not ill enough to warrant admission.</P>
    <P>My sister-in-law offered that our family would look after my mother throughout the night in casualty but at least she would be within the reach of &ldquo;expert&rdquo; help.</P>
    <P>This was rejected.  They eventually had to put their mother into a wheelchair as she was too weak to stand and lift her into the back of a car.  She spent another bad night with her breathing even more distressed, steadily getting weaker.  Earlier that morning &mdash; Christmas Eve &mdash; she contacted her GP who was astonished to learn that she had been refused admission to hospital and tried another hospital. An hour later she was brought to <Col N="803" /> St. James's Hospital and after being examined she was immediately transferred to intensive care where she died two days later from pneumonia.</P>
    <P>I enclose a copy of her death certificate...</P>
    <P>This situation is totally unacceptable and the family were horrified.</P>
    <P>Our family has no doubt that had my mother never been discharged or at least readmitted and given the necessary physiotherapy treatment while she was a tiny bit stronger, she would be alive today.</P>
    <P>Lest the House think that was an isolated case, on the same night 22 December in another Dublin hospital a lady from Fingal Street in Dublin 8 was knocked down by a motorbike at 5.30 p.m. at Dolphin's Barn.  She was taken to a hospital and sent home in a paid taxi at 11 p.m. in agonising pain which she suffered throughout the night.  An ambulance was called the next day and she was taken back to the hospital.  The X-ray from the previous night had been mislaid and a second set of X-rays revealed fractured shoulders and toes plus bruises. Subsequently she was kept in hospital in plaster until the end of January.</P>
    <P>In both those cases the outcome was horrific and the subsequent medical diagnosis was death or that the patient needed urgent care.  That is but a sample of the cases I have been hearing of.  Since the flu epidemic, we have seen two alarming examples of how seriously the Minister is out of touch with the situation.  Firstly, I refer to the announcement last week by senior cardiac surgeons that they were cutting by half the level of heart operations in the Mater Hospital for public patients because there were only 25 beds available and they were not prepared to discharge patients prematurely.</P>
    <P>So that it will not appear that we are jumping in on this vote of no confidence as some sort of cynical political exercise, I will refer to what the Minister said in Dáil debates since I have represented <Col N="804" /> Fine Gael on health, putting forward Private Members' motions.  On 25 October 1988 the Minister said that he rejected utterly the suggestion that there was a problem about the quality of health care in this country.  The Minister then sought to mislead the public in an interview in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday 29 January when he said in relation to the waiting lists:</P>
    <P>I accept there are waiting lists and the length of some of them is unacceptable to me but we have been addressing this with £15 million extra we put into the service last year.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to reconcile this extra money that the Minister has been allocating with what the Minister said in this House at columns 810 and 811 on 20 July when moving the Supplementary Estimate for £15 million.</P>
    <P>The additional resources are being allocated as follows: (a) introduction of sectoral accident and emergency service in the Eastern Health Board area: £1.5 million; (b) operations this year to reduce waiting lists, with priority ear, nose, throat and hip replacement operations: £1.7 million:</P>
    <P>The other £9 million went simply towards the cessation of planned bed closures, restoration of bed-weeks already lost through summer closures and the opening of additional beds.  The Minister did not allocate £15 million to deal with the waiting lists but only a paltry £1.7 million. The Minister said at column 681 of the Official Report of 15 November 1989:</P>
    <P>We have an excellent service with essential treatment at the highest level available on demand and most elective treatment available within a reasonable time frame.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this reasonable time frame and at what Doctors Neligan and Wood had to say in relation to the matter.  They were not prepared to discharge patients before the necessary ten-day period had elapsed.  I will give the instance and the name of a patient who had a heart by-pass operation as a public patient in the <Col N="805" /> Mater Hospital on 4 January.  He was sent to St. Vincent's on 7 January, only to be sent on 11 January to a corridor in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny.  Cardiac surgeons were put in the impossible situation where they either had to discharge people prematurely or reduce the number of operations, and the Minister says that operations are available within a reasonable time frame.  There are 600 patients on that waiting list for heart treatment.  At two per week one can quickly work out how long it would take to get through the waiting list.</P>
    <P>This applies not just in heart surgery. Deputy Joe Doyle brought to my attention the case of a lady in Ringsend who was awaiting admission to the Adelaide Hospital.  In correspondence the Minister's former secretary at the Department, Deputy Flanagan, has clearly outlined the fact that this lady needs urgent admission to the Adelaide Hospital but that she will not be admitted for months and perhaps years.  This is a totally unacceptable situation.</P>
    <P>We have seen adults with mental handicap whose parents or family circumstances have broken down, who had to depend on health care workers to provide night time accommodation for them. This is despite the fact that repeatedly in the Dáil the Minister has given assurances that the problems of hospital waiting lists and residential care for the mentally handicapped were looked after.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote what the Minister said on 5 December in relation to residential places for the mentally handicapped:</P>
    <P>This will ensure that when parents are no longer living there is the assurance that he or she will be cared for in a setting by people who are understanding of their particular needs.  I believe that this is simply not an ideal but is, in fact, the practice in every case ..</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>I am unaware &mdash; in fact I could not envisage a situation &mdash; where if the <Col N="806" /> parents or a parent died or something happened suddenly that a mentally handicapped child or adult would not be looked after.</P>
    <P>On 31 January a statement was made by the manager of St. Michael's House, Mr. Moloney, in relation to Samantha Webb:</P>
    <P>It used to be the case that a parent had to die for a child to get a residential place but that is not enough any more. There are two places coming up soon but they will go to people worse off than Samantha, if you can imagine that.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the Minister is short on credibility when his own statements have no substance?  However, it is never enough simply to criticise.  Fine Gael have consistently, over recent years, put forward an alternative strategy to reorganise the health service.  Last September, this policy was strongly vindicated by the recommendations of the Health Commission.  Their singular most significant recommendation was the need to change the present administrative structure.  I should like to briefly quote from page 15 and the summary of their conclusions:</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Commission's conclusion is that the solution to the problem facing the Irish health services does not lie primarily in the system of funding but rather in the way that services are planned, organised and delivered.  The present administrative structures have a number of weaknesses. They confuse political and executive functions, undermining both.  They fail to achieve a proper balance between national and local decision-making.  The decision-making process does not provide a sufficient role for information and evaluation. Accountability within the structure is inadequate; there is insufficient integration of related services and the interests of individual patients and clients are not adequately represented.</P>
    <P>They go on to clearly define the need to set up an alternative approach, the need <Col N="807" /> to set up a national executive health agency, a system of evaluation, to define the roles of the hospitals and the different constituent structures and to set up an independent appeals mechanism so that patients and clients can get their rights. What happened?  The Minister, having kicked to touch for two years, said he could not make any decision about the long term reorganisation of the health service until he received the report.  What did he do?  He did not issue a statement either for or against the recommendations and said he would ask for everybody's opinion on the report.  We fundamentally believe that until the delivery of our health care service is taken out of the Department of Health and put into a semi-State organisation which will professionally manage all aspects of health care, we will not see an improvement in the standard of our health care services.  The role of the Minister and the Department should simply be to establish minimum legal rights for patients, an appeal system for consumer dissatisfaction, an overall policy role, total authority over funding and a legislative role.</P>
    <P>The day to day delivery of health care should be put into a professional executive agency, a bord sláinte, similar to the relationship between the NHS and the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain.  At present, the Department of Health try to oversee the day to day management of health boards, voluntary public hospitals, voluntary organisations which provide mainline health services and other bodies covering everything from the Health Research Board to the National Rehabilitation Board.  Such a board could bring a professionalism and competence that is sadly lacking in our current health services. They would immediately identify savings and reinvest this money in the front line of health care where extra resources are needed.  I should like to give examples of where practical savings can be made.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that up to £28 million could be saved on our drugs bill by renegotiating in a commercial fashion the <Col N="808" /> way we purchase drugs.  Our drugs bill in 1989 was £165 million.  Of this, £125 million related to general practitioners prescribing and £40 million through hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are two types of basic drugs. Branded drugs have a patent life of maybe ten to 14 years.  No one else can produce that medical compound except the company with the patent.  However, when the lifetime of the patent is ended, anyone can produce that identical medical compound provided they get a licence from the National Drugs Advisory Board.  This does not mean that they will produce a &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo;, a thrift or a St. Bernard equivalent of the drug, they must produce the identical medical compound of exactly the same quality. Generic drugs &mdash; or branded equivalents as they are called because they usually have a brand name &mdash; are 30 per cent cheaper than the branded product.</P>
    <P>What do we find when we look at our drugs expenditure of £165 million?  Up to £96 million was on branded drugs which could have been substituted by generics or branded equivalents.  A 30 per cent saving on £96 million is £28 million.  The present deal which the Department of Health negotiated with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries expires next July and it is vital that the Minister and the Government act to ensure much better value for money.  This will not only bring about more Irish jobs &mdash; because there is a substantial generic chemical industry in Ireland &mdash; it will bring the price of branded drugs down.  We must move from being linked to UK prices because they are simply out of line with those on the Continent.  This is a clear example of where a lack of a commercial modern professional approach is costing patients and staff vital resources that are so urgently needed in the areas of geriatric care and mental handicap.</P>
    <P>A semi-State body would quickly establish non health areas that are at present administered by our health service which is unnecessary and simply amounts to administrative duplication. We have throughout the country a network of community welfare officers and <Col N="809" /> income maintenance through supplementary welfare allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and so on, which would more effectively be administered by the Department of Social Welfare with their network of social welfare officers.  Similarly, we have a dual structure of optical and dental treatment schemes whereby currently medical card holders or the 40 per cent of the population who are poorest get nothing effectively, whereas some company directors and bank managers can have free dental care under the PRSI scheme.  We need to take all treatment benefit schemes and place them under the Department of Health.  This reorganisation would save money and provide a better service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has often said that the cheapest and simplest form of medical care is at the primary level of the general practitioners' surgery.  This is, of course, correct yet, when we look at areas like Tallaght and Clondalkin &mdash; I visited Tallaght last week, an area with a population of 80,000 people &mdash; we find that general practitioners there have to refer all their patients into city-based hospitals in order to obtain the most basic of diagnostic services such as X-ray facilities, blood tests and physiotherapy.</P>
    <P>Why can the Minister not put in place in the local health clinic at Tallaght, and at community care level generally, these facilities available directly to general practitioners instead of having to refer every patient to our over-stretched hospitals such as St. James's?  We need to radically review our medical management to build up and strengthen general practice, including such work as ECGS, on a quick and more effective basis.  There is no use in telling the people of Tallaght that they will have to wait. We must bear in mind that the people there have to take two and three children on a chaotic public transport system to the city hospitals.  Are we telling them that they will have to wait until 1993 before the Tallaght hospital will be built?</P>
    <P>The Minister also consistently points to the high proportion of our health <Col N="810" /> expenditure that is absorbed by our hospitals. What has he done to streamline expenditure on our hospital system other than to apply cash limits which are based on nothing more than last year's expenditure of money for each hospital?  Let us take two hospitals with a budget of £10 million.  One hospital may achieve savings and have an outturn of £9.9 million while the other may go over budget and spend £11 million.  In effect, what the Minister is doing by cutting them both by 3 per cent is saying to the good manager, &ldquo;Do not achieve any more savings or I will penalise you&rdquo;, and he is condoning the budget of the hospital that over-spent.  We do not have a national hospital plan setting out the exact requirements, in conjunction with Comhairle na nOspidéal, of tertiary services, regional services and county surgical and medical facilities.  We need a national network of community hospitals that will provide low technology hospital care to relieve the pressure on expensive acute hospital beds which can cost up to £1,500 per week.</P>
    <P>It is those hospitals, such as former district hospitals, fever hospitals and sanitoriums, that have been taken out of the system in the past three years and were so sadly lacking to deal with the recent requirements of the elderly at risk.  Combined with this national hospital plan we need clinical budgeting which will link the level of money issued to a hospital to the level of output or treatment it is to provide on a reasonable basis of costings, for example, £3,500 for a hip replacement operation.  At the moment, we do not have enough basic information in place to make assessments as to which hospitals are giving better value for money.</P>
    <P>The third piece of reorganisation that is necessary in relation to hospitals is the internal management of each hospital. We have a lack of professionalism and training here.  All the elements of hospital accommodation, catering, heating, laundry services, and purchasing, require the most up-to-date techniques as well as an input from clinicians to ensure the best use of resources.  There is no coherent <Col N="811" /> policy by the Minister, or his Department, to put in place such a strategy for our hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister must deal with the inequalities in relation to hospital treatment. It has been clearly pointed out in the health commission's report that the common contract for hospital consultants is a factor in this.  We need more consultant appointments in our hospitals especially in relation to certain specialities, and we need a greater full-time public sector commitment.  I believe there is a willingness by consultants to enter into meaningful discussions to ensure that our waiting lists are eliminated. Yet, the Minister has not put in place any genuine proposals to get to grips with this situation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the costings of many aspects of health care in relation to hospitals the difference between the cost of five day care hospitals on a Monday to Friday basis and seven day hospital care is almost double. We need to radically examine what elective treatments can be carried out on a five day basis by simply reorganising the timetables of consultants and hospital staff. This, of course, is separate to the ongoing seven day 24-hour need for accident/emergency admissions and care.</P>
    <P>The Minister has often referred to the future cost of the health service with the developments of new technology and the impossibility of funding these welcome developments.  It is regrettable that the Minister has taken no steps to consider how the EC level, or even with bilateral arrangements with health services abroad, such as Britain, we could pool our resources to develop the latest high technology expertise so that operations such as liver transplants would be freely available here.  Tragically, every liver transplant operation here has been unsuccessful.  For a country of our size this is the only logical way to proceed on a rational basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to community care, we need to recognise the particular needs of the elderly.  The number of people over 65 years will increase by 7.4 per cent <Col N="812" /> between the 20-year period of 1981 to the year 2001.  Within those figures the age group over 75 years will rise by more than 20 per cent and over 80 years will rise by 28 per cent.  We need to now plan for their needs.  An excellent report, <i>The Years Ahead</i>, produced by a group under the chairmanship of Mr. Robbins, a former Assistant Secretary of the Department, documented what we need to do.  That report stated that there are three target groups, the elderly who live alone in the community, those with their own family relatives who are trying to cope, and, thirdly, those who require residential care.  The report stated that we need to put in place sheltered housing for those who live alone.  It should be in a central location that will have the backup of meals-on-wheels, that will link in with a proper security system and will give them specialist services such as chiropody.</P>
    <P>Nothing is happening at local level between local authorities and health boards to prepare such a programme of sheltered housing.  We continue to have the minimalist approach to assistance and allowances to the elderly and those being cared for in their homes.  The prescribed relatives' allowance is so restrictive that one cannot get it if one is a married woman of if one has any other income.  I have no doubt that old age pensioners will lose their free electricity allowance and their telephone rental allowance if a son or daughter goes to live with them to care for them on a full-time basis.  We do not have a positive plan to care for the elderly in their home environment. We need now to establish a uniform system of geriatric assessment committees, geriatric departments in acute hospitals and uniform adequate levels of residential care throughout the country. It is estimated that 4 per cent of the elderly require residential care.  The present crazy <i>ad hoc</i> system of subventions to nursing homes is unacceptable and is causing deep distress to many patients and elderly people.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a coherent strategy to deal in this way with the elderly living alone in the community, living at home <Col N="813" /> with their families, or requiring residential care, every winter will be like the present one, where elderly people at risk will require hospitalisation and it simply will not be available to them adequately. I issue that warning to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Any semblance of a coherent preventative health policy is absent from the present Minister, apart from a few photo opportunities of exercises with models.  I regret there was no increase in the taxation on cigarettes in this year's budget, and I would specifically like to see a proportion of proceeds of tax revenue from tobacco used to promote the availability to all of free bi-annual health checkups to highlight individual ill-health, earlier diagnosis, and effective screening.</P>
    <P>Our hospital admission system has a number of increasing problems.  We have moved from one situation where people have died on trolleys due to lack of beds, to the other where accident/emergency admissions have completely closed down routine admission departments and caused mass cancellation of appointments. At the present time in Dublin a general practitioner can no longer refer in a patient directly to a hospital bed. Instead, they must go through the accident/emergency system only to have their patients seen by a doctor who is many years junior in experience and in qualifications to the non-consultant hospital doctor.  The Minister must immediately arrange for more senior doctors to be appointed to oversee the admission systems to our Dublin hospitals.  This must include a system whereby general practitioners can obtain immediate access for seriously ill patients into hospital. Ongoing monitoring of patients should take place in casualty to ascertain the delays in seeing doctors, and flexible arrangements should be put in place so that we will not have the farce we had in Ennis and Kilkenny hospitals where people were piled up in corridors at a time when in the same building there were locked wards and empty beds.</P>
    <P>This motion is not, as the Minister would like to present it, a cynical political exercise.  It is the culmination of almost three years of frustration by the general <Col N="814" /> public in relation to our health services. This frustration has centred on an essential inequality of access to health care, which is unfair and worsening.  As I have outlined, for a public patient in need of a serious operation the time when this will be performed, and one's access to hospital is dependent on whether one is a member of the VHI.  Fundamental to the beliefs of my party is the fact that there should be equality of access to hospital care.  There should be equality of access to dental care.  That system has broken down.  If I wished to be purely party political I could remind the Minister that when he was in Opposition he orchestrated a campaign throughout the country during which slogans were put on hoardings that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.  He was the one who, with the present Taoiseach, ensured that Fianna Fáil dominated and controlled the health boards and ensured that any reasonable, rational curtailment of expenditure put forward by the then Minister was not met.  They ran up huge deficits.  Fianna Fáil majorities on the health boards made those decisions and frustrated the then Government.</P>
    <P>This has no useful purpose.  Instead we must refocus on the needs of the people we all seek to serve.  I greatly regret that the only real response the Minister and the Government have made to this motion has been to concoct a secret, localised backstreet deal with Deputy Fahey to secure his vote and the Minister's survival.  It is similar to the deal which took place last June in the discussions with Deputy Foxe.  Like the Fahey deal, they will be seen to be strictly short-term and meaningless.  The net effect is to demoralise further those working in the front line of health care as they see the only way to obtain change is through political blackmail and political expediency.</P>
    <P>This Minister for Health, and more especially this Cabinet, have not learned the lessons of the last general election. They have ignored the chorus of concern from all involved in the health sector and are simply content to rely on short-term <Col N="815" /> meagre responses.  If the Minister continues to ignore the medium term changes that are required in the health service and fails to have any vision of where the health services will be throughout the nineties, the position will only deteriorate further.  In other countries, given such unprecedented concern over health services, the Minister would feel obliged to take the only honourable course open to him and resign.  Given his stubborn refusal to consider this, I call on Deputies on this side of the House to pass their verdict on this Minister's performance and support the motion.</P>

      <P>I listened to the two Deputies from Wexford, both from the same constituency and spokespersons for health for their respective parties.

They recognise that both of them cannot be Minister for Health and they will have to try to upstage each other in the meantime to see which will win out.</P>
      <P>I was in Wexford on Friday last and visited the hospital there.  I was very impressed by the caring and dedicated staff and the very high quality and level of service provided there.  I met only one complaint, to the effect that their two Deputies are running around the country chasing hares and neither has ever stood up in this House and said a word about the excellent service available in Wexford or acknowledged that although Deputy Garret FitzGerald when Taoiseach went to Wexford and promised to start building the hospital in 1986 they had to wait until this Government came to power.  I allocated the money so that Wexford hospital could start and I was very glad to see the progress which has been made.</P>

I do not know whether Deputy De Rossa will lead for them, but I am sure he will have informed his spokesman, based on his new-found European experience, that the other European countries are facing the same difficulties we faced in the health services in trying to fund an ever-increasing demand.  I am sure he will tell his spokesmen that the 'flu epidemic which has spread across Europe caused exactly the same problems and was dealt with in exactly the same way as it was dealt with here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates referred to two patients whose cases he wished to have investigated. I am surprised that he has not sent me the letters before now but I will be very glad to investigate those cases. The significant point, which Deputy Yates himself has made, is that the decisions were made on the basis of medical assessment, not for any other reason.</P>
      <P>In the past few months some Members of the Opposition have proved that it is very easy to become popular on the health issue by following a few simple rules.  They start making outlandish claims.  We have plenty of them tonight which will be dealt with either by me or one of my colleagues.  There have been claims about numbers of people sneaking into hospital beds through casualty wards.  Never mind if the claim is true or not &mdash; by the time the facts are discovered the moving finger that writes the headlines will have moved on.

      <P>Deputies will be greatly helped, if they go down this road, by the immediacy of radio and television.  One can pour forth any amount of stories and by the time the facts are available to contradict these claims the programme has moved on.

When I qualified I spent three years in hospital practice.  I went into general practice in 1963, believing I had completed my medical education.  In fact it was only beginning because my patients started to educate me.  Every day in my surgery my patients taught me lessons that have added up to a set of essential principles for me.</P>

      <P>It might be appropriate for Deputy Shatter, Deputy Dukes and Deputy Yates that my patients taught me that fear sickens people and makes them less able to cope.  Knowing what is going on and when one is to be treated is vital. <Col N="819" /> They taught me that the word &ldquo;home&rdquo; has a warm significance for Irish people, something it does not have to quite the same extent in other countries.  Irish people settle.  They do not move home that much, on average.  When they are sick, disabled or handicapped or just old they want to be cared for in their own home as long as possible.  I believe that is a basic human need.  My patients have taught me that efficiency is important but that the patient must always come first. They taught me that family support prevents illness and supports those who get sick and that since no system in the world can replace that support the State should always seek to make it possible.  My patients taught me that old people are a valuable precious resource and that a decent society cares for its older people. It does not just warehouse them.  They taught me that information is the essential factor in preventive medicine.</P>

      <P>Given the information, most people do a good job of managing their lifestyle, so getting health information to people is vital.  My patients taught me trust.  People do not wake a GP up at 3 a.m. for nothing.  There is always a reason.  There is always a need. Above all, I learned to admire my patients for their courage in the face of pain, diminution and death and for their serenity in the face of random disaster.</P>
      <P>I was learning these lessons nearly 30 years ago and seeing important patterns emerging.  It was clear, for example, even that far back, that mentally handicapped children were going to live longer than had been the case up to then and that they would require care that did not exist at the time.  I was an early member of an association working for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I got into politics was that I could sense we were on the verge of <Col N="820" /> massive change in health care and I wanted to make sure that the health service reflected what I was learning from my patients.  Yes, I had other concerns. There were other political issues I was interested in but health was always at the forefront.</P>
    <P>I brought into politics with me a clear vision of the health service I believed was right for this country.  What I wanted &mdash; and what I am now beginning to get into place &mdash; is a health service that starts with respect for the patient.</P>

      <P>Patients are entitled to information. Patients are entitled to appeals systems which allow them to have wrongs righted. What I wanted &mdash; and am now getting into place &mdash; is a health service where quality of care to the patient is the guiding principle for delivery of service.  What I wanted was an efficient health service, where money goes to those who deliver, where structures actually serve needs, and where all of this is measured, not guessed at.  What I wanted was a health service which built on the great caring traditions of Ireland &mdash; the family traditions, the religious order traditions &mdash; and added in the realities of business efficiency and value for taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The health service for the coming decades has to be a network of services, not a series of independent empires.  It has to be high-tech, yes, but it must also major on community management of health problems.  It has to be devoted to cure, yes, but it must also concentrate on care, so that the chronically ill or handicapped get the best quality of life possible. It has to run along two parallel imperatives: the patient comes first and cost effective efficiency is essential.</P>

    <P>When I became Minister for Health I started on the process of bringing my vision into reality.  I did it because it was <Col N="821" /> the right thing to do.

It was sinking deeper into debt as a result of the policies being pursued by the Fine Gael-Labour Government of the day who were overspending.</P>

      <P>I did it by rationalising acute hospitals, protecting key services and directing resources to the most appropriate providers of care as finance became available.  The end result has been three years of sustained hostile reaction fanned by the political parties on the other side who had been calling for precisely the same action I took, but while I was taking all of that reaction, I never lost sight of where I wanted to take the health service.  In 1987 I established the Commission on Health Funding under the chairmanship of Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien to report to me on the most appropriate method of financing the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the commission's analyses confirmed my own beliefs which indicate that the way forward has to be based on a number of key principles.  The overriding principle is to provide a comprehensive equitable and efficient health care system based on prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management and rehabilitation. The focus is to be on the patient at all times.  There will be a practical rather than an ideological approach to organisational structures: any changes in structures will take account of the needs of patients and of the strengths and traditions of individual organisations within an overall framework for delivery of services. It must also reflect the interests of the patient, the people who deliver the services and the taxpayer.  Particular emphasis will be placed on developing primary health care so that patients are dealt with at the level appropriate to their need.  Better information on health needs <Col N="822" /> and the performance and costs of individual services and institutions will be generated for policy formulation and management.  A high quality management will be sustained and developed as a tool for the achievement of a better service.  Accountability for the use of resources in accordance with service requirements will be strengthened.</P>
    <P>I am now going to outline an action programme for 1990 and beyond based on these key principles and starting with two significant initiatives which are being put into place this week.</P>
    <P>Both will produce results within the Dáil session and allow me to bring more detailed and specific plans to Government before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>These two initiatives are being headed by people with proven track records.  Mr. Noel Fox, who has been instrumental in the successful re-positioning of the voluntary health insurance, is to conduct an immediate efficiency review of acute hospitals.</P>

      <P>Mr. Fox's task is to identify what hospitals have a highly efficient practice in place and to make sure that that efficient caring practice becomes general, not specific to one particular hospital.  That is why Mr. Fox's group is moving in immediately and with a tight brief and a deadline.  I will be bringing a report, based on what Mr. Fox recommends to Government before the Dáil recess, a report leading to policy, leading to action.  Mr. David Kennedy will head up a Dublin hospital's initiative <Col N="823" /> to examine admissions policy, out-patients arrangements and discharge arrangements for patients needing longer term support outside the hospital.</P>

      <P>Hospitals, in my vision of the health service, are part of a tightly integrated network of care.  It is doubtful that this network of care will happen accidentally or simply because the Department of Health say it must.  Mr. Kennedy will be ensuring that it does.  He will indicate not just what should be done but how it should be done.  He will be heading up an action group and the result of his work will be included in the wider documentation going to Government in this Dáil session.  What I will be going to Government with will be realistic, unlike some of the wild notions Deputy Yates and others have been floating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, what they are looking for is the concept of a standby hospital.  If Deputy Yates has his way every area would have its own hospital plus a standby hospital filled with empty beds so that when the worst 'flu in 20 years strikes you will not have to push beds together or anything awkward like that. You have a hospital full of empty beds and unused staff just waiting for the call. That is what the Opposition have been advocating over the last two months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>But then Deputy Yates does not have to develop serious responses to emerging situations, as I have.  Let me give the House one example of a situation that had to be coped with, over here in the real word.  Our acute services came under unusual pressure as a result of 'flu and respiratory disease in <Col N="824" /> December and January last.  I acknowledge that this exceptional activity involved our hospital services in a very substantial additional cost just at the time when, in the normal course of events, they would have planned to reduce activity in line with normal seasonal patterns. As a result, their expenditure planning, both for 1989 and 1990 have been significantly affected.  I want to state here and now that the agreed cost of this additional activity will be met by my Department in such a way that it will not intrude on the services which they would have planned to provide in 1990.  In addition I will ensure that at a minimum, the overall level of hospital activity in the latter part of 1989 including the special initiative on waiting lists, will be continued through 1990 and that includes the substantial number of beds that were opened throughout 1989.</P>
      <P>There were times this week when it struck me that Deputy Yates should have been in the film business, he was releasing so many trailers in advance of the real show.  One of the trailers was a big statement &mdash; which he repeated here tonight &mdash; about saving millions by switching over to generic drugs.  Of course Deputy Yates, in coming up with this instant solution, does not have to take into consideration patients' rights and the right of doctors to prescribe what they see fit for their patients.  There is no immediate saving of £28 million to be made by the use of generics.  It is a wild claim based on a half understanding.</P>
      <P>When a drug has been around for a while, its patent expires and companies, apart from the manufacturer who first developed it, can then produce it and sell it.  So, one can buy aspirin under a brand name, or buy plain aspirin.  Generics are cheaper.  Yes, we must have savings in our drugs bill.  That is why I gave the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries 12 months' notice that I was terminating the agreement with them on drug prices, the agreement developed by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we get good enough value and I will make sure we get better <Col N="825" /> value.  We have already achieved substantial savings on our drug bill.  We have brought the spending under control, partly by the increased use of generics.  I have always advised my medical colleagues of the need for responsible prescribing and encouraged them to use generic products where their efficiency is of equal value to the patient.  The Department will be issuing a drug formulary to all doctors in practice which will include information on generics among other things.  I will be getting the doctors to agree to the idea that these actions can and should yield savings.  This is expressed in the drugs formulary which will be handed to the doctors soon.</P>
    <P>The claims of Deputy Yates about the scope of savings of £28 million on drug costs which can be spent in other parts of the service are simplistic and display little understanding of what influences costs. Such claims take no account of the growing numbers of expensive but therapeutically benefical drugs that have come on the market in recent times.  Deputies will be familiar with a number of examples themselves, such as AZT used in the control of AIDs.  At present, AZT treatment is costing one Dublin hospital about £180,000 per year, for a total of just 60 patients.  Evidence is growing that the drug may also be of therapeutic benefit for a further 160 AIDs patients who are at a different stage of development of the condition.  This would obviously increase the costs further.</P>
    <P>There is a growing number of other examples of highly expensive life-saving drugs which have become available recently.  An increasing number are on the GMS list and others are supplied in public hospitals.  Examples include drugs used after organ transplants.  Now it is recommended that a very expensive drug, some brands costing £300,000 per injection, should be given to everybody who suffers a heart attack.  In addition there are drugs for cancer, mostly confined to hospitals until recently, which have been added to the GMS list.</P>
    <P>These products are generally patent-protected and not, therefore, subject to price competition.  As a result they are <Col N="826" /> often extremely costly.  The crucial issue, however, is that without their use many patients would die.  Once the drugs are available there is an understandable public expectation that they will be made available to those in need of them. I would be interested to hear Deputy Yates's views on how we should approach this issue.  Are we to put savings in drugs costs before patients' lives?  In this environment of expensive, life-saving drugs and other preparations it is difficult to understand how he can expect to achieve an immediate saving of £28 million.</P>
    <P>Certainly there is scope for further control of drug costs.  It is essential that we do not achieve this at the expense of patient care.  I will continue to seek out methods of controlling expenditure but it must be consistent with the welfare of patients. This aspect of drug costs is part of an approach to the health service which frightens and appals me every time I see it raised by the Deputy.  It is an empty inhuman mechanistic approach which starts with balance sheets and sees patients as units: as if the health service were just a variation on the ESB or of an Bord Telecom.  A telephone is the same on Valentia Island as it is in Wexford or in the centre of Dublin.  The health services are not.  They are complex and must respond to the needs in particular areas.</P>
    <P>On this issue, since so much has been made of it, I would like to explain to the House just one of the realities about generics which is being ignored.  Generics can only be developed when a product has been around for a decade or so.  The generic option simply does not exist in relation to the more expensive new drugs. One of the drugs used for AIDs patients costs £4,000 per year per patient.  There are many newer drugs which are both expensive and necessary and cannot be substituted by generics.</P>
    <P>Patients are looking for a health service that treats them with respect, that listens sensitively to patients and responds to real need.  That is the kind of health service I want to build for the nineties and tonight I am announcing substantial steps <Col N="827" /> towards it.  This action will see an effective appointments system established in all major hospitals to reduce delays in all out-patient departments.  Appointments will be spread throughout the working day so that patients will not have to wait around in hospitals unnecessarily.  I will be requiring hospitals, within weeks, to submit for my approval a hospital code of conduct covering the information to be given to patients before, during and after treatment and visiting arrangements and amenities for patients and their relatives. This will lead quickly to a national patients' charter.  My Department will be sitting down immediately with health service managements to set up a patient feed-back mechanism within each hospital, so that quality assurance and good communication are built into every aspect of their operations.</P>
    <P>Outside of the hospitals themselves I am immediately setting up a formal appeals procedure on eligibility for medical cards under section 47 of the Health Act, 1970, so that people who do not feel they have got what they are entitled to can have their problems addressed.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties about coping with the hidden health revolution, and about getting value for money spent on health, is that we do not have enough of the right kind of information.  We do not have full information on epidemiology. We do not have full information on services. I am not saying that this information does not exist.  Of course it exists; but it exists in pockets isolated from each other and is, therefore, of little use.  If one is running a hospital and one knows a patient needs further care, one may not have the information at the flick of a button as to the appropriate place to send the patient and the mechanics of transfer. Another example is that if an irresponsible person with a vested interest, political or otherwise, makes an inaccurate claim about over-crowding, the Department of Health may take hours or days tracking down the facts, whereas they should be accessible within minutes.</P>
    <P>That will change.  I would add that one <Col N="828" /> of the reasons for the delay in computerising the system is that when the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition were in Government they insisted that the system then in existence was archaic.  Deputy Yates referred to the establishment of committees.  I am not an expert in computers, and I make no apology for establishing a committee which reported to me in six weeks.  I adopted their proposals on the best way forward in computerisation and I am glad to say we are making very successful progress in that regard.  An essential element of my programme for the computerisation of the health services is the radical upgrading of the information systems nationally and at local health board and hospital level.  The right information will be gathered, analysed and applied to what goes on and where in the health services.</P>
    <P>If the new health service is to work it must be operated by highly skilled managers. To improve management throughout our health service I will be taking three actions: I am allowing for the appointment of additional specialist managers in a number of key areas &mdash; recently we appointed one in Cork Regional hospital; I am providing more training support for existing managers, including placement abroad, if necessary, in centres of excellence; I will be putting management training at the disposal of hospital consultants and senior nursing staffs.</P>
    <P>Accountability for money spent must be improved dramatically.  This may require changes in the terms and conditions of staff.  In particular, I want to strengthen the management role and corporate responsibility of consultant and medical staff.  Consultants are not outsiders putting people into hospital beds and fighting for space.  They are insiders who must see themselves as part of a team and who must see the care of their patient as requiring a balance of short-term and long-term services.  In the immediate future I will be asking a number of hospitals, on a pilot basis, to budget departmentally so that clinicians and hospital managements will be able to <Col N="829" /> review the cost effectiveness of existing practices on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>All of what I have announced will give us the capacity to manage resources more efficiently.  It will not do, as Deputy Yates makes out, to approach health and health spending as if one were pushing 5p coins into a meter to get a certain number of units of electricity.  It cannot be systemised like that.  We must fund hospitals on throughout, on delivery, rather than just on the basis of what they got the last time around.  One would not run a business that way; in order to provide the best care for patients, health must be run as a business.  As the man on whose desk the buck stops, I must be able to ask what we are paying, what we are getting and if we could do better, and I must get precise answers.</P>
    <P>It is only with those precise answers that I can allay the real fears of people, deliberately whipped up by some Members of this House, about the level and kind of service they will get if they are ill.  Let us be accurate; it is a long time since people felt so unsure of their health service.  People in Ireland are not alone in that.  Much richer countries than ours have spent billions of pounds more than we have but with poorer results in terms of life expectancy and the cost of treatment to an individual.  We, on the other hand, have taken a situation which was out of control when we came into Government in 1987 and halted the slide. As a Government we have addressed all of these problems continuously throughout a three-year period, coping with the immediate problems and setting down guidelines for the future while at the same time coping with endless untruths coming from the Opposition.  Yet more of these untruths surfaced on today's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme; there were five untruths in four minutes by Deputy Yates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very substantial progress has been made in recent years in providing a modern base from which to deliver health care.  Our acute hospital development programme has given us some of the most modern facilities in Europe, while the provision of modern residential and day care centres has had an equally important impact on the other care programmes.  The Government are preparing a five year capital programme, the main objectives of which will be to ensure that the physical infrastructure is in place to meet the service goals which we have set ourselves, while ensuring that the fabric of existing services is maintained. It is no less important for health care that we should be in a position to replace equipment which is coming to the end of its useful life, than that we should have fine new buildings.  The details of this programme will be finalised over the coming months, with immediate attention to those needs which are creating difficulty in delivering an adequate or efficient service to patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent publicity about the needs of the <Col N="831" /> health services focused almost exclusively on acute hospitals.  There are pressures and particular problems in this sector but I must shape our health services in a balanced way.  One of the principal deficiencies of health care policy over many years has been the relative lack of investment in community care services. That is not going to continue.  A major indication of the Government's serious intent in this regard for the future was contained in the budget.  The Minister for Finance announced the provision of significant additional sums for key areas in the community care programme: services for the elderly, dental services and services for the mentally handicapped. The practical impact of these increased allocations are as follows.</P>
    <P>The report of the Working Party on Services for the Elderly, <i>The Years Ahead,</i> stressed the importance of community services in providing care for the elderly in the most appropriate setting, with access to acute hospitals and nursing units as necessary.  The recent 'flu epidemic further highlighted the need for convalescent, nursing and home care services so that patients can, whenever possible, be treated at home and, if admitted to hospital, can be discharged quickly to a safe, caring and curing environment.</P>
    <P>The additional allocation of £5 million to services for the elderly and the manner in which it is to be spent, demonstrates the Government's commitment to the improvement of services to meet these needs.  Half of the £5 million will be allocated to help strengthen home care, including home nursing and home help support.  The additional funding will provide for more than 10,000 additional home nursing weeks.  It will also enable 3,000 elderly people to receive substantially increased home help support. This money will be allocated to each health board on the basis of its proportion of the elderly population.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million has been allocated to provide more facilities for increased day care, short-term and long-stay care <Col N="832" /> for the elderly, and the improved treatment of respiratory disorders.  Five hundred thousand pounds has been allocated for additional nursing home places for the relief of families who are caring for heavily dependent elderly people at home.  The main funding will be directed to the Eastern Health Board area where there have been particular shortfalls due to a sharp increase in the numbers of the heavily dependent elderly.  The increased funding will enable up to an additional 240 people in a year to be assisted for a period of six months.</P>
    <P>In the context of the care of the elderly, I must also mention that the prescribed relative's allowance, which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, will be replaced by a new carers' allowance worth £45 a week to be introduced next October.  This will provide more effective support for those caring for their elderly relatives, and will complement the improvements being made to the various support services in the health area.</P>
    <P>The Government have been aware for some time of the inadequacies of the dental service being provided by the health boards for eligible persons.  The Government have now decided to make an additional £3 million available to the health board dental service in order to bring about an improvement in services for eligible adults and children to treat more priority orthodontic cases.  As the House knows, we made an extra £300,000 available last year for urgent orthodontic cases.</P>
    <P>The health boards will be given a degree of autonomy with regard to the measures they take to improve services for the elderly and dental services. However, each board will be required to lay down and achieve targets to ensure that the best possible use is made of the additional funds now being provided.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that I have been interested in the needs of the mental handicapped for many years.  Things have changed during those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mentally handicapped people are living longer and require services longer.  Some adults are occupying places which otherwise would be available for children.  These children need access to services to promote their development and to prevent them developing secondary disabilities.</P>
      <P>The needs of the mentally handicapped can be better met by the more co-ordinated approach to the delivery of care now being adopted.  The regional co-ordination committees, which include the main providers of mental handicap services, both statutory and voluntary, in each region have been asked to agree plans for the development of services over the next five years.  Pending the receipt of this plan priority is to be given to persons who have either no service or an inadequate one.  The Government have made an additional £2 million available to meet the most urgent needs.  This money will provide additional places in full-time residential care, in respite care, day care and expanded family support services, all in 1990.</P>
      <P>The measures announced in the budget represent the beginning of a programme of action in those areas over the coming years to boost our community services.  I have been concerned for many years about the organisation of general practice in Dublin and I intend to take steps to strengthen the contribution of general practice to the care of patients, especially for service outside normal hours.  Better organisation can mean that patients who do not need acute hospital care will not burden the accident and emergency departments of our hospitals.  I have already initiated discussions on this issue with representatives of general practitioners, both the Irish Medical Organisation and the College of General Practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures I have outlined tonight represent, at least in part, a response to the report of the Commission on Health Funding.  A further element of the Government's response will be made clear when, before the summer recess, we announce decisions on the future administrative arrangements for the <Col N="834" /> health services.  Further decisions on the funding and eligibility issues covered in the commission's report will be announced when the Government have had an opportunity to consider the review body report on the conditions of employment of consultants.  The Gleeson report will be directly relevant to the Government's consideration of the organisation of hospital services.</P>
    <P>The debate over the past few weeks has been awash with untruths, frighteners and unchecked claims.  Tonight, I am laying before the House a wide-ranging strategy including a commitment to maintain through 1990 overall hospital activity including the special initiative on waiting lists in the latter half of 1989; an outline of precisely how the £10 million allocated in the budget to community care will be spent and a commitment to further development in this area; a major initiative on efficiency in the health service to be headed by Noel Fox; an initiative on Dublin hospital services to be headed by David Kennedy; a radical new approach to patient care, with appointment systems in all hospitals; a patient consumer care plan for all agencies; an appeals system for medical card cases; a clear commitment to a five year capital programme to implement policy and replace equipment, and information systems will be greatly improved and management development stepped up.</P>
    <P>Two further major announcements will be made shortly and decisions on structures will be made before the summer recess.  Following the Gleeson report I will be making further announcements on eligibility, the public/private mix and the consultants' contracts.</P>
    <P>I have now put the health services on course for the nineties.  This does not mean there will not be problems, but if we deal with them in an honest and realistic way as opposed to using opportunism as has been the case in recent weeks we can provide the people with a first-class health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note at this point following the Minister's speech while it is all right in a debate to <Col N="835" /> declare that everybody else is telling lies or untruths, as the Minister kindly framed it and that there is no basis to the claims being made by the Opposition parties about the health services it is contradictory at the same time to announce a series of measures to deal with a crisis which he claims does not exist.  Nevertheless this is par for the course in debates in this House.</P>
      <P>It is a very serious step for any party to table a vote of no confidence and it is one which should not be taken lightly. As far back as the summer of 1987 The Workers' Party tabled a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health.  The same person fills that position now when it first became clear to us that the basic underlying principle of his policy was to put balancing the books first and the quality of the health service and the welfare of patients second.  We are glad, of course, that the other Opposition parties have now come to the same conclusion, are accepting this position and that there is full support on the Opposition Benches for calling on the Minister to resign.</P>
      <P>While the motion of no confidence is directed specifically against the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, what is at issue are the Government's health policies. It must be remembered that the Minister is implementing Government policies and that all members of the Cabinet, both Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats, bear responsibility for the suffering caused by these policies.  The Taoiseach as leader of the Government has a particular responsibility for Government policy in each and every area, including health.  During the last general election campaign he claimed to have been unaware of the strength of public feeling about the health cuts.  He cannot now claim to be unaware of the suffering and the stress caused to so many patients in recent months.  The only conclusion that can be drawn is that he does not care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be pointed out that the health cuts are not a new phenomenon. Every Government since 1982 have cut back on health.  While I welcome the fact <Col N="836" /> that Fine Gael have discovered at last the damage the health cuts can do, it has to be pointed out that the crisis in the hospital service which came to a head over the Christmas period was an inevitable consequence of the inadequate funding for health since 1987 and 1988 which Fine Gael supported.  The old, the sick and the handicapped have been paying the price of Deputy Dukes' Tallaght strategy which effectively gave Fianna Fáil a blank cheque to implement widespread cutbacks in the health service and other areas.</P>
    <P>There are a number of extraordinary aspects to the Minister's performance in recent months.  One was his suggestion that the recent problems were attributable to the outbreak of flu.  Underlying the Minister's approach was a suggestion that the Government had reduced the overall number of hospital beds because they could not tolerate beds lying empty and unused for most of the year.  The hospital service has to be designed to cope not simply with summer conditions when the level of illness is lower but also with winter conditions when health problems are at their worst.  This is like saying we do not need a comprehensive fire brigade service because only occasionally do we have major fires.  The recent relatively minor flu epidemic led to such chaos in our hospitals that a major epidemic would obviously lead to total chaos.  Another extraordinary aspect of the Minister's performance was his attempt to deny any crisis existed and his refusal to listen to the advice of the professionals, the doctors and nurses, who are working in the service.  As a medical doctor himself, the Minister should realise that they are the people best placed to know what is going on. There was an unpleasant example of this recently when the Minister publicly contradicted the version of events given by a nurses' representative at University Hospital, Galway.  This is management by bluster and a King Canute approach to health policy: if one repeats often enough it might come to pass, but wave after wave of crisis in the public health service is beginning to lap around the <Col N="837" /> Minister's feet.  He can repeat as often as he likes that there is no crisis but the professionals who work in the health service and the community who depend upon it have hard experience that the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>My implied criticism of the Minister's reliance on the influence of administrators in these matters does not mean that I go along with the school of thought that argues that the only thing wrong with the service is that there are too many administrators and too few professionals. It is a convenient vehicle for those in the House who do not oppose health cuts as such, and indeed who may have implemented them with relish when their own party was wielding the axe.  This school of thought has some adherents who believe there were no cuts before 1987 or if there were they did little damage. It is this which gives rise to the special pleading involved in the attack on clerical and administrative staff in the service.  It is a means of being for the cuts while pretending to be against the effects of those cuts but it will not wash.  It is as crude as it is uninformed about what has contributed to the current crisis.  This does not mean a major and well planned reorganisation of the service is not necessary but if we should have learned one thing in recent years it is that you must draw up the plan first and make the jobs fit the plan.  What has been happening steadily in recent years is a strategy of management by cuts and redundancies &mdash; implement the cuts and encourage people to leave the service by offering them redundancy and then tailor the service around what is left.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have never suggested that additional spending on its own will bring a better health service but, combined with a restructuring of the service, additional funding can give the people the quality and range of services they need.  The proportion of gross national product we spend on health has been steadily declining and unless there is a commitment to bring the level of spending back up in a planned and phased way the problems will remain.  Health spending in 1983 accounted for 7.61 per <Col N="838" /> cent of gross national product but gradually it was brought down to 7.1 per cent in 1986.  It had declined to 6.6 per cent in 1987, to 6.24 per cent in 1988 and by 1989 it was down to 5.72 per cent.  This year's figure will be roughly the same as last year.</P>
    <P>Average spending on health in OECD countries is about 8 per cent of gross national product.  Spending on health in this country must be brought up in a steady but phased way to this level.  Even with this increase there will, of course, be a need to control expenditure and plan the most efficient use of our resources, not least because the demand for health services will grow and change as the age structure of our population changes with the proportion of elderly people increasing. On that point it must be made very clear to the Minister that there is a very serious crisis in the geriatric services. Today it was brought to my attention that an 89 year-old man was discharged prematurely in the view of his family from St. James's Hospital; he is now a patient in Peamount Hospital suffering from incipient Alzheimer's disease and severe respiratory problems.  This man needs institutional care but this is not available. Peamount Hospital has made it clear that it will not be able to keep this man any longer than the day when they regard him as sufficiently recovered when they will release him to go home.  His family simply cannot care for him and there is no institutional care available for him.</P>
    <P>Control is also necessary because of the exceptional level of inflation in health costs due to the advent of high technology methods of investigation and treatment. The experience all over the world, including Ireland, has been that cost inflation within the health service has outstripped the general level of inflation.  This is a further reason that the impact of the cutbacks has been even more severe than would have been the case if demand had remained constant and cost inflation in health was of the average for the general economy.</P>
    <P>The people expect, and indeed have a right to expect, a health care system which is capable of giving them the best <Col N="839" /> possible standard of care when they are ill.  That expectation is an expression of their collective concern not just for themselves and their immediate family but for families and the community in general.  It is an expression of that collective concern which is the opposite of the Thatcherite approach which has been adopted by the Government in relation to the health services and which seems to promote the idea that the individual who can afford to buy health care is entitled to a greater level of care and a greater quality of care.</P>
    <P>To achieve the kind of care people require needs very exact planning and the allocation of resources where they will benefit most people.  In this context the distortions brought into the health system by the mix of public and private are of central importance and will have to be addressed.  There is hope at least in the sense that the Minister has said here tonight he intends to look at that problem.</P>
    <P>It has now been recognised, even in the United States, that the market and price mechanisms do not make health care delivery systems efficient.  Health care costs are escalating even faster in the US than they are here.  The two-tier health system is not only morally repugnant, it is wasteful.  Fifty six per cent of all health spending goes on acute general hospital services.  While demand for these services is determined largely by the genuine needs of people, it is heavily influenced by the referral policies of the GPs and by the admission policies of the consultant hospital doctors.  Therefore, the quality of the professionalism of doctors and the economic relationship they have with their patients is of central importance in managing an efficient and humane hospital service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done nothing to alter the consultants' common contract to make more efficient use of the hospital services.  At the same time he has introduced a new contract for GPs which encourages earlier and more referrals to hospital care.  As a result of the way in which their common contract is framed, consultants as a group have an interest in <Col N="840" /> making access to their services difficult and sometimes undignified for public patients, thus forcing them into the private sphere.  Of course there are individual exceptions, but the brutal fact is that it is not in the consultants' collective economic interest to improve access and care for public patients.  This must be changed by changing their contract in the following way.  Consultants with public patients should see and treat all patients, public or private, in the same manner, that is in the same room or outpatients' department, under the same conditions and from the same waiting lists.  It should be a breach of their contract to do otherwise. The publicly appointed consultants should be allowed to practise publicly or privately only in those hospitals in which they have public appointments.  The consultants should be paid a portion of their salary for their public work on a merit or productivity basis through the VHI.</P>
    <P>In order to make these changes feasible it will be necessary to appoint more specialists, particularly in the specialties where most delays exist such as orthopaedics, cardiac surgery etc., and their should be a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
    <P>When the new contract for GPs was introduced, changing the system of payments in respect of medical card holders from a fee per item to a capitation system of payment, the Minister promised that new protocols would be drawn up covering the investigation of people prior to their admission to hospital.  The aim would have been to save people from having to go to hospital for tests that could just as easily be done outside.  This has not been done.  When the new GP contract was introduced we warned that unless the change in the system of payment was made as part of an improved, comprehensive general practitioner service which would be free at the point of delivery, it would lead to the development of a two-tier GP service with more frequent referrals of medical card holders to hospitals.  This is clearly what has happened and I have no doubt that the <Col N="841" /> change in the system of payment contributed to the chaos in hospitals over the Christmas period.  The indisputable fact is that there is now an economic incentive for doctors to lavish more attention on private patients and less on medical card holders.  With the outbreak of influenza over Christmas many doctors were simply swamped with calls and they found it made economic sense for them to refer medical card holders to hospital sooner than would normally be the case.  This not only freed them of the obligation to look after medical card holders who were ill but meant they had more time for their lucrative private patients.  To ignore the impact of a change in the system for payment of GPs on the admission levels to hospitals is burying our heads in the sand.</P>
    <P>When the new contract was introduced we were also told that a drugs formulary would be established to reduce the overall cost of drugs.  This has not yet been done despite the announcement by the Minister here again tonight, an announcement which has been made on numerous occasions in this House in reply to questions which I put down to the Minister for Health during the last three years.  We had it announced again here tonight that a list would be circulated to doctors and specialists.  We were also told that a new contract would result in a reduction in the level of expenditure on drugs.  The argument was that as GPs were likely to see their patients less often than under the free for item system, the level of drugs prescribed would go down. This has not happened.  Medical card holders on long term drugs who previously had to go to their GP every month to get their prescriptions renewed are now being supplied with prescriptions for up to three months at a time.  Successive surveys have shown that our drug prices are among the highest in Europe, yet no Government appear willing to tackle the profiteering of the drug companies.  The cost of drugs is the biggest single element in the GMS bill.  This is an area where savings could and should be made without diminishing the standard of patient care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> In relation to the cost of drugs and the drugs formulary, why have this Government and, indeed, other Governments been unwilling to tackle the vested interests of the drug industry?  In the short period I spent on the Eastern Health Board there was very strong opposition from the drugs companies to the introduction of a drugs formulary or the use of generic drugs.  By tackling that area this Government could be doing a service for the health services and for the people who have to avail of them, not only patients who have to go to doctors but people who simply go to a chemist to buy drugs.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have preached the virtues of community care as an alternative to institutional treatment but they have failed to provide the resources to allow this to become a reality.  Running down institutional care without providing the necessary additional resources to develop community care, is, as we have seen, a recipe for chaos, and for suffering and distress for patients.  The report <i>Planning for the Future</i> pointed out that the introduction of community care would be more costly, certainly in the short term, because both institutional care and community care in many cases would have to run side by side until adequate community care services were in place.  Of course, community care can be more expensive than institutional care because you are relying far more on the services of nurses and other specialists out travelling around the community in order to deal with people in their homes. This was to be of particular value in the reorganisation of the psychiatric services and care of people with mental handicap, yet five years after the publication of the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> the alternative community care services are nowhere near as developed as they should be.  This is almost entirely a question of resources, especially capital resources, to open up new community based facilities.  The Minister may believe community care can be provided on the cheap.  Indeed, some feel it is the main impetus behind the move to deinstitutionalise the health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> As an example of the kind of short range planning involved in this area of community care, there is a site in Finglas West at the end of Mellowes Road and Mellowes Avenue which the health board have had in their possession for many years and which they declared was required for a day care centre for the elderly and mentally handicapped.  It still lies idle but the health board are in the process of handing the site back to the corporation because they do not have the finances to develop it.  Presumably the corporation will use it as a park or to provide private housing or whatever. Certainly it will not be used to build a care centre for the elderly or the handicapped in area 6 of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In advance of the closure of the Victorian psychiatric hospitals alternatives should be put in place but this area is being dealt with on a hand to mouth basis mainly because health boards do not have the resources to do otherwise.  The same principles apply in relation to the general hospital services.  If we want to ease the strain on hospital services, our community care facilities must be developed. It is no good wishing for them, the resources must be allocated to provide them.  We welcome the increase in the carer's allowance announced in the budget, but the money provided for the care of the elderly in the community is far from adequate.  What we need is a substantial increase in the numbers of public health nurses, home helps, health visitors, domiciliary physiotherapists and occupational therapists, etc.  Indeed, I would remind the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health of the submission made by the Irish Nurses Organisation, which pointed out that there were 120 unfilled vacancies in the community nursing service. To what extent will the allocation, announced in the budget and to which the Minister for Health referred tonight, cover the vacancies that need to be filled in that area?</P>
    <P>The dominant feature of our health services over recent decades has been the absence of long-term planning and the <Col N="844" /> extent to which crucial decisions were made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  During the seventies, the services were expanded on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and during the past decade they have been cut back on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis &mdash; a particular example of this is the question of staffing.  Over the past ten years, Governments have put a great deal of effort and imagination into the destruction of the services, which cannot be reversed overnight.  We are now paying the price for this sustained assault on the health services and particularly for the strategy of deliberately driving staff out of the service.  It is now practically impossible to get temporary nurses in the way it once was.  They have either emigrated or are unwilling to put up with the pressures of work in a service that has been brought to its knees by cutbacks. Last year the largest general hospital in the State, St. James's, advertised for temporary nurses and received only 30 replies.  The new hospital in Castlebar is having difficulty filling the posts necessary to bring it up to full operational level.  You rarely meet a nurse nowadays who will not tell you that the job he or she once loved has now become a souldestroying drudge.  The pool of available nurses has been drained by the cumulative effects of years of cuts.  Irish nurses are staffing wards from London to Los Angeles, whereas at home we have a nursing shortage, for which Government policy is directly responsible.  This is not an overnight achievement.  The demoralisation of nursing and other professionals is the result of years of destructive policies which this Minister and his predecessors implemented.  In addition, the health workers are sick and tired of patronising compliments about their dedication to duty.  Many of them are past the point where dedication can enable them to provide the level of service they wish to provide.</P>
    <P>The legacy of the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon's term of office of implementing for almost three years Deputy Haughey's policies in the hospital sector, is that overcrowded wards, beds on corridors and long queues have become the norm.</P>

      <P>Gabh mo leithscéal. The immediate shortcomings in the hospital services which have been so evident this winter must be addressed by the rapid provision of additional cash resources and staff to end the queues and thus ensure that everybody who needs a hospital bed will get one.  However, if we do nothing else we will simply be faced with the same problems next winter or at some point in the future.</P>
      <P>We must start the process of a fundamental restructuring of the health service. We must increase the percentage of GNP spent on health, there is no other way.  We must end the distortions between public and private health care. We must alter the consultants' common contract and appoint more consultant and non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>At present, the general practitioner service represents the worst of all possible worlds with a capitation system for medical card holders and a fee per item for private patients.  We must set about providing a comprehensive general practitioner service which will be free at the point of delivery for the entire population. We must tackle the vested interests in the drugs industry and establish a national drugs formulary.  We must provide additional resources to deal with the problems of the mentally handicapped. Never again should we have to face the problems which Samantha Webb faced last week when she had nowhere to live.  I urge the Minister to take on board what the Opposition Deputies are saying tonight and what they will say tomorrow night.</P>

The evidence that things are not right is there for all to see &mdash; endless hospital waiting lists, closed wards, beds on corridors, depleted staff numbers, overworked nurses and doctors and a general crisis in morale that is most depressing.  Key <Col N="846" /> decisions affecting clinical medicine are no longer being taken by clinicians but by an army of bureaucrats who have taken over the running of the health service and they are now taking clinical decisions away from the doctors.  We are seeing casualty departments swamped by patients trying to jump the admission queues.  This is the reality.  The casualty departments are swamped by referrals by the general practitioners as this appears to be the only way the general practitioners can get their patients into hospital. They are also swamped by patients, many of whom complain that they are unable to see their family doctor in the evenings because of the terms of the new GMS contract.</P>

      <P>It was unfortunate that while measures were being taken to prune the health service, general practitioners were switched from a fee per item to a capitation system.  The result was that doctors were not being paid for seeing patients after hours.  In fact, the out of hours fees for seeing a patient were not being paid until after 10 p.m. Doctors, like the rest of society, believe their surgeries should end at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m and we would all agree that there is nothing unreasonable about that.  Under the terms of the new contract, the general practitioner is expected to call out and visit medical card patients for nothing between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m., because according to the Department of Health, visits do not rate as emergencies unless they occur after 10 p.m.  The problem is that patients who are unable to contact their general practitioners between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. are ending up in casualty departments thus throwing an extra strain on the hospital service and costing a damn sight more than the emergency fee that would be paid to the general practitioner.  I say that a review of the contract is needed urgently and I suggest a compromise providing for an emergency fee payment after 7 p.m. and over the weekends.  In fact, this could be the immediate answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the doctors' contract &mdash; I have no vested interest in it and I want to make that very clear &mdash; I suggest that the Minister might give an incentive to general practitioners to carry out more clinical tests in their <Col N="848" /> own surgeries to obviate referrals to hospital for tests.  There must be some alternative to the present iniquitous practice of all general practitioner referrals to hospitals having first to been seen at casualty Departments.</P>

      <P>It is demeaning to an experienced family doctor and it clogs the casualty service.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that more money is being pumped into the health services this year.  If I remember correctly he said that the health budget for 1990 would be increased by 8 per cent over the original provision for 1989.  Yes, he is right there but, on my calculations, it represents an increase of 4 per cent on the outturn for 1989.  This is where the confusion arises. I ask the Minister to please clarify the matter, to inform the House of the net increase in the health service allocation for 1990, as many figures have been bandied about.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to give an extra £10 million to the health services, announced in the budget, is to be welcomed, especially their decision to give £2 million extra for mental handicap.  I hope this money will go towards the provision of 70 extra residential places and 200 extra respite places in the Eastern Health Board area with an equivalent number in the remainder of the country.  We were all moved by the march of the parents of mentally handicapped children, understand their plight and share their concern. The biggest worry of parents of mentally handicapped children at present is that there may be nobody to care for them after their parents' death.  This is a real fear and it is incumbent on the Minister to reassure parents on this point.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to give an extra £2.5 million for home help nursing care was a good move and will go a long way toward relieving the pressure on hospital beds by the elderly, in effect bringing about a considerable saving in our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> By the same token an extra £3 million being allocated to the dental service is a sensible one.  In this area more needs to be done.  We must recruit more dentists into the public dental service.  What we need is legislation to provide for a compulsory intern year for all newly qualified dentists who would spend that year in the public dental service, relieving the waiting lists and repaying the State what has been spent on their education and training.  There is also need for the introduction of dental therapists who could be trained in two years.  This would be an innovation and has been tried successfully in many other countries. It would ease the pressure on dental surgeons and help reduce waiting lists.  At the same time it would go a long way toward reducing dental care costs especially in the public service.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency we need to recruit more orthodontic surgeons into the public dental service and arrange for training of more of them.  As the House will be aware, the cost of dental treatment, particularly of an orthodontic nature, has become prohibitive, with as much as £1,000 being asked for uncomplicated orthodontic procedures. That is a considerable sum of money.  What is so very important is that children requiring orthodontic treatment should have it available to them in time to prevent permanent abnormalities and deformities. That is why it is so important that urgent action be taken.</P>
    <P>I know the health service is far from ideal, I know a lot more needs to be done, I know the public are dissatisfied and I know their expectations are very high but I honestly believe the Government are making a brave and determined effort to improve the service.  I am delighted the Taoiseach is present for this debate.  I know he made a dynamic impact on health when he was Minister for Health. I saw evidence of that when I was in Opposition.  Indeed, I praised him for the great efforts he made in the health services.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the fact that we have finite resources.  That is why I question the motion before the House.  It <Col N="850" /> seeks to condemn the Minister for Health and calls for his resignation.  Assuming the Opposition succeed, assuming the Government are defeated on the motion, what then?  Would we get anything different? Assuming Deputy Yates &mdash; for whom I have the greatest regard and respect &mdash; were Minister for Health tomorrow, would he wave the magic wand to solve all of the present health services problems?  Would he eliminate all the waiting lists?  Would he open up all the wards and, more importantly, would he put a figure on the funding he would require to carry out this gigantic task?  Would Deputy Howlin have an instant solution to the so-called health crisis?  Remember his colleague, former Deputy Barry Desmond, was in an unenviable position as Minister for Health for almost five years.  He was a beleagured Minister, a national hate figure.  Why? &mdash; because he tried to come to terms with the economic realities of health.</P>
    <P>The question I am posing is: would the position be very different with another Minister for Health, I am afraid not; with the exception of some minor policy changes the position would be very much the same &mdash; insufficient funds trying to cope with ever-escalating health costs. We must remember that soaring health costs are not unique to this country; they are a worldwide phenomenon.  Britain has introduced major health reforms in their national health service in an attempt to curb costs.  Australia has undertaken a major overhaul of their health service because of rising costs.  It is important to put this matter into proper perspective. The health service is an ever-developing one with advances and breakthroughs taking place at a phenomenal pace.</P>
    <P>Let us take a look at the budget &mdash; £1,300 million is being provided &mdash; a not insignificant sum although the Opposition will argue that this represents a smaller proportion of GNP than when they were in power.  Be that as it may, it is not an insignificant sum.  Remember, besides trying to cope with normal health services such as primary care, preventive medicine, geriatric and psychiatric care, <Col N="851" /> paediatrics, mental handicap and so on, it is also trying to stretch resources to meet the cost of medical advances and breakthroughs.  High technology medicine is now the order of the day.  Precedures unheard of ten to 15 years ago are now commonplace.</P>
    <P>Take the example of a patient with arthritis of the hips and knees, a condition which until recently was accepted as the inevitable degenerative consequence of advancing years.  It is now seen as a treatable condition but with availability of treatment comes demand.  Replacement by steel or acryllic joints renders patients mobile again and pain-free, but what is the cost?  We never consider the cost.  Let us examine the cost. One may well ask: who wants to talk about cost particularly when a patient is well.  Last year almost £10 million was spent on 2,000 artificial hip operations, representing an average of £3,600 per hip joint replacement.  That is a lot of money but why should patients not have such replacement operations?</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a patient with increasing chest pain and invalidism, a feature of progressive coronary artery disease.  There was a time such patients were told to put a tablet under the tongue, being reassured that they would be all right once they remained at home and never moved out.  This disability is no longer acceptable. A patient can be whisked into hospital, the chest opened, the diseased heart vessel by-passed rendering the patient mobile again and pain-free. What is the cost in that case?  It amounts to £5,000 for every operation and over 900 such operations were carried out here last year.  If the heart becomes more and more diseased then a replacement becomes possible.  We now have the heart transplant which is commonplace according to cardiac surgeon, Mr. Maurice Nelligan, but it is a costly burden on the health service &mdash; £14,000 &mdash; and that does not take into account that very expensive drug &mdash; cytospora &mdash; which is absolutely necessary to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ.</P>
    <P>Kidney transplants are now regarded <Col N="852" /> as commonplace procedures, so commonplace we do not mention them any more.  But what may not be known is that the cost of kidney transplant is £10,000 and there were over 100 transplants carried out in this country last year. Besides kidney transplants, a patient while awaiting a kidney transplant must have renal dialysis, must go into hospital overnight and be treated.  What is the cost of such treatment?  It amounted to £9 million last year to treat 600 patients before having kidney transplants.</P>
    <P>Liver transplants can restore dying patients to normal active life.  The Tánaiste is a classic example.  There have been a number of bone marrow transplants at a cost of £25,000 each but no-one talks about cost.  All we talk about is availability. It is a great tribute to our country and to the health service that we were able to carry out 20 of these transplants last year.  What about the cost, one may exclaim, a life has been saved.  I agree, but because resources are limited some other aspect of the health service may be jeopardised to pay this extra cost.</P>
    <P>There are now diagnostic procedures, ultra-sound, CAT scans, nuclear magnetic resonance and cardiac catheterisation, new sophisticated procedures which facilitate more accurate diagnosis but they cost the earth.  More sophisticated and expensive procedures are coming onstream almost daily.  As I have said over and over again, availability creates demand.  The more the high technology procedures become available, the greater the demand for them.  When the public see these items on television they wonder why they cannot have access to them. Expectations are very high and why should they not be so but all these things cost money.  With the rate of advances and breakthroughs in medicine, I can foresee that health costs could outstrip the gross national product in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>At the same time doctors are facing an increasingly litigious public.  We have witnessed a spate of court cases in recent times and read of the colossal compensation that was awarded in each case. <Col N="853" /> What is the implication of that?  If a doctor makes the slightest error he will be made pay for it.  I am not taking issue with that.  What I am saying is that doctors have been forced to protect themselves against litigation.  How do they do that?  There is no room any more for a speculative diagnosis.  A diagnosis must be accurate and the doctor must utilise the most sophisticated tests available to assist the diagnosis, costly tests which further burden the health service and increase costs.  Medicine is a costly business and is getting more costly by the day.</P>
    <P>At the risk of boring Deputies further I will try to explain one point.  As everybody knows, a heart attack is caused by blockage of a blood vessel in the heart muscle, generally by a blood clot.  In half the cases, death occurs in the first two hours.  Recent research has shown that with a new type of drug called a thrombolitic drug or, to the general public, a clot buster, if given by injection in the first few hours of the heart attack, the clot can be dissolved and the patient can be saved.  Let us remember that heart attacks account for one-third of all deaths in the country.  Over 10,000 deaths occur from heart attacks every year.  This thrombolisis, the dissolving of the clot, must be the most significant and exciting development in the treatment of heart attacks.  When treatment is given in time, mortality can be halved.</P>
    <P>Millions of pounds have gone into the research and development of this type of drug and it is now available to the GP at a cost of almost £1,000 per injection but it may save a life.  The question I am posing is, when confronted with a heart attack case does the GP tell the relatives in advance that the life-saving injection he is about to administer will cost £1,000 or does he take a chance, give the injection and hope to recoup the cost from the patient later or perhaps from the Department of Health or the health board?  Can you imagine the doctor's dilemma in that situation?  Will the Department of Health or the Eastern Health Board, in the case of Dublin, pick up the tab?  I mention this to give some idea of the ever-increasing <Col N="854" /> costs of the medical service and of medical advances.</P>
    <P>I may have strayed from the motion but I am trying to point out that the blame does not lie with the Minister for Health. The Minister does not stand indicted before the Dáil and the public.  He is faced with agonising choices, with so many demands on the finite resources at his disposal.  I would say he is the whipping boy of the public.  Deputy Ivan Yates, were he in the same position tomorrow, would be faced with the same agonising choices.  Where do we get the money to meet these ever-increasing costs?  I foresaw this problem some years ago and called for a national debate on the whole subject of health service costs, priorities and the ethical questions involved.  There are serious ethical questions involved here.  The problem arises in that the budget for geriatric, psychiatric and mental handicap care, the so-called Cinderellas of the health service, may become more and more curtailed as more high technology medicine devours increasingly more of the finite health budget.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, does not stand indicted before us tonight, nor do the Government but we as a Parliament do.  We stand indicted before the public for failing to address this problem, for failing to spell out the escalating costs of high technology medicine, for failing to educate the public on the need to establish priorities within the health service and for failing to ascertain what kind of health service the public require and how it should be financed.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Health Funding was published some time ago.  It would be more appropriate if we were given Dáil time this evening and tomorrow to debate that report, to see if it provides an answer to our problem, rather than giving time to this motion.  I hope the Minister will seek Government time for a Dáil debate on the health funding report.  He can only benefit from having such a debate because everyone here has a very constructive role to play and a very valuable contribution to make. <Col N="855" /> I was delighted to hear Deputy Howlin, Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Allen because I learned a lot from them.  We can all learn.</P>
    <P>Highlighting inadequacies leads to much being done.  I would like the Minister to remember that the Department of Health do not have a monopoly of wisdom on this matter.  Having said that, I believe we are going to see a major transformation in the health services in the years to come.  If we are to control costs and ease the pressure on hospital beds, we will have to put much greater emphasis on preventive medicine and encourage a healthier lifestyle.  It will be a slow process and we can expect no dramatic changes overnight but the sooner we start the better.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that were we to completely ban cigarette smoking we would save the country over £30 million a year in hospital bills alone in respect of such conditions as bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer and coronary artery disease.  The evidence establishing a link between these diseases which result in more than 10,000 deaths each year and cigarette smoking is overwhelming.  For that reason I was surprised and rather disappointed that the Minister for Finance chose not to put an extra tax or levy on the old reliables, as he calls them.  A further tax or levy of 6p on a packet of cigarettes would yield a further £15 million which could be applied to the health services, besides dealing a further blow to active smokers who are polluting our atmosphere, damaging their own health and putting a further strain on the health services and on hospital beds.  A new healthier lifestyle is coming very much into vogue.  There are more and more low fat, low cholesteral diets in use, there is greater emphasis on exercise, on stress control and more and more sensible people are giving up cigarettes.  This sensible lifestyle will lessen the strain on our health services.  We should try to accelerate this process.</P>
    <P>Preventive medicine will assume greater importance as medical knowledge expands.  While I see doctors in the <Col N="856" /> forefront in preventive medicine, other health personnel will be mobilised in the campaign to encourage healthier lifestyles. This would be a very worthwhile innovation in the health services.</P>

      <P>The present structure of the health service is unwieldly and archaic.  We must have the political courage to change, to end the bureaucratic control, to streamline the services and if necessary hand over financial control and operation of the hospital services to an independent insurance agency such as the VHI who would trim the fat and streamline the service.  That would result in savings and a better health service.  There is scope for improvement but the answer does not lie with relentlessly pouring in money.  We need vision, imagination and the political will to meet the challenge, and I feel sure the Minister will respond.</P>
      <P>I would like all parties in the House to be involved.  I would like to see set up an all-party Dáil Committee to examine all aspects of the health services.  Such a body could invite submissions from the public and report within a reasonable time and its recommendations could be debated in the Dáil.  If we do that we will see the type of health service that the public want and will pay for because in the final analysis it is the taxpayer who will foot the bill.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy O'Connell on his contribution.  It was well informed and well researched.  The Deputy stated the facts as we all know them to be in the hospitals and for patients in the community.  The Deputy has had a welcome conciliatory role in the debate. I hope that at the end of the day after the justifiable anger and criticism from this side of the House, we will be able to come together and play a role in determining how the funding of the health services is to be spent and where the emphasis should be in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> I agree with Deputy O'Connell in relation to preventive medicine and the kind of savings that could be made if we could stop people smoking or reduce the trend considerably.  People who are trying desperately to give up smoking will say that they wish smoking was made more difficult for them, that it was illegal in public places and so on.  I agree with the Deputy's suggestion that the Minister for Finance missed an opportunity in the budget for putting cigarettes outside the reach of some people who would like to stop smoking.</P>
    <P>In a debate like this there can be tedious repetition as speakers reiterate similar facts. I have listened from the start of the debate this evening and that is what has happened.  The whole issue could take on a sort of fictional dimension and one might be excused for asking are all these cases fabricated and are things really as bad as they are portrayed.  We know it is not fiction.  The problems and the disarray are real. The discomfort and distress is being felt by people up and down the country.  Turning a deaf ear and denying the reality of statistics, as the Minister has done again and again in this House and to the media, conveys the impression that he does not care what happens or that he cannot cope with the complexity and size of the problem which has developed in the last three years.  The latter I feel sure is closer to the truth.</P>
    <P>It is in the nature of politics to campaign for debating time to highlight Government inaction or omission and that happened last week.  It was unfortunate, but it was necessary to get this debating time and we have to recognise that it flushed out a number of initiatives from the Minister as per his speech.  The proposals the Minister has made cannot be taken too seriously, but I will not demean them either.  We have to hold our counsel and see what difference they will make and see how fast they will be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>What is most unacceptable and even distressing are the lengths to which groups in our community have to go to get justice.  Why should an unfortunate <Col N="858" /> group like the parents of mentally handicapped people have to organise public meetings to which they must bring their mentally handicapped children.  It must be very upsetting and humiliating for them to have to do this, to stand and say &ldquo;look at our deformity; look at our children; look at our needs; we need help.&rdquo;  Neither this nor any other area should be a contest between the weak and the powerful as represented by the Government, the Department and the Minister.  This was also the case in the campaign by the haemophiliacs.  The Minister for Health ignored all attempts to have a reasonable and rational debate on an issue that had been accepted as just in other countries and he allowed the matter to come to a head with a Dáil defeat and a subsequent general election. That was totally inexcusable when one looks at the justice of the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister's performance on that issue tells a great deal about the Minister's style.  The Minister seems to believe that his way is the only way, that his decisions are absolute and correct. The Minister will not entertain counterargument to upset his policies even when they involve distress and suffering for the old and sick.  The Minister's reputation for dealing with the problems is not good and we must accept that there is more than a hint of the king with no clothes about his administrative approach.</P>
    <P>About eight months ago people were hoping for great changes.  That was after the radio programme, prior to the election, when the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, admitted with incredible candour that he did not know quite how bad the health service was or that it was in such chaos.  If the issue were not so serious and the confession not raise such fundamental questions it would have been rather touching to hear a Taoiseach, and such a seasoned politician, being so frank on a radio programme.  That alone begs the question: what kind of representations were being made at the Cabinet table for the maintenance of the health services?  Did the Taoiseach not hear the firm arguments that the budget <Col N="859" /> for the health services should be maintained against cutbacks or economies in our hospitals?  We have to deduce that he obviously did not hear them.  Many people expected changes after the election and thought we would see a totally different approach which would be dynamic and effective.  However, there was only an inadequate package which was too little and too late to make any real difference to the problem.</P>
    <P>There has been a fire brigade action on a service which is barely adequate to cope with health needs and there has been no planning or development on a whole range of issues.  They have all been stressed tonight.  I refer to issues such as residential care for the elderly which is a crucial problem.  There are families all over the country who need to get their elderly relatives into residential care but who are unable to do so because of lack of space, sub-standard accommodation, homes being too costly or because they are not entitled to subsidies to help them with the cost.</P>
    <P>We need a network of community care centres to embrace the numerous social and health issues at local level.  We are wonderful at paying lip-service to community care, the need for more community services, a larger number of public health nurses and psychiatric services at local level but we are very poor at following up with the strategic planning and the funding which these need.</P>
    <P>An urgent plan of action is necessary for the physically handicapped to provide residential care on a regional basis.  This is an issue which comes up again and again.  Last week the case of Samantha Webb classically illustrated the impotence of services for residential adult mental handicap needs.  That case focused attention on the problems better than 20 street protests would have done. That is exactly the kind of problem that the association PAM, the Parents for Mental Handicap, were trying to say. Some parents told us, when we had our meeting at the Mansion House not long ago, that they lived in dread of dying because they knew there would be no one <Col N="860" /> to care for their child.  This is exactly what happened to Samantha Webb as her mother died worried and uncertain about future care for her daughter.  This is not good enough in any country that claims to have a caring philosophy in relation to the weak and the disadvantaged.  It is certainly not good enough in a society which has emphatically ruled against abortion.  Should we not match that decision with services that are second to none for those both with mental or physical defects?  Is the treatment of our handicapped minority anything but discouraging and distressing?  Certainly it reneges on many of the commitments given during the constitutional amendment debate on abortion.</P>
    <P>We all know case histories which bear out the facts.  Everyone in politics could paper their office walls with representations and submissions.  I have received numerous letters and requests from people writing to tell me their problems. However, I will not use my time tonight to deal with them.  I will give one example, a letter from an old lady in my constituency which arrived this morning. I want to make sure that the Minister knows her views.  It reads:</P>
    <P>I am an elderly widow, 78 years, a semi-invalid, who had occasion to be hospitalised from 19-26 January last due to serious lung infection with breathing problems.  I had to spend almost five hours in the casualty department of St. Vincent's Hospital before I got a bed in a ward.  I think the treatment of the elderly is disgraceful. My GP told me I had no hope of being admitted except through casualty even though I am in the VHI, plan D, the premium for which I can ill-afford to pay.  I get no handouts from the Government.  I live on a very small income.  I just dread to think of the next time I will need treatment.  Is this the way our caring Dr. O'Hanlon looks after the elderly?</P>
    <P>I had never heard from this women before but I rang her and told her that I would put the matter before the Minister in the debate tonight.  She told me that <Col N="861" /> when she went into St. Vincent's Hospital she was bewildered.  Old people do not understand why the health service, which is supposed to be so advanced, does not treat them better.  This was not the case 20 or 25 years ago.  At that time you went to your doctor if you were ill, the doctor telephoned to get a bed in a hospital and you went in for treatment.  This woman does not understand why she was so badly treated.  She told me that when she went into the hospital that weekend there were three wards vacant which the nurses said they were not allowed to use.  This defies all logic.</P>
    <P>I know that St. Vincent's is an excellent hospital and only the highest praise must go to those employed there.  However, they are working against unfair odds with one hand tied behind their backs.  The Minister indicated in his speech that some people were trying to slither into hospital by the back door by going through casualty. He seems to have the idea that patients are trying to put one over on him and the hospitals.  I can assure him that this is not the case.  All over the country GPs are recommending to people that they should go through casualty.  There is something grievously wrong when doctors cannot telephone a hospital and get a bed for a patient to be treated.  The Minister cannot say there is something devious about this when it is happening all the time.  Genuinely ill people should be graciously and speedily admitted to hospital to get badly needed care.  The lady to whom I referred should not have felt beholden to anyone for getting into hospital.  Cutbacks, bad budgeting, poor planning or management are perpetuating the situation.</P>
    <P>The Asthmatic Society of Ireland also wrote to me.  The Minister has been informed of the details and I am sure he knows they are seeking action on a measure which he promised in a speech a year ago.  The promise was in relation to a drugs subsidy scheme in January 1989 but it has not been heard of since.  When will this scheme be introduced?  Will the Minister communicate his decision to us and to the society who say they are tired <Col N="862" /> of telephoning and writing to the Department? The scheme would mean that they would get a subsidy on the huge bills, which can be up to £200 per month, on medication.  Will the Minister indicate a date for putting that scheme into effect?</P>
    <P>The Minister said there are not any patients waiting to get into hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the Minister's priorities.  Does he feel that people should be close to death before they get into hospital and are not entitled to ordinary operations such as the removal of a gall bladder or treatment for a heart condition as in the case of a 23 year old? These matters came to my attention and I know there are people in that category waiting to get treatment.  I do not campaign for complaints, they come to me. Can we not get the truth about fundamental issues like this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister consider it a good idea to appoint a health ombudsman?  We should consider either a separate agent or make the present Ombudsman responsible. A case was made for such an appointment last year by Deputy Mary Harney in the course of a Bill introduced into the House.  I was not a Member of the Dáil at that time but the suggestion she made in the course of the debate made a lot of sense.  There are good reasons for such an appointment particularly in view of the conflict that has emerged in this debate.  The Opposition put forward their complaints and the Minister denied them.  For that reason there is a need for an independent person, or body, to sit in judgment on <Col N="863" /> such complaints and, if necessary, make recommendations.</P>
    <P>In the course of that debate, as reported at column 902 of the Official Report of 23 May 1989 Deputy Harney stated:</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to provide for the creation of a health ombudsman to investigate the provision of medical and surgical services in public hospitals. We have deliberately modelled the Bill on the Ombudsman Act, 1980 but there are a number of important differences.  First, the sole function of the health ombudsman is to investigate complaints by or on behalf of persons with either full or partial eligibility under the Health Acts or who have policies of insurance with the VHI or who are the holders of health insurance licences in relation to the provisions of administration by a public hospital or health board.</P>
    <P>The objective of this Bill, therefore, is to provide some independent arbitrator for patients using hospitals and to provide a check against improper or wasteful decisions of the hospital or health board bureaucrats.  I am not saying that such an appointment would be the answer to all our problems but it would fill a need. It is important that we get to the truth between the arguments that are flying hither and tither in this debate.  Fine Gael, represented by Deputy Yates, welcomed the initiative by Deputy Harney and described it as an effort to ensure that there would be accountability.  An ombudsman, working independently, would be able to identify genuine complaints as distinct from spurious accusations.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals to deal with the problems in the health services deserve a guarded welcome.  We will watch their development with interest. The Minister should identify the needs in the health services.  Deputy O'Connell outlined the expensive health care services that are available.  Five years ago <Col N="864" /> we would not have thought of heart transplants, open heart surgery or liver transplants. They are expensive procedures but at the end of the day one must ask, &ldquo;what price a life; what price to feel well&rdquo;?  The developments in medical science have been tremendous in recent years.  It is the Minister's responsibility to decide on how we should use the new technology.  We cannot say we do not want high tech surgery, that we should continue as before.  I do not think we should say that we cannot afford to give a patient a liver or a heart.  We must consider all advances, look at intermediate reliefs and adopt creative ways to deal with our health needs which do not rely entirely on high tech institutions and expensive hospitals.  Such facilities are not necessary in all cases.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to two hospitals which are providing an important service and in recent years have been fulfilling a vital role.  I am referring to Hume Street Hospital, which is dear to my heart, and Baggot Street Hospital.  The Hume Street Hospital gives a very cost effective service for patients with Psoriasis.  It keeps patients out of hospital by providing a day care service for more than 100 patients needing treatment.  Those patients go to the hospital early in the morning and leave at night.  The hospital also has 26 five day beds.  It provides those services for a little more than £1 million annually. That is an example of what can be done and is an indication of the direction in which we should be moving.  We should use existing hospitals as a type of community support.  Most of us want people to be able to stay at home but at the same time obtain a premium health service.</P>
    <P>A very exciting programme is in place at Baggot Street Hospital.  The Eastern Health Board took over that hospital and have given it new life.  At present a variety of services are centred in the hospital and are operating out of it in the community. There are 35 beds for geriatrics on a residential basis and from 15 to 25 beds for respite care.  Those beds are vital and are in constant use.  There is also a mental health clinic, an adult psychiatric clinic, a dental service, physiotherapy, <Col N="865" /> and an AIDS drop-in centre.  It is wonderful to know that that old hospital which could easily have gone the way of the other city hospitals which were closed has found new life and is providing such a worthwhile service in the community. The hospital is providing community services for as wide an area from Baggot Street to Dún Laoghaire.  It operates with GP cover by seven GPs in its immediate community care area.  That means there is not a necessity for a resident doctor. The GPs concerned have access to the beds and to the services.  That work is provided for a little more than £1 million annually.  We should give deep consideration to such examples.  I would love to think that we could utilise other hospitals and provide the same type of constructive services.</P>
    <P>The debate has been acrimonious, and rightly so, because there is a great deal of pent-up frustration and anger about the health services.  It is our duty to highlight complaints and to urge the Minister to take action to improve our health services. It is my wish that following the debate we will have a service that will satisfy the 78 year old lady I referred to, the parents of handicapped children, the old and those who need community care. I hope we will not be back again flogging the same horse, making the same complaints and getting more frustrated about our health services.  We need to look at access to hospital beds, community care development, services for the mentally handicapped and intermediate hospital care like that provided by Baggot Street Hospital.  We all want a more effective service and we must play our part in trying to end the suffering and the difficulties that exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to state that it saddens me to think we are debating the issue of no confidence in our health services and in the Minister for Health.  It saddened me to witness the depths to which the Opposition, particularly the Fine Gael Party, descended in recent weeks.  I am upset that this issue was brought forward following a lot of <Col N="866" /> petty squabbling by people who are supposed to be intelligent and mature.  At times I have admired the contributions of Opposition members.  I feel quite nauseated that a group who claim to be the principal Opposition party and whose Leader casts himself in the role of Leader of the Opposition should seize upon the health services in what Deputy Dukes referred to as a legitimate parliamentary tactic.  Did they really have all-party consent for this tactic?  For some time Fine Gael have tried to put themselves forward as the custodians of the ill and the elderly, but some of their behaviour on this issue has bordered on the shameful. Their attitude of childish stubbornness, scaremongering and sensationalism has shown them to be what they really are &mdash; people who are trying to make political gain at any cost.</P>
      <P>Very many people, especially elderly people, have been terrified at the prospect of becoming ill when they have heard the grossly misleading statements made by Deputy Yates and others.  The Minister has already refuted those unfounded allegations but it is known that the scare headline has a tendency to stick in people's minds even when the story in question has been shown to be totally untrue.  The scaremongering has continued tonight.  Death certificates and letters from elderly people have been produced.  These relate to isolated incidents I see every month of the year, not just during a flu epidemic.  As a doctor I would have been appalled if some of these allegations had proved to be true and if I had experienced anything of the kind I would hope that my political allegiance would not have silenced my protest.</P>
      <P>I suspect that Fine Gael have been less than concerned about the health service than about desperately looking for an opportunity to inflict political embarrassment on the Government who have earned international acclaim for the manner in which they have transformed our economy in a very short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that a flu epidemic causes problems and numerous hospital admissions occur.  The Opposition helped to <Col N="867" /> create that crisis in relation to beds and hospitals.  If it had been left to the general practitioners we could have managed and controlled the influx of people to beds in hospitals.  The scaremongering tactics of the Opposition and comments from politicians and from some hospital personnel in the media heightened the public sense of panic on a daily basis, with the result that many went directly to casualty departments where casualty officers, medically and legally constrained, would find it very difficult to refuse admission. Scaremongering actions led people to rush to casualty.</P>

      <P>I blame these tactics to a large extent for the panic which was caused.  It irritates me to see people like that take advantage in order to make political capital.  Their tactics did not take into consideration the demoralising effects on doctors, nurses and hospital personnel, all of whom are being accused of not being able to manage the work they are supposed to do.  My profession have been insulted by being accused of turning away people at hospital doors. Doctors have been insulted by claims that people died as a result of decisions not to admit them.  It is always a doctor who makes a decision if a patient is not admitted to hospital and that doctor takes responsibility, not the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is one of no confidence in our health service and in our Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon.  Perhaps on this occasion I have a slight advantage.  I was in the front line during this epidemic.  As an individual and as a doctor and one who is quite prepared to give honour where honour is due on any side of the House and one who will not be afraid to castigate where necessary, I have every confidence in our Minister, his officials and the health service.  I deplore the methods employed by the Opposition parties acting as they did on the emotional issue of health.  This is not because they are concerned with the health of the <Col N="868" /> people &mdash; their treatment of Deputy O'Kennedy demonstrates this &mdash; but for purely political gain in the forthcoming 1993 election.</P>

      <P>Were it not for the going out of office of Fine Gael in 1987 we would scarcely have a bandage, let alone be in a position to provide £1.4 billion for the health service.  That is a lot of money but not satisfied with the mess they left us in 1987, Fine Gael and other Opposition parties last week did their level best to organise the defeat of the Government on the budget proposals.  As Deputy O'Connell has said, what would they have done had we been defeated?  Have they made any concrete proposals tonight?  All we have heard is criticism. Had they succeeded we would have had an immediate general election and risked financial instability and loss of confidence. One of the possible casualties would have been the very health service about which Deputy Yates and his friends now claim to be so concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the almost unanimous disgust with which the national press viewed the behaviour of Fine Gael in recent weeks.  In case anyone should think that this opinion has its sole origin in Metropolitan sophistication, perhaps it would be no harm to record some views from the far north-west.  The editorial in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i> of 2 February stated that some of the behaviour bordered on shamefulness, as for instance not to pair in the Dáil for the hospitalised Minister for Agriculture, whose illness can well be described as an outcome of physically overtaxing endeavour in the discharge of his ministerial duties here and in Brussels.  The editorial continued that for some time past Fine Gael have been assailing the Government for inaction on the troubled state of the health services.  The Labour Party are likewise on the trail to notice on a similar issue, seeking a Dáil vote of no confidence in the Minister for Health.  The Government agreed to have the problem of health administration subjected to a <Col N="869" /> special debate towards the end of February. The Fine Gael Leader, Deputy Dukes, seeking to make a mountain out of a molehill, declared that a state of emergency exists in the health services and that there is urgent need for consideration and action.  There may be grounds for suggestions of precariousness but how unbecoming it is to the status of the second largest party in the State to have the problem made a matter of sensationalism, as if the whole structure of the health administration is on the verge of collapse.</P>
    <P>Three years ago a child of ten would have known that speedy and radical action was urgently needed in order to save the economy and with it all our social services, including health, from collapse.</P>

      <P>Massive cuts in public expenditure were introduced right across the board.  These had to include the health services.  I noted the manner in which Fine Gael ostensibly gave full support to these cuts.  I also noted their devotion to the cause of the canonisation of Deputy Dukes on foot of what I would call the miracle of Tallaght.  I, too, at the time was taken in and was tempted to join in the prayers until I heard a comment from a well known Fine Gael supporter who said that if he was within an ass's roar of Fianna Fáil in the opinion <Col N="870" /> polls, the Tallaght strategy would disappear in the morning.  The fact was that this allegedly noble gesture was making a virtue of what was then regarded by Fine Gael as a necessity.  The electorate were not as innocent as I had been.  The votes did not materialise and so the strategy was abandoned.</P>

      <P>I would remind these lapsed patriots that if the so-called Tallaght strategy was right in 1987 it should still be right today because we have still some way to go before we reach the stage where money is no obstacle where health is concerned.  For Deputy Yates to suggest, on the one hand, that lack of extra expenditure is not at the root of the problem and then to pinpoint areas which could only be improved by increased funding merely highlights the double standards of the Fine Gael case.  Deputy Howlin in his address came up with a number of points, most of them in my opinion, were all statistics.  Deputy Howlin tends to have a lot of time for figures and such things this year.  I must remind him that it is very easy for minority parties to talk here on these issues. I do not think they have a sense of responsibility.  An Oxford dictionary definition of minority on a political matter should probably be irresponsibility. I should loathe the day when anything like that or the type of attitude adopted by minority parties would come across in my health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates also made the point about cataracts and talked of people going blind.  I have never witnessed anybody going blind as a result of a long-term cataract, it is not physiologically possible.  The Deputy also made certain points about drugs, using generic names etc. and talked of the money that could be saved in that way but, as the Minister pointed out, medical science is progressing every day, new drugs and new generic names are coming on the market all the time and any saving that is made is automatically diverted to these areas. <Col N="871" /> Deputy O'Connell mentioned a number of these expensive drugs.  We have to use them in certain instances.  I have often given a lecture on drugs from this viewpoint. Generic names are fine but they are being used and medical science will continue to produce new drugs, possibly on a weekly basis, so that we will always have to use money in this way.</P>
    <P>As one who has worked as a medical practitioner for more than 12 years and in surgical before that I think the House will accept that I have some knowledge of the matters being discussed in this debate.  I come from a county that has always had to fight hard for its fair share from the national coffers and the fight was usually a lost cause in those unfortunate times when Fine Gael were in power.  I am reminded of a period when, as a house officer in what was then known as the County Hospital in Letterkenny, we were in dire need of massive upgrading of facilities so that we could come even remotely close to what would have been regarded as normal in most parts of the country.  The then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition refused point blank to allocate a single penny towards the hospital even though Donegal people had to travel to Dublin and elsewhere for a whole range of treatments.  Furthermore, a deputation at that time were told it would be several years before anything could be done.  Within nine months of this refusal, Fianna Fáil were returned to power and the new Minister for Health at that time, now the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, promptly provided £10 million for the extension and upgrading of what is now Letterkenny General Hospital. He also provided community health services for the county. I am certain that Fine Gael would have regarded this expenditure as a national scandal just as they described similar funding to Knock airport.  This was, of course, just part of a massive hospital programme which Fianna Fáil initiated and which is continuing under the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I have had experience, too, of members of minority parties standing up at county council meetings and making <Col N="872" /> the accusation that the hospital I have worked in has been downgraded to an extent that is irritating and nauseating. The position is that from 1981 to 1989 the number of inpatients treated in the medical department there increased from 2,400 to 3,500, an increase of 46 per cent. A third surgeon was appointed in January 1989.  This increased greatly surgical activity at the hospital resulting in 473 extra general surgical operations being performed in 1989 compared with 1988.</P>
    <P>Our paediatric and neo-natal service has been developed following the appointment of a second consultant paediatrician in 1984, and a registrar in 1989 with the result that the number of transfers of neo-natal and paediatric patients from our far north west to other hospitals has dropped by over 70 per cent since the early eighties.  The number of patients treated in the casualty Department increased from 8,000 in 1981 to 14,700 in 1989, an increase iof 83 per cent.</P>

      <P>The range and depth of pathology services provided in the hospital laboratory has increased during the past decade to the extent that less than 1 per cent of the workload from Donegal is now sent to extern laboratories. Arrangements have been agreed with Altnagelvin for access to a CAT scanning system.  A renal unit was opened in 1985 to provide free treatment for a week for a maximum of six patients.  Up to that time such patients had to travel all the way, two to three times a week, to Dublin hospitals.  A surgical day ward was opened at the hospital in 1987 and there is a major increase in gastrostomies &mdash; 113 per cent.  In addition, a dermatology service is being provided.  Of course we could do with more but that is not to say that the medical service is static.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can Deputy Yates say that we need more centralisation?  Are we to have all roads leading to Dublin hospitals though Dublin hospitals are really <Col N="873" /> national hospitals?  They ought to be complimented on the way in which they care for the rest of the country.  What is the point in all roads leading to Dublin if, as the Deputy says, the corridors are blocked?  We could do with a little more decentralisation.  Other procedures such as TURs and a certain amount of ENT could well be done in rural hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the recent period during which the Opposition claimed that the hospital service was on the verge of collapse I was not aware of a single case where anyone in need of treatment in Donegal was denied access to hospital.  This was due to proper management of the hospitals. Perhaps, therefore, the hospitals quoted by the Deputy ought to look at their management structures before they make such outlandish claims.  During a meeting I had last evening with the administrator at Letterkenny hospital he described the type of management that exists there.  I will not bore the House with the details but it is a credit to them that we did not have any uproar in our hospital during the Christmas period and I do not think we had any less of an epidemic than was the case elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Such access to hospitals would have been virtually impossible had Fine Gael and their erstwhile partners remained in office during all of the years.  A similar story could be related by certain people from Counties Mayo, Cavan, Galway and Waterford and from many other parts of the country where facilities, second to none, are now available, thanks entirely to successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health.  In Dublin the replacement of ancient hospitals by such magnificent additions as Beaumont Hospital and the new Mater Hospital are testimony to what I have said.  This programme is continuing apace.</P>
    <P>The Government, which my party now lead, are no less committed to the task of constant improvement in this whole area but we should occasionally pause and reflect on just what we have achieved in providing health services for our citizens. None of us can yet be satisfied with how far we have gone, but let us contrast our situation with that of the richest nation <Col N="874" /> in the world, the United States.  We have all heard the harrowing stories of people actually becoming bankrupt in that magnificent country as a result of a brief stay in an American hospital.  Only two weeks ago, I read of President Bush's budget proposal which plans to pay for the Star Wars defence system by cutting medical care for the elderly and other social programmes. Compare this with our budget which once again showed our concern for our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this stage, to take the opportunity to refute some of the accusations that have been made in the House here tonight. In my own health board, we can see the Government's commitment to the development and improvement of the health service.  My area also encompasses Sligo and Letterkenny. In the north-west work is well underway on the construction of a new eight storey extension to Sligo General Hospital which will provide excellent new accommodation for wards, operating theatres, X-Ray, out-patient and physiotherapy departments.  The equipping of some departments in the extension has already begun.  Work on the eight storey block will be completed by January 1991 and it will take a further two-and-a-half years to complete stage 2 of the project which involves renovation of existing accommodation.  The total cost of this project in Sligo, in the north-western region, will be £37 million.  The new extension will ensure that the north-west has an excellent modern service with the most up-to-date technology including a CAT scanner.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also approved two additional orthopaedic consultants for the North-Western Health Board last year.  These consultants will have an important impact on waiting lists in orthopaedics in the north-west and one of these consultants will do trauma work at Letterkenny hospital.  These two consultants represent a 50 per cent increase in orthopaedic consultant staffing in the north-west.  The Government are steadily improving the health service in my region to the highest standard.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies tell us that they <Col N="875" /> care about the elderly.  There was a time when we had a rural dispensing scheme. In February 1987, the Fine Gael Government terminated the rural dispensing scheme.  Under that scheme drugs, medicines and appliances were provided through retail pharmacies.  In most cases the doctor gave the complete prescription form to the patient who took it to the pharmacy that had an agreement with the health boards, and in rural areas where a doctor had a centre or practice three miles or more from the nearest retail pharmacy participating in the scheme, the doctor dispensed for those patients services from that centre who opted to have their medicines dispensed by him or her.  Fine Gael got rid of that scheme, causing elderly patients the problems and expense of getting buses to go to the towns, and then they talk about caring for the elderly.  I wonder what their answer to it would be now?  The doctor normally would dispense the medicines provided through a stock order given to the local pharmacy participating in the scheme. The abolition of this scheme caused severe hardship and a lot of distress to patients throughout rural Ireland who depended on the scheme to maintain their health.  The saving the Opposition hope to make by abolishing that scheme was less than £3 million.  This cutback, had it gone ahead, would have caused distress to over 146,000 people.  When the present Minister came into office he had the matter reviewed and the scheme was restored with effect from July 1987.</P>
    <P>In regard to services for the elderly, the health board recently introduced home care schemes for the terminally ill which provides nursing support for the sick in their homes.  With present-day technology we can treat patients at home and make their own bedroom their hospital bed.  In Donegal, for example, 300 patients die from cancer every year and 200 of them die in hospital.  If I were to ask any of the Deputies in this House where they would like to die, I would say that every single one would say that they would rather die at home among the people who knew and cared for them all <Col N="876" /> their life.  No matter how good all hospital services and doctors and nurses, people prefer their own homes.  With proper community care, the services can be provided to enable people to stay at home, so that elderly people can die in their own homes instead of, as the Opposition members phrase it, taking up hospital beds.</P>
    <P>The Government have increased substantially the level of funding for the mentally handicapped.  This is a very emotional issue.  I saw the mentally handicapped on television and my heart went out to them.  I am glad the Government have acted.  I know the Minister will continue to act to help the services for the mentally handicapped.  We have much to be proud of in our health services.  It is no tribute to the quality of our hospitals, nurses and doctors to engage in the scaremongering of recent weeks.  I do not deny there are several areas that I would like to see improved and I will never hesitate to remind the Minister of these in the fully knowledge that they will be dealt with as expeditiously as our resources allow.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that some of these areas have been the victims of the necessary cost-cutting exercise of recent years.  I sincerely hope that funds can be reallocated in such a way as to rectify this.  I refer to such areas as speech and occupational therapy and stroke cases. The personnel are simply not available at this time to enable patients to receive the treatment which could mean the difference between permanent disablement and recovery.  I refer also to the cardiac unit of the Mater Hospital where a small team of surgeons have been performing heroic deeds in recent years.  It was distressing to read this team had to make a medical decision to reduce the intake of patients because they regarded it as necessary that patients should have a longer period of recovery.  It is not true, as was stated, that these people were sent home; they have always been sent back to the referring hospitals.  Nevertheless, the surgical team's judgment was that they should remain now in the Mater and that judgment must be respected.  It is <Col N="877" /> unfortunate that the two people concerned in the complaints did not go initially to the Minister rather than to the media.  I now appeal with confidence to the Minister to look into this very serious area of medicine without delay.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of the desirability of addressing the problem of what is perceived to be a two-tier health system so that no one is seen to be less deserving than others where health care is concerned. This is something which has not been achieved anywhere in the world that I am aware of.  Indeed, in our situation, many would say that we now have a three-tier system with the arrival of the super-private clinics.  Everyone should feel that he or she is a private patient as distinct from the super-private which is another matter entirely.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for your patience.  I have not said everything I wanted to say but I would like to assure the Minister of my complete confidence in him.  I have mentioned some of the matters of concern to me because I know he is anxious to listen to any suggestion which might assist him in his determination to achieve the goal to which he is totally committed and which I am sure he will achieve, namely, a health service that is second to none and one of which we can be proud.</P>

      <P>It gives me no joy to have to take part in this debate tonight, especially when it is a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Health who comes from my constituency.  However, my silence <Col N="878" /> could have been taken that all is well in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and there might be some good reason the Minister for Health is not fully aware of the problems which confront our health service.  If I did not contribute to the debate I would be sadly lacking in my duty to the people who elected me to this House in the first instance and secondly to the families and friends of the sick, the aged and the handicapped who had been in touch with me in increasing numbers over the past number of weeks.  Before I go into this matter in detail and, in particular, a case which came to my notice over the weekend, I should like to comment on a couple of issues.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed at the Minister for Health's opening, unscripted and throwaway remarks when he attacked our spokesperson, Deputy Yates, for bringing this matter to the floor of the House and accused him of climbing on the backs of the handicapped and the sick in an effort to get cheap headlines.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Minister's remarks were uncalled for and have done nothing to add to the debate. I have not come into this House to make alarming statements or in an effort to create any annoyance among the people who are suffering.  I will stand over the facts I put before the House and I hope we can all benefit from this discussion.</P>
      <P>It is noticeable that the Government have thought it necessary to bring in qualified medical members of their party to contribute to this debate, for example, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, who is a former GP, the right honourable Deputy O'Connell who gave us a lecture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We got a lecture from Deputy O'Connell on high-tech modern medical developments.

      <P>These benefits are available to people in the higher income group and those who have contacts and can get into the hospital overnight.</P>
      <P>The third speaker on the Government's side, Deputy McDaid, accused us of belittling his profession.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Nobody has a higher regard for the medical profession than I have.  The yardstick I use for this is the dedication I have seen by members of that profession in my constituency who are prepared to work over and above their normal hours of duty because our hospitals are understaffed.  Within the past ten days nurses have broken down and cried in my presence because they are overworked and over-stressed.  These nurses are over-stressed because they have been put in the unenviable position of having been asked to do the dirty work of putting patients out of hospital before they are able to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the case of a 93 year old lady who is in Cavan General Hospital.  This woman's friends are reluctant to call in to the hospital to see her because of the pressure being exerted on them to take her out of the hospital before she is able to be taken out.  It is not good enough to expect that a 93 year old lady should have to go back to her <Col N="880" /> home which is unheated and to depend on her neighbours.  In another case an 85 year old lady who received a hip replacement operation in Navan Hospital was transferred to Cavan General Hospital and even though she is bed-ridden extreme pressure has been put on her friends to take her home.  If it takes both nursing and lay staff in the hospital to move this lady from her bed into a chair every day, how can we expect that type of service to be provided in her home?  I am sure the Minister will accept that the community care service is practically nil. This is no reflection on the district nurses who are overworked and who have to cope in addition with the old problem, which I will continue to highlight and which is relevant to this debate, of having to travel from house to house on bad roads in the provision of community care services.  I know of a number of houses which are inaccessible because of the condition of the roads.</P>
    <P>What influenced me finally to make a statement here tonight was the removal within the past ten days of extra beds which were assembled in Cavan General Hospital.  I think a total of 35 beds are generally provided in the hospital for middle-aged to elderly people but because of the cramped conditions and pressure the good nursing staff in the hospital for whom I have the highest regard assembled a number of extra beds in a ward which is heated but unused.  I have been told that officials from the North Eastern Health Board who visited the hospital demanded that those beds be taken down and the ward locked.  Is that the kind of medical care and service we should be providing in this day and age? Extreme pressure has been put on the staff working in that hospital.</P>
    <P>At present every one of the 254 beds in St. Phelim's Nursing Home are full. The only way in which one can get an elderly person into that hospital is when some poor unfortunate person in it dies. There are patients in the hospital from the ages of 50 to 104 years.  The fact that there are so many elderly patients in the <Col N="881" /> hospital is an indication of the tremendous service being provided by the nursing staff.  Deputy McDaid, Deputy O'Connell and the Minister referred to the flu epidemic.  I do not believe this flu epedemic has created any crisis.  Our older population are living longer.  At present there are 254 beds in St. Phelim's Hospital whereas five years ago there were 310 beds.  I accept that the reason for the cutback in the number of beds was safety &mdash; beds had to be taken away to leave the passages free for fire exits &mdash; but no extra provision has been made even though there are 60 fewer beds in the hospital.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid said we are accusing and attacking the Government without putting forward any constructive proposals. I want to put forward a constructive proposal here tonight.  The Minister should set up a 20-bed geriatric assessment unit in Cavan General Hospital. I am not the only one who has put forward this proposal.  Some people on the Government benches may say that as a non-medical person I am not qualified to talk on this matter but I have spoken to the staff who care for these old people and they have said that rather than have patients going directly into the nursing home they should be sent first to the general hospital where their condition can be assessed and the necessary treatment prescribed.  If necessary they could then be kept on in the geriatric unit in the general hospital until such time as a vacancy occurs in St. Phelim's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately because of emigration and other reasons many young people who would have looked after their elderly relatives cannot do so and these elderly people have to depend on their friends and neighbours.  I instance the case of an elderly man who following a serious accident was admitted to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin where he has received all the medical treatment that can be given to him.  He is now in need of full-time nursing care.  As he is not from the Eastern Health Board area they are anxious that he be transferred from Beaumont.  He cannot be admitted to <Col N="882" /> Cavan General Hospital and no place is available for him in St. Phelim's Hospital. This unfortunate man after a lifetime of service to this country now finds that he has nowhere to go and no one wants him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the damage caused by recent floods and storms.  The matter is in order but I do not observe the Deputy in the House.  I propose therefore to move on to the second item chosen for the Adjournment Debate this evening. Deputy Pat Rabbitte gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Jobstown college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter this evening.  Let me say before I commence my contribution that in the last few minutes Deputy Flood has asked me to allow him to be associated with this request.  I propose to give him a minute or two of my time if that is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about a community of 7,000 people who were living, until 1980, in a green field area.  Of this number 3,300 are under 14 years of age. At present 1,300 pupils are attending the senior primary school and 67 per cent of the people in the community are unemployed. Up until 1984 there was no primary school in the Jobstown area, so that <Col N="883" /> the parents who moved there to live were forced to send their children to primary schools in Killinarden, Aylesbury, and Castleview.  People who have no idea of the distances involved will not appreciate the hardship that was experienced with children having to travel long distances to school in bad weather.</P>
    <P>This community of 7,000 people live almost entirely in public sector housing. There are no recreational facilities and no amenities in the area except the occasional corner shop.  For example, there is no swimming pool and no second level school in the area which is not served by a rapid rail service.  Indeed, the Codan report carried out in 1987 showed that 67 per cent of the people living in Jobstown were unemployed.</P>
    <P>This is the background to the unique relationship between the school, teachers and parents in this area.  The school is at the centre of community life and represents the aspirations of people that their children will do better than they were permitted to do in terms of educational opportunities.  That community spirit is the source of the extraordinary, sustained and disciplined campaign being carried on by the parents to have a school built.  I recall the principal of the primary school saying that it is being used by the community from 4 p.m. until midnight.</P>
    <P>The college I am talking about was established in 1986 in temporary premises some miles away.  The Minister supported the building of a college when in Opposition.  It was expected when she came to power in 1987 that she would give the go-ahead for the school to be built. Unfortunately, in 1987 the parents became apprehensive about its future and formed the parents' action committee. The Minister equivocated throughout 1987 and the leaders of the parents' action committee paid her an unscheduled visit after she refused to meet them in her office in Marlboro Street.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question from the leader of my party, Deputy De Rossa, on 1 December 1988 she told him that she had decided not to go ahead with the building of Jobstown community <Col N="884" /> college because &ldquo;it was not justified&rdquo;. However the parents were not put off by this and following an extraordinary campaign led by people, such as their chairman, Tony Hubbard, Mick Billane and other parents in the area, they finally wrested a commitment in writing from the Minister on the eve of the general election in 1989 that the college would be built.  Since then a number of parliamentary questions have been tabled.  For example, on 24 October, she told me that agreement had been reached with the liquidator on the purchase price and that arrangements were in hand to complete the process.  As recently as 13 January she gave a similar answer but indicated that that process had still not been completed. Construction work on the school was to commence in March to be completed by the start of the academic year in September 1991.  It was envisaged that the initial class rooms and home economics school would be ready for occupation on 1 September 1990.</P>
    <P>There are 292 pupils on the roll at present and a further 102 sat the assessment test.  This means, give or take the loss of a few over the summer months, that there will be a need to provide accommodation for 370 pupils this September. In addition, on average between 160 and 180 pupils will come on stream each year from a single primary school in the area who will have to be accommodated every year thereafter until the end of the century.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, as described in the newspaper this evening under the heading &ldquo;Bungling Blamed for School Delay&rdquo;, told a meeting last night that the delay in starting construction work on the controversial Jobstown community college in Tallaght was due to a bureaucratic bungle within the Department of Education. Obviously Deputy Harney has not learned that she is now in Government as she is still making Opposition-like statements.  As of tonight, a site has not been acquired and the contract documents have not been signed.  What is even more disturbing is that the construction date has been put back from early March <Col N="885" /> to April.  How is it proposed to have the school built by 12 September?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to bear in mind that there was a delay of about three minutes in starting. I wish to support my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, on this issue and would like to refer to three pertinent points.  The first is that we have a site which is being transferred to the ownership of the Department of Education.  The legal formalities are holding this up in the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Education to ensure that from tomorrow every effort will be made to clear the logjam and to allow for the title of the site to pass to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the contract for the building of the general purposes classroom should be placed forthwith.  These classrooms must be available from September to accommodate the need for the school. There is a tender procedure but I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Education the need to by-pass any difficulties or delays and to ensure that the tender is placed during the month of February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that in placing the contract there is an absolute condition contained in the <Col N="886" /> contract which will bind the successful tenderer to have the classrooms completed and ready for occupation for the start of the school year in September. I say to the Minister of State that in September there will not be sufficient room in the present Brookfield College, as I understand it, to accommodate the needs of Jobstown school.  Therefore, it is absolutely essential that efforts be made to get the contract under way now to ensure that the first phase for which the Minister for Education has given us a commitment will be completed and ready for occupation in September and that the final phase will be completed and ready for occupation in September 1991.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my own appreciation to the parents' committee of the school who fought long and hard, whom we supported in every way we could and who in the end proved successful.  I pay tribute also to the Minister for Education for finally yielding to the needs of the people in the area, for bearing in mind the special circumstances which pertain in the Jobstown parish and for ensuring that this parish is being allowed to develop to its full potential by having its own second level school building in the area from which we understand, although they are occupying an alternative building at present, they are achieving excellent academic results and excellent results in the other areas of the college's activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the contributions they have made in raising this issue because it gives me an opportunity to report on progress which has been made and the difficulties which have existed in regard to the acquisition of the site for this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say first in response to points Deputy Rabbitte made that the Minister for Education responded in a very positive way to the situation in the Jobstown area and to the demands for a new community school in that area, despite very significant financial constraints and other constraints placed upon her at the time. It is only fair that that be pointed out and that in a relatively short time, given the <Col N="887" /> kind of delays that take place and are commonplace in the planning of major community school projects such as this, quite significant progress has been made despite some major legal difficulties which have been outside my Department's domain and which have caused the delays which have been mentioned here this evening.  I am pleased to report that progress has been made on several fronts in regard to the acquisition of this site and the removal of some of the legal difficulties that existed.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of the site for the college have been delineated by the owners' representatives and the survey of the delineated area has been completed by the design team.  There have been very significant legal difficulties associated with the acquisition of the site, many of which were outside the control of the Department and which contributed in no small way to the delay in the acquisition of this site.  These legal formalities are now being processed by the Chief State <Col N="888" /> Solicitor who has been specifically notified of my Department's requirements. The design team are at present revising the tender documentation.  The list of contractors interested in the project from whom tenders will be invited will be presented to the Minister this week together with the contract documents necessary to specify that certain classroom accommodation must be available by next September.</P>
    <P>I assure both Deputies concerned that it is my Department's intention and that there is every reason to believe those classrooms will be provided on time.  I conclude by saying we are well aware of the situation that pertains in Jobstown. We are quite satisfied of the urgent need to provide this school as quickly as possible. I assure the House it is my firm intention that the projected timescale which includes the provision of those classrooms for September 1990 will be met.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 7 February 1990.</P>

A firm of management consultants was engaged by my Department to provide assistance to the three military teams for the full period required to prepare their submissions.  There was no question of a lack of co-operation by my Department in the matter: on the contrary my Department's attitude was and continues to be one of facilitating the Commission in every way possible.

      <P>This incident occurred when a tank round fired by the de facto forces from their compound at Al Qantarah impacted within the Irish UNIFIL position on the southern outskirts of Qabrikha village. The round was one of a large number of tank, mortar and heavy machine gun rounds fired in response to an attack on the compound from the village of Al Qantarah by armed elements.  The tank round destroyed a billet which had accommodation for five personnel.  At the time of the impact, all personnel at the post, which is normally manned by eight members of the Permanent Defence Force, were in their bomb shelter due to previous mortar fire in the nearby area of Tulin.</P>
      <P>The matter was the subject of a strong protest to the Israeli authorities by the Department of Foreign Affairs on 21 December 1989.  It was also raised by the Irish Ambassador accredited to Israel in a meeting last week with the Israeli Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>In the last six months there have been 98 firings close to Irish positions in UNIFIL.  These firings, while hazardous for Irish personnel, did not constitute attacks in the strict military sense.  All of these incidents have been the subject of protest by the UNIFIL authorities to the Israeli Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>I have received an initial report regarding this incident.  The report indicates that shortly before 10 p.m. on 30 January 1990 <i>LE Deirdre</i> responded to a Mayday call relayed through Marine Rescue Co-Ordination Centre from a trawler which was aground one quarter of a mile north west of Roancarrigmore Lighthouse at the eastern entrance to Berehaven.  The trawler had 16 crew members on board.</P>
      <P>
        <i>LE Deirdre</i> which was anchored in Berehaven was on the scene in 20 minutes and the ship's captain decided to attempt to rescue the crew of the trawler.  A Gemini craft was launched, manned by two naval personnel, Leading Seaman Michael Quinn and Able Seaman Paul Kellett.  The Gemini craft was unable to go alongside the trawler due to severe winds and high seas and the crewmen attempted to return to <i>LE Deirdre</i> but the craft was capsized by a freak wave. Both crewmen were thrown into the water.  Both were wearing floatation suits and lifejackets but were unable to communicate with each other due to the conditions and became separated. Seaman Kellett was eventually washed ashore on the rocks and succeeded in making his way to the public road where he was picked up by the local gardaí.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that, despite a search of the shoreline by gardaí and of the sea area by the RAF helicopter which arrived on the scene some time later, Leading Seaman Quinn did not survive.  His body was subsequently recovered.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the bravery of both men and to offer my condolences to the family of Leading Seaman Quinn on their tragic loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> A full and extensive inquiry will be carried out into the circumstances surrounding the incident.</P>

      <P>Ireland's network of diplomatic relations, both resident and non-resident is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future given our limited financial and personnel resources.  Possibilities for its extension are examined from time to time in the light of our national and international interests and the availability of the necessary resources.  Announcements are made, at the appropriate time, following such review exercises.  It would be contrary to international practice, however, to publicly speculate on their outcome.</P>

      <P>Ireland has substantial contact with a number of SADCC countries. Three of the four priority countries for Irish bilateral aid are members of SADCC: Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho. Projects assisted in each of these countries in 1987, 1988 and 1989 were in the areas of education, health, rural development and institutional support. In 1987 there were 34 Irish experts employed under the bilateral aid programme in Lesotho, 21 in Zambia and eight in Tanzania.  These numbers remained the same for Zambia in 1988 and 1989.

      <P>I have been advised by the <Col N="679" /> Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 30 June 1989 and submitted a claim for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment to the inspector of taxes on 5 July 1989.  His claim was dealt with on 23 August 1989 and a cheque for £212.36 was issued to him on 31 August, 1989. An application form to enable him claim a further repayment after four weeks was issued to him on 23 August 1989.  The inspector of taxes has not received any further claim from the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>There has been no decrease in the available number of agricultural seed varieties.  The International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) of which Ireland is a member was established under the aegis of FAO in 1976. Its basic function is to promote and co-ordinate an international network of genetic centres to further the collection and conservation of germplasm and it has collected over 100,000 samples since then. The germplasm stored by them is available to plant breeders here if they require it.</P>
      <P>As part of the European Co-Operative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources organised by IBPGR, Ireland has contributed any unique varieties of grasses, clovers and cereals to breeders and gene banks throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>Supplies of germplasm are maintained here by my Department, Department of Forestry, Teagasc and the universities. Collecting and maintaining germplasm is very expensive and setting up our own gene bank is not necessary when we have access to the international network of genetic centres.</P>

The study tour allowed the Irish experts to view at first hand the progress in disease eradication achieved in these countries and it served to indicate ways in which ERAD's own programme might be improved.  It resulted in a number of joint research projects being set up between Irish researchers and their foreign counterparts.

      <P>The Community support framework sets out the commitments from the FEOGA Guidance Section over the period 1989-93 for:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the operational programme for rural development;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the operational programme for forestry;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the western package;</P>
      <P>&mdash;horizontal Community measures (under Objective 5 (a)) relating mainly to on-farm investment, headage payments in disadvantaged areas and marketing and processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to a similar question on 30 November 1989, I indicated the amounts <Col N="686" /> committed from FEOGA Guidance Section in respect of each of these five headings. The Community support framework does not provide a more detailed breakdown or the annual amounts in respect of these five headings.</P>
    <P>At this stage I expect that grants for marketing and processing will continue to apply to the range of projects which are currently eligible for assistance such as the construction and modernisation of beef, pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat processing facilities, certain dairying processing activities, convenience food plants, grading and packing facilities etc.</P>
    <P>With regard to on-farm investments, it is envisaged that the existing aids for these under the farm improvement programme and the western package will continue in operation.  In addition, the operational programme for the control of farmyard pollution, which was introduced in August 1989, provides aid towards the provision of slurry and silage effluent storage tanks and for animal housing and fodder storage outside the context of a farm plan.  It is also proposed to introduce a scheme of aid to promote alternative farm enterprises and a national agri-tourism scheme under the operational programme for rural development at present in preparation.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the report of the European Court of Auditors, paragraph 8/17 and 8/18, stated that 37 per cent of industrial regional development in Ireland which qualified for aid grants were abandoned and that the aid was fully decommitted during the period 1985 to 1987; and the controls which will be introduced to prevent this type of situation arising under the current plan.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report in question which refers to a sample survey, carried out by the European Court of Auditors, of industrial projects which were approved for ERDF support which found that 37 per cent of the projects were abandoned and the aid decommitted. The Government do not accept that the survey results represent a fair reflection of the true position.  Of the total number of projects which were approved support for the years 1985 to 1987, 21 per cent either never commenced or ceased production.  This represents 16.8 per cent of total financial commitments.  In addition there was a further 5.1 per cent decommitment in respect of projects which proceeded but in respect of which the actual expenditure <Col N="693" /> was less than anticipated.  Most importantly, the ERDF moneys decommitted were not lost to Ireland as the proceeds of these decommitments were made available towards other projects.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that a certain proportion of industrial projects will either not proceed or not proceed as initially envisaged for sound commercial reasons.  The new arrangements for Community assistance, under the Operational Programme for Industry 1989-1993, provide for financial support to be given towards expenditure under a total programme rather than for individual projects so that a situation where individual projects are decommitted should not arise.  All the agencies under my Department, which were fully involved in the preparation of the operational programme, have in place systems and controls which will ensure that the subprogrammes are implemented and that the funds are effectively spent. In addition, there will be a monitoring committee representing Government Departments, the Commission of the European Communities, the social partners and the implementing agencies, chaired by my Department, which will have the role of monitoring the implementation of the operational programme. It has been agreed with the European Communities that as the implementation of the programme proceeds figures may be adjusted to reflect outturn and emerging trends within the discretion allowed under the Community support framework.</P>

    <P>Figures for 1989 are not available at present.</P>
    <P>Figures based on net underwriting results.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in the day-to-day operations of insurance companies or in the exercise of business acumen on their behalf.  The system of statement presentation adopted by insurers is a commercial matter to be decided on by each individual insurance company.  Notwithstanding its desirability in the consumers' interest, some insurers do not indicate the level of no-claims bonus on their renewal statements. However, I understand that all insurers will issue details of no claims bonus on request.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy no doubt will be aware, since price control was abandoned in January 1986, motor insurers are required only to notify my Department of proposed alterations in their rates.  Such proposals do not require sanctioning but rather I must respect the right of individual insurers to adjust their rates in the light of their individual underwriting experience.  Therefore, the question of adverage acceptable level of increases does not arise.  The Deputy will appreciate that my primary, and indeed statutory responsibility as the insurance supervisory authority, is to ensure that insurance companies maintain the appropriate statutory reserves and solvency requirements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies relate to the day to day activities of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health and I suggest that they seek this information directly from the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, provided the legal basis for the new occupational safety and health system and for the establishment of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  The principal functions of the Authority are set out in the Act and these include monitoring and enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions.</P>
      <P>The purpose behind the establishment of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies such as the Authority to carry out executive functions of Government is to provide the optimum degree of flexibility and freedom and to relieve Ministers of responsibility for the decisions which the boards and staffs of these bodies take in the course of day-to-day administration of their responsibilities.  I will remain answerable to the Dáil for the overall policies relating to the Authority including the legislation under which it operates and the Exchequer allocations provided to it.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, it is the board's policy at present to target new housing developments and areas which are already served by gas mains and which have potential for significant extra gas sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital cost of extending the gas grid to built-up areas such as Llewellyn <Col N="697" /> Court which are not already served by gas mains is extremely high.  Bord Gáis are currently undertaking a pilot project on the economic feasibility of bringing supplies to non-gas housing estates.

      <P>As I stated in reply to previous questions in the matter, Bord Gáis Éireann is a statutory body charged with developing and maintaining a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis.  Any proposal for the extension of the gas grid must, therefore, be assessed in this light by the board.</P>
      <P>The board have, accordingly, concentrated to date on marketing gas in areas which are in close proximity to the existing transmission pipelines, which have existing gas grids, and which have a market which would justify the high capital expenditure required to supply gas.  Consideration may be given to the extension of supplies to other areas such as Carrick-on-Suir in the longer term, but it would be unrealistic to assume the likelihood of supply in the short to medium term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their dwellings is the responsibility of local authorities.  Information on the number and type of dwellings in each county which require refurbishment on the number of the dwellings which have been refurbished at any particular point in time and on unit costs is not readily available in my Department and the compilation of the information would require a disproportionate amount of staff resources.  The capital funding which has been drawn by authorities under the remedial works scheme to the end of 1989 is set out in the statement below.  The 1990 applications will be notifed to authorities shortly.</P>
      <P>In the case of Dara Park, approval issued last month to the seeking of tenders for phase 3 which will involve work on up to 60 dwellings.</P>

      <P>The recommended temperature for incineration of hospital waste, which would typically include waste designated as Class A, B, C and D, varies from one country to another.  A survey of emission rules in seven countries, published in the Journal of the Institute of Hospital Engineering of October 1988, shows recommended temperatures from 800ºC to 1000ºC.  All incinerators recently installed in hospitals in this country have a minimum specified burning temperature of 1000ºC.  Arrangements are in hand to ensure that all waste will be incinerated in conditions which comply with these requirements.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any published reports which relate to the analysis of emissions from hospital incineration stacks in this country.  However, it is generally accepted that emissions from waste which is incinerated at the recommended temperature do not constitute an environmental hazard.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board that two medical practitioners provided general medical services to eligible patients in the area in question up to recently, when one of the doctors retired.  The board then reviewed the composition of both doctors' patient panels including the age profile, the geographical distribution of patients and the viability of the two general medical services practices in the area.  Following this review the board decided, after consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation, that the appointment of a second doctor to the area was not required.</P>

      <P>The staffing of national schools is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the INTO under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In the case of Scoil Íosagáin national school there were 273 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 1988 which warrants a staff of principal plus seven assistants for the 1989-90 school year.  The school also has the services of a full time remedial teacher and an additional assistant teaching post under the special scheme of teaching assistance for schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions that can be made from the agreed staffing arrangements is in the case of developing schools or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes would be breached. Scoil Íosagáin national school does not meet the criteria necessary to qualify under either of these exceptions.  Therefore, the appointment of an additional assistant teacher is not warranted for the 1989-90 school year.</P>
      <P>The appointment of an additional assistant to the school for the 1990-91 school year with effect from 1 September 1990 is warranted by the enrolment on 30 September 1989.</P>
