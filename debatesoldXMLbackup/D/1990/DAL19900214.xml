      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 9 and 10.  It is also proposed that No. 2 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 19, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the Taoiseach intends to make any time available in the House over the next few days to give information to the House about the proposed sale of ICI, thereby bringing to a conclusion a matter which caused this House difficulty some years ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking if the Taoiseach would consider bringing the matter before the House so that we can discuss it.  It is a matter of some public importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach on the Order of Business and in his role as President of the EC if he has decided to have a special summit meeting of the EC Foreign Ministers or of the EC Council of Ministers in Dublin to discuss the implications of German monetary union? Has the Taoiseach as President of the EC made a decision in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 23 to 26, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;on such day&rdquo; down to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;one calendar month after its enactment by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may fix by order, either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision, and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and different provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>It is a concern of the Fine Gael Party that we enact legislation and bring it into force as rapidly as possible to tackle the very serious inadequacies of our laws with regard to compensation claims and compensation awards.  This legislation was published on 18 October 1988 and has had an extensive Second Stage debate. At the time I made the point that I felt the legislation was grossly inadequate and did not deal properly with many of the problems that had to be confronted. During the course of that debate I listed a number of problems with the legislation as I saw it and proposed a number of different approaches I hoped the Minister would be willing to take on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we start this debate I want to say I am pleased the Minister, in the vast number of amendments he has tabled, has taken on board many of the fundamental changes that Fine Gael proposed to this Bill.  Whereas I still disagree with some aspects of the Minister's approach, I think even if none of the Opposition parties' amendments were accepted &mdash; I hope some of the amendments tabled on this side of the House by all parties will be accepted &mdash; and even if we simply took on board the Minister's amendments, the Bill would emerge from the current procedure as a measure vastly improved from that originally proposed to the House.  I am glad the Minister, <Col N="1718" /> having said to the House on Second Stage that he wished to hear what Members had to say about the Bill, has shown a genuinely constructive response to many of the criticisms of the Bill.  It is right that we say this because on too many occasions when Opposition Deputies raise issues with legislation Ministers go deaf and are not willing to take on board constructive changes that are proposed. Therefore, I welcome the approach the Minister has shown to the Bill and many of the amendments he has proposed.  Certainly they will improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>Due to the inadequacies of the original legislation it is only now, in February 1990, almost a year-and-a-half since this Bill was first published, that we are getting down to Committee Stage.  In the time lapse that has taken place further possible claims for compensation in circumstances that we would regard as unjustifiable have been lodged against local authorities.  Local authorities are at risk of further claims being processed and awards being made that I do not believe are in the interests of the wider community.</P>
    <P>I do not really understand why section 2 is phrased as it is.  I do not see why, once this legislation is passed through this House and through the Seanad and is signed by the President, it should not automatically become law.  I do not know why the Minister intends, as it appears from the section, to bring different parts of the legislation into force at different times.  I am concerned that that could result in further compensation claims building up that may have to be determined under the current law and under the criteria laid down in the current law rather than be determined under the new provisions we are going to enact under this Bill.  Therefore, my initial reaction to section 2 is that it should be opposed, and I think Deputies Quinn and Gilmore have taken a similar view.  If I understand the procedures of this House, we will go through a two-fold voting stage.  My reaction is that the section should be taken out of the Bill.  If we do not succeed in taking it out of the Bill we should delimit the time following the passage of the <Col N="1719" /> legislation within which it comes into force.</P>
    <P>In a sense, my amendment No. 1 is an alternative to taking this section completely out of the Bill.  If we cannot take the section completely out of the Bill I propose a substitute amendment to the effect that the Bill must come into force one calendar month after its enactment by the Oireachtas.  The Minister may feel that for some reason local authorities may require a brief lead-in time following the Bill being signed by the President to come to terms with the provisions contained in the legislation, though I do not see why they would need that lead-in time.</P>
    <P>The preferable approach would be to delete section 2 and let the Bill commence upon its enactment.  The next preferable approach, though not the best, would be to have 21 days or one calendar month following the signing of the Bill by the President and it becoming law. The worst approach of all is to have this provision in section 2 that is there which means that, first, following the enactment of the legislation there is no certainty when it will become operative.  It may not become operative in 1990; it may become operative in 1991 or 1992.  There is no certainty when different parts or different aspects of the legislation will become operative.  Because of the interacting nature of the legislation and because different provisions in it are interdependent with other provisions, I see some difficulty in different parts being brought into play at different stages.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider section 2.  It is the type of section we have as a commencement section.  It is what one has seen in other legislation.  Perhaps the parliamentary draftsman just put it in.  We had a similar provision in the Building Control Bill which gave rise to similar concerns.  I do not think it is appropriate in this legislation, considering the lead-in time to our getting to Committee Stage.  If the Minister feels there is some need to give owners of lands a warning of this legislation, they have had a year and a half to be warned.  I do <Col N="1720" /> not think people who seek to abuse the provisions in the Planning Acts to seek unjustified compensation in circumstances that from a social policy perspective are indefensible should be given any particular notice in any case.  I ask that the Minister agree that section 2 be deleted.  If he will not agree to that, then I propose amendment No. 1 which would have the effect of ensuring that within one calender month of the legislation being enacted it would come into force.</P>
    <P>This is very important legislation.  As far as I know, in a local authority of which I am a member, Dublin County Council, there are accumulated possibilities of compensation claims amounting to in the region of £18 million.  I am not saying some of the property development companies who may seek to make those claims will necessarily succeed in them even under existing legislation.  They may not, and I want to say nothing in this House to lend credibility to some of those claims.  However, they are there and that local authority are under threat from them.  There are probably other claims mounting or threatened against other local authorities.  I am most familiar with what Dublin County Council are confronted with and because of that it is most urgent that this legislation come into force immediately upon its passage.</P>
    <P>It is urgent for another fundamental reason.  A number of local authorities, including Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation, are involved in the development plan review process.  The whole procedure of the development plan review and the re-zoning of lands in the context of taking an overall view of the planning in the city and county is rendered nugatory by threats of compensation from developers seeking to put housing estates or industrial development on land zoned for agricultural or amenity use.  As a result of such threats, local authorities who do not have the funds or capacity to pay compensation claims have succumbed to granting planning permission which materially contravenes their development plan and which in effect makes the development plan review process a largely futile exercise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> Very recently we had a situation where Grange Developments, who had been paid £2 million compensation by Dublin County Council, were given planning permission for their lands which materially contravened the development plan, in effect because the Fianna Fáil majority on the council wished to recoup the £2 million which had been paid to them.  To my mind the decision was not based on what was in the interests of the planning of County Dublin; it was a planning permission eventually given, in a sense, on account of financial blackmail. We must bring that financial blackmail to an end and ensure that we have proper planning and development.  We must also ensure that the preparation of development plans mean something and that compensation claims of the type we saw in the Grange Development case will not arise following the enactment of this legislation.  There must be no delay in bringing it into force.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board our amendment that we remove the section entirely.  However if he does not take the proposal on board, I would ask him to consider that we have a one month lead-in time before the legislation comes into operation following its enactment.</P>

      <P>In his opening remarks Deputy Shatter has spoken for the House in a broad sense and I do not want to repeat unnecessarily what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have an opportunity very quickly to indicate what he will do in relation to this section.  It is quite clear that it is totally unsatisfactory in its present form.  I wish to join in supporting the view expressed by Deputy Shatter that the Act must come into operation at a fixed time.  The public at large and the developers are well aware of its contents and that the terms of compensation have been changed.  The overall commitment to deal with this problem has been signalled by this House for some time.  The Department of the Environment have the resources to make the necessary regulations quite quickly and to bring the Act into operation at a fixed point in time, <Col N="1722" /> which can be readily calculated by the Minister and his advisers from today 14 February 1990.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to respond positively and to indicate clearly to the House that it is his intention to amend this section on Report Stage or to signal quite clearly that the legislation will come into operation by a fixed date.  I am referring to all of the provisions of the Bill coming into operation on a fixed date and not just individual sections as proposed in the wording of section 2 at present.  For that reason, like other Deputies I am opposed to the section.  Having regard to the arguments that have been made on the section, I would like to hear what the Minister's response will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us deals with legislation that is certainly long overdue. There has been a great degree of hesitancy going back over the years in tackling the problem of planning compensation. For years we were told we could not legislate to do away with planning compensation because that would be unconstitutional.  It was not until there were very substantial claims in the Dublin area &mdash; the case against Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member, by X.J.S. in Killiney and the case in Mountgorry involving Grange Developments and Dublin County Council, of which I am also a member &mdash; that it became quite clear that it was no longer supportable to have a situation where the taxpayer had to fork out large sums of money simply to compensate somebody who had been refused planning permission. I might add that in both of those cases the circumstances of the refusal &mdash; or certainly the circumstances in which An Bord Pléanala made its final decision &mdash; gave rise to very serious questions that have yet to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the legislation comes into effect quickly.  Like Deputy Shatter I do not understand why section 2 is as it is in the original Bill and why it is proposed that the provisions of the Bill would only come into effect piecemeal and that the Minister might have the power to bring into operation <Col N="1723" /> one part of the Bill, which for example, deals with the question of connections to sewers or the water supply but that he would also have the power not to bring in the substantial part of the Bill, dealing with compensation until some time later, or that he might bring in the part of the Bill dealing with compensation and not bring in another part.  That seems to me to leave the whole question of planning compensation and the need to tighten and eliminate the loopholes very much in the air.</P>
    <P>I believe that the section should be deleted from the Bill and that the legislation should come into effect immediately. There are very good reasons for that.  The principal reason is that you do not give advance notice to people who may wish to lodge planning applications or claims against local authorities for compensation or allow a hiatus period within which that may be done.  I agree that Deputy Shatter's suggestion would improve the section, if it is not going to be deleted, but I would still be concerned that if you give a month lead-in time between the enactment of the legislation and its coming into force it would be a very busy month for the local authority planning departments.  I believe that planning applications would be lodged by the hundreds and compensation claims as well in order to meet the deadline.  Obviously it would be considerably worse if you allowed a period of time that would be longer than this. There is a good deal of experience that supports my view on this.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in the past couple of years the number of planning compensation awards and the amounts of the awards have been increasing.  The people who have been making the claims have been encouraged by the awards that have already been made.  If we allow a period of time between the enactment of the legislation and its coming into operation we are in fact inviting and encouraging additional planning applications, which might be very spurious, but are lodged simply to get a toe in the door and be in <Col N="1724" /> line to claim compensation.  Unfortunately that has been the experience. People have talked publicly about closing the loophole in the planning law by abolishing planning compensation or at least by limiting the circumstances in which it can apply.  I think it would be very regrettable if the Legislature, having faced up to the problem at long last, were then to leave a further loophole through which property speculators could slip in their planning applications and their compensation claims against local authorities. There is a considerable number of claims outstanding.  In reply to a parliamentary question last week the Minister said that at the end of 1987 the total was over £10 million in Dublin County Council alone.  He told me that it was £13.5 million but my information from Dublin County Council is that the figure is closer to £20 million.  I believe that the national figure is probably in the order of £50 million to £60 million. Between 1982 and 1987 the aggregate of claims against local authorities was in the order of £70 million.  We are talking about very large sums of public money, possibly, going to people for refusal of planning permission.  There is an obligation on the Legislature to close the loophole irreversibly so that developers and speculators cannot slip through.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment in the name of Deputy Shatter and also the amendments calling for this section to be deleted.  One has to welcome the fact that this Bill has been radically changed since it was first in this House.  I was not then a Member but I worked behind the scenes with Deputy Shatter to ensure that we could get a better Bill. Knowing the difficulties of the 1963 Act at local authority level, we saw the flaws in the Minister's Bill.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has tabled so many amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is risk that if this section stays in the Bill the Minister may find himself under enormous pressure from local <Col N="1725" /> authorities and particularly from developers. There are so many claims for compensation that he might be pressured into saying that they should be sorted out and tidied up before this legislation comes into force.  In that event, many more claims will be commenced.  One does not simply put in a claim today for compensation. There are many minor steps along the way.  Dublin County Council and other local authorities have many claims that are very low down on the ladder but, if this legislation is delayed, there will be an opportunity for these claims to climb up the ladder in such a way that the Act will not apply to them.</P>
    <P>We want to make sure that the claims now outstanding do not come into the same realm as the scandal last year when Mountgorry Lands and Grange Development Properties managed to get £2 million of taxpayers' money from Dublin County Council.  It is interesting to note that they got that money within 24 hours. A planning permission which was granted has been appealed to an Bord Pleanála, who might have the sense not to grant it. It is ridiculous that compensation by local authorities has to be paid in one lump sum but we are now in a position where the local authority have to do a deal with the current applicant to get the money back over ten or perhaps 20 years.  It certainly will not be returned with the same speed as the council had to pay it out from their precious capital funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister should listen to the Opposition case.  I know he wants this Bill to be effective.  If that section remains, the Minister will come under enormous pressure to hold the line until there is a tidying up of any claims outstanding. The Minister has shown his openness in accepting so many amendments to improve this Bill and his name will go down in history as the one who introduced the necessary legislation to get rid of the scandal of compensation.  I know he is big enough and man enough to accept this amendment, or even the slightly less suitable one, which will ensure that the Bill comes into force within one calendar month.</P>

With the welcome given to the proposed legislation, as amended, I hope this generosity will see a speeding up of the passage of the legislation, which is in all our interests.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `habitable house' means a building or part of a building which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is used as a dwelling, or</P>
      <P>(b)  is not in use but when last used was used, disregarding any unauthorised use, as a dwelling, or</P>
      <P>(c)  was provided for use as a dwelling but has not been occupied.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment introduces the concept of &ldquo;habitable house&rdquo;, using the same <Col N="1727" /> definition as is contained in the Planning (Exempted Development) Regulations, 1984.  Later amendments, particularly amendments Nos. 61 and 77, will rule out any compensation where planning permission is refused or conditions are applied so as to prevent the demolition of a habitable house.  The collective effect of these amendments will be to reinstate the exclusion of compensation in this matter which existed between 1969 and 1984 by virtue of the now repealed Act of 1969.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 9, after &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, section 23 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the section <Col N="1728" /> on the connection to public water supplies and sewers.  The owner of any premises within the district of a sanitary authority shall be entitled to cause his drain to empty into the sewers of that authority, subject to the following conditions:</P>
    <P>That he applies to that authority in the prescribed form and receives permission to do so;</P>
    <P>That he pays the contribution required by that authority for making such a connection;</P>
    <P>That he complies with the regulations of that authority in respect of the mode in which the connection between such drains and sewers is to be made and with the directions of any person who may be appointed by the authority for the supervision and inspection of the work.</P>
    <P>A sanitary authority may refuse permission for such a connection if, <i>inter alia,</i> the existing capacity in a sewer has been designated for the drainage of an area zoned for development in the development plan made in accordance with Part III of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which was recommended by the Irish Planning Institute in their document submitted to the Minister and circulated prior to the publication of the original Bill.  The view of that professional body should be given serious consideration in relation to the connection to water supplies and sewers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments attempt to improve the drafting of section 25.  They also introduce an explicit power and requirement for a sanitary authority to charge for making a connection to a public sewer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might deal with the drafting matters first.  Amendment No. 59 proposes a new subsection (3) for section 25 but leaves the other provisions of that section intact. Section 25 (6) and (7), as drafted, in effect provides that the requirement of special permission under subsection (3) to connect to a sewer will be dispensed <Col N="1729" /> with where a sanitary authority already direct a person to connect, or where planning permission or by-law approval has been obtained for the structure.  In that type of case a person would avoid the mandatory charge or contribution the amendment seeks to establish.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 25 (3) (b), as proposed by amendment No. 59, essentially this appears to repeat what is already catered for in subsection (8) which, incidentally, the amendment would leave untouchéd.  I intend to speak more fully later about the policy considerations behind section 25.</P>
    <P>I should explain that I am not concerned in this Bill to effect a fundamental overhaul of public health and sanitary services legislation.  Section 25 was designed only to prevent developers from finding an escape route by way of normal planning controls by way of earlier rights laid down in the sanitary services code. As to charging for consent to connect to a sewer, this is not provided for in the Bill.  The reasoning is that such charging should be possible under section 2 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 or, in the circumstances of a planning application, by way of a development contribution under section 26 of the 1963 Planning Act where it is already catered for.  In those circumstances I cannot support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 14, after &ldquo;under this Act,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any other case under Part VI of the Principal Act, which arises or has already arisen before this Act comes into operation,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment because, as the Minister and Members will be aware, there are outstanding a considerable number of claims for planning compensation.  The Bill, as drafted, would not affect any of those claims.  I might add that we are talking about claims, nationally, of the order of £50 million to £60 million, an enormous sum of public money.  As was mentioned earlier, in the case of one local authority, we are talking about claims close on £20 million.  The House has a responsibility to protect the public purse against huge payments of this kind.  It may be argued that the payments may never be made.  If they are not made in practice what will happen is that local authorities will give undertakings to developers to grant planning permissions that would otherwise be refused.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen has already mentioned the repeat case of Mountgorry, the very same lands in respect of which Dublin County Council paid £2 million in compensation in April 1989 and in respect of which a new planning application was submitted.  There is the possibility that the £2 million may be refunded, that Dublin County Council, under severe financial strain, will decide to grant planning permission for a development there which is virtually the same kind of development in respect of which they originally refused permission as they fought through the courts and in respect of which they ended up paying £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had experience of both of the <Col N="1731" /> major payments made in relation to planning compensation.  I am a member of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council which ended up having to pay £150,000 in compensation and subsequently in excess of £50,000 more in order to purchase lands on Roche's Hill in Killiney, the XJS case. I remember the difficulties we experienced in Dublin County Council last year with the award to Grange Developments. It is ironic that those members of Dublin County Council who sought to resist that payment last year &mdash; and there were over 50 of us who voted against the payment at a meeting of Dublin County Council &mdash; were told subsequently that a file had been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions to establish whether we were in contempt of court.  I find it remarkable that public representatives, who sought to protect the public, and public money from being paid out in such circumstances, could find themselves threatened with legal action, whereas nothing appeared to be done <i>vis-à-vis</i> the recipients in that case who had a horrendous track record in County Dublin with a long list of unfinished housing estates.</P>
    <P>What I am endeavouring to do in this amendment &mdash; in addition to closing off future claims which may be lodged against local authorities &mdash; is to close off the possibility that local authorities will have to pay out on claims already in the pipeline because of planning permission refusals to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly like to see this amendment supported.  I should also like to hear the legal advice the Minister has received in relation to it because it appears to me to contravene a fundamental rule within our Constitution that retrospective legislation cannot be enacted.  That would appear to be its impact.  Certainly it is its intent because a claim for compensation filed under existing law &mdash; however ridiculous that law may be considered to be &mdash; would appear to me to be legally valid.  Certainly I would support the sentiment.  It is not merely a matter of trying to close the <Col N="1732" /> barn door after the stallion has galloped away, it is more a case of endeavouring to construct the barn before we even get the stallion into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Quinn has said constitutes a major problem in this area.  That is my understanding of it. There is a very old law case, called the Sinn Féin funds case, the legal principles of which have been reiterated since.  They are to the effect that if litigation has been instituted, the Oireachtas cannot pass legislation which would interrupt the course of that litigation, or change the law from the date when court proceedings were issued, until the date on which the case was heard in a way which would directly impact on that case.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we have a difficulty in this area, which relates to litigation which has been instituted.  Once litigation has been instituted it is somewhat like a football match, one cannot move the goalposts or change the ground rules halfway through the match; constitutionally that is not permissible.  Nevertheless there is one aspect of the Bill that I am concerned with and I have tabled amendment No. 6 to give the Minister an opportunity to tease this out with us.  It seems that there can be different stages of a claim.  A developer could say to a local authority: &ldquo;I am going to bring a claim against you&rdquo;; the next stage may be when the local authority says: &ldquo;You do not have a claim&rdquo; and the developer then institutes court proceedings to determine whether he can properly claim compensation.  A court, in those proceedings, may take the view that under existing legislation the developers can claim compensation.  If the court so decides it can take a further step and suggest that ultimately the amount of compensation is determined by an arbitrator under an arbitration procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of these steps are individual legal steps in their own right.  If, at the date this Bill is passed, a developer verbally or through correspondence threatens a local authority with a compensation claim but has not instituted court proceedings, he will be bound by this Bill and there <Col N="1733" /> will be no problem.  If there is a dispute as to whether there is a claim to be made for compensation, as opposed to what the amount is, that may require a court's adjudication.  I appreciate that we are travelling a somewhat thin constitutional line in this but it seems that if the dispute that may arise on the date this legislation is passed is whether there is a valid claim for compensation, there is nothing wrong with this legislation making provision that, if subsequently it is determined there is a valid claim for compensation, the new rules laid down in the legislation for determining how to calculate the compensation payable can apply.</P>
    <P>I would like to invite the Minister to tease out the different scenarios I have painted and perhaps come back to this matter on Report Stage rather than deal with it definitively today.  If &mdash; and I think this is justifiable &mdash; the thin dividing line can be traversed in a way that is constitutionally sound so as to allow, in certain claims, a moving away from compensation being awarded on the maximum developmental potential value, as opposed to the reduced value under the new rules which will apply under the new First Schedule of the Bill, it is worth doing.  We should tease out this matter carefully.</P>
    <P>There is a difference in the approach of Deputy Gilmore's amendment and that of mine.  There is a constitutional problem in this area and we have to get it right.  In cases where the formal arbitration system has not commenced in the context of processing a claim to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded, where the arbitrator has not been asked to fix an amount, we cannot interrupt that procedure.  If it is a question of the courts first of all having to determine whether a claim for compensation can be properly made it seems that amendment No. 6, which proposes to insert a new subsection (3) in section 4 of the Bill, could delimit the amount of compensation that can be properly claimed.  It may ensure that the speculative element in abusing the planning process is further reduced in the context <Col N="1734" /> of the level of any award that might be made.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to tease out this matter further.  I appreciate that he, his officials or the Attorney General's Office may not have had sufficient time to tease out the implications of amendment No. 6 but if the Minister says he is willing to consider the scenario I have painted and come back on Report Stage with comment on it I would be happy.  There is a constitutional problem in our taking on board the approach that Deputy Gilmore wishes us to adopt.  Nevertheless, in the context of the outrageous claims that local authorities have been confronted with &mdash; Deputy Gilmore and I are colleagues on Dublin County Council and we see this at the coalface all the time &mdash; I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment Deputy Gilmore has tabled.  Like Deputy Quinn, if I thought we could constitutionally get away with it I would be quite happy to go along with Deputy Gilmore's amendment but I do not think we would get away with it.  If we could make some provision that is constitutionally sound, to at least delimit the damage, it would be worth considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to go a little further into teasing out the provisions of this section of the Bill.  The Minister might be able to tell me what are the legal implications of the word &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;.  The Bill states that this section will not apply other than to a case where any compensation assessed will be payable.  Does that mean where compensation has already been assessed before the Bill becomes law or does it mean in the process of being assessed?  The wording in the section needs to be tightened up. As I said on an earlier amendment, the process whereby a developer eventually receives a cheque for £2 million, £150,000 or whatever the sum might be starts literally from the day on which he or she lodges a planning application.  Very often planning applications are lodged in the full knowledge that they are going to be refused and that perhaps it may not be possible to put a non-compensatable clause into that refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very well known Mountgorry <Col N="1735" /> case, I believe the developers had a very clear understanding that they were on the road to compensation when they put in a planning application.  It took nearly six years to bring that case to finality.  Companies who have already lodged a planning application but are nowhere near getting any money out of it could claim that they were already in the process and that there was a future compensation claim to be assessed.  Because of the way this section is worded, these companies could be outside the law.  I do not believe that is what this House wants, nor do I believe it is what the Minister wants.  I think he would like to feel that he is closing off this source of compensation.</P>
    <P>In my view, Deputy Shatter's amendment clarifies the position.  There may not be much of a difference in the wording in the section from that in Deputy Shatter's amendment but I believe the amendment spells out loud and clear to developers that it is only those who are at the very last stage of getting compensation by swap of land or whatever, those who have gone through the various processes under sections 57 and 58 of the Planning Acts, who will receive it.  I would like the Minister to clarify the wording &ldquo;any compensation assessed will be payable&rdquo;. Does it mean that compensation already has to be in the process of being assessed before this Bill rules it out?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is as well that I give the statistics as I understand them concerning current planning compensation claims because this matter has been raised by a few Deputies.  The latest published planning statistics prepared by the ERU are for 1987 and show a total of £78 million for planning compensation. These claims were lodged with planning authorities over a six-year period, from 1982 to 1987.  Planning authorities were requested, for the purpose of compiling the statistics, to give details only of new claims arising each year.  However, there is now reason to believe that this instruction was widely misunderstood and that consequently the aggregate of £78 million <Col N="1736" /> is significantly overstated.  They misunderstood the instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>Yes, and regrettably it has led to a lot of confusion.  We are now working to revise those statistics and I hope to have the data available shortly.

      <P>Quite right, and in fact there was nothing for Dublin Corporation or Dún Laoghaire Corporation. There may be a couple of other cases around the country, but they do not involve a serious amount of money although anything is serious to a local authority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will seek them before the end of business and give them to the Deputy.  The figure was £2.1 million in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that by virtue of section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, any compensation claim resulting from a decision or other action taken before this Bill becomes operational will be dealt with under the procedures and valuation rules established by the 1963 Act.  Section 4 (2) with which the amendment is concerned deals with another matter entirely.  It preserves the valuation rules of the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919, as amended by section 69 (1) of the 1963 Act so that they can continue to apply to <Col N="1737" /> CPOs and purchase notice cases.  This will be so, despite the repeal of section 69 of the 1963 Act by this section. Amendment No. 6 seeks to apply the provision of the Bill to any compensation claims arising from the 1963 Act still being processed when the Bill commences. This would run counter to the normal run of transitional provisions including those of the Interpretation Act, 1937, which preserve rights accrued under repealed statutes and, <i>prima facie,</i> to deprive persons of rights merely because their claims have been processed less quickly than others would be unfair and I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn's and Deputy Shatter's understanding of this litigation process is right.  They have stated the point quite adequately and there is no point in my restating it now.  Matters where litigation has been instigated have to be disposed of under the legislation applying at the time of the institution of the proceedings.</P>

I am happy to let this amendment rest until Report Stage in the hope that the Minister, with the assistance of his officials and possibly the assistance of the Attorney General's Office, will be able to come back to us to look in more detail at the transitional arrangements.  I appreciate that on Second Stage we dealt with the broader issues as to the circumstances generally when compensation should be payable and how the amount payable should be determined and that we are now teasing out the process.

      <P>Like Deputy Shatter I welcome the Minister's positive response in relation to the transitional arrangements but it does not meet what I was getting at in amendment No. 5.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that it <Col N="1739" /> was.  I appreciate the legal difficulties.  In relation to the 1963 Act the question of the constitutionality of the compensation provisions there have already been raised.  In the XJS case, for example, when it was being addressed by Mr. Justice McCarthy in the Supreme Court, he raised very clearly whether the compensation provisions in the 1963 Act were constitutional and drew our attention to the fact that, while the Constitution protects the rights of private property, it limits those rights and provides for the limiting of them by law where social justice or the exigencies of the common good require.  It is clearly not in the interest of the common good that the taxpayer would have to pay, even after the passage of this Bill, huge sums of money claimed under the 1963 Act.  The Minister has already referred to claims of £13.5 million in the case of Dublin County Council plus other outstanding claims against other local authorities. Even after the passage of this Bill large sums of public money could have to be paid out over the next number of years. Notwithstanding the legal difficulties that have been raised, this House has a responsibility to the taxpayer to protect his money and to prevent that situation arising.  I am very much aware of the difficulties referred to by Deputies Quinn and Shatter, and repeated by the Minister, in relation to the legal side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose in many respects issues like that ultimately end up being tested in the courts.  As I said earlier, there is a major question over the constitutionality of the compensation provisions of the 1963 Act. Two Supreme Court judges at different stages questioned whether the compensation provisions of the 1963 Act were constitutional and they virtually invited a challenge on constitutional grounds against that part of the Act.  There is public concern about the pay-out of compensation awards and this House should not fail to address the outstanding claims already made against local authorities. The Minister mentioned the question of transitional arrangements and I should <Col N="1740" /> like him to clarify whether it is his intention to address the question of outstanding claims already made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to look at this matter and I will do so. However, I am sure that Deputy Gilmore recognises the legal difficulties attached to this question.  He and I know that inevitably the taxpayer can only be protected by legislation enacted here.  We all agree that we are changing the law insofar as planning compensation is concerned. This will be a fundamental change but the Deputy is asking whether the Legislature can somehow fairly seek to impose new provisions retrospectively.  I do not think that can happen.  However, I undertake to examine the matter but my personal opinion is that we cannot seek to impose this kind of restrictive clause retrospectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for undertaking to look at the matter.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1937, and other Interpretation Acts, the net point on which we will be seeking legal interpretation from the Attorney General's Office is in regard to compensation.  If a claim had been lodged for compensation and if that claim had been conceded in principle by a local authority in respect of a refusal permission for whatever reason &mdash; maintaining open spaces or something like that &mdash; and if the process of filing for monetary compensation had not commenced at that stage, in other words if the refusal of the planning permission had been arrived at but the lodgment of a claim for moneys had not yet legally commenced, you could ensure that the method of valuation applied ultimately by an arbitrator in the event of a dispute between both parties would have regard to the new rules as distinct from the old rules.  I will give an analogy which I can understand; if a football match resulted in a draw and a replay was ordered it would provide an opportunity for the rules of the game to be changed by the governing body of that sport between <Col N="1741" /> the scoreless result of the first match and the commencement of the replay.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 5, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;No person shall be entitled to compensation, as a result of any decision made by a planning authority or by the Board, involving a refusal of permission to develop land or a grant of such permission, subject to conditions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is about the core of the legislation and I wanted to move it before the House discusses the whole question of procedures for claiming compensation and so on.  The amendment deals with planning compensation and whether it should exist.  That is something we must decide and my amendment seeks to put clearly and unambiguously in the Bill that there shall be no compensation for refusal of planning permission.  It is <Col N="1743" /> blunt and simple.  The Bill as presented deals with limiting the circumstances in which compensation can be claimed. That is certainly a major improvement on the situation which applied heretofore and is welcome.  However, the core issue of whether there should be compensation in the first place has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that the reason for a compensation provision in the 1963 Act relates to the constitutional right to private property.  As I said earlier, the Constitution is clear on this point, it confers the right to private property but it qualifies it by the requirements of social injustice and the exigencies of the common good.  If somebody applies for planning permission and is refused, as the law stands, in certain circumstances he can be paid compensation.  Under the Bill he can still be paid compensation, albeit in more limited circumstances and, perhaps less than would be the case under the 1963 Act.  The important thing is that such people continue to qualify for compensation.</P>
    <P>I do not think that should be allowed. The planning process is quite elaborate and democratic.  Democratically elected local authorities draw up a development plan and each local authority has a professionally staffed planning department. There is a clear procedure for the making of a planning application.  Applications are scrutinised in considerable detail and at the end of that scrutiny the applicant can appeal against the decision if he or she is not satisfied with the outcome. After the outcome of the planning appeal the applicant can still submit a new application, perhaps for some varied development, in respect of the same lands.  The door is never closed to an applicant for planning permission in his or her efforts to get approval.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why it is that in the planning area compensation is allowed to an applicant who is refused permission. Why is it that a person who is refused planning permission becomes entitled to compensation while a person who is refused permission for anything else is not entitled to compensation?  For <Col N="1744" /> example, as a result of public policy and measures decided in the House there are many people who are applying to get into hospitals but cannot gain admission. They are not entitled to compensation. There are children whose parents are applying to get them into particular schools but they are not entitled to compensation if they are refused.  A person who buys a car has a constitutional right to own the car but it does not appear that he has an automatic constitutional right to drive it.  That person must apply for a driving licence and if he or she does not succeed in obtaining the licence they cannot apply for compensation.  Why on earth should a person who owns a plot of ground and wants to develop it be entitled to claim compensation if planning permission is refused?  By and large, planning applications are not made by people anxious to build a house for a son or daughter on a piece of ground that they own.  By and large planning compensation claims have been made by people who acquire land in the first place for speculative purposes and want to make a killing out of it.  Why on earth should people be entitled to compensation if they are refused planning permission?  I do not understand the logic of that.</P>
    <P>As the issue has arisen in this debate, we should state clearly that there should be no compensation for a person who is refused planning permission.  There is a clear procedure for applying for planning permission and, if a person is refused, that should be the end of the matter.  I do not see why there should be any requirement on the taxpayer to have to underwrite the property values or the possible speculative gains for people applying for planning permission.  My amendment seeks to end planning compensation.  That is what we should be doing, otherwise we will be limiting circumstances in which it will apply and leaving people entitled to claim compensation if they are refused planning permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments, as Deputy Gilmore said, would remove the right to planning compensation in any <Col N="1745" /> circumstances.  As such they run counter to the political consensus on Second Stage among the main political parties about the need to provide for some possibility of planning compensation.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for me here to retail chapter and verse on the constitutional provisions regarding private property.  It is enough to point out the following.  The planning control system will be constitutionally acceptable as long as it can be shown to operate its restrictions on property rights bona fide in the community interest.  This Bill provides for a very wide range of non-compensatable circumstances, but always by reference to specified considerations of community interest.</P>
      <P>To provide simply, as the amendment does, that there should never in any circumstances be a right to planning compensation is to presume that a planning decision automatically, and without the need for justification, will always fairly embody the community interest.  It is to assume that arbitrary or inconsistent decisions, or decisions based on poorly conceived planning objectives, will never take place.  That is not my understanding of the position.  Some remedy in terms of planning compensation is to be found in virtually all physical planning systems in the western world.  There may be differences between countries, as there may be between us here, on the exact extent of circumstances which should be compensatable.  But there is no argument about the need for some provision in some circumstances for planning compensation.</P>
      <P>Against that overwhelming consensus I find it difficult to entertain the amendment and I should like to ask Deputy Gilmore to recognise that and withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an astonishing amendment from Deputy Gilmore.  The Minister has treated it in as circumspect language as he could in opposing it.  What we are about in the House, and what we want to achieve, is to ensure that the property speculator who tries to abuse our planning legislation to get financial <Col N="1746" /> gain from the community by making unjustified compensation claims against local authorities is no longer allowed to do so.  We want to ensure that if a person purchases a piece of land knowing that it is zoned for amenity or agricultural purposes he or she cannot go and obtain compensation if they are not allowed to build a major residential development or a major industrial development on the land.  In such a case the land was purchased knowing that it was zoned as agricultural or amenity land and the applicant should have absolutely no rights to get any compensation from the community or the taxpayer for not being allowed to carry out a development that he or she knew they would not be allowed to carry out at the time the land was purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problem concerns the way the planning Acts operate.  Unscrupulous speculators can run a coach and four through the planning system.  The zoning provisions put into play in the interests of the community can be seriously undermined by compensation claims.  Awards of the nature we saw in the Grange development case can be made.  The legislation is designed to ensure that the property cowboys, the speculators, cannot undermine the planning process and the planning Acts.  We must, in our legislation, provide protection for the community on two fronts.  We must protect the community against unjustified claims.  We must also provide protection for the community against a real loss suffered either by a community or an individual as a result of a decision made by a local body or a Government body.  Let us take the case of á person who buys a site of one acre which is already zoned for residential use.  That person pays a sum of money for that site based on a valuation that one can build on the site because it has a residential zoning.  The local authority, six months later in their development plan, may decide that it is in the interests of the community that that land, together with other land adjacent to it that previously had been zoned residential, be zoned amenity.  In effect, the local authority are reducing the value of the land and <Col N="1747" /> preventing the person who purchased it in good faith on the basis of a zoning by the local authority, from utilising the land for the purpose for which it was acquired with the result that they suffer real financial loss.</P>
    <P>There are two different types of political systems, one is a democracy in which you recognise that decisions are made in the interests of the community that cause real loss to an individual where the individual is entitled to some compensation from the community; the other is the totalitarian-type systems which we saw in Eastern Europe where there is a democratic centralism in which it is believed that whatever the Government or the local authority does is always right and no matter how it impacts on the individual &mdash; who is powerless when confronted by the local authority despite all the theories of democratic centralism &mdash; he can be screwed down and can find that the property which was properly acquired and properly paid for in good faith with proper, legitimate expectations, is taken away from him and he can simply be left with no compensation from the State.</P>
    <P>Let us put in perspective what Deputy Gilmore is trying to achieve.  This is a political exercise to try to pretend that some parties in this House are still in favour of unjustified compensation awards.  We are not.  The message that goes out from this House on this legislation is that the type of problems we have had in the Planning Acts with some development companies will no longer be tolerated.  The person who buys land which is zoned for residential purposes is entitled to compensation if the community, through their local authority, make a decision which reduces the value of that land that results in its being changed to amenity or agricultural zoning.  Is Deputy Gilmore suggesting that if the local authority decide to widen a road in his constituency which has 50 or 60 residents, a decision resulting in half of people's front gardens being removed, the local authority are entitled to do that and pay them no compensation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is an ultimate logic no matter how he may try to confine it to this particular provision in the Bill. The ultimate logic is that if a local authority or a Government Department make a decision which impacts on the individual's correct entitlements, constitutionally recognised entitlements and justified expectations, they should never get compensation.  I do not believe that is the type of system that is wanted by the vast majority of the people.  The fact that it is unconstitutional is incidental. The reality is that it would impose on the Irish people a system, in effect, in which one would take the view that the State is entitled to abolish the rights to private property.  That is the ultimate logic behind Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of The Workers' Party that there should be no rights to private property.  It is a system they tried to operate in Eastern Europe for 45 years and which is now being turned on its head. That approach has been shown to have no acceptance by the population of those countries who laboured under the yoke of the type of democratic centralism that The Workers' Party favour.  This particular amendment may have been seen by Deputy Gilmore to be a politically astute way of suggesting that other parties in this House are not committed to tackling the scandal of unjustified compensation awards but he has lifted the lid off where The Workers' Party truly stand ideologically in this particular area.  Let the message not be confused.  This amendment is not about the problem we are trying to confront in relation to unjustified compensation awards.</P>

Perhaps I am wrong, but I cannot recall The Workers' Party even going this far on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I do not think Deputy Gilmore was in this House on that occasion and possibly his colleagues felt, in the context of the likelihood of the general election approaching at that time, they had better be a little more circumspect in their approach.  For my part and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party I cannot support this amendment.  It seeks to turn on its head the approach that the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland would like to see taken.  They want to see the speculator who tries to blackmail local authorities, through unjustified compensation claims, taken out of the scene and they want to see local authorities being able to exercise proper planning controls and proper planning functions.  People also want to see that, where someone owns land which had been purchased in good faith, based on zoning and with a clear indication of the particular use permissible, and if as a result of local authority decisions the possible use of that land is changed and the property is seriously diminished in value, such a person is compensated, in the same way as the person is entitled to be compensated if the local authority want to take a portion of their farm to build a highway or a portion of their front garden to extend a road, or for a variety of other reasons which one can list and for which compensation is payable.  If I was Deputy Gilmore I would rapidly withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that this ideological amendment should be put <Col N="1750" /> down by Deputy Gilmore.  I believe there is a unanimity in this House, despite our political differences, to tackle the scandal of compensation claims.  Albeit that Deputy Gilmore says his amendment does not call for the abolition of compensation, in introducing the amendment he made it quite clear that he was trying to remove the whole concept and principle of compensation from our legislation.</P>
      <P>There is no point in trying to rectify a disastrous situation by putting in other inequities and inequalities into the Bill. In every other law some form of compensation is available to the members of the public for whatever reason.  I recall that when a few Deputies from this House were elected they marched in front of an office.  I think they were trying to stake a claim to some rights and compensation for the jobs they held before being elected to this House.  The same principle applies here.  By an action of some other body, not of their own doing, they were being denied certain rights and they sought rights and compensation in that way.  One cannot differentiate on the principle of compensation.  If one has been knocked down and badly injured on the road by a car which the owner driver has not properly maintained &mdash; and one has no right to ask him to maintain his car &mdash; one is entitled to some compensation. In exactly the same way in the planning laws, there are instances where people are entitled to claim compensation. If we do away with any of those instances we will be doing a bad day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even within the terms of Deputy Gilmore's amendment there are instances where local authorities have changed the zoning of land, which was formerly residential or industrial, to amenity zoning, in the course of which the beneficial rights of people have been diminished.  I shall give an example.  A family in a certain location in County Dublin gave land to the community to use as a sporting amenity. It was land that at that stage was considered residential and was zoned residential, but it was not needed by the <Col N="1751" /> owner and his family gave that land.  Subsequent to that a case was made to actually zone the land in keeping with the sporting amenity that was on it, thus reducing the land from residential zoning to amenity zoning.  By no action of that owner his land was reduced greatly in value and was no longer available to him to develop, despite the fact that it was by a generous act that the land was given. There is no law in any country I know that would not say that by an act of generosity such an owner had been deprived of his beneficial rights to that land and was entitled to seek compensation.</P>
    <P>What about somebody who buys land that is zoned residential and, because of some Act passed subsquent to the purchase of that land, a local authority decide to change a road line?  Dublin County Council are in the process of making a great many changes to a number of the existing road lines throughout County Dublin, mainly the smaller road lines and because they have been on our maps for many years, many people who might otherwise have got a single house on a bit of land may have been deprived because they were told there is a 30 year road plan.  There may well be instances where we will have a road line put through land people bought in good faith and now, because of developments &mdash; maybe the building of an industrial estate &mdash; we want to move the line nearer to the industrial estate so that people can get to work.  I do not think Deputy Gilmore would like to see a situation where some form of recompense would not be paid to people who suffer in such a way.  We in Dublin County Council &mdash; and three of us in this House are members of Dublin County Council &mdash; will be responsible for making decisions in our development plan for the common good that might well damage other people's rights.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter that this amendment was put in such a way as to imply that if we do not agree with it we are, in some way, condoning what the cowboy developers, the big speculative developers, in this city and country have been doing for the last number of years, <Col N="1752" /> that is, driving a coach and four through the 1963 Planning Act to their own benefit. We are here today trying to rectify that but there is no point in creating another inequity.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Gilmore will take what I and Deputy Shatter are saying in good part.  He may well have worded the amendment in a certain way but what he has said in speaking to the amendment is not what he is actually saying in the amendment.  He is trying to get rid of the whole concept of compensation.  I do not think that is fair.  He only has to think of his own lifestyle since he came into this House and perhaps equate what he and Deputy Rabbitte attempted to do to get compensation for some losses they suffered when they moved in here.</P>

      <P>I look forward to Deputy Owen joining me on the picket line the next time I decide to parade up and down outside a certain high rise building in the city.</P>
      <P>It is a pity Deputy Shatter did not read the amendment.  Had he done so it might have restrained him from the outburst he engaged in.  The amendment says that no person shall be entitled to compensation as a result of any decision made by a planning authority or by the board involving a refusal of permission to develop land or grant of such permission subject to conditions, in other words, it is dealing solely with compensation where there has been a refusal of planning permission.  It is not dealing with the abolition of the right to compensation if a local authority put a highway through one's front garden; of course the person who owns the property in that case is entitled to compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a section of this Bill which deals with situations where local authorities might put sewers, water or other mains through property.  I am not proposing to amend that; of course people are entitled to compensation in those circumstances. There is a section in this Bill which deals with the situation where there have been certain changes introduced by the local authority and somebody may suffer a loss as a result.  I am <Col N="1753" /> not proposing to amend that.  All this talk about Eastern Europe and abolishing the right to private property and to compensation and so on is garbage because Deputy Shatter is not in a position to answer my question, that is, that he should explain why compensation should be paid at all in a case where there has been a refusal of permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is ignoring some of the reasons for the refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That question has not been answered.  The closest anybody came to answering it was the Minister when he said that the planning authority might make an arbitrary decision, that it might be inconsistent in its decisions. There are, however, a whole range of areas of life where an arbitrary decision may be made.  People who apply for social welfare benefits have arbitrary decisions made against them day in and day out, and arbitrary decisions made against them on appeal.  Can they apply for compensation? They cannot.  If somebody who applies for a medical card has an arbitrary decision made against him, can he apply for compensation?  No, he cannot.  Why is there one set of rules for claiming compensation for refusal of planning permission and another for every other area of activity in this country?  Why, for example, did this House abolish criminal injuries compensation? I see a letter in today's newspaper about that.  Why is it that there is no compensation in those cases but somebody who is refused planning permission can apparently be compensated? Deputy Shatter spoke about lifting the lid off ideology.  There is no lid on my ideology but it would appear that the amendment has done something to lift the lid off his own ideology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us deal with the question of compensation in the case where there is a right to private property.  Let us be clear that I am not challenging that right, but let us tease this out a little further.  Let us suppose I live next to a field and the owner applies for planning permission <Col N="1754" /> and is refused; he can claim compensation. Let us suppose he is granted permission and as a result the value of my property which is next to it is devalued.  Can I claim compensation? No, I cannot.  There is an inconsistency here.  There are people living in housing estates which have been left uncompleted by developers.  It is remarkable that the beneficiary of the largest claim paid out in planning compensation in this country &mdash; £2 million to Brennan and McGowan Developers &mdash; left people in houses in estates all over County Dublin with roads and other services not completed.  Could the owners of those houses claim compensation? No they could not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>They can.  They can sue them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they can sue them as, indeed, can the planning applicant in the normal course of civil law, as I am sure the Deputy is well aware, pursue a case if he feels a local authority has been negligent in the way it has exercised its responsibilities.  There is a total inconsistency here.  The application for planning permission is the only area where this right of compensation exists. There is no right to compensation where the owner of an ordinary private house has his or her property devalued as a result of a planning decision made, perhaps, in the interests of a particular developer. There is no right to compensation where the owner of a house who has put his entire life savings and taken out a mortgage to buy that house, finds himself living in an estate which is not completed. Since there is no right to compensation in any other area of activity where people apply to public authorities for decisions on rights they believe they are entitled to, why should there be a right to compensation where a local authority refuses planning permission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I come back to the question of the options open to a planning applicant. If a planning applicant submits a planning application there is a professional decision made on it.  If he does not like the decision the applicant has the right to <Col N="1755" /> appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  the applicant also has the right to approach public representatives and ask them to pursue that planning application through a section 4 motion at a local authority meeting, and that is done regularly although it is something with which I do not particularly agree.  It is a legal right which somebody can pursue.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Shatter and Deputy Owen will be aware that section 4 motions are repeatedly tabled for the agendas of the meetings of Dublin County Council.  If a planning application in some way contravenes a development plan it is open to the applicants to get their public representatives to propose a material contravention to the development plan.  Again, this is regularly done. At the last meeting of Dublin County Council there were material contraventions for a total of 914 houses and something in the order of 15 material contravention motions were proposed. Therefore, a whole range of options are open to somebody who is refused planning permission or who finds the going difficult.</P>
    <P>A far greater range of options are open to a planning applicant in those circumstances than is ever open to somebody who applies for a medical card, a social welfare benefit or anything else from a public authority.  There is no justification in asking the taxpayer to pay out money to somebody who has been refused planning permission but there is justification for the payment of compensation in cases where property has been devalued as a result of a road being built through it or some other activity which might be engaged in by a public authority. It is wrong and disingenuous of Deputy Shatter and Deputy Owen to suggest that my proposal not to pay compensation in cases where there has been a refusal of planning permission somehow automatically applies right across the board in other cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are in danger of opening up a Second Stage philosophical debate.  Perhaps this is the type of debate <Col N="1757" /> being worked out on the streets of Eastern Europe at present but it is not particularly germane to what we are trying to do.</P>
      <P>I fully understand the sentiments behind the amendment moved by Deputy Gilmore &mdash; I want to take a benign view rather than the politically malign interpretation taken by Deputy Shatter &mdash; but, in terms of a Committee Stage debate, Deputy Gilmore has effectively negatived his proposal by the inclusion of the adjective &ldquo;any&rdquo; in his amendment. The word &ldquo;any&rdquo; rules out any and all decisions.  I want to put it to Deputy Gilmore and the House that the development potential of property is an inherent component of property itself and the development potential of privatelyowned property is an inherent characteristic of that property.  The development potential of that property is part of the rights attached to property as enshrined in our Constitution.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that the right to education or a medical service is not, unfortunately, enshrined in our Constitution. Therefore, for the purposes of law making, which is what we are about, we have to observe the rules under which we make all the laws in this State.  We are a law-bound State &mdash; this is a status most central and eastern European countries, including the Soviet Union, want to achieve &mdash; and ultimately the authority of the law is enshrined in our Constitution with all the processes of appeal.  To rule out the payment of compensation in any circumstances, as is the legal and technical intent of this amendment, basically negatives that process, no matter how <i>bona fide</i> the Deputy's intentions are.  In fairness to Deputy Gilmore, at no stage did he suggest in his proposition that there would be no compensation for property on which a CPO was placed for a road or whatever.  That was not a fair assertion to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about his intentions, the Deputy legally fails to understand the complexity of property law and the correlation and interconnection between the development potential of property and <Col N="1758" /> its rights as protected under the Constitution. I want to give a specific example to illustrate this point.  If, for example, Dublin County Council decide to change the zoning of land running down from a road to the sea or to a river in a built-up area from residential to amenity the value of the property will be affected automatically. If people need to lodge the deeds of their property with a bank in order to secure a mortgage the value of that property will be changed overnight as a result of a change in the zoning of it.  In those circumstances people should have the right to seek compensation if they are materially affected.  They may not automatically seek compensation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording used in this amendment is so sweeping in its impact and indiscriminate in its application that quite frankly it would not get past Áras an Uachtarán.  Perhaps this was partly the reason for provoking the response from Deputy Shatter, which was not in the spirit of the progress we were making earlier today.  This amendment would not get past the President's desk in Áras an Uachtarán and the Council of State would recommend that it be referred to the Supreme Court who would give a view in 60 days.  The view of Mr. Justice McCarthy and others, who would rightly give their view on the constitutional balance between the exigencies of the common good and the rights of property, would be that, having gone from one extreme, we now appear to be going to the other.  In all fairness to Deputy Gilmore, I do not think that is what he is trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because in responding to me a moment ago Deputy Gilmore, in effect, confirmed what I was saying.  If I were to adopt Deputy Quinn's benign approach to this amendment, as he so aptly put it, I would simply say that this amendment is based <Col N="1759" /> on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Planning Acts work.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the very simple example I gave a short time ago about an elderly couple who own a piece of land which is zoned as residential and who intend to build a small cottage on it to which they will retire.  If six months before they apply for planning permission the local authority zone the land as amenity space that couple, according to Deputy Gilmore, will not be entitled to compensation.  The Deputy is saying this &mdash; he may not understand he is saying it &mdash; for the following reason.  The zoning of land as amenity by the local authority does not of itself, even under current law, give rise to any compensation claim and if that elderly couple want to make a compensation application they will first have to apply for planning permission. They will assume that if the land remains zoned &ldquo;residential&rdquo; they will receive planning permission.  If the land is re-zoned &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; and they make an application they could, under the welcome new provisions of this Bill, be turned down and they would not, in the context of Deputy Gilmore's approach, be entitled to claim compensation.  Under this Bill they will be entitled to claim compensation.  What will trigger that compensation entitlement is a refusal to grant planning permission.  They will not be able to claim compensation without first applying for planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Gilmore in effect is saying to the person or construction company who behave <i>bona fide</i>, who have proper business intentions and a good record and who purchase 20 to 30 acres of land, which is zoned &ldquo;residential&rdquo; at residential prices, knowing that they want to build a decent development on that land and six months later, find that a local authority, perhaps dominated by The Workers' Party, have rezoned it &ldquo;amenity&rdquo;, is tough, that if they put in an application it may be turned down on the basis that the land has been zoned &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; and they are not entitled to planning permission regardless of the fact that this decision may result in the <Col N="1760" /> financial bankruptcy of the construction company and the loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the small individual who buys a single site of a quarter or half an acre which is zoned &ldquo;residential&rdquo;, he is saying that if, after it has been bought and residential prices paid, the local authority unilaterally decide under the planning process, without that individual's views being taken on board, to zone it &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; that individual should suffer the loss.  They will suffer the loss because the only way they will be able to claim compensation under the Bill is to make an application for planning permission and to have that application turned down. What Deputy Gilmore is saying to all those people is that it is tough on them if the local authority change the zoning from &ldquo;residential&rdquo; to &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; or &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo; and that they will have to bear the loss.  Taking Deputy Quinn's benign approach, perhaps Deputy Gilmore did not understand that that would be the impact of his amendment.</P>
    <P>A natural corollary would be to deprive people of compensation in all the other circumstances I outlined.  I did not misunderstand the Deputy's amendment.  I know exactly what it says and the circumstances in which it would apply.  It would be just as logical to say that if the local authority want part of a person's front garden in order to widen the road, that person should not get compensation either.  That would not be the direct impact of putting this provision into the Planning Acts but it is the logical extension of the approach which says if the local authority make a decision on land use the person should not be entitled to compensation.  Where one suffers a real loss as opposed to an artificial loss, which companies like Grange Developments tried to generate, the individual is entitled to compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears as if the approach has been changed somewhat. Deputy Shatter has now shifted from attempting to bully me on this amendment to attempting to patronise me.  I understand the planning process only too <Col N="1761" /> well.  Let us tease out the argument concerning the old woman who buys a piece of land somewhere and a local authority dominated by The Workers' Party decide to zone it &ldquo;high amenity&rdquo; and look at it in the right of the present practice.  The applications for planning compensation are not being made by little old ladies who own half an acre of ground somewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>They could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy invited me to look at the practice and that is what I am going to do.  The claims for planning compensation are being made by and large by speculative developers.  I have in front of me the current list of claims before the Dublin County Council and it indicates that there is one particular developer seeking £3 million in compensation, another £2 million and someone else £2.2 million.  Therefore, it is clear that applications are not being made by one-off buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my experience on Dublin County Council that when an application, of the kind Deputy Shatter and Deputy Owen have talked about, is made it is dealt with by way of material contravention and generally passed.  Therefore, there are a number of options open to somebody who finds himself in that position and these options are frequently exercised. Let us deal with the question in front of us.  I have to say I have not come across too many cases where land zoned &ldquo;development&rdquo; has been rezoned &ldquo;high amenity&rdquo;.  My experience is that the reverse is the case.  Land zoned &ldquo;high amenity&rdquo; in the green belt has been rezoned &ldquo;development&rdquo;.  That is the practice in Dublin and I suggest that it is a practice which is more widespread throughout the country.  I have not come across any case where the value of property owned by a person was reduced when land was rezoned &ldquo;high amenity&rdquo;. I have come across several cases where the opposite has been the case.  I am afraid that the old trick is being used, that where there is no justification a highly emotive hypothetical situation is produced and <Col N="1762" /> people hang their arguments around that. I am afraid that that just does not hold up.  When it comes down to it, the Members of this House are either going to abolish planning compensation or they are not.  My amendment seeks the abolition of planning compensation but it would appear from what is being said that it is not going to be successful.  I hope that if it is not successful we will then go on and at least limit the circumstances where planning compensation is payable so that the taxpayer is protected against the type of claims being submitted at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reply to what Deputy Gilmore has said.  His final statements are mischievous and he is trying to imply that in our opposition to the amendment we are somehow giving succour and consolation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to potential, large scale developers.  Deputy Gilmore should have listened to what his colleague sitting on his right said.  Deputy Quinn has pointed out what is wrong with the amendment.  I think I know what the Deputy is trying to get at and I agree with him that we should get to the nub of the issue.  A developer as a result of the refusal to give planning permission can claim compensation.  He does not automatically get it just because he is refused. Many other sections of the Bill tackle that, but the amendment is encompassing and is badly worded in the sense that it says it does not matter for what reason you are refused, you are not entitled to compensation.  That is where the flaw is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In anything the Deputy has said so far he has not tackled the instances &mdash; albeit they are not the normal instances we have in County Dublin and in other places.  I am not as familiar with the local authorities outside Dublin and I suggest he is not either.  I suspect there are far more cases of little old ladies looking for compensation where a local authority will take a decision that will lose for such persons the benefit of land they might <Col N="1763" /> have bought for residential purposes which is now dezoned and used for a road.  He is trying to take a large sledgehammer to crack which is admittedly a very large nut, but he is not getting to grips with what he is trying to do, as Deputy Quinn says, by leaving in the words &ldquo;of any decision made by a planning authority&rdquo;.  He is throwing out the baby with the bath water.  He is going to get rid of the concept of compensation.</P>
    <P>In pushing his amendment he is, perhaps, giving himself the opportunity to send around a circular to the taxpayers in Dún Laoghaire to the effect that he has saved them millions of pounds in potential compensation claims.  What is he going to say to the people of Dún Laoghaire or anywhere else when this section might prevent a decent developer or builder who finds himself or herself, because of some act of a local authority, no longer able to develop land bought in good faith?  Is he going to say to that developer's workers: &ldquo;I am sorry, we put it into the Bill.  That is tough on you.  You should have looked at it more closely and anticipated some action a local authority would take and you should not have bought that land in the first place&rdquo;?  Not every developer or builder is a gangster. A few are gangsters and we could name them here in the House but I will not do so.  We all know which kind of developer we are trying to get at here.  Not everybody who builds is out to cheat the State and seek compensation.  There are those who start the whole process of a planning application for the prime and only purpose of taking it to finality and looking for compensation.  I hope this Bill will prevent that ever happening again.  I know where it is happening at present.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Gilmore will not listen to us on this side of the House, or even to Fianna Fáil, he might listen to his colleague, Deputy Quinn, who I believe understands fully the danger of this amendment and the damage it could do.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 5, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;Notwithstanding any provisions in the Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, no person or company shall be entitled <Col N="1765" /> to compensation as a result of a decision made by a planning authority or by the Board arising from a refusal of permission to develop such land where such compensation would be in excess of the existing use value of the land for which planning permission was originally sought and where such claims had been made on the estimation of the increased value which would accrue if planning permission had been granted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome your guidance, a Cheann Comhairle, on discussing these amendments together as it is a very complex measure.  One of the intentions of the Bill was to try to codify and to put in one coherent Bill the rules regarding valuation and arbitration, which are an essential component of the law of the land in any society where the rights of property are protected.  I have reason to believe that there is a number of technical reservations about the clarity with which the legislation will be interpreted by professional valuers even when it is ultimately enacted by the Oireachtas.  I may come back to that point at a later date.  I am not professionally competent to articulate the cogent reasons and concerns that have been expressed, but I can convey to the House from my knowledge of a number of different institutes and individuals involved in this area that there has been a lot of concern about the technical operation of the Bill since it was first moved by the present Minister in the previous Dáil.  That is another point for discussion.</P>
    <P>I want to confine my remarks on the next point to one of philosophy rather than practicality, but they interact and it may be necessary, having discussed this amendment, that a revised amendment which meets the technical requirements be moved by either Minister or myself on Report Stage.  I say that by way of introduction to the intent of the amendment in my name.</P>
    <P>Since the late seventies and the Kenny report on land prices, this House has been attempting to deal with the problem of the orderly transfer and valuation of <Col N="1766" /> property and the retention for the community of any additional value that would arise to a privately owned property which in the first instance was created by community action such as zoning, the building of a new road or whatever and which was not brought about by any action, passive or active, taken by the individual landowner.</P>
    <P>The phrase used in valuations is &ldquo;the existing use value of a piece of land as distinct from its development potential value&rdquo;.  The scandal in relation to a number of planning decisions and subsequent claims for compensation has been manifested in the following examples.  A person buys land that is zoned to agriculture, applies for planning permission for industrial or residential development and having been refused permission in the first instance by the local authority subsequently files a claim for compensation.  When that claim is evaluated under the 1919 Act and the 1963 Planning Act, the value of the land for which compensation is being sought is not at its existing use value, that is as agricultural land, but the value of the land as if planning permission had been granted in the first instance for a residential estate.  Compensation is paid out on the basis that they had forfeited a loss calculated on what they could have built on that site rather than what the site actually was in the first instance.  I would like to amend the 1919 Act.  This is the first time we have got to Committee Stage, despite numerous attempts to deal with this matter in the past ten years.  I would also like to amend the 1919 Act in relation to compulsory purchase but I am precluded from so doing within the confines of this legislation.  I am having a half bite of the cherry but I should prefer a full bite.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party clearly recognise the rights of private property and the right to compensation where such property is being reduced in value or is being taken for the common good from the individual owners.  The problem is the basis on which valuation is made.  This attempt may be technically deficient in its wording because the legal drafting of such an <Col N="1767" /> amendment is complex.  I would accept guidance from the relevant authorities.  I am saying that notwithstanding any provisions in the 1919 Act, no person or company shall be entitled to compensation as a result of a decision made by a planning authority or by the board arising from a refusal of permission to develop such land where such compensation would be in excess of the existing use value of the land for which planning permission was originally sought and where such claims had been made on the estimation of the increased value which would accrue if planning permission had been granted.  I understand what I am trying to say but when I read the legislation and the various Schedules I am not so sure I understand the precise wording.  Ultimately professional lawyers will argue the minutiae of it in court.  I certainly feel very competent to speak about the net point.</P>
    <P>Unlike the previous amendment, this amendment admits the principle of compensation and accepts that it should on occasion be paid, subject to the law of the land.  It is concerned exclusively with the value of that compensation.  In the XJS case, which was referred to earlier, money was claimed by people who sought compensation in regard to Killiney Hill.  Deputy Gilmore, who is a member of the authority concerned, may recall the case more clearly than I.  In the arbitration award ultimately made, the original sum of money was of the order of £2 million, but it was discounted by the cost of development work which the developer would have to undertake by virtue of the nature of the site and the final amount was about £150,000.  The starting figure was the hope value or the potential value.  It started by saying that a rock on Killiney was worth £2 million, because of the value of property in the surrounding area, but because of the costs which the developer would have to incur he was only entitled to £150,000.  I am trying to change the kind of law that enables the claim to be made that Killiney Hill is worth £2 million.</P>
    <P>Coal importers have a coalyard in City <Col N="1768" /> Quay but when Coal Distributors Limited came into operation the coal business moved down river.  The coalyard at City Quay was acquired in a famous CPO case which was cancelled and subsequently renewed by the then Minister, Mr. Tully. When the valuation was made it was zoned in the general business area of Dublin city.  The owners of the coalyard were free within market conditions to apply for planning permission and to transform the coalyard into an office block.  They chose not to do so.  At that time it was considered that one would not get a willing tenant into an office block in that part of the city and that there was not much point in undertaking a speculative development.  It has no real value other than its existing use; it was a semiused coalyard.  However, when Dublin Corporation moved in with the reactivated CPO to acquire that land the price ultimately paid was not what a willing buyer would have agreed with a willing seller but was based on its potential development value.  It is the City Quay-Lombard Street East area in which there are now local authority houses.  It is that gap between existing use value and hope value which is at the nub of public outrage against the abuse of compensation claims in the general Dublin area.  I am not familiar with such outrage elsewhere in the country but there may be examples.</P>
    <P>My amendment may be technically incomplete and possibly could be improved in the drafting but that is a secondary point.  In cases where compensation is legally and properly being granted, subject to a planning commission decision, the value of the compensation should not be based on the hope potential value of the property but on the existing use value.  A person may buy agriculturally zoned land and apply for planning permission for some kind of alternative development.  If that person is refused planning permission and seeks compensation, the amount of compensation he should get should correspond with the value of what he has, not what he would have got.  That is a reasonable, balanced attempt at finding a balance between the rights of private <Col N="1769" /> property and the exigencies of the common good.  This is what Mr. Justice McCarthy and others invited public representatives to do.  Successive Attorneys General have advised successive Ministers for the Environment that any shift away from hope value would be deemed to be unconstitutional. I gather the Minister is accepting that body of advice.  In other areas he has displayed considerable legislative courage in taking a risk and certainly the change in the amended Schedule would signal that.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to be even more courageous, subject to all the known constraints obtaining.  I know from detailed experience, without in any way revealing confidentialities, that there is on file an overwhelming body of opinion which states, from the Attorney General's point of view &mdash; to which any Government officeholder must legally and constitutionally have regard &mdash; that, in the opinion of collective Attorneys General, interfering with the valuation in the manner I am suggesting would be deemed to be unconstitutional, taking one into a catch 22 position.  I have put that point to Supreme Court judges.  They have said that is an opinion of law officers given reasonably, as is their responsibility, but it has never been properly tested.  As we know in this House the ultimate place of test &mdash; which has proved to be a very influential, progressive arm of State &mdash; in the past has been the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Here I may be anticipating the Minister's reply but if his advice is that my amendment could be construed or deemed to be unconstitutional &mdash; on the basis of the legal advice available to him to which he must have regard &mdash; I would invite him to display the kind of courage he has shown in other areas and say: notwithstanding that there is a reasonable doubt expressed in other areas, on balance perhaps we should allow it be referred to the President; perhaps we should signal, in the conventional manner appropriate to this House, that if there is a doubt perhaps it should be resolved by <Col N="1770" /> the authority whose word will be final in such matters, the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more time in the House.  I know many other Members will want to go into this area in some detail.  However, there are the technical operations of the valuation system and the philosophical basis on which compensation will be claimed.  At the end of the day we must endeavour to strike a balance between the common good on the one hand and the right to private property on the other.</P>
    <P>Whereas the previous amendment found no support in this House, because its impact would be so distorted as to render it manifestly unconstitutional, I would submit to the House &mdash; and this is a matter which has concerned me for over ten years now &mdash; that the intent of my amendment would be constitutional and would meet people's legitimate concerns. As people have said, taking the example of the Killiney case, in principle, an outrageous amount of money was being paid by way of compensation for something to which the developers were not entitled because they had not created that value; rather the potential value of that site had been created by acts of the community in general and not by the individual developer concerned.  I hope I have made my point as clearly as possible.  I will be happy to clarify any points that may remain unclear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remind ourselves that we are talking about public money.  Over the past couple of years this House has repeatedly considered measures to restrict occasions and the manner in which public money is spent. Since we are here talking about public <Col N="1771" /> money it is incumbent on us to demonstrate the same degree of restraint in the expenditure of public money in areas like these as we would, say, in health or education.</P>
      <P>As a result of the defeat of the last amendment it now appears that we will have legislation which will allow for compensation, albeit in more limited circumstances. As a democrat I fully accept the view of the House in that regard.</P>
      <P>We should also now examine the size of any potential awards.  The thrust of my amendments is that compensation should be based on the actual loss incurred.  As Deputy Quinn has said, the problem that has obtained to date is that the compensation claimed, and that awarded, has been based on the full development potential of the relevant lands, perhaps in some cases offset by certain considerations. Deputy Quinn spoke of the XJS case in Killiney.  That property was bought for £40,000 in 1981.  When the developers were refused planning permission in 1983 or 1984 they lodged claims of £2.3 million.  Eventually they were awarded £150,000, which represented a very substantial profit on the lands concerned.  The lands at Redrock, with which Deputy Owen would be more familiar than I, were bought originally for £15,000.  In that case the planning compensation claim amounted to over £2 million, the value of the undertakings given by Dublin County Council being £800,000.  I do not know what was paid for the purchase of the property at Mountgorry but I would venture to suggest that the level of compensation paid &mdash; £2 million &mdash; was far in excess of the amount paid for the land and the loss incurred by the developer.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If compensation is to be awarded it should be based on the actual loss incurred by the developer concerned and should also take account of a number of other factors.  For example, under the terms of the Minister's amendment it <Col N="1772" /> would remain possible for land to be used for exempted development.  As I read his amendment, that would have the effect of increasing the value of the property concerned.  I do not think account should be taken of that.  If I am wrong in that respect, perhaps the Minister would correct me.  It is my understanding that the intention there is that, when the calculations are being done, on the one hand, it would be assumed that the value of the property would be increased by the possibility that exempted development might take place on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Deputy Gilmore allow me make a point of order?  I looked at the monitor; I do not think we are on amendment No. 8; I think we are on Deputy Gilmore's amendment further down.  Might I seek clarification?</P>

      <P>Can we make this quite clear because we did have botheration before.  There can be one amendment only before the House. Amendment No. 8 has been moved.  The House has also agreed that, in respect of the other amendments related thereto, they would all be taken together for discussion purposes.  That means that, if and when any of those amendments has been disposed of, they can be formally moved if the mover of the amendment is anxious that a question should be put on any of them.  Meanwhile there is one amendment before the House which entitles discussion on all the others listed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense that was the point I was raising when I inquired whether the Minister was moving his amendment first.  All of these amendments deal with the same topic, that is, <Col N="1773" /> the amount of any potential compensation award.</P>
      <P>I was making the point that I did not consider exempted development should be taken into account.  It is also my contention that the price paid for the property should be taken into account in assessing any potential award.  Quite clearly, if somebody has acquired a property for a very small consideration, it seems unreasonable that they should ultimately receive a huge compensation award purely on the basis that the property, had it achieved its developmental potential, would have amounted to considerably more.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment refers to the value of comparable land being taken into account.  I should like some clarification of that.  It appears to me that, if one starts taking into account the values of other properties in the immediate area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if any changes are planned in the Programme for National Recovery in light of the special delegate conference of the ICTU held on 8 February 1990 and the strong criticism of the programme expressed by many delegates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcome the confirmation by ICTU at their special delegate conference of their continued agreement to the <i>Programme for</i><Col N="1774" /><i>National Recovery.</i>  This decision was due to the fact that the majority of delegates considered that the programme had been honoured and implemented in full by the Government.  The progress report published last week by the central review committee of the programme and placed in the Oireachtas Library gives full details of the progress made under the programme in implementing its objectives and commitments.</P>
      <P>The Government hope that all social partners will participate in negotiations on a further programme.  Since the current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is operative until the end of this year, discussions on a new programme will not commence until later this year.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> enables the social partners to share in decision making and implementation in respect of national economic and social objectives.  This is a new successful formula for national economic management which is better than anything we have ever tried before.  It is now widely recognised that the economic and social progress made over the past three years has been due in large measure to the programme. The social partners who have contributed so much to the success of the programme should now have the opportunity in continued partnership with the Government to determine how the growing benefits of our expanding economy will be distributed.</P>
      <P>I hope, therefore, that the negotiations in due course will lead to a new programme which will enable us successfully and in partnership to confront and overcome the many economic and social problems which still face us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his considered reply in an area that he regards as a cornerstone of his economic policy.  Notwithstanding what the Taoiseach has said about a majority considering that the terms of the programme have been honoured, would the Taoiseach agree that equal concern was expressed by all at the special delegate conference concerning the failure of the <Col N="1775" /> agreement effectively to tackle unemployment? Would the Taoiseach say whether there are any new employment strategies contemplated by the Government arising from this unanimity on the part of the delegates in the unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is disappointment in the trade union movement about employment but I would not agree with the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo; of the programme with regard to employment, because the programme has reached its employment targets, such as they are. The Government share with the trade union movement and the other social partners disappointment that the rate of economic growth we are achieving in the programme has not yet translated itself satisfactorily into employment creation. That is a subject which is engaging our attention and one which we will discuss with the social partners through the central review committee.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not have noticed that I mentioned in my budget speech that we have asked the Commission in Brussels, from their expertise, to give us the benefit of any advice or assistance they can offer in the process of translating economic growth into more employment.  I agree that it is the central issue today in the economic area.  Optimistically, perhaps, one could visualise a delay in economic growth translating itself into employment and that from now on we should increasingly get the benefits of the growth in the economy which is averaging 3 per cent or 3.5 per cent.  I accept that it is something of concern to all of us.</P>

      <P>I welcome what has been the most frank statement coming from the Taoiseach on this critically important area.  I presume the Taoiseach agrees <Col N="1776" /> with the figures advanced in the House yesterday by his Minister of State that some 13,500 redundancies were notified last year to the Department of Labour. Does the Taoiseach agree that that does not include people who would not be covered by the redundancy payments Acts and that that leaves a very minimal net improvement in the jobs situation? Would the Taoiseach also agree that workers who have been enduring wage restraint would expect some income restraint demonstrated by other sectors, and would expect a more reasonable translation of that wage moderation into job creation?  When the Taoiseach refers to the fact that this matter is under scrutiny at the moment, I take it he is referring to the review of industrial policy that he mentioned in an answer to me in this House some time ago.  Can the Taoiseach indicate when that review might be complete?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal objectives of the current round of GATT negotiations, which is due to be completed at the end <Col N="1780" /> of 1990, is the greater liberalisation of agricultural trade through the improvement of market access and the introduction of increased disciplines on the use of all subsidies.  At the mid-term review of the negotiations in April 1989 the participating countries agreed to the long-term aims of substantially reducing support and protection levels and of ensuring that agricultural policies were made more responsive to market signals. Notwithstanding these agreed objectives some contracting parties, in particular the US, are continuing to propose the full liberalisation of agricultural trade and the elimination of practically all subsidies and supports.</P>
    <P>The Community's approach, which I fully support, is that while the EC is willing to participate in negotiations to progressively reduce support to the extent necessary to achieve balanced markets and a more market oriented agricultural trading system, it remains fully committed to the fundamental principles of CAP.  This is an essential condition for the EC in the negotiations.  The Community is also insisting on receiving full credit for the various agriculture reforms since 1986 which have contributed significantly to improvements on world markets. Ireland has continuously pressed these points in the discussions within the Community which have contributed to the establishment of the EC negotiating position.  The actual negotiations are, however, conducted by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I am kept fully aware of the views of farm interests on developments in the negotiations through the special group of representatives of the agriculture and food organisations which I established for this purpose.  The group have been meeting regularly since October 1988 and they perform a very useful function.</P>
    <P>My principal aims in these negotiations are to ensure that the Community can continue to support farming and rural areas and that farmers' incomes are maintained at reasonable levels.  In its agreed negotiating position the Community is firmly committed to meeting these aims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to understand the Minister's stance when one considers that it appears the EC is weakening its resolve in the face of the American challenge.  As this is of the utmost importance to every farming family in the country &mdash; and, indeed, to people totally unrelated to farming &mdash; will the Minister say if the EC is creating a level of subsidy which can be very easily reconciled with what the Americans want, the total abolition of subsidies over ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Our priority and that of the Community will be to protect the agricultural industry and rural life generally within the context of those negotiations. The stance adopted at the negotiations with the Americans is geared towards protecting those interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the fact that Ireland holds the Presidency of the EC one of the reasons that the whole case on agricultural price support at the moment is so unsatisfactory?  The two Ministers of State were involved in the meeting of the Council of Ministers this week and they seemed to accept tamely that there should be no price increase this year &mdash; not just for Irish farmers &mdash; but for Community farmers generally.  It seems that the Ministers are preparing the way to give the Americans their chance of ensuring that all subsidies will be phased out over the next five to ten years.  If something is not done soon to stop this slide towards the abolition of all subsidies there will not be even 30,000 farmers in this country in five or six years' time.  Is the Minister aware of what is happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 24 and 42 together.  I have sought and obtained a whole series of measures over the past <Col N="1783" /> year.  At the January 1989 Council of Ministers' meeting I got agreement to give special recognition to the importance of the beef industry to the Irish economy.  In March 1989 I succeeded in obtaining carcase intervention for a two-week period.  This was of considerable benefit to the winter feeder.  In September 1989 we were successful in persuading the EC Commission of the need to introduce an aids to private storage scheme, despite opposition from some member states.  A total of 81,000 tonnes was placed in store under this scheme. During the peak production period in 1989 and in the early part of this year we persuaded the EC Commission to accept a total of 66,400 tonnes of beef into intervention under the tendering system.</P>
      <P>My primary concern is that the returns to the producer remain at acceptable levels.  We will, of course, continue to press the case of the Irish cattle producers at all levels in the Community in order to ensure that the EC support schemes are operated to the optimum benefit of all sectors of our beef industry.  The policy review group which I set up late last year will look, <i>inter alia</i>, at the problems of seasonality in the beef sector and how it might be tackled.</P>

It appears from the Minister's reply neither he nor the Department have a single idea in regard to changing that system.  He said that a committee had been set up but that committee has been in operation for 18 months.  Is the Minister aware that the real problem is that in the beef sector there will not be winter beef fatteners next year?  I am sure the Minister is aware of what that will do for food processing, an area that comes within his portfolio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>BSE was first confirmed here on 25 January 1989.  To date, there have been 18 cases &mdash; four in County Cavan, four in County Donegal, one in County Monaghan, one in County Meath, one in County Longford, three in County Cork and one in each of counties Carlow, Clare, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
      <P>This disease has a long incubation period and studies are continuing as to its possible origin.  The feeding of Scrapieinfected meat and bonemeal has been suggested as the most likely cause of the disease but this has yet to be conclusively proven.  The evidence in regard to the small number of cases found here is that the cause of the disease was import-related &mdash; either the infected animals were imported or were exposed to imported feed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following confirmation of our first BSE case, I took steps to make it notifiable and to provide for slaughter of affected animals with disposal of the carcases by burial or incineration.  I have also arranged for a special examination of the brains of animals presented for slaughter with suspicious symptoms and for the purchase and retention for research purposes at the Department's veterinary laboratory of the progeny of confirmed cases.  The importation of ruminant rations from the UK is prohibited and the import of cattle from that country is currently limited to those born after 18 July 1988 &mdash; the date on which <Col N="1786" /> a UK national ban on the feeding of ruminant-derived rations to ruminants became applicable.</P>
    <P>In line with a recent EC decision, our restrictions on the importation of cattle from the UK will be extended shortly. Ireland opposed the EC proposal referred to on the basis that it was not justified on either animal or public health grounds.  There is no evidence that BSE poses a threat to human health.  The Scientific Veterinary Committee of the EC unanimously reported to that effect on 8 January 1990.  This view is shared by the Food Advisory Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the opposition of the Government, and the Minister in particular, to the ban imposed by the Commission on the importation of cattle from countries where this disease is endemic, I should like to know why the Minister did not adopt the same attitude as the German Government and impose a ban on the products?  Is the Minister aware that various scientific journals have outlined the dangers involved for humans and particularly the time bomb that may exist after a 30-year incubation period for a virus that has not been isolated as yet. Similar viruses have a 30-year incubation period.  The Minister must bear in mind that contaminated products may appear in the food chains.  The Minister has stated that there is no known risk arising from this disease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat the conclusion of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the EC to the effect that there was no evidence to suggest that BSE is transmissible to humans.  With regard to the decision of the EC to prohibit the export of live cattle from the UK I should like to tell the Deputy that Ireland opposed that measure on the grounds that the decision was not based on conclusive scientific evidence.  There was no logic to that decision and it was contrary to the unanimous view of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the EC which was that the risk of BSE spreading to humans was extremely remote.  BSE is a notifiable disease and virtually all the cases in Ireland are in Border areas.  They relate to imported cattle or imported feed.  There is no comparison between the problems being faced by the UK and those we face.  In the UK 9,600 cases were reported and 25 per cent of the sheep population is infected with the disease.  We do not have that problem here.</P>

      <P>The difficulties of eradicating TB in this country are well known. We have had far greater success with brucellosis.  It has been well documented over the past 30 years that little progress has been made.  To that end ERAD was established and resources provided to finally eliminate the problem of bovine tuberculosis.  They have now drawn up a comprehensive programme with the help of their board, which is representative of the farming community, and they expect to make considerable progress over the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 8 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission has recently fixed a 65 per cent recoupment rate for horizontal measures in Ireland, including the headage payments schemes in our disadvantaged areas.  It is Ireland's intention to meet the additionality requirements laid down by the EC in relation to this increased recoupment rate on a broad front so as to achieve the maximum draw-down from EC funds.  When the full extent of the new areas is known and when the cost of their inclusion is quantified we shall ensure the necessary funds are provided as they are needed for the extension and reclassification of our disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase of the 65 per cent recoupment rate.  May I ask the Minister to state if the applications that have been made by the different areas &mdash; where the people know the criteria that is to be applied inside out &mdash; have been scrutinised and agreed according to public statements by other people in his own party?  Has he made provision in the Estimates for adequate funding for those areas which are to be included?  When can we expect a statement on the decision on the areas to be included?</P>

      <P>The processing of the survey work which has been going on for some time is in its final stages at present and we hope it will be going to the Commission in the not too distant future.  I would say, <Col N="1791" /> and I am sure that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, if he was here would wish me to say, that he is more than pleased that he has negotiated the new 65 per cent rate of recoupment. Obviously, it will be beneficial to the operation of the scheme.  In the past there had been a problem where the recoupment did not come back for a 12 month period.  Through his negotiations he has ensured that we will get it back in a much shorter period.  That, of course, will leave the financial provision for the extension and reclassification in a much more satisfactory position.</P>

It is still in Agriculture House while all our competitors, throughout Europe, have their files sent.  How does the Minister gel the figures in the Programme for Government between his party and the Progressive Democrats when he said it was Government policy to extend the areas, where possible and to increase the headage to those already in receipt of headage over the next four years, whereas, in the Community framework support scheme there appears to be a shortfall in the amount of money sought and what he actually received from Brussels? Where will the actual funding come from for the extension which the Minister and his Deputies are telling the whole country is coming?  Will everybody who is successful in this review be paid their headage in 1990?</P>

      <P>The information on controls referred to in the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors of the European Communities for the financial year 1988 has since been forwarded to the Commission.</P>
      <P>As regards the annual declaration, the annual report indicates that this country was one of five member states which were not in a position to meet the specified deadlines in respect of the 1986 accounts.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The definitive annual declaration for <Col N="1798" /> 1986 was submitted by Ireland to the Commission in December 1987 and no subsequent amendments were made.  The delay was due to the huge volume of sales in 1986 resulting from the Commission decision to reduce intervention stocks significantly in that year, which led to complex administrative processing before the definitive declaration could be finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the director of ERAD that in 1989 there were 21 herds comprising 1,129 animals depopulated from bovine TB and 17 herds comprising 1,500 animals depopulated for brucellosis.  The corresponding figures for 1988 were ten TB herd depopulations comprising 275 animals and 19 brucellosis herd depopulations comprising 1,036 animals.</P>
      <P>There were 1,227 herd restrictions for TB and 57 for brucellosis in County Tipperary in 1989.  The corresponding figures for 1988 were 880 and 48 herds, respectively. These restrictions resulted in the removal of 4,148 TB reactors and 863 brucellosis reactors in 1989 and of 2,546 TB reactors and 530 brucellosis reactors in 1988.  The increase in the 1989 figures reflects the increasing intensity of the eradication programme.</P>
      <P>Amounts paid for compensation relate to actual payments made in the course of each calendar year.  Reactor and depopulation grant payments which herdowners in County Tipperary received in addition to the factory prices for slaughtered animals amounted to £1,521,356 in 1989 and £888,524 in 1988.</P>

      <P>I agree that the figures represent a worrying trend.

      <P>When the scheme governing installation aid for young farmers was reviewed by the EC Council last year I pressed for a reduction in the labour unit requirement for eligibility at the time of installation from one man work unit to 0.5 man work unit.  This change would have the effect of extending the benefits of the scheme to a greater number of applicants.  In the event, the Community agreed that an applicant could be given two years from the date of installation to attain the labour requirement of one man work unit.</P>

      <P>The concessions the Minister obtained last year were vital to this scheme but there are still some anomalies in it.  I know of a young farmer who has all the necessary educational qualifications to qualify for aid but because an uncle bequeathed five acres of land to him he was regarded as having land of his own, even though it is part of the family farm.  I ask the Minister to examine the anomaly which exists between land which is handed down and that which is purchased.

Like Deputy Leonard, I know of a young farmer who, because of a lack of funds, was two months late commencing his Teagasc course and because of the time limit on the course he was rendered ineligible for aid.

      <P>The maze of problems in relation to installation aid cannot be laid at the Minister's feet; these problems existed from the beginning.  The Department should, if possible, carry out some review into this scheme.  As Deputy Connor said, it can be nearly six to eight months before an applicant for aid is told what is wrong with his application and these problems can continue for two or three years.  It would be of great benefit to young people entering farming if they could be told from the outset exactly what is wrong with their application so that it can be reassessed.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 18, 48, 60 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Because of the view of the EC Commission that the continued operation of the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards could not be justified under Community law, the Government decided that the milk boards should be dissolved and replaced by a National Milk Agency which would regulate the liquid milk market on a countrywide basis.  The Government also decided that the boards assets should be disposed of.  Consultations are currently taking place with a view to implementing this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present no plans for the privatisation or commercialisation of the other companies or agencies under the control of the Department but, as stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 6 on 30 November 1989, the Government set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee to prepare <Col N="1807" /> a report on the options for the future development of Siúicre Éireann.  This committee are at present finalising their report, which is expected to be submitted to the Government shortly.  Pending consideration of the report it is not possible to indicate what decisions will be taken on the future development of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State inform the House if recent reports which suggested that plans have been finalised at the Sugar Company's headquarters to sell off 25 per cent of the company to the private sector are correct? If so, can he tell us if the workers were consulted bearing in mind the sacrifices they have made to keep the company going and strong?  Furthermore, was any consideration given to the need to protect beet growers should the company be privatised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the annual report of the Sugar Company, which was well publicised, in which the chairman suggested the possibility of going to the Stock Market with 25 per cent but, as I said in my reply, the ultimate decision rest with the Government. That remains the position.  I want to assure the Deputy and the House that the important asset of our sugar quota will be protected no matter what the future of the company may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In a statement he made in 1989 the Taoiseach referred to speculation about privatisation of the Sugar Company and indicated that this had never been considered by the Government. May we take it from what the Minister of State has said that there is no question of the Government considering privatisation?  The chairman of the board, Mr. Cahill, made the statement without first having discussions at board level. Now that the company is in good shape there seems to be great interest in privatisation but the question is, may we take it that it is Government policy not to allow the company or any part of it to be privatised?</P>

      <P>I said in my reply that the chairman in the annual report made certain suggestions.  He also acknowledged that any decision on the future of the company is a matter for the Government, who have made no decision as yet. To date they have not received a report from the <i>ad hoc</i> committee which they established to examine the options for the future development of the company. Therefore they are not yet in a position to even consider that report let alone make a decision on it.</P>

      <P>As part of the 1992 Single Market programme the EC Commission are considering the harmonisation of standards for health, hygiene, etc., both in relation to liquid milk for human consumption and to milk for the manufacture of dairy products.  Proposals in this regard have not, however, been formally presented to the Council.  My approach to any negotiations on these measures will be to ensure that only realistic standards which are fair both to producers and consumers are proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the proposals got out around the country, but there is a proposal going from one district office to another which I hope the Minister is aware of, which states that any type of water supply which is contaminated in any shape or form, even to a minute degree, cannot be used on Irish farms where milk is supplied.  If that is so and considering the level of water supply we have, surely no Irish dairy farmer will be able to have the type of finance to invest to ensure that he will come to a particular level.  Against that background, would the Minister accept that all the pointers and signals at the moment are that the milk price in Ireland will drop 17p per gallon in the next month or two?  Taking one with the other, will he give some degree of confidence to the dairying industry, considering that all the factors are working against them?  Will he accept that the price is going to decrease by 17p per gallon?</P>

      <P>New hygiene laws have been defined and at present discussions are going along those lines, but they are going to impose a certain financial burden, particularly on many smaller farmers.  I am interested to hear that the Minister does not favour imposing financial hardship.  Do I deduce from that that some financial assistance will be given to farmers when these proposals are being implemented?  They were very stringent proposals originally but due to the vigilance of Teagasc they have been fairly modified.  Therefore, can I have an assurance that some assistance will be given particularly to farmers who cannot meet the costs?  We all know farmers who are under siege at this stage in relation to cost.</P>

Any <Col N="1813" /> effort that is made and any encouragement the Government can give will be towards improving the quality of milk for supply to consumers.  I think farmers are being paid particularly well for milk and there is an onus on farmers to supply only milk which is fit for human consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 77 together.  The position is as follows: Continuous input into policy making from all the major sectors of the industry is now being dealt with in the context of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Progress is being monitored regularly by the central review committee.  I have recently instituted a policy review group to specify the key objectives for the agriculture and food sector in the medium term and to recommend the major policies to be used in working towards those objectives.  The main organisations concerned have been consulted and written submissions have been invited from other interested persons or groups.  In these circumstances it is not envisaged that an agriculture and food council will be established at this stage.</P>
      <P>The provision of mortgage type finance is essentially a matter between the lending agency and the individual farmer concerned and all the major financial institutions are in a position to offer long-term agricultural loans.</P>
      <P>I have considered the setting up of a land authority.  I am not satisfied that a land authority are warranted at the present time or that they would have the effect on mobility suggested in the Deputy's question.  Apart from the very high cost which would be incurred by the Exchequer there could be also constitutional problems involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the question of a land authority and the functions which they might exercise are being kept under review in <Col N="1816" /> the light of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and other developments. The position of young people wishing to enter farming has improved in recent years due to the greater opportunities for leasing land and the introduction of the installation premium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Minister that it is contained in the Government's White Paper?  Is the Minister aware that the figures now show that 95,609 people left the land between 1971 and 1986 and that at present anybody with enough money can buy land whether for a hobby, an investment or bona fide farming, and that the only way to control land sale, which is a matter of urgency, is the establishment of a land authority who would have responsibility for the powers to monitor the control of land purchase?  If we are to give more than lip service to the young people who have done training and have no land to make a living on, the Minister will agree that this is an urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the movement of people from agriculture into industry and other areas is not a phenomenon confined to this country; it applies across Europe generally.  The thrust of Deputy Sherlock's observations has to do with the regulation of the market for land. This has been considered in great depth. We are immediately into constitutional considerations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1861" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 8.</P>
    <P>In page 5, before section 5, but in Part II, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;5&mdash;Notwithstanding any provisions in the Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, no person or company shall be entitled to compensation as a result of a decision made by a planning authority or by the Board arising from a refusal of permission to develop such land where such compensation would be in excess of the existing use value of the land for which planning permission was originally sought and where such claims had been made on the estimation of the increased value which would accrue if planning permission had been granted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Deputy Quinn.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of calculating the amount of compensation that might be paid is extremely complex and has been the subject of some litigation. The Irish Planning Institute in their submissions drew attention to what they regarded as the two key clauses in the 1963 Act &mdash; section 55 (2) and 55 (3). They made the point that those two clauses in the 1963 Act were the subject of a court case in 1982 where the High Court held that the claimant was not confined to the probable development value of the land if the permission refused had been granted.  Both of those clauses were in the original Bill in rules 13 and 14 respectively and they are repeated in the Government amendment No. 60 in rules 3 (2) (c) and 4 (1) (a) of the First Schedule. The net effect of that, as I read it, but I am open to correction by the <Col N="1862" /> Minister, would be to continue to allow a situation whereby the compensation would be calculated on the basis of the development potential of the land rather than on the actual loss incurred by the landowner.</P>
      <P>The amendments I have tabled are to the effect that calculation of compensation should be on the basis of the actual loss incurred.  I believe that should be stated explicitly in the rules governing the calculation of compensation because the rules will have to be operated by arbitrators.  It is important that they are clear about what is intended and that the ambiguities contained in the 1963 Act, which led to a situation whereby the level of compensation awards and claims were far in excess of the price originally paid by the landowner for the land or of the actual loss incurred, are cleared up.  I believe a number of things should be taken into account.  I mentioned before we adjourned for lunch that the price of the land should be taken into account; the possible availability of exempted developments should not be taken into account; the question of the availability of comparable land nearby should not be taken into account, because those two factors would serve to inflate the level of awards being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also proposed an amendment which would require that the value of the land attributable to completed or planned public infrastructural works should not be taken into account when calculating compensation.  I will give an example of what I have in mind.  If the local authorities are providing additional water or sewerage systems under the Minister's Environment Action Programme which enhance the value of the land, as those facilities have been provided in the first place with public money, I think it would be quite wrong if at some future stage an applicant were to claim that because services were made available which in turn increased the value of the land that should enhance the possibility for compensation. I think the provision of such infrastructural works should not be taken into account when calculating compensation. I am proposing specifically <Col N="1863" /> that rule 3 should be deleted.  Basically, it provides for the development value of the land to be taken into account and also the rule that would require the arbitrator to take into account the possible development potential in the light of any undertaking which might be given by a local authority.  At the end of the day any compensation that would be paid should be based on the actual loss incurred by the landowner.  I think that is the only basis on which compensation should be allowed.  I do not believe the landowner should be compensated for the possible future development potential of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this very important set of amendments and I would also like to thank the House for agreeing to take such a large number of amendments together. However, as far as my amendments are concerned there is really only one substantive matter involved, and that is the new set of valuation rules for determining the amount of compensation.  These new rules are set out in amendment No. 60 which proposed a new version of the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>All of the other ministerial amendments are either consequential or otherwise dependent on this basic provision.  For example, amendment No. 16 and all 13 amendments to sections 18 to 24, inclusive, are concerned solely with applying the new First Schedule to the less usual categories of compensation claims dealt with in Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main occasion for compensation claims envisaged under the Bill is the refusal or adverse conditioning of planning permission as dealt with in section 12.  However, the possibility of compensation is provided for also, as previously, in relation to certain other actions by planning authorities under the 1963 Act: removal or alteration of a structure, discontinuance of use, removal or alteration of a hedge, tree preservation orders, creation of public rights of way, entry on land and placing or dealing with <Col N="1864" /> cables, wires and pipelines.  Only very rarely have compensation claims arisen under any of these provisions, and in some cases, as far as we know, no claim has ever arisen.</P>
    <P>Because of the restructuring of the valuation rules which I am now proposing in the revised First Schedule, it is necessary to make certain adaptations to these provisions of Part III of the Bill, so that the rules can be meaningfully applied in these cases.  The bulk of the amendments which we are now discussing are concerned with this and provide explicitly that the First Schedule, as proposed by amendment No. 60, shall apply to assessment of compensation in these instances also.</P>
    <P>Having disposed of these largely technical adjustments to the Bill, I would like now to deal with the key amendment No. 60 which proposes a new version of the First Schedule.  This sets out an entirely revised set of rules for determining the amount of compensation in all cases arising under the Bill.  The Bill, of course, severely limits the right to planning compensation, but in cases where planning compensation should still be payable, the measure of it should be the reduction in the value of a person's land which is directly attributable to the adverse planning decision.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, the valuation rules of the 1963 Act seemed to encourage a maximalist approach to assessing compensation. In practice, compensation tended to be based on the difference between the value of land following the adverse planning decision and its notional value had the planning permission been granted, albeit subject to suitable conditions. In other words, the top line for valuation purposes tended to be set by the landower's own aspirations for development of his land in the form of his planning application.</P>
    <P>The most important and radical provision of amendment No. 60 is to do away with this maximalist assumption.  The top line which it fixes for valuation purposes is simply the realistic market value of the land immediately before the adverse planning decision, but the new rules <Col N="1865" /> make it absolutely clear that only reasonable prospects for developing the land are to be embraced in this assessment.  In particular, regard must be had to the fact that the land might not, at the relevant time, have carried any substantial planning permission and that its prospects of obtaining such permission would have to be viewed by the market as uncertain. The new rules categorically disallow any automatic presumption of the kind of planning permission which the owner was seeking.</P>
    <P>The valuation framework proposed in the new First Schedule is clearly structured around the difference between the antecedent and the subsequent realistic market value of the land, subject to all of the qualifications provided by the previous rules.  As well as making the fundamental change which I mentioned, the new First Schedule reorganises and refines most of these previous rules.  I can deal with it in greater detail in response to particular queries which Deputies have raised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has also put down an extensive range of amendments relating to valuation matters.  These substitute concepts such as the &ldquo;actual loss incurred by the applicant&rdquo; or &ldquo;the financial loss incurred by the developer&rdquo; for the concept of reduction in value which underlies the existing valuation provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For a start, I am not clear that the notion of loss in itself differs appreciably from that of reduction in value, but if I understand Deputy Gilmore's amendments correctly, he may be concerned to relate the idea of loss very closely to the particular circumstances of the applicant. If so, his amendments are attempting to import an element of subjectivity which would not be consistent with accepted land valuation principles.  Planning is about regulation of land use and planning compensation must relate to the effects of this regulation on land values, not to the personal circumstancese of the claimant.</P>
    <P>Having said this, I am grateful for Deputy Gilmore's attempts, as expressed <Col N="1866" /> in his amendments, to improve and clarify the new valuation rules.  I can accept his amendment No. 7 to my amendment No. 60, which involves the deletion of Rule 4 (2) of the new First Schedule.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept his amendment No. 5 to Amendment No. 60 which would prevent account being taken of any increase in the value of the land attributable to planned public infrastructural works.  If these works have or would have enhanced the value of land, then it is to be assumed that, had they granted planning permission, the planning authority would have levied an appropriate development contribution.  Rule 3 (2) (c) already requires the arbitrator to have regard to this likelihood and to take account of the effect on open market value.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn speaks quite knowledgeably about these matters and I appreciate his intervention in this regard. He spoke knowledgeably about the history of the development land question and the principle of setting the compensation for acquisition of land at existing use value, as recommended by the majority Kenny report.  This was for the outright acquisition of land as distinct from the purposes of this Bill.  Under the Bill we are attempting to fix the compensation to be paid for the reduction in value arising from planning decisions, but the ownership of the land is not changing. My approach is to fix the compensation not at purchase price or value but at the difference between the antecedent and the subsequent realistic market value of the land.  The new rules categorically disallow any automatic presumption of the kind of planning permission which the owner was seeking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn's amendment No. 8 would seriously compromise the possibility of planning compensation.  It provides that compensation would be disallowed where it exceeds the existing use value of the land prior to the planning application, and where a claim is based on the estimate of the increased value which the desired planning permission would have brought.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in accepting the <Col N="1867" /> substance of the last part of this amendment. As I emphasised, paragraph 3 of the new proposed First Schedule provides for this very same point and will ensure that the top line, for the purposes of calculating reduction in value, will not be set by the aspirations of the planning application.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty, however, regarding the relevance of existing use value to the circumstances of planning compensation. A landowner will enjoy the existing use value of land both before and after an adverse planning decision.  In that sense, it is the bottom line for the purposes of calculating reduction in value, but, by definition, the due amount of planning compensation cannot be the existing use value since the landowner will not have lost this.</P>
    <P>Planning compensation has to be based on the difference between the antecedent value of land, when it was unaffected by the adverse planning decision and its subsequent value when it has been affected by the planning decision.</P>
    <P>That is generally the view I put to the House.  While I can concede on some items, I cannot do so in respect of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments are addressed to the substance of the First Schedule.  The other amendments are consequential or related.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has substantially changed the approach from the provisions in the Bill as published.  Deputy Quinn was right in one matter &mdash; I am sure the Minister would not disagree with him &mdash; that the complexities of the First Schedule are such that, whether we are talking about reduction in value, as it is referred to here, or other concepts, the vagaries of judicial interpretation on occasion can be such that none of us in this House could predict with 100 per cent certainty, in the event of a judicial analysis of the Bill, what might emerge from the courts structure.  I spent some considerable time looking at the First Schedule and its implications.  In fairness to the Minister it has to be said he has come up with a formula which is a great <Col N="1868" /> deal better than that contained in the first presentation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The contingency we are all anxious to get at is that if compensation is to be paid it will be compensation for a genuine, real loss and not compensation for some theoretical loss that is not a reality. Moving away from the potential maximum value of land based on somebody's hope as to what he could achieve is very welcome.</P>
      <P>I do not want to intervene at any great length because the Minister has set out his intentions.  We could spend many hours going over this First Schedule.  I am taking a simple approach to it, which is that the Minister has come a long way towards meeting the various concerns we had on this side of the House about the original provisions of the Bill.  In the context of the Bill now before us we have a much improved provision.  The concept of reduction in value, as it is dealt with in the First Schedule, I hope will work in the manner the Minister envisages.  I have no doubt there is a possibility that this will be analysed and parsed during the course of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>In this intervention, so as to give the Minister an opportunity to respond I want to raise for discussion purposes amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 60 which I have tabled to be included in the First Schedule in Rule 2 (a).  In Rule 2 (a), which deals in the First Schedule with the rules for the determination of the amount of compensation, there are a number of matters to which regard is to be had in determining what is defined as the antecedent value and the subsequent value of the land for the purpose of Rule 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no particular criticism to raise with the items listed.  I thought it a curiosity in Rule 2 (a) (i) to (iv), that the various matters listed there do not deal specifically &mdash; though I presume in trying to look at the open market value it is something that would result in regard having been had to it, if we are dealing with land recently purchased or acquired &mdash; with looking at the actual price paid for the land if it was land acquired within four to five years of the compensation <Col N="1869" /> claim arising or acquired by way of inheritance.  It does not deal in specific terms though it is implicit that regard would be had to these matters.  Neither does it deal with what might have been the valuation put on that land at the time it was inherited.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's response to amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 60 which I have tabled in the context of our discussion on these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment to my amendment No. 60 would require the property arbitrator, in determining both the antecedent and subsequent values of land, to have regard to any price paid for the land within the previous six years, and to any valuation for death duty purposes within the same period.  I consider that this last aspect is adequately catered for by paragraph 2 (c) of the First Schedule which provides that all returns and assessments of capital value for taxation made or acquiesced in by the claimant may be considered.</P>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's amendment seemed to me to be unnecessary. The arbitrator's basic terms of reference have already been set in paragraph 1 of the First Schedule.  They are to operate on the basis of open market value before and after the adverse planning decision. It is axiomatic that any recent sale price for the land will be relevant to this system of open market valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might have the indulgence of the Chair and Members present, perhaps I might read into the record some details of the Schedule which might be of advantage to those who would be reading it outside this House.  In a matter of this nature, which might have a subsequent <Col N="1870" /> hearing in another forum, it might be just as well to have this read into the record.</P>
    <P>Rule 1 establishes the basic concept that reduction in value is to be calculated as the difference between the antecendent and the subsequent value of land.</P>
    <P>Rule 2 sets out the facts which are to be considered, or not considered, in determining both antecedent and subsequent values.  All are derived from the First Schedule as originally published. Rule 2 (a) (iv) is an abbreviated version of the earlier Rule 2, and provides that regard should be had to the market value of comparable land in the vicinity of the land being valued.</P>
    <P>Rule 2 (b) (iii) is a modified version of Rule 5 in the previous draft which has been expanded to exclude from reckoning any element of value attributable to the use of land or the use of any premises on it in a manner which could endanger public safety or the environment. Rule 2 (b) (iv) is the former Rule 8 (a).  Rule 2 (b) (vi) goes beyond the former Rule 10 in excluding from consideration any development proposal of a statutory body affecting the land; the former Rule 10 referred to development proposals of a local authority only.  Rule 2 (c) is derived from the former Rule 1.</P>
    <P>Rules 6 and 8 (b) of the original Schedule have been omitted.  Rule 6 was made redundant by the introduction of the concept of antecedent and subsequent values.  Rule 8 (b) provided that regard was not to be had to any depreciation or increase in the value of land attributable to the inclusion of the land in a special amenity area order; this was unnecessary since the Second Schedule provides that compensation is not payable in respect of development in an area to which such an order relates.</P>
    <P>Rule 3 of the new Schedule sets out the other matters to which regard must be had in determining antecedent value. It provides that regard is to be had to the reasonable possibilities, if any, for development of the land which, having regard to all material considerations, could be held to have existed immediately before the adverse planning decision. <Col N="1871" /> The material considerations to be taken into account include the likelihood or unlikelihood of obtaining permission to develop the land in the light of the provisions of the development plan and the nature and location of the land.  Therefore Rule 3 moves decisively away from the maximum advantages concept of valuation to a more realistic framework.</P>
    <P>Rule 4 sets out the other matters to be taken into account in the determination of subsequent value.  Sub-rule (1) requires the assumption to be made, in the case where planning permission has been refused, that permission would not be granted for any development of a kind specified in section 14 (2) and also requires account to be taken of any conditions which could reasonably be attached to any permission granted.  Rule 5 defines `statutory body' for the purposes of Rule 2 (b) (vi).  It is a technical matter and it will be of some advantage to those who will be seeking to interpret it afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complicated First Schedule and, as the Minister said, the detail of what is contained in this First Schedule may well be the subject matter of very expensive litigation in the years to come.  We would do well to spend some time teasing out exactly what is meant by this because this will determine how much compensation will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> I appreciate that we are dealing with this all together.  Because we are dealing with the total issue of how compensation should be calculated it is inevitable that we will hop from one aspect to another but it might be worthwhile doing that for a while.</P>
    <P>I will first deal with the concept embodied in the First Schedule.  The Minister made the point that he was not entirely clear as to whether the concept of a reduction in value differed very much from the concept of actual loss incurred which I sought to introduce into the Schedule.  That was something I was not clear about either, when I was reading the Minister's new First Schedule.  I was not clear as to whether what the Minister intended to do was roughly the same as that which I would like him to do.  I am still not 100 per cent clear on that.  What the Minister is proposing is that compensation will still continue to be calculated on the basis of the development potential of the lands although not necessarily on the basis of the maximum development potential of the land.  That is different from the concept of the actual loss which may be incurred as a result of the decision to refuse permission.  The Minister felt that to introduce the concept of actual loss incurred might introduce an element of subjectivity into the whole calculation procedure.  I suggest that it would take the element of subjectivity out of it, that it would be easier for an arbitrator to assess the loss actually suffered by a landowner who had been refused planning permission, then to try to calculate a reduction in value, because the reduction in value has to take into account the possible potential of the land. There is a difference in the concept.  I would like the Minister to tease that out a bit more with us.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of the different qualifications and elements built into this, as to what constitutes a reduction in value, there is very considerable subjectivity and we would like some clarification of it. Let us deal with the question of exempted development.  It is said that in determining the antecedent and subsequent value of the land, regard should be had <Col N="1873" /> to the fact that exempted development might have been carried out on the land. Does that mean that the arbitrator is being asked to notionally increase the value of the land for the calculation of the compensation on the basis that exempted development could have taken place on it?</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the open market value of comparable land, if any, in the vicinity of the land whose value is being determined, what does that mean? Does it mean that if I own a plot of land and I am refused planning permission and there is a plot of land next to it which has planning permission, the value of the land for which planning permission has been granted is to be taken into account in deciding on the compensateable value of my land?  At what point are the open market values of comparable land to be assessed?  The market values of land vary from time to time.  I am not clear about this.  There is a great degree of ambiguity and subjectivity here which would leave a loophole for large claims.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has said that he is not prepared to accept my amendment No. 5, which says that no account shall be taken of planned public infrastructural works on the basis that that could be taken account of by the levy which might be charged for those works in the planning application.  That is fair enough as far as planned infrastructural works are concerned, but suppose we take an area in, for instance, north County Dublin which because of the Environment Action Programme announced by the Minister will probably get new sewerage facilities in the next ten years &mdash; there is a degree of inevitability about that because of the Minister's stated intention to halt the discharge of raw sewage into the sea &mdash; will it be argued under this Schedule that the value of the land after these works have been carried out will be increased?  That must be addressed.  The same would apply for other infrastructural works such as the provision of telecommunications, electricity or roads.  Many developments taking place are in the vicinity of major roadworks.  If the public put a large sum <Col N="1874" /> of money into the building of the Shan-kill-Bray by-pass, the southern cross route, the south-eastern motorway, all of which are road developments in south County Dublin, will it be argued that the value of land in the vicinity of those works will be increased as a result of those works, that because roads and water services are provided the value of the land concerned has increased?  It should be expressly stated in the Bill that any increase in the value of land which is attributable to those works should be taken into account and possible compensation levels should be reduced to take account of that.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not agreed to take my amendment on board.</P>
    <P>Rule 3 says that regard shall be had only to such</P>
    <P>reasonable possibilities as, having regard to all material considerations, could be judged to have existed immediately prior to the relevant decision under Part IV of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>This idea of &ldquo;reasonable possibility&rdquo; is one of these great vague phrases which could mean anything to anybody.  The whole idea that the Minister seems to be building into the Schedule is that account will be taken of the reasonable possibilities for development.  Who will say what &ldquo;reasonable possibilities for development&rdquo; will be?  With respect, this is the kind of loose terminology which gave rise to the situation under the 1963 Act whereby the courts concluded that the fact that account was to be taken of the conditions which might be imposed on a planning permission implied that the planning permission should be granted in the first place.</P>
    <P>The rule goes on to deal with material considerations, the nature and location of the land and the likelihood of further permission to develop in the light of the provisions of the development plan.  This means that gates are being opened all the time to increase the level of compensation paid.  My concern is that the First Schedule as it stands continues to <Col N="1875" /> leave open the possibility that large compensation claims will still be made and awarded.  There is a need for a very great degree of clarity about what is intended here.  For that reason there is a difference between the idea I put forward that it should only take account of the actual loss incurred rather than the reduction in value which is subject to too great a degree of subjectivity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all so busily engrossed trying to understand what we are saying to one another that there is a certain reluctance to participate in this debate.  However, it clearly underlines the complexity of what we are trying to do and, if we have difficulty in understanding it, we should reflect on the implications for the public at large.  The core of this Bill is to identify the areas in which compensation will be paid.  They are listed in section 5 (a) to (i), inclusive.  In respect of all the claims for compensation which involve some form of loss of value, the way the value will be determined is set out by the Minister in the Schedule in the rules for the determination of financial compensation.  That much is clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised amended First Schedule is a considerable improvement on the original Schedule but it is still not clear whether the maximum value to which the Minister referred in various interventions represents the &ldquo;hope&rdquo; value or the development value of the land.  Ultimately, when this Bill becomes an Act and is being discussed by a court following a dispute, will the professional valuers who have to interpret it &mdash; and who are clearly an established professional body in their own right &mdash; have a clear understanding of what the Legislature intended?  Did the Minister have consultations with the representatives of the Society of Chartered Surveyors in relation to this matter?  While we can comment on the Bill, if any of us was involved in a dispute on behalf of a local authority or as a private citizen we would have to turn to a member of the Society of Chartered Surveyors.  They could very well say that they will do the best they <Col N="1876" /> can but that the rules are so complex there is no degree of clarity and they cannot say that we can reasonably expect a certain sum.</P>
    <P>When I moved the amendment I said that my concern was twofold.  I am concerned with the practicality of application from a purely operational, professional point of view of this legislation and I am not competent to evaluate that.  My second concern is the value system which will be applied in the absolute sense. There were clearly a number of substantial changes in the First Schedule and they did not come about lightly.  Will the Minister inform us whether the changes were subject to informal consultation with the Society of Chartered Surveyors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be more precise in relation to the wording in the First Schedule?  I appreciate that confidentiality is involved and that the Department must have due consideration to the primacy of this House in relation to looking at texts.  However, it is my intention to have consultations with those people between Committee and Report Stages to seek further clarification in regard to streamlining, if that is felt necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The society did not see the text but there was a general discussion about it.  I cannot go beyond that but obviously the Deputy will be taking advice between now and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore queried the time when the value of the land is to be assessed. Under Rule 1 the antecedent value is the value immediately prior to the decision and the subsequent value is the value immediately after the planning decision.  Deputy Gilmore also made a comment proposing the deletion of Rule 3.  Of all the provisions of the First Schedule this is the one that was deliberately and calculatedly written in to keep the top line of the valuation equation &mdash; I refer the Deputy to the end of page ten; it was deliberately done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> He also said that actual loss to a landowner should not take any account of the development potential of the land. However, development potential, where it exists, is a component of the open market value of the land.  Where it exists it must enter into the assessment of the &ldquo;actual loss&rdquo; or &ldquo;reduction in value&rdquo;, whichever term one likes to use.  The Deputy also suggested that Rule 2 (a) (3) of the First Schedule could operate to increase compensation awards by requiring regard to be had to the possibility of exempted development being carried out on the land.  I do not believe that that is the likely effect of the provision.  If anything, this consideration is likely to enhance the subsequent value of the land and so decrease the amount of compensation which might otherwise have been awarded.</P>
    <P>In both cases we are seeking to accommodate the view the Deputy would like enshrined in this and it is better left that way, particularly as far as Rule 3 is concerned. Deputies are agreed that this is a changed and enhanced Schedule.  It may well be that it will have to be argued in another place, but we think we have got it right on this occasion and we recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule refers to &ldquo;antecedent value&rdquo; of the land and in regard to that I should like to put an example to the Minister.  The Minister does not lose an opportunity to remind us that we are spending a lot of money building a massive ring road around Dublin city and there is a proposal to erect a massive shopping centre at a junction of that massive capital investment, some of which came from the EC and some from our taxpayers, on land zoned for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position if a contract to purchase that land was signed on the assumption that the prospective purchaser was informed by the seller that, having regard to the current political majority of Dublin County Council, a section 4 will be successful and the zoning will be changed from agricultural use to general purposes or commercial use?  We <Col N="1878" /> are all aware that the market is volatile and responds to different circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that the market value is equated to the antecedent value.  The present market value of that land would be well in excess of its value when it was zoned for agricultural use.  I am not an agricultural specialist but it is my view that between £2,500 and £3,000 per acre is the value of agricultural land in Dublin.  If the zoning of that land was changed we would be talking about a quantum leap in value to at least £20,000 or £30,000 per acre.</P>
    <P>If the market value today is such that a person with political influence in Dublin county can tell a person, pointing to the evidence on the last ten agendas for meetings of Dublin County Council, that he has access to the majority group of the council and he is happy that a section 4 promoted by him would receive favourable attention with the result that the value of the land zoned for agricultural use would rise, what is the position?  Am I correct in saying that the antecedent value of the land is the amount which the land if sold on the open market by a willing seller immediately prior to the relevant decision under Part IV of the Principal Act might have been expected to realise?  My reading of the Schedule leads me to conclude that that is precisely what is meant.  In that event I find that provision unacceptable because the market value as determined by external political, social or other considerations would be a value well in excess of what the community when they last decided to zone it believed it would be.  The value of the land is enhanced not just by the particular political complexion of the county council but by the massive investment of public infrastructure, in this case the western link road.</P>
    <P>If antecedent value means market value in the present circumstances I have to tell the Minister that I find that to be in conflict with my amendment.  The Minister has not said if he will accept my amendment.  He has indicated that it would pose difficulties and would lead to contradiction in some areas but he has not refused to accept it.  A planning <Col N="1879" /> application granted under section 4 in respect of an area of rapid growth whose value was enhanced as a result of expensive capital infrastructure being provided by the State, and the European Community, may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  If An Bord Pleanála refused permission, would the developer, the owner of the land, be able to file a claim for compensation against Dublin County Council using the valuation system set out in the schedule?  Would that person be able to say, in accordance with the Schedule, that the antecedent value of the land for which planning permission was refused was not the agricultural land use value but its value as a site for a shopping centre located strategically off the national primary route system on the western side of Dublin city?  Would that person be entitled to claim that instead of the value of that land being £3,000 per acre, its agricultural value, it was £23,000 per acre, its commercial value?  Is that what antecedent value means in the circumstances?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect that we should bear in mind is that it was always possible for the authority to use the vehicle of the development levy clawback system, even where section 4 cases are applied.  We should not lose sight of that.  They have always had the capacity to deal with any clawback they wished to achieve by way of compensation for expenditures of money in the public arena.  Existing use value is not necessarily equivalent to the current open market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made a case earlier about a Dublin coalyard.  If land is being under-utilised the existing use value would be less than the current open market value. With regard to the enhancement of land values by public works I should like to tell the Deputy that I tried to deal with that issue before.  If local authority works enhance a proposed development the planning authority have always been empowered to levy the appropriate development contribution where planning permission is granted.  Under Rule 3 (2) (c) the arbitrator is required to <Col N="1880" /> have regard to this likelihood and to take account of the effects on the open market value and this will also pull down the open market value.  Why cannot the First Schedule as outlined in Rule 1 (a) and (b), accommodate the point made in two different ways by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Quinn?  I cannot see how we can in any way end up in a position where we would be worse off so long as the rules are applied as set out in the schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister's reply to the specific example I gave that the value would be set by the development potential of the land?  We are talking about a situation where An Bord Pleanála have refused planning permission for something that had previously been granted permission by the local authority, and where it involved, <i>inter alia,</i> a change in zoning, a material contravention of the development plan from agricultural to commercial.  Can we say, for arguments sake, that the value of the land had increased tenfold per acre?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So do I, but I cannot see exactly how the Minister is doing it in the system.  If he can show me specifically I will sit down and listen.  Since I have not heard that may I pose a specific problem? I will give the Minister a concrete case and perhaps he will tell me how the new system of valuation would apply.  I would be most interested to hear, having described the hypothetical case in west county Dublin, the historical case which has got this legislation on the floor of the House &mdash; the XJS case in Killiney where a decision was refused ultimately by An Bord Pleanála.  When the arbitrator went to impose a valuation on that land for the developers who sought compensation &mdash; Deputy Gilmore has illustrated some of the details already and they are on the record of the House &mdash; they started off with the maximalist value, or a potential value, and then proceeded to reduce the real net value which would take the form of compensation by calculating the cost of betterment levies, the cost development levies, which a local authority would put on the site, and the real cost to the developer of development costs.  He said that if they got this land and had to develop it, they would have had to spend so much money to have roads built through the rock and they would have had to pay local authority levies of a certain order. <Col N="1882" /> All these things taken together and subtracted from the sum of £2.3 million would have given a net figure of £150,000. That is what happened and that is what we are objecting to.</P>
      <P>From my reading of this &mdash; and I am open to the observation that perhaps I am not reading it with the necessary professional clarity, which I do not purport to have as I am not a professional valuer &mdash; I do not see how antecedent value is basically any different from that current system to which we are opposed because it appears to be market value and not existing use value.

      <P>May I add a point to what Deputy Quinn has said which may be of assistance to the Minister and it may help to clarify the issue the Deputy has raised. Rule 3 (1) of the Third Schedule &mdash; to which Deputy Gilmore also referred &mdash; states:</P>
      <P>In assessing the possibilities, if any, for developing the land for the purposes of determining its antecedent value, regard shall be had only to such reasonable possibilities as, having regard to all material considerations, could be judged to have existed immediately prior to the relevant decision...</P>
      <P>In the context of the query raised by Deputy Quinn which arises directly under paragraph 1, and perhaps interlinking it with paragraph 3 of the First Schedule, I wonder if the Minister might be able to shed some light on it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The kernel is in Rule 3.  We are attempting to get over the difficulty raised by Deputy Quinn.  Without Rule 3 this does not work.  If it is read in conjunction with Rule 1 (a) and (b) one will get an indication of how we are trying to accommodate the minimalist view as distinct from the other.  That is the whole thrust of this Schedule and that is the intention of the Minister in that regard. The wording of Rule 3 seeks what Deputy Shatter said.</P>

      <P>I have deliberately not dealt at great length with this issue and I very much welcome the change we have in the Schedule.  I think the kernel of this matter is in Rule 3.  Deputy Gilmore had a point when referring to Rule 3.  He said the language is such that one cannot be sure that the problems Deputy Quinn has been teasing out are necessarily resolved. One cannot be sure that they are resolved either.  On the assumption that we will ultimately adopt the new First Schedule which the Minister is proposing this afternoon, we will need to have a further look at Rule 3 and I would urge the Minister to have a further look at Rule 3 and, indeed to consult on Rule 3 to ensure that we get it right.  I appreciate that Rule 3 is the kernel when dealing with the problem Deputy Quinn outlined.  There is the problem of semantics with that which ultimately could end up in litigation and none of us will know until the Supreme Court pronounces on it exactly how it will apply.  We may need to come back to Rule 3 in the First Schedule on Report Stage.  I am saying that in order to be of assistance and in the hope of making progress today.  I think that the intent is right in Rule 3 but we may not be fully achieving that intent.  I am not sure there is a perfect wording that will enable us to achieve the intent and it may ultimately have to be left to the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was thrown off slightly.  I felt that Deputy Quinn was trying to give a status to the political process that should not have any effect on this, and I did not want it to be seen in that way.  I am quite satisfied that in any consultations the Deputy may have with the chartered surveyors or, indeed, with any other reputable firm of valuers or auctioneers they tell him that hypothetical political considerations in so far as the planning processes are concerned would not have any place in the professional valuation system, and should not.  The property arbitrator has to make the assessment for the compensation and he would have to do it with professional <Col N="1884" /> valuation standards.  Perhaps I got sidetracked by that and it was colouring my attitude.  The whole thrust of the Schedule is encapsulated in Rule 3, if one can live with Rule 3.  I respectfully suggest to Deputy Gilmore that to do what he suggested with it would be to dismantle the system of the minimalist approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have used a fair amount of floor time in relation to this matter.  I was not deliberately trying to make a party political point in relation to section 4's and decisions.  I have tried to put down an amendment to rule out the validity of planning permissions for the purposes of compensation where such planning permissions have been granted under section 4 and were a material contravention of the development plan.  The amendment was listed on the Order Paper but it has been ruled out of order, understandably; I do not particularly like the decision but I can accept the reason it was made.  I accept that Rule 3 is the gear box in terms of determining valuation and what Deputy Shatter has said is certainly true. This is a process of argument presented on both sides and the arbitrator is the judge.  In assessing the possibilities of any further development land for the purposes of determining its antecedment value, regard shall be had only to such reasonable possibility as, having regard to all material considerations, could be judged to have existed immediately prior to a relevant decision under Part IV of the Act.  If the reasonable possibility were a reality and a planning permission, albeit a section 4 granted material contravention planning permission, had been granted, then one is not even talking about possibilities but about something real.  That is my problem.  As my other amendment cannot be allowed, I was trying to get around that because this is where some of these abuses have occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point about the importance of Rule 3 if one is approaching this problem from the point of view of the value concept.  My amendment on Rules 3 and 4 was following on the earlier amendment that I had proposed in relation to the loss concept.</P>
      <P>Let me come back to this question of the antecedent value and how it is to be assessed as the market value of the land prior to the decisions being made.  Perhaps I could take up an analogy used by Deputy Quinn and explore it a little bit further.  In the XJS case, when that land was originally sold to the developer who wanted to develop it and who made the claim subsequently nobody, particularly the vendor, believed that it had any potential for development.  It subsequently turned out that it did have potential for development, notwithstanding decisions which were made by Dún Laoghaire Corporation, which refused the application in the first place, and subsequently by An Bord Pleanála who remarkably failed to state a non-compensatable reason in their reasons for refusing permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explore the matter a little bit further.  Perhaps the Minister could explain what is intended here in the light of a specific example.  In part of my constituency work has now started on the construction of the Bray-Shankill by-pass. South of the current main Dublin-Bray road in the Rathmichael-Old Conna area which moves up towards the Dublin mountains, the land is zoned either high amenity or on the basis of limiting development to one house to the acre.  In recent times the market value of the land in that area has been increasing quite substantially and this is due in large measure to the anticipation that some of that land may be re-zoned.  There is a <Col N="1886" /> belief that because the new road is being constructed at least some of that land will be re-zoned and that the present zoning of one house to the acre will be loosened up and there may well be a zoning of ten houses to the acre on some of that land.</P>
    <P>That belief will be confirmed by looking at the fact that in recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number of planning applications and applications for outline planning permission for the lands in that area.  The antecedent value of the land in that area is now much greater, if it is calculated on the market value of the land, because of the anticipation that there will be a loosening up of the zoning density for that area.  That view is also confirmed by a decision which was made to grant planning permission for a parcel of land which was associated with the acquisition of land for the by-pass and one of the conditions was that it would get planning permission for ten houses to the acre.</P>
    <P>Let us take that as a practical example. Somebody there applies for planning permission and is refused; they believe they have a claim for compensation and if under the Bill the claim for compensation is allowable, how is the antecedent value to be calculated?  It is quite clear, first, that the market value is much higher because of the anticipation of further development of the area, so that will increase it.  Second, it will be pointed out that there is comparable land in the vicinity for which planning permission was granted for ten houses to the acre and therefore that increases the antecedent value of the land for them.  Third, it would be pointed out that the developments which are taking place and the fact that there is to be a new motorway which will take people faster into the centre of the city increases the market value of the land.  That has to be taken into account. Fourth, it would very probably be taken into account that there is a DART service servicing the area.  There is a whole range of factors which will be taken into account in calculating the antecendent value so that the antecedent value in that case would be considerably greater than <Col N="1887" /> the Minister is saying and would be considerably greater than, for example, the level of development that the development plan for the area would currently allow.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the concerns being raised by Deputy Quinn about this, that calculating the antecedent value on that basis could, in circumstances like that, lead to an inflated value being calculated for the land concerned.  Arguably, were one to get that and there were to be a refusal afterwards and the value of the land reduced, one could actually widen the gap between the antecedent and the subsequent value and thereby increase the level of compensation that would actually be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The quick answer to that is that under the improved policy arrangement we are putting in place here, using the zoning mechanism we are talking about, there should be no reason that that should ever lead to a compensation claim.  We are inclined to treat these hypothetical cases as if the original system was still in place.  It is not.  When this becomes law we are into a totally different range of policy events.  I know we are talking about hypothetical cases, but I do not see any cases arising if the policy enunciated here is applied.  The Deputy is talking about what happened back in the old days.  The zoning provision should render no compensation payable in the circumstances of the hypothetical case the Deputy mentioned, except of course, if there were a down-zoning in the previous five years, but that is a particular circumstance.  Apart from that it does not arise from now on.  The arbitrator of course would have to make an assessment of all this but notional enhancement on the basis of future possibilities is hypothetical and I cannot see them influencing compensation cases. Such cases will not arise in future if the local authority are doing their job right. In talking about possible future claims, we must try to tear ourselves away from the old system that applied and consider <Col N="1888" /> the new arrangements under the Schedule and what happened previously in the area of non-compensation where there was only one circumstance.  We are talking about one circumstance only in down-zoning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will still be a problem with the wording of Rule 3, and I will refer to this on Report Stage. The instance which has been raised is based on an assumption that if you buy land which is zoned as amenity and you do not get permission to have it zoned as residential you will have to make a compensation claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that the new provision in the Bill provides that if zoning is the reason you have not got planning permission you are no longer in a position to make a compensation claim. Much of what was said a few moments ago in regard to zoning is correct.</P>
      <P>With regard to the material contravention provision, I think Deputy Quinn was saying that a person may have reasonable possibility of getting a material contravention.  Assuming you get a material contravention in a local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot if we have got this provision right.  If a local authority have, by a majority, voted that there is a material contravention, and this is overturned by An Bord Pleanála, the compensation claim cannot be triggered any <Col N="1889" /> more by virtue of the zoning <i>simpliciter</i> being used by An Bord Pleanála as the reason for not granting permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I am talking about up-zoning in the context of amenity to residential, industrial or whatever.  I appreciate what the Deputy said but I am not sure that the concern is missing that focus, that is, once it is not down-zoning a compensation claim cannot be triggered.  Once the trigger is not released we do not really have a major problem with antecedent values.</P>

      <P>Nobody in his right mind in 1981 or 1982 would have believed that it would have been possible for somebody to lodge a planning application for the piece of ground on Roche's Hill in Killiney, which became the subject of the first application, and end up being paid compensation for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not have happened if the administration had got it right at that time.  It is because of that case we now have this new scenario which will not allow that to take place in the first instance; the triggering mechanism is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the decision which gave rise to the compensation claim in the XJS case and the decision by An Bord Pleanála which gave rise to the award in the Dublin County Council case were both remarkable. It is stretching belief to believe it was purely coincidental that on two separate occasions an omission of that kind could have been made by An Bord Pleanála.  In addressing how compensation is going to be claimed we have to allow for the possibility that at some time in the future a claim will escape out of the net, however unlikely it may appear now, and we have to ensure that the rules which are laid down for calculating compensation are sufficiently tight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem we have here is that compensation will be the antecedent value minus the subsequent value.  A number of amendments have been put down to the Minister's proposal in this regard. My amendment &mdash; Deputy Shatter has proposed a similar amendment, albeit in a different form &mdash; proposes that the price of the land and public infrastructural works should be taken into account and that the antecedent value as a result of infrastructural works should not be increased.  When one is looking at the antecedent value on the basis of the market value there are circumstances <Col N="1891" /> where, notwithstanding anything else which may be in the Bill about zoning and so on, the market value of the land concerned may be inflated.  I gave an example of this.  I do not think it is adequate to state that issues like infrastructural works can be dealt with by way of the development levy.  We all know that the development levy a local authority may make in a planning application is very often the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála by the developers.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of this First Schedule are becoming clearer but there is still much in it which is not at all clear.  I appreciate that we are beginning to batter the Bill to death a little bit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot satisfy the Deputy because it is his stated objective not to have compensation in any circumstances. I am fighting a losing battle to try to convince the Deputy that I have endeavoured to bring about a situation where compensation will not be paid in any circumstances except, to put it in a colloquialism, in one place where there will be deliberate down-zoning from residential, commercial, etc., to virtually sterilising the land.  In such circumstances a person is, in justice, entitled to some compensation.  What I am trying to ensure is that in that extraordinarily limited circumstance there would be a method to evaluate how much a person should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Deputy says runs contrary to his original argument that no compensation should be paid.  I share his view that it should be a minimal amount and that is what we are trying to achieve in the Schedule.  However, the Deputy will have to take that at face value.  Of course this matter will be argued elsewhere but <Col N="1892" /> I am saying it is perfectly clear that when we remove the Deputy's thoughts on the original system and all the circumstances where one could seek compensation for many reasons, be they administrative omissions or otherwise, we will see that this will not be the case under the regime. Compensation may only be claimed in one very limited circumstance.  That is what I am trying to achieve.  The Deputy will have to take it in good faith that that is my intention and that that is all that may be achieved in that one circumstance where compensation may be claimed following downgrading.</P>

I am not sure if the question of the antecedent value has been answered.  I wish to be reassured by the Minister on that point. He has reassured me that it is his intention to minimise the amount of compensation that may be paid but this will depend on there being controls in place on the way the antecedent value is calculated. It still seems that the method of calculation the antecedent value will be wide open to interpretation when all kinds of factors may be taken into account.  Valuers, arbitrators and the courts may subsequently interpret these in a more generous fashion from the point of view of the applicant than we had intended.  It is all very well to say that <Col N="1893" /> this matter is going to be argued in a different forum at some stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We find ourselves in a difficult position in that there is a lack of clarity on the House's intentions.  I know what I would like, which is that compensation should only be paid in cases where a loss has accrued.  The Minister has implied that that is also his intention but that is not the way the Schedule reads to me.  I am concerned that the antecedent value may in fact turn out to be an enormous sum which will then be demolished following a decision to refuse planning permission when we will be back into the business of large compensation claims. That is a scenario we should try to avoid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Therefore no compensation should be paid. Unless a loss accrues no compensation should be paid.  The question was raised this morning whether compensation should be paid where there is down-zoning of land.  The Minister referred to this question himself.  In fairness, in cases where a person bought a parcel of land when it was zoned &ldquo;housing&rdquo; but which was later rezoned &ldquo;high amenity&rdquo; a loss would accrue but there may well be cases where a loss will not accrue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make the point that we are talking here about the payment of taxpayers' money.  If somebody has the good fortune to inherit property and then applies for planning permission but fails to get it no compensation should be paid as they have suffered no loss.  Quite frankly, I do not see why the taxpayer should be asked to pay them compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  I do not accept that a piece of land which I inherited from my grandfather 50 years ago for which I never paid a thing should be deemed worthless whereas the land owned by the man who lives next door to me for which he paid a certain amount of money should be deemed as having the value he paid for it.  That is not equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add to that point? My concern centres on the professionals who will sit down with well-paid hired intellectual guns to look at the legislation when enacted to see if it contains any loopholes.  If we look at the compensation cases we have been confronted with where the local authorities have been taken to the cleaners we will see that they have not been made by the ordinary citizen.  Let me refer first, before going on to deal with the central theme of my own amendment, to the intervention made by Deputy Gilmore.  It could happen &mdash; although I do not think this is his intent &mdash; that somebody inherits a piece of land which is subject to inheritance tax.  While he may have got the land free, he may be subject to the public sector pay constraints, he may have an overdraft and may have to raise money to pay the inheritance tax.  He is told and advised that the best way to pay the inheritance tax is to get planning permission on the land and to sell off part of it and use that money to pay the inheritance tax and hold the land himself.  He would be at no real cash gain and would avoid a cash loss.  If he is refused planning <Col N="1896" /> permission for a compensational reason, under the present legislation it seems totally inequitable to deny him compensation because not only would the inheritance not be a gift, it would be a liability and he would be rushing down to Teach Earlsfort &mdash; as it used to be &mdash; to offer them title because the land would not be of benefit, it would be a liability.</P>
      <P>There is a danger in the fundamental logic Deputy Gilmore is applying.  He is saying that the nature of ownership is specific to the person who owns it rather than to the property that is owned.  As I understand it in planning legislation it has always been that a planning permission attaches to the property irrespective of the personality of the owner.  For example, if somebody is pleading for special planning permission for a particular kind of development because of the circumstances of his family, say a wheelchair case, and they want to extend into the back garden because they need the ground floor accommodation for their concerns, the local authority, however reluctantly, would have to say that they could not grant that planning permission because they have to have regard to the nature of the property itself in abstract and in isolation from the nature of the individual ownership because the occupancy of ownership can change but the property, the piece of ground, is static. There is a danger in what Deputy Gilmore is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, without wishing to sound unnecessarily scholastic, I want to come back to Rule 3 of the Schedule.  When you take the whole Bill together &mdash; we are taking a number of the amendments together &mdash; and consider the Second Schedule and Third Schedule, you have clearly identified the areas where planning permission or refusal of permission will not be grounds for compensation.  I have no great problem with that.  The Minister may want to come back on this on Report Stage.  It is my concern that the people who will abuse this system if we do not get it 110 per cent right will be the professional developer-speculator. Because of the lists in the Second and <Col N="1897" /> Third Schedules, I do not think the problem of compensation will arise in those cases.  There may be the odd accident&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And it was overturned.  An intention to grant planning permission, a notice to grant planning permission, is the phrase used.  We are teasing this out. It is quite possible, given the complexity of this matter, that the answer is not encompassed in the four walls of this room, and I invite the Minister to explore <Col N="1898" /> it, but I am putting down a very serious marker.  It seems that under Rule 3 of the First Schedule a well placed developer with an eye on the main chance using the political complexion of any local authority &mdash; I am not necessarily referring to the party political complexion because frequently you get cross-party voting on some section 4s, let me say, lest anybody think I am having a cheap jibe at some party in any local authority &mdash; seeing a possibility, could go down a particular route knowing he would be in for compensation at the end of the day.  The suspicion most people have in relation to the XJS case is that it was never seriously intended to develop the land in the first instance but there was a possibility of getting a ball into the air that would go over the crossbar for the purposes of compensation. At that point the antecedent valuation system as proposed in Rule 3 of this Schedule would be based on the fact that the decision, albeit one subsequently overturned, established a ceiling value on that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it would. The Deputy is making a very interesting point.  I do not accept that the decision is quantifiable as a procedure in the antecedent value mechanism until such time as it has cleared the whole planning process under the 1963 Act, but to satisfy the Deputy I will refer to this on Report Stage.  I will take away the net question the Deputy is asking about that set of circumstances wherein somewhere during the planning process a notice of intention to grant a certain decision was conveyed.  The Deputy is afraid that that might be taken as a value notion in the antecedent value that would influence the arbitrator, whereas my understanding is that that could not affect the arbitrator's understanding of the antecedent value until it had cleared the whole legal process. If it did I would have to be very concerned about putting a mechanism in place that would kill that.  I will refer to this in my Report Stage contribution.  I get the point.</P>

Unless the Minister can satisfy me in relation to Rule 3 which relates to maximum hope development value on the one hand and existing use value on the other, which is really a rose by any other name, and his antecedent value is essentially the same thing, than I will be moving something along these lines.  For the purposes of progress I will withdraw the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>If it is intended to proceed on the basis of the reduction in value &mdash; as proposed in the Government amendment &mdash; then there are a number of things which have to be taken into account.  There are a series of amendments to Government amendment No. 60 tabled by myself and Deputy Shatter and I am proposing that the price of land should be taken into account in amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 60.  In amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 60 I am proposing that the question of the value of comparable land in the vicinity should not be taken into account because it may well inflate the antecedent value of the land.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I would like to comment on amendment No. 8 to amendment No. 60 which deals with financial loss and if I may, I will refer back to a point made by Deputy Quinn earlier.  The whole approach I have been advocating is that if somebody incurred a loss, for example, a person who inherits land, pays inheritance tax on it and then cannot develop it and is at the loss of the tax, that is precisely the type of situation that would be allowable under the concept of actual loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seeking your guidance, a Cheann Comhairle.  Taking the issue of whether the price paid for the land is going to be taken into account, I do not think the Minister responded to that point, and I made the point earlier that the most noted compensation circumstances which have arisen are cases where the price paid <Col N="1902" /> for the land was very low.  In the XJS case it was £40,000 as against the £150,000 which was eventually paid out in compensation. In the Red Rock case it was £15,000 and the total value of undertakings given by Dublin County Council was £800,000.  I would like clarification from the Minister as to what account is taken, if any, in determining the antecedent value, of the price originally paid for the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see circumstances where the arbitrator would not take any note of that at all.  If the land had been bought 30 or 40 years ago it would have no relevance to what he had to arbitrate on.  I think the Deputy would be much more accurate in referring to the price paid for comparable land, and this might be the way the arbitrator would do it.  I see it as being more appropriate, as I could see circumstances where he would not take account of the original price paid for land back in the last century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might be apposite to quote the famous saying by either George Bernard Shaw or Oscar Wilde &mdash; I can never remember which &mdash; when he castigated those people who knew the price of everything and the value of nothing.  The two things are actually quite different.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I thought it was Oscar Wilde, it has a slightly more leftist ring to it.  If the value of a property is £100,000 but somebody had bought it at a steal for let us say £20,000, there is another mechanism on behalf of the State that will come into play, capital gains tax, and that will deal with that particular matter. I can understand in part what Deputy Gilmore is getting at &mdash; Dublin Corporation had to pay out the £800,000 compensation and not the Revenue Commissioners who stepped into the breach and compensated for the balance between the two figures &mdash; but it is still a problem for the local authority.  The value would be what a willing buyer <Col N="1903" /> would offer to a willing seller in an unencumbered market notwithstanding what price the seller paid for the property and if he or she were subject to capital gains tax, that mechanism would come into play in parallel and separately.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to give potential claimants for compensation three months rather than six months in which to make their claim.  It is a deliberate attempt to raise the obstacle course.  It is self-explanatory and does not need a great deal of elaboration on my part.  If the Minister does not intend to accept it perhaps he can indicate in his reply how he arrived at the period of six months?</P>
      <P>The intent of my amendment quite clearly is to say to claimants that they have a fixed period of time, 90 days, to make a claim for compensation.  All it might mean is a letter from a solicitor or a properly authorised person simply stating that they are seeking compensation. One would not need a long, elaborate procedure to initiate the process and I think three months is more than sufficient time in most cases as I think you are only inviting compensation claims if you leave the door open for that length of time.</P>

      <P>The amendment would reduce the period for making compensation claims from six months to three months.  I would like to point out that the six month period specified in section 5 already represents a stricter provision than that obtaining under the 1963 Act, and that Act allowed in all cases for six months or such longer period as the Circuit Court might allow if it appeared to the court that there were reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and it would be just and reasonable to extend the period.  The courts have not hesitated to strike down hard and fast time limits where in the case before them they found these in conflict with natural justice.  The two-month time limit specified in section 82 of the 1963 Act has been impugned in that way.  I am reluctant to move away from the six-month time limit and I would ask the Deputy to accept it.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;10.  The applicant or any person having an interest in the land to which the application relates or any company which is a subsidiary of or is associated with the applicant is entered in the register maintained by any Local Authority for the purposes of section 6 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule relates to the reasons for refusal of planning permission which exclude compensation.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I raised a major problem which was clearly illustrated in the Grange Developments case.  That is the problem which confronts a local authority when a development company have already been granted planning permissions to build residential estates and that company, or its subsidiary or associated companies, have failed to comply with the planning conditions imposed by the local authority.  Dublin County Council have had this experience with the Brennan and McGowan group of companies. Major housing developments in the Tallaght area were undertaken and people bought houses on the assumption that basic landscaping would be carried out, roads would be completed and the basic essential infrastructure necessary to make life reasonable in a housing estate would be put in place.  There is the problem of a development company happily taking the cost of a house from a purchaser for the building company and the company failing then to complete the estate.  The local authority are forced to serve &ldquo;latest date&rdquo; notices and ultimately to bring proceedings under the 1976 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act in the High Court to force the development company to complete the estate.  The Brennan and McGowan group were not the only group with whom Dublin County Council had difficulty but a plethora of court cases were brought to force compliance with planning conditions. <Col N="1907" /> If a local authority are dealing with a building company who have a very poor or bad record of completing estates and if while they are taking that company to court to complete an estate the company seek planning permission from the authority to build another estate, the local authority cannot refuse to grant a planning permission saying they do not believe they will implement the conditions attached to that permission since they are already taking the building company to court to complete two or three other estates outstanding within that local authority area or because they know another local authority are already taking them to court.  Because of the various other companies associated with Grange Developments, we had the ludicrous situation where Dublin County Council were forced to pay out £2 million in compensation to a company who belonged to the most litigated group of companies in the entire country for failing to comply with planning permissions and conditions.</P>
    <P>We should have a provision within our planning legislation which would allow local authorities to refuse to grant planning permission in circumstances where a company have a clear record of failing to complete estates properly.  We have a duty to the general public and to the consumer not to allow local authorities to be put in a position where they have to grant permission to development companies whom they know will not comply with the conditions imposed.  It must also be said that there are many excellent companies who do not create these problems but we need to restrain the poor builders, who do not properly comply with planning conditions, from getting new permissions to build new estates until they complete properly developments for which they have already been given permission. I am somewhat constrained in dealing with this issue under this Bill, which deals generally with planning compensation.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have tabled is designed to ensure that where a development company have failed to complete <Col N="1908" /> an estate properly and as a result court proceedings have had to be brought against that company or a &ldquo;latest date&rdquo; notice has been served, the local authority can refuse to grant planning permission and will not be liable for compensation awards.  In order to make this effective I have provided a subsection which would require local authorities to maintain a register which would list the names of those development companies against whom they are currently proceeding. The general public would have access to such a register.  Presumably, as a matter of practice, the cross-checking mechanism could be put in place betwixt and between the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the Minister may say to me: this amendment is not correctly drafted.  I suspect he may also say to me that, if I want to achieve the general purpose I have just outlined, a somewhat different and more substantial approach would be required.  Because of the problems being experienced in urban areas throughout the length and breadth of the country I felt we should try and use this Bill as a vehicle to raise this problem at this stage.  If the Minister feels he cannot take this amendment on board I would encourage him to come back to us on Report Stage and tackle this problem.  I am very conscious that for another two or three years we will probably not be afforded another opportunity to introduce another planning Bill.  We have now the problem of the non-completion of housing estates, with developers responsible for failing to complete them at the same time seeking permission to build further housing estates.  This is a problem being experienced in many urban areas.</P>
    <P>Had I wanted to deal with all aspects of this problem there are some additional amendments I could have tabled which probably would have been ruled out of order on the basis that they went beyond the scope of the provisions of this Bill.  I am anxious that we confront this problem. As a member of Dublin County Council I have seen this problem very much at the coalface over a period of ten years <i>vis-à-vis</i> a variety of different <Col N="1909" /> building companies.  I know that a great deal of time and resources of Dublin County Council, a great deal of money has been spent in bringing cowboy developers through the courts to force them to comply with planning permissions.  There must be a way in which we can tackle this problem through legislative process which will allow local authorities deal with it in a more efficient and rational way.  It makes no sense that a developer with a bad building record, in completing housing estates, at the same time as he is seeking permission for a new housing development, is in litigation with a local authority for failure to comply with previous planning permissions and conditions. It is a very foolish system which allows new planning permissions to be granted to that developer for new housing estates.  It is a system which undermines the credibility of the planning process.  It is a system which provides no protection for the consumer, a person going out wanting to buy a house, in particular those most vulnerable, those in what I regard as the less expensive sector of the housing market, young married couples buying their first house who often find themselves going into housing estates poorly finished &mdash; when dealing with a developer of this nature &mdash; who do not themselves have the financial resources to take the developer to court and who, if the local authority were allowed to refuse planning permissions in such circumstances, would be given a great deal more protection within the housing market than they have at present, in that there would be a great deal more certainty that when one buys a house in a new estate that estate is likely to be completed properly.</P>
    <P>I have tabled this amendment in the context of the compensation provisions obtaining.  In responding I hope the Minister will be able to address this issue in the broad manner in which I have brought it to his attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 75 seem to relate as much to the general consideration of planning enforcement as to planning compensation.  They provide <Col N="1910" /> that planning permission may be refused, without compensation, for the reason that the person involved has been entered on a penal register by the planning authority. Persons would be entered on this register when they have breached certain planning requirements, particularly those relating to the completion of housing estates.  The establishment of a penal register of this kind by merely an administrative authority has obvious implications for natural justice, particularly in the area of personal rights.</P>
      <P>As the amendment stands, a person contravening certain planning requirements &mdash; over and above any penalties imposed by the courts &mdash; would have to suffer the stigma of entry in a penal register in addition to being debarred from access to planning compensation which would remain accesible to others.</P>
      <P>Second, the framework for planning decisions laid down under the provisions of section 26 of the 1963 Act would have to be widened to allow planning authorities to take account of the character of applicants and their previous relationship with the planning system.  At present planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are restricted, when dealing with planning applications, to considering the proper planning and development on the area of the authority, including the preservation and improvement of amenities thereof &mdash; that is in accordance with section 26 (1) of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>Planning considerations are regarded in law as considerations relating to the character of the use of the land.  Clearly the amendment would involve planning authorities in exceeding this accepted planning perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, the amendment, on its own terms, would be relatively ineffective in that it makes loose provision only for the possible ramifications of company circumstances. In a sense this whole proposal is premature until the question of connected persons, for the purposes of the Companies Act, is dealt with in the context of the Bill now in Special Committee. Planning is by no means the only <Col N="1911" /> area in which persons who have contravened the law may relaunch their fortunes under the identity of a new company.  It would be unrealistic to expect planning law to develop advanced counter measures in relation to this ahead of company and taxation law.</P>
    <P>The Deputy broadened his argument away from the simple compensation issue with which this Bill purports to deal.  He would seek to restrict a developer from obtaining planning permission for reasons of non-compliance with previous granted applications and the schedule attached thereto.</P>
    <P>That is really for another day.  I would respectfully suggest to the Deputy &mdash; to put it in a colloquialism &mdash; I am not really interested in perfecting a sin bin register at this time in so far as developers are concerned.  I do recognise the difficulties that have arisen in many planning authority jurisdictions concerning unfinished estates but it is for another day.  I recognise the difficulty which will have to be attended to but I do not think this Bill is the appropriate vehicle.  I would ask the Deputy to accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Shatter's amendment.  The Minister is right in one respect &mdash; the question of dealing with developers who fail to finish off housing estates is something that must be dealt with in a comprehensive way.  As I understand it, what Deputy Shatter is attempting to get at in this amendment is that, at the very least, a developer, or a company which is a subsidiary or associated company of a developer, who has failed to complete a housing estate would not benefit from planning compensation.  That is a very reasonable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand very clearly what motivated Deputy Shatter into tabling this amendment.  I recall as he does &mdash; we are both members of Dublin County Council &mdash; the scandal of Dublin County Council having to pay £2 million planning compensation to a developer whose associated companies had left estates all over County Dublin uncompleted, who had <Col N="1912" /> taken money from housebuyers under one set of conditions; in other words, that the estate would look as it was supposed to look on the brochure when they were selling houses on the estate, but which left them without roads having been completed, in some cases without essential services, landscaping, the development of open spaces, all of the normal amenities one expects to be provided in a housing estate.  All of these things were left uncompleted in many housing estates. Then Dublin County Council must fork out £2 million to the same people for refusal of planning permission in another case.  The remarkable irony is that the money handed out was money which could have been used by the same local authority to undo the damage these developers caused in the first place.  It is an obscenity to have money being paid out in that way where the developer has not completed the estates concerned. The Minister offered three reasons he cannot accept the amendment.  The Minister said it is against the principle of natural justice that developers who do not complete estates would be entered on a register and suggested that it is almost some kind of arbitrary decision by a local authority administration.  Of course, it does not work like that in practice.  As the Minister knows, the conditions on which the developer should complete the estate would be clearly set out in the planning permission.  A local authority will in the normal course of events issue a list of works to the developer which have to be completed by a certain date. Notices will be served on the developer concerned.  There is a lengthy procedure which local authorities go through month after month, serving notices, chasing developers, entering into discussions with them and trying to cajole them before they get to the stage of taking legal action.  The same would apply before they got to the stage of entering a developer on the register.</P>
    <P>One of the horrific problems in the case where a developer does not complete an estate is that very often by the time the local authority get around to taking him to court, he is gone and the company is <Col N="1913" /> liquidated.  I had a case recently where in a small development of eight houses a man had a heart attack and the ambulance spent 20 minutes going up and down the road trying to find the house, because the developer had not put a name plate on the estate.  The local authority concerned for three years have been trying to take that developer to court to get him to complete a whole range of works in that estate.</P>
    <P>I am sure that problems between associated companies are being considered under the Companies Bill, but the principle that Deputy Shatter has proposed in this amendment is sound.  I agree that the question of the completion of estates should be addressed soon in this House by new legislation but as a very bottom line we should provide in this Bill to ensure that people who do not complete estates do not get compensation when they are refused planning permission for some other development.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It would at least be a stick.  If a developer knows he cannot claim compensation if he does not finish a previous estate, it might bring him to his senses.  All of us who served on councils or corporations know there is nothing more frustrating than having people complain about the absence of lights, footpaths and so on, expecting the county council to provide the facilities and, of course, the council will not take over until the builder has <Col N="1914" /> finished what he is supposed to do.  This leads to all kinds of difficulties for the residents.  Builders who flout the regulations and leave people who have paid a lot of money for houses literally and metaphorically in the dark should be deterred by at least refusing compensation to them.  I take the Minister's point that this Bill does not directly concern unfinished estates but I hope he will introduce an amendment in a section of some other Bill to make sure rogue developers do not get away scot free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of Deputy Shatter's amendment I would invite the Minister to consider some amendments which he might care to introduce on Report Stage.  Would it satisfy the Minister if a local authority, having tried to get a developer to complete an estate, were to register the refusal with the District Court and have the court serve notice on the developer that it was the intention of the local authority to go to court and get an affirmation of the court that certain conditions of the planning permission had not been complied with?  In this way that would no longer be an arbitrary decision of the administration but would be a decision of the court.  Such a formula might deal with the Minister's objection in relation to the question of natural justice. The court could also determine the value of the completion of the planning conditions and allow the local authority to subtract from any compensation awarded to that developer, the money needed to complete the planning conditions. I am assuming that the Companies Bill will deal with all the problems of directors and associated directors, for the purposes of this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not rejected the principle of what Deputy Shatter is saying and he has said in response to Deputy Browne that this Bill does not deal with the question of unfinished estates.  It deals, however, with the question of compensation and both Deputies Shatter and Gilmore from their experience in Dublin County Council have referred specifically to the apparent contradictory nonsense of a local authority being forced to pay <Col N="1915" /> money by way of compensation to a developer who in another guise has failed to fulfil conditions of a planning permission elsewhere.  The Minister may have all sorts of reasons for his attitude but I am sure he would want to be the last person to try to explain in a by-election in West County Dublin that may or may not arise in the near future, that the reason he is standing in the middle of an unfinished estate and the reason the developer of that estate is getting compensation somewhere else in County Dublin from the same county council, has to do with the technicalities.  I would love to hear the Minister's well known capabilities in terms of verbal articulation explaining to an irate citizen why, when he had the opportunity to do something about this, the Minister spectacularly failed to do it.</P>

      <P>I thought Deputy Gilmore did admirably against the combined forces of the largest Opposition party and the Minister.  It is ironic, therefore, that I support the thrust of Deputy Shatter's amendment.  I represent the constituency <Col N="1916" /> of South-West Dublin and it is extraordinary that West County Dublin has seen the city developing westwards over the past 20 years.  A small number of developers have been involved in most of that building and, no matter how badly or inadequately they completed any given development, they were still given additional tenders by the local authority or additional planning permission by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>There were several references today to the Grange Development case where the partners, Brennan and McGowan, did exceptionally well without building a single house.  They developed a number of estates in my constituency, including 1,590 houses at Kilnamanagh.  Thirteen years later the Kilnamanagh Residents' Association, the community and public representatives in the area are still trying to have that estate completed.  The very same councillors, who voted to observe the law of the land after the High Court action to give those people £1.9 million in compensation, cannot provide basic footpaths, name-plates, adequate lighting and other facilities.  That is only one example.  I do not know to what area Deputy Gilmore is referring &mdash; he is extremely fortunate if there is only one such enclave of eight houses in his constituency. However, I do not think that is what he meant when he referred to Dún Laoghaire.  There are several vast developments in West County Dublin where even the most basic infrastructure work required by the terms of the planning application has not been completed. As a result families have been dislocated from the inner city and other areas; they live in west Dublin and have to cross fields without footpaths.  There are dirt tracks for roads, inadequate public lighting and no footpaths.  This problem should be tackled without raising the hackles of any Deputy about the more fundamental question with which this Bill is concerned.  I am very glad to join my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, in supporting Deputy Shatter's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the other Deputies who contributed to this debate. <Col N="1917" /> The Minister is right because I cannot, in the context of this Bill, tackle this issue in full.  I wish I could have dealt with it more fully but if I had tabled additional amendments to deal with other aspects of the Bill they would have been ruled out of order, as was the case in one of Deputy Quinn's later amendments.</P>
      <P>I rarely use the word but I want to mention the scandal of a company being given £2 million when its associate company had been responsible for flagrantly breaching planning permission and conditions in major estates built in County Dublin.  Deputy Rabbitte gave illustrations in his own constituency which has been most seriously affected.  He mentioned Kilnamanagh and the Aylesbury estate is another example.</P>
      <P>I do not share the Minister's reservations about a planning sin bin.  The general public are entitled to a sin bin so that when they see an elaborate advertisement in the newspaper about a wonderful development which a company intend to establish in an area, listing the great landscaping and recreational facilities which will be provided, they will know if the advertisement is credible and will have something to test it against.  If the local authorities have a register which lists unreliable building companies, those which made promises in the past, reneged on them and are now the subject of court proceedings by the local authorities, the young married couple investing money which very often they can ill afford will have something by which to judge the advertisement.  They will know the reliable building companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right in relation to the problem of associated companies popping up and developers who seem to form a new company for every development they undertake.  It is a problem and that is why the amendment refers to not simply subsidiary companies but to the concept of associated companies.  I will not pretend that this amendment is a perfect solution to the problem but it is a start in tackling it.  I have been a member of this House for about nine years and we have never had legislation before this House which was a vehicle allowing us to raise <Col N="1918" /> this issue.  Even if we provide only a partial solution to the problem by taking this amendment on board, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this would be a penal register.  It should be a penal register because if young couples are asked to lay out £30,000, £35,000 or £40,000 and raise a mortgage of £30,000 to 35,000 for its purchase &mdash; which they will be paying back for 20 to 25 years &mdash; they are entitled to know that in addition to the house they will have the basic facilities of roads, footpaths, lighting and open space areas properly landscaped in the estate.  That is part of what they are paying for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of what they hoped they would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a penal register which tells them that they cannot rely on a particular company to provide what they promised, so be it.  The very presence of such a register will resolve part of this problem because building companies will not want to be on the register.  They will realise that such a register will diminish the possibility of them selling houses on another estate.  The register will go further, it will give local authorities discretion to refuse to grant planning permission in such circumstances without a compensation claim arising.  I do not have worries or reservations about the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to an aspect of the amendment, which is very simple.  If you do not want to be on the register as sinning against the planning code you can get yourself off it. Subsection (5) provides that when you comply with planning conditions and permission you can have your name taken off the register.  It is not a question of a development company, even by accident, failing to comply with some planning condition and finding themselves arbitrarily on the register.  It will not happen that way because, in practice, the local authorities go through a series of procedures to get development companies to comply with planning conditions.  A person on the register has a simple remedy if he <Col N="1919" /> or she wants to obtain a new planning permission or ensure before they are put into the planning sin-bin, if they are building somewhere else that being on the register will not prevent people purchasing houses built in another estate. All such a person has to do is comply with the original planning conditions.  If that is done he or she will be removed from the register.  They simply have to comply with an undertaking given to the local authority pursuant to the development that person got involved in and which resulted in many people paying large sums of money for houses.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides a method for people to get off the register.  The Minister said that generally speaking the criteria local authorities must have regard to in determining whether a planning application should be granted or not are the planning and development criteria. He said that a local authority should not make a judgment on the character of an applicant.  He also raised the issue of a company.  This is not so much about the general character of the applicant. Nobody will be interested whether the building company has directors who are interested in horse racing, or who gamble, play cards, go on long summer holidays, smoke, support a football team or a political party.  That is not what this is about.  This is about allowing a local authority to take planning considerations into account.</P>
    <P>When a planning application is made to a local authority, that authority, in determining whether to grant planning permission will be allowed, look at the planning record of the applicant.  It is not the character but the planning record of the applicant.  The local authority will be able to say that if they grant the planning permission, subject to conditions, from previous developments the company carried out are they in a position to <i>prima facie</i> assume that the company will do their best to carry out the development properly and fulfil the conditions imposed?  If the local authority can see from their records that in the housing estates built by the company there have <Col N="1920" /> been no problems, or there have been minor problems which were resolved, the matter would end there and permission would be granted.</P>
    <P>However, if their records show that the company, or an associate, was before the High Court in regard to four different planning problems in estates in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, or elsewhere, the local authority will be able to say that if they refuse planning permission they will not be subject to compensation.  The local authority should be able to say &mdash; I cannot put this into the Bill in the way I would like &mdash; that they would not grant any permission.  I agree with the Minister that to tackle the problem properly there is a need for additional legislation, but this is a step towards tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>I have used the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the context of this provision.  Under the relevant statutory provisions a &ldquo;person&rdquo; is both an individual and a company.  I use the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; because it covers both the company and an individual.  My amendment goes on to talk about subsidiary and associate companies.  I invite the Minister to accept my amendment so that we will be tackling the issue of compensation.  Will the Minister say when he intends to bring legislation before the House to deal with the other aspects of the problem?  Since I was first elected to Dublin County Council in 1979, that problem has been highlighted on a regular basis but there has not been any Government action.  We have never had legislation to provide protection for the consumer and to allow local authorities refuse planning permission to development companies whose records are abysmal and who should not be given new permissions until they complete estates that are long since outstanding for completion.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to accept my amendment.  If the Minister wants to give it further thought with a view to taking it on board in principle, if he says he will bring forward his own amendment to deal with the technicalities he feels should be addressed, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.  In doing so, I will be expecting the Minister to introduce his <Col N="1921" /> amendment on Report Stage.  However, if the Minister tells me that this is not an issue, even in the context of compensation, that he will address and that he will not give it consideration between now and Report Stage, I will have to tell him that I will be formally putting the amendment.</P>

      <P>Most of the contributions on this point were not relevant to the provisions of the Bill.  I would like to feel that collectively we condemn the rogue developers who deliberately contrive to escape their responsibilities by not finishing developments in accordance with the schedule of conditions they receive attached to their planning permissions.  I support that point of view.  What we are talking about is compensation legislation. Under the new policy we are not contemplating any compensation claims. Since this morning we have been throwing our minds back to the position that existed prior to these provisions coming before the House.  I am not contemplating any compensation claims and, consequently, the matter is irrelevant. However, it does not take away from the good thought that we should collectively condemn what has become a feature of the construction landscape in certain parts of the country.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that this problem is not confined to the Dublin area although all the contributions referred to unfinished estates in Dublin city and county.  This is a problem in the provinces and Deputy Browne was correct in saying that.  We thought we had all this dealt with a few years ago when £3 million was put up by the Government to settle this matter.  Unfortunately, the necessary guidelines or legislation were not put in place at that time to cover any future difficulties that might arise.</P>

    <P>I am not suggesting that the local authorities are negligent in the way they do their business but they might take a leaf out of the notebooks of other small authorities on how they deal with this matter. In one case that I am aware of, the local <Col N="1922" /> authority succeeded.  In giving the planning permission for the development of an estate the local authority took a lien on part of the property, or had a bond put in place, or insisted on money being put up front by the developer.  The developers the Deputies have referred to are well-heeled, whether they got their money through the ordinary process of commercial activity in the building or selling of houses or through the compensatory process that existed heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have the facility under the existing guidelines which I insisted on a couple of years ago and which applied admirably under the 1963 Act, to enable them to seek this arrangement in advance of the granting of planning permission so that they have the lien subsequently if a developer does not act in accordance with the schedule of conditions attached to the planning permission.  That has worked successfully for a number of smaller authorities and it may be that some of the larger players should do something similar.  I do not want to be put off-side on this.  It appears that the view is that by my inactivity, or by not accepting Deputy Shatter's amendment, I am trying to protect the rogue developer who deliberately sets out not to commit himself properly to the satisfactory completion of the works in the schedule attached to his planning permission. Such a person needs to be dealt with.  We should warn young buyers of houses that some contractors do not complete their developments.  Certainly, they are reminded of that fact in reports of court actions.</P>

      <P>Some from my own part of the country have done very well here in the city.  I acknowledge the serious concern that has been expressed by some Deputies that the enforcement they advocate should be made more effective. I would like to assure the House that it is a matter I would like to be involved with.  I cannot give a categoric assurance that this will be legislation in the immediate future.  I have many items of legislation in the Department at present which I am anxious to introduce.  This Bill was one of them and there are a few others outstanding and there are some new items of legislation attached to the environmental area.  Consequently there is no categorical assurance that we will suddenly arrive with this legislation.  In the meantime we could get a better and more effective administration of the existing planning provisions as outlined in the 1963 Act, if the legislation to deal with this matter is left to a later stage, with the promise that it will be put together as quickly as we can manage.  I ask Deputies to accept that the matter cannot be meaningfully dealt with under this Bill.  I know that Deputy Shatter passionately agrees with the position he has put forward and would like to see it taken on board at this time.  I recognise his anxiety in the matter and concede the point to him that there is a need to do something effective whether it is through the administrative structures already in existence or through new legislation.  I <Col N="1924" /> accept all of that but I do not wish him, if possible, to pursue the matter in the amendment in this legislation because it seems not to be compatible with it in the way it was framed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify a matter.  Can the Minister assume a scenario of development company that applies for planning permission to build 250 houses on an area of land, zoned residential, in County Dublin.  All the services are in place, there is no problem about roads or about sewer capacity; the only problem is they want planning permission.  They seek planning permission. The local authority feel they would normally have to give it because everything is in place and there is no particular reason that they should not give it because the zoning is right.  They will have to impose conditions: the conditions will require road building, landscaping, etc. and the local authority say: &ldquo;We have a problem.  We have imposed three similar conditions elsewhere on this company and we have them in court. The only basis on which we can refuse a permission is because we do not believe they will carry out the development&rdquo;.  Let us presume that the Bill becomes law tonight &mdash; which will not be the case &mdash; what is the position if the local authority say: &ldquo;We will refuse this permission because you have a lousy record and we will not give you permission until such time as you complete the other three estates for which proceedings are being initiated in the High Court.  The position, as I understand it, under this Bill is that the local authority will not be able to do that but if they refuse the permission, without having any reason beyond that stated, they will be liable to pay compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's argument is not watertight.  The permission attaches to the land not to the person seeking it. That being the case I could put to you the scenario that I could circumvent all this by asking Deputy Owen or her sister to make application.  She gets the planning permission in all good faith and gives <Col N="1925" /> it to her neighbour, her partner or whoever. I do not want that to happen. Because of that I will seek, if I can, to tighten the structures under the 1963 Act. I will give the undertaking that it is an agreed item for legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have so much experience of this, unfortunately, in County Dublin and, with respect, I do not think there is any other county that has housing estates of the same size built in their own county with the result that a developer might start an estate, and as has happened over the last ten years, because of the rise and fall of values, etc. they move off and seek planning permission elsewhere not because they do not want to finish the housing estates &mdash; they would if they could &mdash; but they feel more money is to be made by moving to a more desirable area to build.  The existing structures give the local authorities no power whatsoever to blacklist these developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have many conditions that could be put into planning permissions. At our council meeting on Monday last the manager told Dublin county councillors that, albeit that there is a condition in every planning permission that levies have to be paid &mdash; bonds have to be entered into &mdash; and an amount of money must be paid before commencement of work on the site, he cannot implement that provision because if he does no development will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell him how to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The councillors who were at that meeting will bear me out on this point.  He said if we wanted to force a developer to pay the levy before he did his work he would have to get a motion of the council to allow him to put that in because otherwise the whole procedure would be null and void and he would not be able to have it implemented.  The Minister said he would advise young couples when they go to buy a house.  Not <Col N="1926" /> many go to the trouble or even know how to find out exactly what is happening in the locality when they go to buy a house. The main reason they choose a house is that it is the house they can afford and it is the one for which they can obtain a loan.  There is no way in which they are privy to information about the record of that builder without getting into their car or into a bus and literally driving around and asking who built that estate, and whether it is properly finished.  The Minister could not suggest that young couples should do that.  This amendment would allow a young couple who have, say, £35,000 to spend on a house to make a choice between buying that £35,000 house because that builder has a good record or that £35,000 house and find that that builder has a lousy record.  I do not think the Minister is being realistic in saying that couples should make themselves aware of the builder's record.  If I walk into the planning department and ask if builder A is good or if he has left estates unfinished I would be told at the counter to get lost.  There is no way the planning department could give that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three things.  I will not prolong the argument.  I do not accept the point of view that young couples do not drive around.  They go around to various estates to see what the value is, the design, the landscaping, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not.  The other point is that it would require a decision or a resolution of a local authority for a condition to be in place.  That is not a great deal to ask the elected representatives who do most of the baying about this at their meetings.  One will hear about unfinished estates at every council meeting. It is not much to ask the county <Col N="1927" /> manager to put up a resolution or a motion to include a certain item that would make it more difficult for the rogue developer to get away with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to give the House an instance of how it has been got over in another locality with a far-seeing local authority.  Planning permission is given for the development of an estate but it is given on a phased basis on, say, the first 40 houses.  The services, the lighting, footpaths and roads must be completed to the satisfaction of the inspecting officer before the next phase is allowed to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not offering these as solutions.  I am just saying that certain administrative things have been put in place in other authorities that have worked.  I know there are enormous estates but I would suggest that it might be much easier to apply some of these arrangements on a much larger estate than it would be on a 100 house estate like the ones I am referring to.  Apart altogether from that, I am not slipping away from it.  I accept what has been suggested by Deputy Shatter, that we need to address this, and it will be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the amendment before us, which I support, I would invite the Minister, when he has time off, to look at one particular superb episode of &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; where the fantastic secretary of the Department gave the quintessential reason as to why one can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in six reasonable ways. It is a gem of its kind.  The Minister, with a certain degree of west of Ireland blas wrote the script, gave it a particular twist&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1928" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were writing that script I would not be in here, but I know what the Deputy is getting at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that the idea is a marvellous one but it is badly written is one way of saying it.  To say that the idea is a terrific one but it is inappropriate at this time, is another way of saying it.  To say that the idea is one with which I personally fully agree but that regrettably it contravenes natural justice is a third way.  There are a few others &mdash; I am paraphrasing in a very pedestrian way the eloquence with which they were written in that particular television series.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister really has a very simple choice at this stage, to accept the amendment or not.  It is clear from what the spokesman for the environment for Fine Gael, Deputy Shatter, said that the amendment will be pressed and it is clear that it will have the support of the other two parties, and that is contrary to the spirit in which we have been trying to do our business today.  We have made a lot of progress although we are only at section 6.  If this amendment is accepted by the Minister in its present form or if, as invited by Deputy Shatter, the Minister were to signal that he will come back on Report Stage with a tidied up wording of the same amendment, all it would achieve at this stage is simply to say that there is a blacklist, a register of people who have failed to complete planning permissions in respect of housing estates, and only housing estates; that is all it confines itself to; and that in so far as such developers might ever wish to seek compensation from a local authority &mdash; and the grounds of compensation clearly are now going to be totally constrained if this legislation has the successful impact that we seek for it &mdash; then the occasions on which such persons will in fact be formally denied compensation will, by the Ministers own estimation, be very low.  What, therefore, is the legislative benefit of such a provision?  It has a two-fold benefit.  It has the marvellous benefit of being a deterrent and an encouragement. It is both a carrot and a stick, the carrot being that if they do not get <Col N="1929" /> their act together they will forfeit the possibility of claiming compensation at some stage in the future for a compensatable reason &mdash; and the Deputies in question, all four of whom have spoken here recently, are members of a local authority that has been the victim of precisely the situation that has been described.  It will give to the public at large, albeit in a rather incomplete manner, some degree of warning in respect of the performance of certain types of builders in relation to the construction of housing estates.  To that extent it is a bit like a small trader taking on a new customer and wanting to get some indication of how this person performs from the point of view of credit and having reference to the Gazette or some of the companies that provide such credit ratings on people.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what is impeding the Minister from accepting that as it stands except the argument of natural justice which has some validity.  I have offered a mechanism that may deal with that but I am not a constitutional lawyer and that may not be adequate.  I accept, however, that there may be other technical drafting measures that need to be tidied up.  I do not accept &mdash; and we have done this far too often &mdash; that because there is better legislation down the road that will do all of these things and more besides that we should wait for that.  Our record in this House in terms of legislation across the board is not as good as any of us would like it to be and there are, regrettably, other sets of reasons for that over which we have little control, for example, the logjam of the parliamentary draftsmen. In this instance one would not solve the problem to which Deputy Shatter and Deputy Owen and the two Workers' Party Deputies have referred, but one would certainly put down a very clear marker and it could be a very effective marker if it were done in the manner of this amendment, without any amendment, without any subsequent change, or in a manner similar to this amendment with whatever polishing and refinement the people in the Department feel they need to do.  I can see that in a matter of <Col N="1930" /> this nature they may want to get some legal advice apart from the legal advice of Deputy Shatter.  I readily accept that that may be so.  However, notwithstanding the skill with which &ldquo;Sir Humphrey&rdquo; evasions have been offered to the House, the Minister's bona fides in this matter are at test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat that request to the Minister because there are tens of thousands of people in this city alone, especially in Dublin county &mdash; the Minister has said it is a provincial problem as well &mdash; who would wish us to avail of the opportunity that is now presented in dealing with this Bill.  Legislation promised down the road is all very well but, as Deputy Quinn has said, it may take us a very long time to get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to underline what Deputy Owen has said, without repeating it.  We do operate the bond system and the phased contract basis, but they are not adequate, having regard to the scale of the developments that we are talking about.  I take it from what the Minister has said that the Mayo local authority are more successful in dealing with Mayo builders than are Dublin local authorities, but the problem remains and it is so vast and on such a scale in Dublin county that this opportunity should be availed of.  It is not that Deputies have come into this House today to take advantage of the opportunity to put on the record the names of certain developers.  It is not that at all.  It is the track records of the developers that have been mentioned, and one developer, one group of companies, has been mentioned here this evening.  I have given the incidence of a 1,590 house estate in my own constituency, Deputy Shatter gave another in my constituency of 1,400 houses, where they have walked off the job.  Yet we have, with another hand in Dublin County Council, paid out this vast <Col N="1931" /> amount in compensation.  For example, in my constituency this developer has walked off and left houses unfinished. They are not the only developer.  There is a number of developers in west Dublin and in the Dublin South-West constituency that have left houses half finished, partially finished, almost finished. One can say that is due to market forces, that the bottom fell out of the market and so on and that there is nothing that can be done about that.  These houses, however, are a source of intolerable nuisance to the people living in the estate.  The dangerous buildings legislation is not adequate or suitable to deal with them.  The lives of people in these estates are blighted, the quality of life is blighted by the track record of some of these developers.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity here to deal with this.  What I am talking about is a situation where a particular developer puts in a new planning application to, for example, Dublin County Council, for a planning development in another part of the county.  Meanwhile he has a number of unfinished houses in other parts of the city.  They may very well be more low demand areas of Dublin county or Dublin city as compared to the more prestigious part of the city that they are now seeking planning permission in respect of, but it is appalling that ordinary people who have paid their mortgage through building societies and other financial institutions are left in this predicament.  They simply do not understand why we should be according new planning permission to such a developer when these houses are left in that state in unfinished estates.  It is Deputy Shatter's amendment and he may want to press it before 7 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to me the Minister said that an unscrupulous developer might get planning permission in somebody else's name.  So be it if he builds the estate but he will be on the register and will not sell his houses in those circumstances.  Therefore, there would be no incentive for him to behave <Col N="1932" /> in that way.  That ties up that problem. In the context of the Minister's reply, I will be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned last night I had commented in a general way on our attitude to the environment over the years.  We have been almost schizophrenic in our attitude to environmental matters.  During the sixties and seventies we marketed Ireland as an industrial centre while at the same time we did not take the necessary decisions to provide industries with the kind of back up facilities they required.  I referred to an industry which had set up in Ireland and had indicated they would have a product which could not be disposed of in domestic tipheads.  Even now, nine years later, we have not provided suitable dumping facilities for that industry. For many years that industry had to <Col N="1933" /> get trucks to bring its waste over the Border and dump it there.  In recent years the British said they did not want any more of this waste to be dumped in the North as they had enough waste of their own to dispose of and an alternative arrangement has had to be made with Dublin County Council for this firm.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the irony in regard to some of our environmental policies. We spend a certain percentage of our GNP &mdash; I do not believe we spend enough &mdash; and many voluntary agencies spend a great deal of money, sending experts to the Third World where serious efforts are being made to ensure that deforestation is stopped and to encourage the people there to plant trees again.  When I was in Tanzania a few years ago a young man of about 25 years of age told me, as we looked out on what appeared to be endless desert, he could remember that area being covered with trees when he was a child.  It is ironic that we are helping Third World countries to replant, provide a clean water supply and cut down on the use of chemical fertilisers in the agricultural sector while at the same time we have not been minding our own backyard. Maybe we should bring back some of those experts and get them to sit down with the Minister for the Environment and his officials to teach them some of the lessons we are trying to teach people in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the incredible decisions which have been taken by this Government and the Government who were in power from 1987 to 1989.  I cannot blame the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, for any of the decisions taken between 1987 and 1989.  I know that both at council level and in the Dáil she was one of the most vociferous critics of the Government's decision to abolish An Foras Forbartha in 1987.  At a time when the rest of the world was beginning to wake up to the need to respect and protect our natural environment and ensure that any industrial and agricultural policies did not further erode our natural environment, our Government abolished the one independent agency to which members of the public, members of local <Col N="1934" /> authorities and business people could go for independent advice, knowing they would not be getting the advice of somebody who had a vested interest.  The Government gave all sorts of reasons for abolishing this agency and said they were setting up an environmental unit within the Department.  That unit was not as independent as An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>The Minister has again promised to set up an environment protection agency. However, this is still only a promise; Deputy Shatter's Bill is the only one we have.  We do not yet have the Bill the Government keep promising.  We are endeavouring, probably at great expense and certainly with great delay, to get the Government to introduce a Bill which will establish an environment protection agency.  There would have been no need for Deputy Shatter's Bill if An Foras Forbartha had not been abolished.  We might have had to extend the role and powers of An Foras Forbartha but we would not have had to go to the expense, both in terms of time and money, of introducing a new Bill.  The abolition of An Foras Forbartha must go down as one of the most foolish mistakes of the 1987-89 Administration.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some areas of the environment in which I have had a particular interest for many years.  The time has gone when we could regard our seas and rivers as one large septic tank.  Other countries gradually came to believe that what they were doing for too long created dead seas and rivers, but we still continue to blithely believe we can create septic tanks out of our rivers and seas. We still have the scandal of raw sewage being dumped into the sea and in some instances there are very short sea outfalls which means that the raw sewage is being washed back onto the shore.  I think Deputy Bruton referred to the major investment in the new Ringsend primary sewage treatment plant.  The Minister said in his glossy publication that he intends to introduce secondary treatment for sewage as quickly as possible.  We should be past the stage of introducing secondary treatment plants; we should be providing tertiary facilities.  We should go <Col N="1935" /> straight from primary to tertiary facilities as quickly as possible to ensure that our seas are no longer treated as dumping grounds.</P>
    <P>If one walks along the beach in Portmarnock in my constituency very often one will see a long line of rubbish, condoms and toilet paper.  I am sorry to have to say this but if it is not spelt out the engineers seem to say you are not telling the truth.  I have walked the beach and seen this rubbish.  When I said the rubbish must be coming from the Howth or Ringsend outfall I was told it was coming from ships who empty their bilges and throw their rubbish overboard when passing our shores.  They must have been very active ships judging by the number of condoms, etc., I saw on the beach.  I do not believe for one minute that the raw sewage and rubbish on the beaches in north County Dublin come from the ships which pass our shores.  The outfall from Howth and Ringsend seems to come up on the beaches in north County Dublin.  These are some of the finest beaches in our country and I will continue to press for the removal of all untreated outfall on our beaches.  That is the direction in which we should be moving.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the issue of smog and the Minister's big glossy publication, which, no doubt, formed part of the expenditure on PR by the Department of the Environment which we heard about yesterday.  I would liken the production of this booklet to asking a good student to do a project.  It is full of lovely statements and catchy expressions, what they would call in America mom-and-apple-pie statements.  It contains very few hard facts.  The Minister has banned the sale of bituminous coal from next October and is going to make £3 million available in an effort to help those who cannot afford to buy smokeless fuel.  We do not know who will qualify for this grant, when it will be paid and if it will only be made available to those people living in areas which are the subject of smoke control area orders and who received grants to convert their systems to enable them burn smokeless fuel.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter and the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, deserve credit for recognising the need for an environment protection agency.  I also wish to congratulate the Minister of State on her appointment as this is the first time I have had an opportunity to speak on a Bill on the environment.  Deputy Owen and I also have something in common in that we are members of Dublin County Council.  As chairman of Ogra Fianna Fáil, I proposed in February of last year the setting up of an environment protection agency at the launching of an environmental campaign in Power's Hotel. Therefore, the need for this agency is appreciated but like other speakers on this side of the House I would have to conclude that it would be more prudent to await the introduction of the Bill to set up the agency proposed by the Minister of State.  I think she has adopted the right approach and achieved the right balance. That Bill must be seen in the context of the environmental action programme <Col N="1937" /> launched recently by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn.  I have to say that it is one of the most comprehensive action plans ever produced by any Government.  It covers all aspects, including the health area.  I have said in the past that we do not place enough emphasis on the health area.  In that context I ask the Minister of State to look again at some of the language in the Bill to ensure that a stronger emphasis is placed on the health area.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Action Programme covers the area of health, the quality of water, and air, our marine environment, agriculture, forestry, fish farming, heritage, waste recycling, thatched cottages and the ozone layer.  Last night Deputy Bruton referred to the need for an extension of the programme to cover the nuclear sector.  I share this view and ask the Minister of State to consider doing this.  One of the strengths of the Bill is that it attempts to co-ordinate resources and refers to the need for co-operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen referred to mistakes made in the past.  One of the mistakes the last Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour made is that they seemed to approach this matter sector by sector.  The growing threat to humanity, vegetation, animal life, air and water presents us in the last decade of the second millennium with a tremendous challenge.  It is a well known fact that the developed world is the main culprit when it comes to trans-frontier pollution caused by chemicals, airborne effluents, fossil fuel combustion, nuclear plant emissions and other discharges and resulting in the majority of industrial catastrophies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As new industries develop, existing industries expand and new technology is introduced the environment will increasingly be placed at risk and hazards for human health will arise.  History shows that industrial innovation is rarely matched in speed with corresponding protections for the community and the environment.  We cannot turn back the clock and unlearn the science and technology of the last 20th century.  In any <Col N="1938" /> event it is not science but its disordered application that spawned the pollution problems that face us.  As I said, this matter was approached sector by sector in the past.  For example, when it came to the question of animal disease eradication it was turned into a veterinary problem with little emphasis placed on the environmental and public health aspects.  In relation to physical planning and development, concern was centred on land use and not on the health and welfare of people.  Energy policy centred on fuel costs and tended to ignore the social and environmental aspects.</P>
    <P>That was the position in the past but I have to say that it has now changed.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, said recently:</P>
    <P>There is a wide acceptance that environmental considerations can no longer be seen merely as external constraints on industry, agriculture or energy production.  Instead, the awareness of the environmental requirements must be fully built into the development of policies for these sectors.</P>
    <P>That is the key.  As I said, we must continue to place emphasis on the health aspect.</P>
    <P>The environment is the primary determinant of the state of general health of any population.  One can only produce quality food in a pure environment.  The aesthetic and healthful state of our land, air and water underpins our tourism industry and promotes the health of our citizens and indeed visitors.</P>
    <P>The question of specialisation and segregation must also be tackled.  The interconnectedness, inter-relationship and inter-dependency of the activities of Government Departments, industry, agriculture and other social partners mean that real progress can only be secured through co-operation, through inter-sectoral collaboration and through integration of the several areas of knowledge and expertise.  This has been well demonstrated by the many Irish technology industries which compete in a challenging business environment where <Col N="1939" /> new successful products can only be produced with the co-ordinated input of a wide range of technological expertise. The management structures in this environment are characterised by a flattened out pyramid where communication and co-operation across several areas of expertise is the order of the day.  Specialisation without collaboration can be destructive.  This happened in the past.  It is both wasteful and downright irresponsible. The strength of the Bill and the ten-year action plan I referred to is that they place emphasis on co-operation and co-ordination.  When I read through the contents of the action plan and the contents of the Minister of State's Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a few moments.  At the outset I complimented my constituency colleague for producing a Bill but I have to say there is a number of flaws in it.  I will cover as many of them as I can.  Tonight I am talking about the need to await publication of the Minister of State's Bill and to see it in the light of this action programme.  I said earlier that we need to look at the nuclear industry and to include it in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We do that in the Bill. The Minister of State will not be doing so in hers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is still in a position to do so.  The water pollution Bill has been referred to during the course of the debate and rightly so. It has to be pointed out that our water is still among the cleanest in Europe. However, the number of fish kills is still too high.  These fish kills have damaged <Col N="1940" /> our reputation and image abroad when it comes to tourists and environmental quality generally.</P>
      <P>In agriculture, due to the grant aid to farmers the progress of combating the pollution problem is beginning to work and is paying dividends.  The Government must be commended for that.  The local authorities have stepped up their enforcement provision under the Water Pollution Act.  Many of them still lack resources, but this is tackled in the Bill and in the Environment Action Programme. We have moved on immeasurably in farming; we have moved into intensive farming and industry also has become more intensive.  Haymaking has been replaced by silage.  I spent part of my young life in rural Ireland.  When one goes back one sees that the change is immense.  I am talking about parts of the west and of east Galway.  I am fortunate to have lived through a period when I could draw clean, fresh drinking water from a well, which I think is still there &mdash; my brother tells me it is still there &mdash; and I have walked through fields where one could smell new-mown hay.  I am not from a farming background, but those memories are very strongly implanted in my mind, and those experiences I will never forget.</P>

      <P>There are more fertilisers, more chemicals.  There are changes for <Col N="1941" /> the worse in some cases, but that is progress. Any of us who lived through that period will have a greater appreciation of the environment and of our natural resources.</P>
      <P>I hope that in putting a Bill together we will take on board many of our experiences and the need to protect that environment and at the same time take account of advances in technology.  There are obviously far greater quantities of waste water on our farmlands.  Silage effluent has been established as the greatest polluter in that it is 200 times more polluting than sewage.  We must have properly managed systems for disposal of agricultural waste.</P>
      <P>The environmental protection agency, as envisaged by the Minister, will be a full, independent and dynamic body with the necessary expertise and sophisticated equipment to enable them carry out their functions.  The Minister has produced a comprehensive Bill with very clearly defined functions.  They have been spelled out: control and regulation of developments likely to pose a major risk to the quality of our environment, general monitoring of the environment quality, support, back-up and advisory services and environmental research. They will have a full-time executive board and an advisory council.  We must accept there are many established environmental groups who have been very helpful in their involvement in this environmental debate, such as Greenpeace, Earthwatch and others.  I hope bodies such as these will be involved in the advisory council.  The Minister said they will be established in 1990.  If Deputy Shatter or Deputy Owen have reservations, let me say the key of their establishment is that this will be a developmental process.  There is a great degree of flexibility in that the Minister is willing to develop the whole agency as they progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that local authorities will continue to have their own separate responsibilities, but there will be a linkage between the agency and the local authority system.  Again, the success of this Bill is that it brings in co-operation <Col N="1942" /> between the existing structures.  It does not implant new structures on top of what we have which would cause tremendous chaos and confusion.  The agency can play an important role in the operation of the environmental impact assessment procedure, in particular with regard to water, air and soil.  They will be responsible for general monitoring of the environmental quality of the water.  They will maintain data bases and as we are now in the computer age this is important. I presume we will have data bases provided in places such as libraries, etc. The staffing will come from the environmental research unit in An Foras Forbartha. The Minister referred to Eolas.  I support the view that we should use staff and expertise from Eolas who are engaged in the provision of environmental services.</P>
    <P>The agency will act as a national focal point for the new European environmental agency who will be concerned initially with the collection of data.  I repeat that it is important to see this agency in the context of a ten year environmental action plan.  Sir, you can remind me of the time because I would like to share it with the Minister, Deputy Flynn.</P>

      <P>There is tremendous pressure coming from industry, agriculture and growth in our urban areas. This agency will command the confidence of the public.  It will ensure the application of standards on a uniform basis. Industry and agriculture can co-exist with a clean environment if we have this high level of expertise and equipment and can separate the role of the local authority from the agency and everybody understands what is happening and who is in charge.</P>
      <P>I like the suggestion that they will have an in-built appeal procedure.  If a Merrell Dow type incident occurred again I understand the agency could act as a type of arbitrator, both sides could put their case and debate could take place in a very healthy atmosphere.</P>
      <P>There are many other things I would like to say but I do not want to take time from the Minister.  Again, I thank Deputy Shatter, my constituency colleague, for bringing this Bill to the attention of the House.  However, looking at its structures and how he operates I have to say there will be total confusion if this were to be brought into place.  I suggest that the Minister's Bill in the context of the Environment Action Programme is the correct solution.  We have made a tremendous beginning.  We have the plans in place and over the next ten years I foresee a very healthy environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Opposition's conversion to real concern for the environment. I hope that commitment to the environment will continue to future years.  It has not always been there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My personal interest, and the interest of the Minister responsible for environmental protection, is not in doubt, but the Opposition have pleaded that the Bill should be accepted if not on its merits at least to save the Government some embarrassment because legislation setting up an environment protection agency <Col N="1944" /> is not in place.  I assure the House that the Government are not in the least interested in any face saving exercise in so far as protection of the environment is concerned.  The Government are in the action business in that regard.  Recent developments, such as the publication of the Environment Action Programme and the follow-up with special budgetary provisions in respect of the environment are examples of the Government's commitment involving a substantial allocation of funds to our most serious environmental problems.</P>
    <P>The action programme also provides for an impressive legislative programme on the environment, much of which is at an advanced stage.  In particular, there is a commitment to introduce the Government's Environment Protection Agency Bill in this session.  There have been many statements from the other side of the House that the Government Bill will not be introduced this year.  That is not so, and I hope they will have the good grace to acknowledge their error when we introduce the Bill this session.  We will have it in action and the agency in operation this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When will it be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Opposition speakers have been criticising the environment action programme and I must respond, even though time is limited. The action programme is the culmination of my personal interest and endeavours in environmental matters.  I have done more than any previous Minister for the Environment since I assumed office. Many of the proposals were initiated in previous years in the context of budgetary or legislative measures and have now been strengthened and amalgamated into one comprehensive and workable plan. The programme is, therefore, no overnight wonder or public relations exercise as the Opposition are attempting to make out.  The plan provides for the expenditure of about £1,000 million over the next ten years, starting with an additional <Col N="1945" /> £20 million in excess of ordinary expenditure, which has been made available for the current financial year.  The money is only part of the programme.  Equally, if not more important, are the commitments to other kinds of action to remedy problems and preserve, improve and enhance the environment.  I can assure the House that the programme of action will be implemented.  Some of the proposals are of a long-term nature but others are already under way.  The progress in implementing the measures will be reported on periodically so that the public will know this is an action programme, that we mean business, and we are stressing that the action is taking place now.</P>
      <P>I now want to turn to the provisions of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  Deputy Shatter attempts to suggest that only minor differences of approach exist between the Government proposals and the Bill and that they could be teased out on Committee Stage.  I am glad to recognise that there are differences, but his suggestions show a clear lack of appreciation and understanding of the proposed functions of the Government agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not discover the functions of the Government agency until a month after the Bill was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's proposal to give the agency a licensing function in respect of specific developments is of major importance and will enable the agency to take effective action to prevent pollution from development which poses the greatest threat to the environment.  A fully integrated coherent and consistent approach in the licensing system is being adopted and this can only be achieved through the introduction of new and significant legislation.  The Government Bill will be making specific provision for an integrated licence instead of the system of separate licences and permits for air, water and waste as at present.  This approach has already been welcomed by industry and developers and by environmental groups <Col N="1946" /> because of the streamlining of existing procedures.</P>
      <P>The assessment of applications for integrated licences for complex developments will require special expertise and this expertise will be provided by the proposed agency.  This fundamental difference between the Government's proposals and the Bill before the House is not something which can be teased out on Committee Stage or through the adoption of a few amendments thrown in here and there or by shifting around sections of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  The reason is that Deputy Shatter's Bill is fundamentally flawed in so many respects that it would be completely unworkable no matter what amendments were made on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the attitude adopted by the Opposition to Government comments on the Bill.  They have been objecting to any specific references to the problems with the Bill and at the same time stating that the Government have given no coherent reasons for not accepting it.  It is difficult to satisfy them.  I have already indicated a major problem in relation to what is omitted from the Bill so far as Government proposals are concerned and I will refer briefly to some of the problems we have with what is included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal problems of this Bill is that it does not take account of existing legislation.  There is no attempt to co-ordinate the provisions of this Bill with the provisions of the Air Pollution Act or the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act.  The Bill proposes to establish a new organisation with significant powers which will be set down on top of existing bodies.  The agency will duplicate existing functions and powers of these bodies and yet the Bill does not clarify where the roles of the different organisations are to start and finish.  Let me give another example, there is provision for the agency to establish and publish national criteria for water and air quality and for discharge standards where applicable.  I cannot see how this differs from quality standards and emission <Col N="1947" /> limits in existing legislation.  What happens if conflicting standards are introduced under both sets of legislation?  Who will ensure that this cannot happen?</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to prosecutions.  The environment commissioner is being given extensive prosecution powers if &ldquo;he deems it appropriate&rdquo; or &ldquo;if, in his opinion, proceedings are warranted&rdquo;.  If we accept this, we will end up with a system where any existing Authority's or State body's prosecuting powers can be over-ridden on the opinion of the environment commissioner.  It makes no provision for what may be happening between a local authority and a polluting development.  There may be a programme of investment by a developer to remedy a source of pollution which had been agreed with the local authority but now, the environment commissioner can institute proceedings.  What are developers to make of such a situation?  They do not know and they will not know if an agreement with their local authority or any other State body is of any use or consequence.  They will feel they need to negotiate with both the local authority and the environment commissioner. They may consider it necessary to go to the commissioner before they undertake development because of the possible implications of future prosecutions.</P>
    <P>In addition to the elements of confusion and duplication there is the distinct danger that the overlap of responsibilities would also have the effect of facilitating, if not actively encouraging, the passing of responsibilities from the existing authorities to the agency.  Such a system would be very frustrating for environmentalists and developers alike.</P>
    <P>To be effective an environment protection agency must have teeth with comprehensive, primary and direct control functions from the earliest concept and design stages in the case of development which poses the greatest threat to the environment.  The environment will ultimately suffer if the agency is not able to act in its own right until it is obvious that a particular authority had failed in its duties and irreversible damage had <Col N="1948" /> resulted &mdash; a case of closing the stable door after the event.</P>
    <P>The sweeping but haphazard and disparate range of functions proposed for the commissioner display an inadequate lack of understanding of existing controls to prevent a deterioration in environmental quality.  The references to the environmental impact assessment procedures and the proposed agency role is a typical example of the failure to understand the basic principles of the system.  Apart from the obvious confusion between environmental impact statements and environmental impact assessments, the Bill fails to deal with the obvious conflicts of interest which would arise if the agency was to carry out all the functions proposed for it in this area.  I refer, of course, to giving it functions to prepare environmental impact statements, not assessments, as in the Bill and also carrying out assessments of environmental impact statements.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of an Oireachtas joint committee on the Environment, the primary function of which would be the supervision of the operations of the agency even to the extent of functions in relation to the appointment of the environment commissioner, members of the environmental council and the numbers and terms of reference of staff, which says a lot for the independence of the agency.</P>

      <P>In attempting to set out the function of the agency, the Bill fails to give any clearly defined criteria which could be interpreted and implemented by any commissioner or environmental council or staff of the agency, no matter how highly qualified they may be.  There are pious aspirations and meaningless phrases such as &ldquo;the intrinsic values of eco-systems&rdquo; and &ldquo;the values of individuals and groups&rdquo;.  Phrases such as &ldquo;the need for future generations&rdquo;, &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; and &ldquo;pressures on the environment&rdquo; are useless statements to any pollution control authority faced with the harsh reality of complex modern developments with the potential for seriously affecting the quality of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the challenging situations faced by enforcement authorities it is essential that legislative criteria take account of modern scientific principles and strategies for eliminating or minimising pollution. Any improvement to the existing control regime must have strong and direct regulatory powers with well defined procedures for integration with existing arrangements.  The Bill fails miserly to provide for this.  It contains no <Col N="1950" /> clear guidelines as to where the responsibilities of the agency would begin or end and under what circumstances the commissioner could take action.  It would be impossible for such an agency to operate unless it had limitless resources if, as is proposed in the Bill, it has to monitor the day to day operations of all existing authorities on every aspect of the environment.</P>
    <P>I have been able to touch on only a few of the problems relating to this Bill.  I regret that it is nothing more than just a political exercise and an attempt to embarrass the Government during the European Presidency when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am absolutely confounded by the contribution made by the Minister.  I am astounded that the Minister for the Environment has not read this Bill on the environment protection agency.  This is evident by the speech he has placed on the record of the House.  He is not aware of the contents of the Bill, the powers contained within it and the methods of appointment.  It is shocking that a Minister with his responsibilities could deliver such a speech.  It is reflection on him, the Government and his party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with the environment with his head in the sand and he is totally unaware of the problems.  This is evident by his reluctance to have an environment committee of this House established.  He has put on record his objection to such a committee because he is obviously afraid of his fellow Deputies deciding on various aspects of the environment.  He is unaware of the procedures under which the environment commissioner would be appointed.  The same procedure is proposed in this Bill as exists in relation to the appointment of the ombudsman.  Of course we know very well the attitude of this Government to the appointment of the Ombudsman and his independence. Obviously that is why the Government find this Bill totally abhorrent.  They cannot accept the total independence of <Col N="1952" /> the agency proposed by Deputy Shatter. This is very unfortunate because until we have a completely independent environmental protection agency we will not have free protection of the environment. The Minister states that general policy issues will be directed by the Minister for the Environment.  While the Minister has some input into the agency it will not be totally independent.  That is not good for the environment.</P>
      <P>It is extremely unfortunate that the Minister has adopted such a small-minded parochial attitude.  He sees this as an attempt by Deputy Shatter to embarrass him and his Department.  To adopt such a miserable attitude is despicable and deplorable instead of commending the Deputy on the excellent work he has done without the back up of a Department and the resources which the Minister has available.  Despite his back up, the Minister has not yet managed to publish a Bill on the protection of the environment.  This House must condemn the Minister for his attitude.  The arguments put forward by him should not convince anyone to vote with him against this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a very important Bill which has the support of organisations throughout the country, including environmentalists, farming organisations and people involved in industry and in fish farming. The amount of support this Bill has commanded is quite extraordinary and the Minister has shown how totally out of touch he is with what is happening on the ground and with the reaction of the community at large to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Last week the Government published an environment action programme in which they stated that by the year 2000 they will spend £300 million on improving the standard of drinking water.  This amount is miserable when it is considered that between 1980 and 1989 over £760 million was spent by the previous Government on similar projects.  When one takes inflation into account, the figure of £300 million is very much less than the amount spent in the past decade. It is eye-wash and camouflage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> There are problems in the area of aquaculture. The Department of the Marine have not the resources to act quickly in relation to the many applications they have received and there is much confusion. The Government state that they will improve the monitoring arrangements and that mandatory codes of practice are being put in place.  I am not aware of anything being put in place.</P>
    <P>The Government have done nothing except react to specific Directives issued by the EC.  In order to placate the Commission they are putting something on paper that they will be able to go to Europe and say they have a programme for action.  We all know that &ldquo;flip all&rdquo; is being done in any of the Departments which pertain to the environment.  All we have is print and verbosity from the Minister but no action of any substance, whereas we in Fine Gael have introduced a positive, constructive Bill.  It is up to this House to acknowledge the merits of its provisions and give it a Second Reading.  I hope all Members will join with us here this evening and not adopt the small-minded, negative attitude that has just been displayed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Minister's proposals, they constitute a totally watereddown version of ours.  In accordance with the various press releases of the Minister and his Minister of State I understand the Government agency would play no role in complying with EC environmental directives.  Indeed, radiological safety will not be dealt with at all by the proposed environment protection agency whereas we have specific provision in this Bill in regard to the Nuclear Energy Board.  That is something we, as a nation, must monitor very closely.</P>
    <P>I understand also that the proposed Government agency will have no right of access to departmental documentation relating to the environment and will not be free to investigate the manner in which Government Departments and local authorities deal with environmental matters. This means that the proposed Government agency will have no teeth and will merely constitute a watered-down version of our proposal.  For <Col N="1954" /> example, the Government agency will have no power to serve or control orders.</P>
    <P>We must be very sceptical about the manner in which the Minister spoke in the House this evening.  He spoke of the fact that this Bill did not take into account existing legislation dealing with the environment. This Bill very specifically takes into consideration existing legislation in relation to the environment.  For example, in relation to the Air Pollution Bill we know there are no guidelines laid down for local authorities with regard to what criteria they would adopt.  We know that, for example, Cork County Council had to go to Germany to decide what criteria they should adopt in issuing licences under the Air Pollution Act. That begs the question, what is the Minister talking about?  He is talking about legislation that does not meet a need. He is talking about his Department not having in place uniform criteria to be applied across the country.  It is left to the discretion of each local authority to decide what criteria they want to adopt.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to share my time with two other Members and, with that in view, I shall conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling on Deputy Garland.  Deputy Garland will appreciate that he and Deputy Byrne have until 8.13 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly no doubt that our environment urgently requires protection on the part of our Government.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House by citing a long litany of the many existing environmental problems which require action.  To do so, would take until midnight.  In passing, I might mention the latest problem we have encountered, particularly in the Dublin area, the excessive levels of aluminium in the water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that the first step to be taken to address these issues seriously would be the formation of an environmental protection body of some kind. Whether it be called the environmental protection agency, as proposed by the <Col N="1955" /> Government, supported by Deputy Shatter, or the environmental management agency, as Deputy Quinn prefers to call it, is not important.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Bill in any detail I should say that I will be supporting its Second Reading.  In so doing I might stress that I am not entirely happy with the Bill for reasons which I will state later.  However, imperfections can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  There is involved here an important matter of principle, that is the right of an Opposition party to introduce legislation, a right which I wholeheartedly support.  There is no monopoly of virtue on the Government side of the House.  I have been saddened by the attitude of the Minister of State in this matter which is purely and simply playing politics with the environment.</P>
    <P>If the House fails to grant this Bill a Second Reading &mdash; which I suspect will be the case, bearing in mind the mathematical voting patterns of the House &mdash; I have little doubt that the Government Bill, whenever introduced, will be very similar.  I must stress that this matter is one of extreme urgency and that the Minister's attitude will delay the establishment of the agency by some months at least.</P>
    <P>Before giving the Bill detailed consideration I must respond to some contributions already to this debate.  Deputy Shatter referred to the problems of unemployment and emigration and very serious they are too.  On this important subject he said:</P>
    <P>We must have industrial growth while at the same time ensuring effective environmental protection and development.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The concept of sustainable development is given statutory recognition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter wants to have his cake and eat it.  It must be said that we must not have growth if it conflicts with the necessary protection of the environment. The planet's precious resources of fossil fuels must not be consumed frivolously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> Again, Deputy Shatter said:</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the desirability of integrating environmental considerations in all sectors of the economy and the community so that they automatically form part of sectoral planning and decision-making at all levels.</P>
    <P>That is putting the cart before the horse. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, say that the economy must be managed in line with environmental needs.</P>
    <P>I might refer to Deputy Gilmore's thoughtful, well-researched contribution, and to his side-swipe when he said:</P>
    <P>We risk the debate on the environment and the environment becoming dominated by environmental fundamentalists who reject economic growth and who in some cases espouse a philosophy which is anti-human.</P>
    <P>I might state categorically that the Green Party are not opposed to economic growth providing it is sustainable. Deputy Gilmore also accused us of being anti-human, which would be indeed a very bizarre policy for a political party. That is just not true of the Green Party. The fact that we have a progressive animal rights policy does not mean we are anti-human.  Deputy Gilmore referred to the necessity to continue the production of pharmaceutical products in Ireland. This is a clear reference to the Green Party stance on the Merrell Dow issue. We make no apology for opposing the siting of this plant at Killeagh, which contrasts with the attitude of Deputy Gilmore's party colleague, Deputy Sherlock, who was very supportive of that Merrell Dow proposition.</P>
    <P>Having read Deputy Shatter's Bill in some detail I find myself broadly supportive of its thrust.  Certainly, some agency must be established very quickly. Should certain amendments to this Bill be accepted then the Bill should be adopted by the House rather than waste <Col N="1957" /> any more time awaiting the parliamentary draftsmen's production of a Government Bill for the establishment of an independent agency.</P>
    <P>There are three main requirements for any such agency &mdash; independence from vested interests, full public access to all information held by the agency relating to the actual or potential environmental impact of any development, whether that be a plant, process, product, construction or whatever and, of course, adequate legal powers to investigate, to suspend operations and to prosecute.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, sections 24 and 25 of the Bill require amendment.  It is absolutely essential that there be complete freedom of access to environmental information on the part of the public.  The agency must be allocated staff and a structure appropriate to its totally independent status.  The Green Party contend it is essential that such an agency does not carry out environmental impact studies but rather should lay down guidelines on how such studies should be undertaken, which should be in accordance with the highest professional standards by independent consultants contracted by any body intending to carry out any development, whether it be the ESB, Bord na Móna, local authorities, companies or private individuals.  Again, this Bill would require amendment in this respect.</P>
    <P>The fines stipulated in the Bill should be index-linked to the prevailing rate of inflation.  It is essential that companies be compelled by law to have yearly audits compiled of the waste they produce. Additionally, an integral part of the Bill should deal with the establishment of a sub-agency to research and implement waste reduction at source.  In many cases toxic substances and practices within industry creating hazardous toxic waste can be substituted.  It is not only desirable but essential that we strive to eliminate the generation of toxic and hazardous waste rather than simply controlling what we are already producing and shall continue to produce.  The idea of a national incinerator is totally unacceptable and we in the Green Party totally oppose this suggestion.  Until there is a safe way to <Col N="1958" /> dispose of this waste we must store the water we produce from essential processes such as X-rays.  An incinerator would be unsafe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter should consider the possibility of including hazard assessments in his Bill in addition to the environmental impact assessments.  These assessments would project the potential environmental impact of an accident.  Of course, the environmental protection agency would have to ensure that the hazard assessment would be to an adequate standard and provide the backup to deal with an accident.  Should a hazard assessment show that the danger would be too great, the development should not take place.</P>
    <P>The environment commissioner should report directly to the Oireachtas by way of an annual report, or from time to time as he deems necessary or if requested by the Oireachtas in certain circumstances. We should avoid setting up the agency with the sort of accountability which governed the functions of An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>I support the Second Reading of the Bill because it goes some way down the road towards the type of independent agency this country so urgently requires. I stress the need for the items I have raised to be included in this Bill as they will only serve to enhance its effectiveness.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned about many environment issues but I will address the social, economic, aesthetic and cultural aspects of the environment.  Dublin was a beautiful city but the Department of the Environment, aided and abetted by <Col N="1959" /> the local authorities have implemented more measures to destroy the physical and cultural environment of the city than anyone else.  The environment protection agency proposed in the Bill would have to have the authority to protect the environment from various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>What sort of pollution affects the learning capacity of young working class children? In west County Dublin, for example, 50 per cent of children going to second level education have serious problems with reading and writing.  Is the cause the same form of pollution that affects the inner city and children from urban working class backgrounds so that they cannot gain access to third level education?  Is it the smog or the lead petrol fumes which is causing this educational immobility or is it the policy pursued by the Department of Education under successive Governments that is causing the problem?  Perhaps the Department of the Environment are the cause?</P>
    <P>What sort of environment does the Department of the Environment create? The Department have allowed the building of flat complexes in this city which are so environmentally disagreeable that even homeless people will not live in them.  Families whose financial resources are inadequate are herded into these complexes.  We are rightly concerned about preserving and enhancing our physical environment.  There is nothing as relaxing as a game of golf in a pleasant unpolluted setting or a sail in unpolluted waters or a horse back ride in unpolluted countryside, but none of these pursuits is open to the 388 tenants in Oliver Bond Flats or to the 392 tenants in Dolphin House &mdash; two of the largest flat complexes in Dublin city.  Will the environment protection agency prosecute those responsible for the criminal neglect of the environment of these people?  These people do not even have the most basic community facilities and because 75 per cent of them are relying solely on social welfare they are not in a position to pursue any leisure pursuits. <Col N="1960" /> Are we to have a two-tiered environment as we have a two-tiered health system, a two-tiered education system and a two-tiered society?</P>
    <P>The physical character of Dublin city is or has been destroyed in parts.  Clanbrassil Street and Cork Street lie in ruins. They have been progressively destroyed over the past 40 years because road engineers have earmarked them for road widening.  What authority should have the right to impose unspeakable dereliction on communities without having even an obligation while awaiting funding to complete road works, to at least grass in the sites or carry out temporary landscaping to enhance the environment? Why can local authorities walk away from the destruction leaving behind vulnerable and demoralised communities surrounded by weeds, rubbish and rat infested sites?  I agree that there should be penalties to bring Government Departments and local authorities to heel.</P>
    <P>Many former Protestant churches have been abandoned but they are of tremendous historical, architectural and amenity value and they form an important element in the visual character of the inner city of Dublin.  These buildings have been focal points in many street schemes in the older parts of the city.  The environment protection agency working with the local authorities and the Diocesan Council of the Dublin Diocese should ensure the survival of the many churches that dot the Dublin landscape, churches like St. Catherine's in Thomas Street, and St. Audeon's and St. Werburgh's in our inner city.  Far too many churches have been almost abandoned to the vandals. Criminal neglect by our State agencies has allowed these churches to deteriorate.  It is a crime that a city as ancient as Dublin can abandon its architectural and cultural heritage in the form of churches to the vandals.  It is not alarmist to say that six former Protestant churches, historic buildings, have been destroyed in Dublin's inner city.  It would be a crime to allow this to continue and <Col N="1961" /> an environment protection agency should have a role in protecting the old Protestant churches as a feature of the city.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this debate.  I will speak on the environmental programme put together by the Minister of State.  So far as the role of the local authorities in relation to the proposed environment protection agency is concerned, there is support among local authorities for the agency.  The local authorities will welcome the establishment of this agency. They will welcome its establishment because local authorities require an agency which is capable of undertaking research and supplying them with advice in relation to environmental issues.  They also require advice in relation to the standards to be attained and the methods of achieving such standards.  Galway County Council, of which I am a member, have been confronted in recent years with a number of matters arising from aquaculture development.  In some cases planning permission had to be considered within the statutory period of two months but no State agency were able to supply the scientific information which the council required.  In respect of one planning application the county manager had to send council staff to Scotland to secure the necessary minimum information. Therefore, it is obvious to the House that an agency is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to see the environment protection agency responsible for interpreting complex EC legislation and Directives with a view to their adaptation to the Irish context.  They could, for example, supply training courses and seminars for staff involved in the implementation of environmental legislation. They could establish and maintain a library of scientific literature and operate a computerised data bank with access <Col N="1962" /> to the information available in scientific institutions throughout the world.</P>
    <P>One of the areas mentioned in this debate is water and the water laboratory. The agency could give advice to local authorities with regard to the equipment, staffing and functions of their water laboratory. They could function to achieve uniformity of standards in this area and they could supply the laboratory service which local authorities may need on an occasional basis in respect of some matters outside the scope of the regional laboratories.</P>
    <P>There should be a close link between the function of dealing with planning applications and the function of dealing with the consequential emission licences, water or air.  For example, developers should not be faced with the difficulty of dealing with two agencies, one in respect of planning permission and another in respect of licences.  There could be difficulty and confusion from the point of view of developers and local authorities.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister mentioned the one-stop shop in the programme is important and relevant as it worked very well in the past and I hope it will also work well in the future.</P>
    <P>There may be an impression that local authorities grant planning permissions rather easily but that is certainly not true with regard to my own local authority. That is evident from the Goodman project which was dealt with for a long time by the local authority and An Bord Pleanála and which had 14 planning conditions attached which the developers said were too strict.  It is good that local authorities are so careful with the applications coming before them.  Local authorities have had to deal with complex planning applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical areas and intensive agricultural activity has often given rise to problems.  I have already mentioned aquaculture and there is also concern in regard to afforestation and mining, especially in the west.</P>
    <P>It is important to have an agency which <Col N="1963" /> will have the necessary expertise to deal with problems.  Local authorities would not be able to provide expertise on their own and I appeal to the Minister to try to provide extra resources for them. When the resources are as scarce as they have been over the past decade, local authorities often have to provide finances for environmental functions at the expense of other services.  I hope the Minister will look at that area.  The question of pollution involves a number of local authorities and there have been disputes between authorities as to who is responsible.</P>
    <P>I was appointed to a committee on science and technology in the Council of Europe last May and I was very glad that one of the first reports undertaken by them was on the diminution of the ozone layer.  Our committee investigated the use of CFCs and I was glad they brought in a recommendation that since the majority of CFCs were produced and exported from the member countries, a labelling system should be introduced for products that did not contain CFCS.  I proposed an amendment in this regard when I sat on the committee.</P>
    <P>National parliaments have a role to play and they could contribute more fully to environment protection.  I hope we will do so by implementing the environment protection agency.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Bill before the House to set up an environment protection agency is the only substantial environmental legislation now before the House and it is the only environment protection legislation that is likely to be before this House for quite some time. The Government do not have a Bill and they will not have a Bill for many months to come.  They do not have a Bill in their legislative programme for this session.  In fact, only three days after they introduced this document &mdash; An Environment Action Programme &mdash; this decade long, <Col N="1964" /> £1 billion programme, an exercise in crystal ball gazing if ever I saw one, the Minister, flanked by his Ministers of State, circulated his legislative programme for this session.  At the very back of the programme it says &ldquo;Environmental legislation, Bills which will be introduced in the session beginning 30 January 1990&rdquo;.  The third one is the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990.  We will not see that Bill this session.</P>

The latest forecast from the Minister of State is that there will be a Bill in September of this year.  Up to quite recently we had been promised a Bill by the summer of this year.  In this document we were promised a Bill in the session beginning 30 January of this year. I do not know &mdash; I am not privy to the Government's intentions in regard to the length of this session &mdash; but I bet my bottom dollar that we will not have an Environment Protection Agency Bill this side of the summer.  What do we do in the meantime?  Can anything constructive be done to advance matters in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The striking thing about this debate has been that on all sides of the House there has been agreement that we need to move firmly and decisively to set up a system that will clean up and maintain <Col N="1965" /> our environment.  That is putting it in a nutshell.  The Bill now before the House gives us the opportunity to do that.  It will be a long task and I have no doubt that there will be a deal of debate on the Committee Stage of the Bill which we would welcome.  It is not going to be quick and the sooner we start with it the better. There is now a Bill before the House that addresses all the issues.  In fact, I am happy to say that my party colleague, Deputy Shatter, and the rest of my colleagues in this party, are in the van in this regard.  The Minister for the Environment, in his usual way, came into the House and tried his sarcastic tricks.  He congratulated my party on what he called our new found concern with the environment. He might try to develop some concern himself.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that this is the Minister for the Environment who abolished An Foras Forbartha, the Dublin Transportation Authority, the Dublin Streets Commission and the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  In every one of those acts he was opposed, tooth and nail, by the current Minister of State, and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats.  They are now co-operating in unnecessarily delaying the passage through the House of legislation they know we need, that their Government know we need and that the whole country knows that we need.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to establish an independent environment protection agency and I do not think I am being unduly harsh on anybody in saying that the general public is already more than a little sceptical of the Government's commitment to tackling environmental problems and somewhat sceptical of the local authorities' ability to provide environmental protection.  I am not criticising the local authorities for one moment in saying that.  Our Bill sets out a clear designation of functions, responsibilities and powers that would make it clear beyond any doubt, without any duplication and without any confusion, what we need to <Col N="1966" /> do and how we need to go about protecting our environment.</P>
    <P>We set out a number of principles in the Bill and I should like to direct the House's attention to section 5 where it sets out the general functions of the agency.  By what is not just a curious coincidence the Government have accepted much of what we set out in section 5 because one finds in their publication, <i>An Environment Action Programme</i>, the following pararaph:</P>
    <P>The specific steps and the new programme now decided by the Government involve significant further development of existing environmental measures.  They will deal with environmental problems into the coming decade and take particular account of the following considerations:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the concept of sustainable development, as advocated in the ... Brundtland Report;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the principle of precautionary action even where there is no definitive scientific evidence to link emissions or discharges with deterimental environmental effects;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the integration of environmental considerations in all policy areas.</P>
    <P>That is language that has never been used before by the Government.  It is also, by some strange coincidence, language that repeats almost word for word the provisions in section 5 (a), (b) and (c) of our Bill.</P>
    <P>I take some little encouragement from that because it means that at least the Bill has had the effect of concentrating the Government's mind on some of the more important considerations that should be to the forefront of our action in relation to the environment, even if it is only to produce their glossy programme.  The Minister of State is convinced of the urgency of the matter.  She said in the course of her speech in the House on 12 December last that the important thing <Col N="1967" /> was that the agency be established as quickly as possible.  Yet, she rejects the only legislation before the House and it can only be for purely party political reasons.  I will return to that point.</P>
    <P>The functions this agency should have, as outlined by the Minister of State, are all provided for in the Fine Gael Bill.  The control and regulation of developments, for example, are provided for in section 8.  General monitoring is provided for in section 6.  Support, back-up and advisory services are provided for in several sections of the Bill.  Environmental research is provided for in section 6.  Not only does the Fine Gael Bill provide for all those functions to be undertaken, it also provides for significant additional functions which have been detailed by Deputy Shatter and other members of my party in the course of the debate.  From what has been revealed to us so far of the Government's intentions we can only conclude that they are inadequate and would produce less effective action than the Fine Gael Bill would.</P>
    <P>The Government, for example, propose that the agency directly carry out some environmental licensing functions. Our Bill envisages the agency establishing national criteria for water and air quality and for discharge standards on which environmental licensing would be based.  There are a great many more additional functions that are provided for in our Bill which the Government do not seem so far to have decided on, and which the Minister for the Environment, and the Minister of State, have not yet pronounced upon.</P>
    <P>We have provided also, in the structures set out in our Bill, for a role for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have provided a substantial role for an Oireachtas Joint Committee.  The Government, apparently, do not like this although I am bound to say that reading the reasons advanced by the other side of the House for not having this committee I <Col N="1968" /> am far from convinced that this is anything other than bureaucratic obscurantism. The Government, after all, have proposed to the House what I regard as a very shabby and incomplete Oireachtas committee on the funding, structures and operations of local authorities.  The same Minister who is now objecting to the Bill, who is now objecting to an Oireachtas joint committee to drive environmental policy, wants a joint committee to get him off the hook because he failed three times in the last Dáil to convince the Government to make any change whatsoever in the local revenue raising powers of local authorities.  The Minister might have wanted to do it but some of his colleagues put the screws on him and held him back.</P>
    <P>In spite of several valiant efforts to leak this all, without the assistance of his erstwhile colleague, now Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the news got out but Pádraig still got stopped.  What does the Minister want to do now?  He wants an Oireachtas Joint Committee to provide a defensive screen behind which the Government can operate and maybe for the Minister to get his way without looking at the consequences of that for overall taxation.  There the Government are going to have to mend their hands but I must say that they have the right idea because for once the Government, with the lengthy Minister who can look me straight in the teeth, and their Napoleonic Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not be drawn by Deputy Quinn, although Deputy Howlin could give Deputy Quinn a few lessons on how to misrepresent things.  We will deal with that another day.  It is a great pity that the Government, reinforced as they are by those noted opponents of their core values now sitting with them, have not begun to appreciate the role that can be played in the House by Private Members' Bills.  We saw a Government in the last Dáil that perversely, stupidly and without the slightest good reason, objected to a Private Members' Bill on adoption.  On the night we had the vote it looked as if they sincerely regretted what they had done.  They came back to the House later with virtually the same Bill which had been passed by the House.</P>
      <P>That is the same Government who objected to a Private Members' Bill in relation to the up-dating of marriage law. We were very glad to have at that time &mdash; we were then in Opposition &mdash; the assistance of the Progressive Democrats in order to make sure the Government were not allowed uncaringly, unthinkingly and unfeelingly to throw that Bill out of the House but we got it back in here, in a special committee, and good legislation was passed on the basis of a Private Members' Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government could do exactly the same tonight on this Bill.  The Government should doubly want to do it because we have here in front of us the Minister for the Environment, this giant of a man who bestrides an awful lot more than the Taoiseach ever will.  This man has had the good sense in the last few weeks to accept 48 amendments from my party to the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill and made it into a half-way decent Bill, and may still accept another amendment or two.  He <Col N="1970" /> has recognised that the process of parliamentary debate and scrutiny in this House can add to the quality of our legislation and it could add to the quality of life for 3.5 million people in this country.</P>
    <P>I know it is traditional at this stage in winding up a debate on a Private Members' Bill for the Opposition spokesman to make an emotional plea to the Government, even at this late hour, to relent, to see sense, to accept this Bill and to amend it in any way they consider desirable and pleasing to the House in Committee.  I am not even going to say that because that would be a waste of breath.  I should like to say to this Government that they are making a very big mistake in carrying on with this nonsensical view that a Government can never afford to accept that what the Opposition is putting forward has value and might even anticipate what the Government will do and get us the results we need earlier than a Government that is locked into the bureaucratic procedures which have meant that we have not seen even the shape of a Bill from this Government after almost three years of action.</P>
    <P>It is a shame, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the most likely outcome of this vote is that this Bill will not proceed to Committee Stage.  It will be an indictment of the Government if all the sensible things contained in this Bill, most of which the Government say they want to carry out, will be delayed for another six months because they simply will not see that this legislation is better, clearer and more focused than the woolly ideas we have heard from the Government so far.</P>

      <P>Ballycotton pier is a 105 year old structure which has been severely damaged by the recent storm. Over a long number of years trial borings have taken place and numerous reports have been compiled by departmental officials and the Office of Public Works with a view to developing a new pier.  I think a local committee submitted their proposals on this project some 18 months ago.</P>
      <P>The demands of the people of Ballycotton were aired at a recent public meeting of an action committee who have been set up.  Following further storm damage the pier was split in two and it completely blocks the inner harbour which is used by the lifeboat service and many fishing trawlers.  The crew of the lifeboat reside in Ballycotton and no alternative location for the lifeboat would be workable.  The Ballycotton lifeboat service covers an important area of the southern coast and the consequences of leaving this area without lifeboat cover for a long period would be very serious. As we know from recent events the capacity of the Air Corps to provide helicopter rescue services is still restricted by weather conditions.  In these circumstances the fishermen and seamen whose lives are at risk still have to depend on the lifeboat service.</P>
      <P>In excess of 50 people from the area are permanently employed in the fishing industry in Ballycotton and many more are employed in a temporary capacity. Their livelihoods are threatened by the damage done to Ballycotton pier.  I appeal to the Minister to treat this matter with extreme urgency.  At their meeting on Monday last Cork County Council decided to give this matter top priority. I understand a plan has been submitted on how to make the pier safe and I hope the Minister will provide the funds necessary to carry out this work.  The local committee, which is comprised of representatives of all the local associations, fishermen, the community, etc., want a new pair to be developed in the long term at Ballycotton.  I want to emphasise the need for recognition of their demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise the two very important problems which need to be addressed in the Ballycotton area. We hope some funding will be made available through the Structural Funds and perhaps with Government assistance in the medium to long term to ensure that Ballycotton harbour will be upgraded and developed and a new breakwater put in place.  More importantly the Government need to provide funding to Cork <Col N="1975" /> County Council to ensure that the essential work can be carried out as of now in order to repair the extensive damage which has occurred as a result of the recent storm.  The damage done to the breakwater in Ballycotton should be repaired immediately.</P>
      <P>Some of the improvements we are seeking here tonight have been sought for over 30 years.  At a public meeting a few weeks ago the people of Ballycotton told us they have waited for far too long for this work to be carried out.  We agree that a grave crisis exists in Ballycotton which needs to be tackled immediately.  I think I can say without doubt whatsoever that the very future not only of the fishermen and their families in that area but the future of the whole town of Ballycotton is in serious doubt and under threat if the Government do not provide funding to Cork County Council to carry out the necessary work.</P>
      <P>The town of Ballycotton is entirely dependent on the harbour.  The fishing and tourism industries which have come about as a result of Ballycotton harbour create the only real employment in the Ballycotton area.  If these two industries are allowed to develop and obtain funding both from the Government and the EC it will mean that there will be jobs for the people of Ballycotton.  Unlike many of the industries which receive copious IDA grants these industries will not disappear overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock outlined very clearly the needs of the lifeboat service.  The breakwater is on the verge of collapse and, as has been pointed out clearly, if it does collapse the Ballycotton lifeboat service will not be able to operate.  The gravity of that situation should be clear to all.  The people of the area want the Government to give urgent attention to this matter and I appeal to the Minister to give us a positive response to take back to the people of Ballycotton.  A genuine crisis exists there at present and the <Col N="1976" /> people of the area need a genuine commitment and answer from the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As no doubt the Minister is well aware Ballycotton is an important tourism and fishing area and the lifeboat service which is vitally important to the south coast, is based there. Without going into what has been said by the other two Deputies, it is essential that the breakwater and harbour are repaired so that no harm will be caused to the fishing community, the people who use the sea around the south coast and the people who holiday in the area.</P>
      <P>I earnestly request the Minister and the Government to do all in their power to ensure that this facility is brought up to the proper standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to thank Deputies Sherlock, Bradford and Ahern for bringing this matter before the House.  The Deputies will be aware that I have already sent one of my engineers to Ballycotton to inspect and report on the damage caused by the storm.  I should like the House to know that the lifeboat there is operational. There were media reports that the lifeboat was not able to put to sea, but, as the Deputies can verify, that is not the case.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sherlock knows, Cork County Council have requested help with regard to the damage caused to the pier and the breakwater.  I understand Cork County Council are to demolish the concrete beacon on the breakwater because it is weakening its structure.  I think they are only waiting for better weather conditions to carry out that work in order to reduce the strain on the damaged section of the breakwater itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies and the House will no doubt be aware that Ballycotton is only one of the many coastal towns which local coastal authorities are now seeking assistance for.  I, my Department and the Government are aware of the gravity of <Col N="1977" /> the problems which have been caused by the persistent adverse weather we have been having for almost three months. Because of this bad weather the Government set up a special sub-committee to report urgently on what needs to be done. I and some of my colleagues are members of that sub-committee and our task is to assess the damage caused and to report back to the Government with all possible speed.  Just before this debate there was a meeting of the sub-committee.  I want to assure Deputy Sherlock and Deputies Bradford and Ahern that I will be pressing for special funding to deal with the damage caused to our coasts.  Ballycotton will be among those places to receive that kind of consideration.  As I said, the report will go before the Government urgently.</P>
    <P>We want to give help speedily and in an equitable manner to the actual locations which have suffered damage.  I am aware that Ballycotton is an important fishing place.  In 1989, £300,000 worth of fish was landed there.  I have already referred to the lifeboat.  It is operational and the Deputies need have no fears about it.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock when he says that it covers a very important area which is exposed to south-west and south south-west storms.  Fifty full-time fishermen are entitled to facilities.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to long-term development.  We are not dealing with long-term development at this time.  One particular operation which should be done would take up all the money which might be available for this kind of remedial action.  I am also aware that it is a very important tourist centre, as mentioned by two of the Deputies.  We depend a great deal on the tourism industry which is a developing one.  I will bear this in mind in our considerations in the sub-committee, in drawing up the report to be submitted to the Government and when it comes up for consideration at a full Government meeting.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, most sincerely for allowing me to raise this matter this evening.  The history of the proposed community school in Cashel is a long, unsatisfactory and troubled one, riddled with broken promises, delays, postponements, disappointments and, above all, inaction.  To be fair to the Minister not all of these have occurred during her period of office, nevertheless most of them have.</P>
      <P>In 1979, a large extension to the girls' secondary school in Cashel was approved by the Department of Education.  By the end of 1983 plans for the new buildings were almost completed.  A site was provided free of charge by the Presentation Sisters and the required local contribution was raised by the parents. However, on 31 January 1984 a Department circular called for a review of post primary education facilities in Cashel.  As a result of this review the Presentation Sisters and the CBS agreed to participate in the proposed community school on the understanding &ldquo;that the community school would proceed without delay&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Commitment after commitment was given and in December 1984 the Department assured us &ldquo;that there is no question of any delay in the availability of funds for the school building&rdquo;.  In January 1985 the Department said &ldquo;planning of the school will proceed immediately&rdquo;.  In November 1985, the building unit wrote to the managers of the schools in Cashel and stated that the scheme would go to tender in July 1986 and building would commence in either September or October 1986.  Cashel waited and waited patiently.  At this point I must compliment the community for their patience and the restraint they have shown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first warning was given in November 1987 when a letter from the Department stated that a decision to commence the proposed community school in Cashel <Col N="1979" /> would depend on the availability of resources and on the Department's other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>In May 1988, the school authorities were informed that the plans for the community school were being shelved in favour of a new departure in school building, that is, designed, built and financed by a private developer. This school was to be included in that new pilot scheme and we were assured in early September 1989 that all the difficulties, legal and otherwise, had been cleared and that the builders would be on site before Christmas 1989.  In November 1989, an assurance was given that the builders would be on site by February 1990.</P>
      <P>We have now learned to our horror that the scheme has not even gone to tender, despite the assurances given by the Department of Education that the school would be open by September 1991.  That proposed opening date could still be achieved if the Minister for Education gives sanction for the building to commence immediately.  For far too long all the schools in Cashel have coped with totally unacceptable conditions, poor, unhealthy sanitation, fire hazards, grossly inadequate classrooms, constant flooding in pedestrian areas and no ventilation &mdash; so poor in fact that the inspectors supervising State examinations have made repeated complaints about the position.  There is some doubt at this stage as to whether the public examinations can be held in the building this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is but a brief summary of the prevailing unacceptable conditions in the schools in Cashel.  I cannot over-estimate the anger and frustration felt by the parents, teachers, students and school managers in Cashel.  Continuous delays and postponements have resulted in a <Col N="1980" /> mounting tide of impatience and intolerance. For far too long Cashel has waited.  It now wants action.  As a past pupil of the Presentation Convent &mdash; my colleagues teach in the VEC and my family are past pupils of the CBS &mdash; I am deeply committed to the future of education in Cashel.  I plead for immediate action to ensure that Cashel community school will open in September 1991 and for all the promises to be honoured.</P>

      <P>This problem goes back to 1970 when the then Minister for Education asked that both schools be amalgamated.  I recall distinctly the bitter opposition this proposed amalgamation received and the emotions which were played on at the time.  Those who thought of amalgamation at that time were way ahead of their time and certainly were not appreciated.  We witnessed the expansion of both schools without proper facilities. I am aware, a Cheann Comhairle, that you joined with me on that occasion in supporting that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being realistic and has done the best she can within the limited resources available to her.  She has not put this matter on the long finger.  Deputy Ahearn forgot to mention that there was a failure to agree with the VEC on the establishment of a community college. That was the source of one of the delays. The Minister on coming into office saw there was no money available but brought some innovative thinking into the matter. I can assure the House that I have every confidence in the Minister to bring about a quick and satisfactory conclusion to this <Col N="1981" /> matter which would meet the agreement of all the people of Cashel.  I am a native of that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you are precluded from so doing.  I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this matter on the Adjournment, for a very fine presentation of the facts and for the very fair way in which she delineated the various delays over the years, not leaving out 1979, 1983, 1984 and 1985.  Three of those years were in the term of a previous lady Minister for Education.  When I came in I knew quite well I had not the money and was not behind the bush in saying at that time that I had not got it.  Happily, circumstances altered and we were able to go ahead with a new process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware from my reading of the files of the constant &mdash; I hesitate to use the word &mdash; harassment because in a man-woman situation it has another connotation, but I have been constantly harassed on this matter by Deputy Noel Davern &mdash; in the nicest possible way &mdash; since he came into the Dáil and by Senator Seán McCarthy in the previous Dáil.  They &mdash; and Deputy Ahearn tonight &mdash; left me under no illusion about this school being wanted for this town. Deputy Davern told me on some occasion the history of what led to the very admirable decision that it be a community school.  Let me pay tribute to all parties to that.  I know Sister Claude very well.  She is a very able woman of the <Col N="1982" /> highest integrity, as I am sure the other principals concerned are too.  Because it was a new concept and legalities had to be cleared as to how such matters would proceed, there were of necessity legal difficulties quite beyond my control which rested with the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  Those are at present receiving attention.</P>
    <P>I am working with very great attention on this case.  It is not a matter of finance. How could it be when we do not pay up front?  The whole concept of moving on schools such as this is that the person designing the building moves ahead with a block of money and we pay it back over a period of years.  Therefore, there is no such thing as the Government or myself and the Department being niggardly with the funds for such an admirable project which will benefit the town of Cashel greatly, a school which will be available not just to the students of 12 to 18 years but as a community facility, as the term community implies, open to the public for all sorts of other activities, further training, adult education, second chance, women returning to education and all that will be written into the conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahearn was with me on a deputation about another matter and in regard to rationalisation she heard me say that we put our money where people put their faith in a concept.  Faith has been shown by the people of Cashel in this concept. It is not a matter of ready finance.  We do not need ready finance for it.  Therefore, there is no reason that I should in any way not press the button but for the legalities.  If they were not correctly sorted out I would find myself in a very assailable position.  I have to have all my i-s dotted and t-s crossed.  I wish to accommodate the town of Cashel, the brothers, the nuns and the VEC, who despite earlier difficulties have worked together on this.  As soon as I have the legalities cleared I will proceed to do what is required.</P>
    <P>I commend all the Deputies for the area who have been assiduous about this. <Col N="1983" /> Since we came back into the Dáil last October Deputy Davern has never ceased to pursue this, and Deputy Ahearn has brought it forward here tonight.  A Cheann Comhairle, if you could speak on this matter you would do so.</P>
    <P>The matter is urgent.  The school is needed.  The present accommodation is completely unsatisfactory.  I want to allay the fears about the public examinations. If it is not wished to have them in those schools, public examinations will be held in Cashel.  That is not an issue.  We will provide a centre in Cashel for public examinations.  I would not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to any EC proposal which would withdraw or reduce EC intervention facilities to milk processors who manufacture so-called dairy spreads; if he is concerned at the huge decrease in butter consumption; if he is satisfied that sufficient intervention storage space is available; and if he will make a statement on the prospects for the dairy industry in 1990.</Quest>

      <P>No proposal of the type referred to by the Deputy has been tabled at Community level.  However, the decline in butter consumption is, of course, a cause for concern.  The EC Commission has re-introduced intervention purchases to stabilise the market. Other measures are also being implemented to restore balance to the market in the medium term and to avoid an accumulation of intervention stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> Proposals to regulate the sale of substitute products are being formulated by the EC Commission with a view to establishing order in the yellow fats market. In addition, I have asked for increased emphasis to be placed on the promotion of the many beneficial attributes of dairy products to counter the increased market penetration by the substitute products.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate any difficulties with storage space for intervention purchases. I would expect that reliance on the intervention outlet will diminish again by the second quarter of 1990.  Butter production in Ireland increased substantially last year at the expense of cheese production. The intervention outlet now allows the industry the opportunity to readjust its production in line with prevailing market conditions.</P>

      <P>On the wider international matters, the GATT negotiations are now entering a crucial stage and the Irish Presidency will afford Community Agriculture Ministers full opportunity of discussing all the agriculture elements of these important negotiations.  The Ministers will want to ensure that the fundamental principles of the CAP are safeguarded and that the incomes of Community producers are not threatened.</P>
      <P>Eastern and Central European issues will continue to arise over the coming months and the Presidency was pleased that already at the January Council the question of food aid for Eastern and Central Europe was addressed.</P>

This figure represents 24 per cent of the value of total exports and is 12 per cent higher than in 1988 due principally to the strong performance of the dairy produce and meat export sectors.

      <P>I am concerned of course that the firm should go into receivership so soon after the new plant was opened.  Accordingly, I asked for a report from my Department and the IDA on certain aspects of the case.  Because of the confidential nature of the Department's and the authority's dealings with individual companies it would be inappropriate to comment further on aspects of the matter.  I can confirm that the IDA examined and evaluated the company in detail prior to grant approval and satisfied itself as to the commercial viability of the venture at the time.  I understand that the receiver has advertised the plant for sale by tender.  I should point out that the sale of the plant is a matter for the receiver and something over which I have no control. I have not been approached regarding the purchase of the plant.</P>

      <P>I have asked for a report from my Department and the IDA on those aspects of this case for which they have responsibility.  Because of the confidential nature of the Department's and the authority's dealings with individual companies it would be inappropriate to comment further on these aspects of the matter.  However, I can say that I am satisfied that the inspection staff at the plant was adequate for hygiene control and meat certification for which my Department is responsible.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the IDA examined and evaluated the company in detail prior to grant approval and satisfied itself as to the commercial viability of the venture at the time.  The investment was progressed with the involvement of new overseas investors which represented a significant additional initiative in the development of the enterprise.</P>
      <P>The closure of the company is very regrettable especially because of the jobs at risk.  While I am also concerned about the farmer suppliers who are owed money by the company, this is now essentially a matter between the suppliers and the receiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plant is in excellent condition and is one of the most modern in the business. I am therefore hopeful of positive developments regarding its future.  The FEOGA and State moneys involved were used to build a substantial asset which is of benefit to the industry.  I understand that the receiver has advertised the plant <Col N="1833" /> for sale by tender.  I am anxious that a buyer would be found so that operations at the plant could resume as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Under its terms of reference the National Pensions Board which was set up in 1986 is required to submit proposals to the Minister for Social Welfare on all aspects of a national pensions system. The overall pension arrangements for public servants including employees of State companies and the contribution and other eligibility conditions governing entitlement to contributory pensions will be among the issues to be dealt with by the board.  The question of introducing <i>pro rata</i> pensions for persons with a mixture of full and limited insurance will be considered in that context.  It is expected that the board's report will be presented later this year.  Meanwhile, no provision has been included in the 1990 Estimates for the granting of <i>pro rata</i> pensions to persons with mixed insurance records.</P>

      <P>The provision of geriatric and psycho-geriatric beds in the city of Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of geriatric accommodation requirements in the Dublin city, the health board take into account accommodation provision in the whole Eastern Health Board area.  On the basis of the recommendations of the Report of the Working Party on Services for the Elderly, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly,</i> there is a need for approximately 3,615 extended care and welfare beds in the Eastern Health Board area. The actual number of beds in public and voluntary facilities is around 3,700.  I am satisfied that this level of bed provision, together with places available in the private nursing home sector is adequate to meet requirements.</P>
      <P>I should add that I recently announced an additional allocation of £5 million to services for the elderly to be allocated among the health boards including the Eastern Health Board.  This money will be directed towards development of home nursing and home help services and respite and other facilities for the elderly.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board have recently submitted a plan for further development of services for the elderly which is being considered in my Department at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards psycho-geriatric services, the Eastern Health Board have established a specialised psychiatric service for the elderly in Dublin community care areas 3, 6 and 7 with the appointment of two consultants with specialised training in the psychiatry of older adult.  The philosophy of these services is community based and day hospitals have been provided at St. Patrick's Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.  Assessment services have been provided in James Connolly Memorial Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, while existing <Col N="1854" /> psychiatric and geriatric assessment facilities are shared in St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The following extended care places for the elderly mentally infirm have also been provided:</P>

    <P>In addition, there are approximately 500 persons over 65 years of age being cared for in Eastern Health Board psychiatric hospitals with a further 250 elderly persons resident in community hostels.</P>
    <P>I recognise the need to develop services for the elderly mentally ill and infirm, particularly in the Dublin area where the number of older people is growing rapidly. The specialised psychiatric service which has been established in Dublin is being evaluated by the Eastern Health Board and it is the board's intention to develop further a community based psychiatric service for the elderly.</P>

      <P>The position of dental surgeon in the area referred to by the Deputy fell vacant in June 1989 due to the resignation of the holder of the post.

At present the board are providing two <Col N="1855" /> three-hour sessions per week at the dental clinic in the District Hospital in Belmullet.</P>

      <P>The imposition of charges in respect of long stay patients in geriatric hospitals is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  These charges are calculated on the basis of the patient's income, which normally consists solely of pension.  Accordingly, when income increases, the charge is raised on a <i>pro rata</i> basis; this practice applies not only to the Christmas bonus but also to any other increases in income, such as proceeds from investments or disposal of assets.</P>
      <P>These arrangements have existed for many years.  However, I would like to assure the Deputy that where particular individual needs exist, then these are considered by the health board in a sympathetic manner.</P>

      <P>The situation was first brought to my attention late last week by my colleague, Deputy Flood.  The matter is primarily the responsibility of the national school authorities having regard to the fact that it is a condition of the lease under which the school is vested that the building be used where required for national school purposes.  I have already arranged that my Department's officials discuss the whole matter with the Brookfield school authorities and other relevant parties in an effort to resolve the difficulties.  The Deputy will be aware that this situation has only arisen from the recent approval of a concessionary post for the Brookfield school.</P>

      <P>I am aware that conditions generally at Crinkle national school, County Offaly are unsatisfactory.  On 18 January 1990 my Department wrote to the school authorities offering grant-aid for essential works which were recommended by the district office of Public Works and a response is awaited.  In the <Col N="1860" /> light of the Deputy's question I have arranged that the local architect inspect the school at once with a view to advising the school authorities on what additional works now need to be executed.  Grant-aid will be available for such works in accordance with the rules for national schools.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering the question of the provision of a permanent extension on a modified basis and I will write to the school authorities in this regard at the earliest possible date.</P>
