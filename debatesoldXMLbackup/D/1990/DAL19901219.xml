      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 23.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: (1) the sitting shall not be suspended today; (2) Nos. 2, all stages of Nos. 9, 10, 11, and 12 shall be decided without amendment or debate and by one question, in each case; (3) statements on the European Council Meeting in Rome and bilateral meetings with other Heads of Government on 14-15 December 1990 shall be made now, and speakers shall be confined to a spokesperson nominated by each of the groups, as defined in Standing Order 89; and such statements shall not exceed 30 minutes for the Taoiseach and 15 minutes for each other speaker; and (4) at the conclusion of No. 23, the Dáil shall adjourn forthwith until 12 noon on Wednesday, 30 January 1991.</P>

      <P>We do not agree with the proposal for No. 11 which relates to a report on Dáil reform circulated to most Deputies this morning.  It is proposed that the report, which I am sure most Deputies have not yet read, will be <Col N="406" /> adopted by the House today.  We are being asked not only to approve it without debate but without amendment.  We are being denied the right to even propose amendments to the report.  My party have submitted an amendment to No. 11: we have proposed that the rota for priority questions be changed to provide for the restoration of the priority question which was allowed to The Workers' Party up to about six months ago.  We proposed that there should be three priority questions for Fine Gael, one for the Labour Party and one for The Workers' Party.  I am sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The proposal that the Dáil adjourn to 30 January is not agreed by the Fine Gael Party.  The Dáil sat for barely 30 days since 1 July and we have not transacted all the business which needs to be transacted.  Large amounts of legislation promised for this session by the Government have not been processed because the sitting times have been too short.  As long as the Government continue to insist on operating an unreformed Dáil, where Committee Stages of Bills are taken in this House and where the Estimates of expenditure are not debated at all &mdash; because they are also taken on the Floor of the House rather <Col N="408" /> than in Special Committee &mdash; the proposed number of sitting days is, quite simply, totally inadequate.  Fine Gael, therefore, oppose an adjournment to 30 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>You may recall, a Cheann Comhairle, that I raised this matter yesterday in the hope that the Taoiseach might listen.  In relation to the recall of the Dáil, have the Government given any consideration to extending the sittings of this House and breaking them into four sessions per annum instead of the present three?  The Taoiseach &mdash; and his Ministers &mdash; promised on numerous occasions that the Environmental Protection Agency Bill would go through the House this session.  The same was promised in relation to the Roads Authority Bill and I suggest to the Taoiseach that we should come back two weeks earlier in January to get those Bills through the House.</P>

      <P>Clearly this issue, the date of the return of the Dáil, is linked to the issue I raised with regard to taking an important report on reform of the House without debate and amendment. I clearly support the motion that the Dáil should return at an earlier date. I, therefore, oppose Item No. 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business I have two questions I wish to raise with the Taoiseach one of which may be disagreeable to him and the other agreeable.  I will take the disagreeable question first.  May I ask the Taoiseach if he will appoint a Minister for Defence or if we will have another six weeks with a part time, half-time Minister for Defence in view of the fact that so many decisions have to be taken on the implementation of the Gleeson committee report in regard to Defence matters?  It is entirely undesirable that we should have a part timer fulfilling this important role.  I am asking the Taoiseach if he will make provision today for the appointment of an extra member of the Government which requires the consent of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I now come to the other question I wish to raise.  It is a disgrace that we have not got a full time Minister for Defence.  I will leave it at that.  May I ask another question?  I realise, Sir, that it has not been the precedent for the House to have an opportunity to pay tribute to an outgoing President of Ireland at the end of his or her term but it is a precedent we should break on this occasion in order to provide an opportunity for the party leaders to pay a brief tribute to Dr. Patrick Hillery for the distinguished conduct of his office of President over a period of 14 years.  It is appropriate that the House should have that opportunity and I am sure the Taoiseach, as a former colleague of Dr. Hillery, would wish to be associated with a tribute to him on the work he has done, particularly in view of the time of year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have to be disagreeable.  The matter of the appointment of the Minister for Defence has been mentioned many times in this House and the Taoiseach gets quite upset and, indeed, has done on two or three occasions.  I wonder whether he can give us one sensible logical reason why he has not appointed a Minister for Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Taoiseach's prerogative but I would say he is not doing himself, his Government or this House a service by not appointing a Minister for Defence.  We will now have to wait until February before we have a Minister for Defence or, perhaps, the Taoiseach will wait until the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.</P>

It is incumbent on the Government to point out the efforts all of us have made to build confidence in the law and security forces in Northern Ireland.  The decision by the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions yesterday not to prosecute the soldiers involved causes grave disquiet to me and to other Members of this House, particularly when it is taken in conjunction with the decision made in England the previous day in regard to the Birmingham Six.

In regard to the patents Bill which is supposed to have been circulated during the current session, the Taoiseach recently indicated that the matter was with the Attorney General.  It now appears that at least some members of the Government are of a different opinion. They say that the Attorney General has ruled on the matter and has considered it impossible, in view of our constitutional constraints, to have a Bill endorsing the European convention dealt with in this House.

      <P>After the meeting, we participated, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in the formal opening ceremony of the inter-governmental conferences on political union and on economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>Copies of the Presidency Conclusions have already been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  On this occasion, and in line with my desire and commitment to keep the House fully informed on all aspects of the inter-governmental conferences, a number of other relevant documents have also been placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a successful Summit.  The atmosphere was constructive and co-operative. <Col N="422" /> We dealt with a major agenda and accelerated the momentum towards intergration.</P>
    <P>At the summit among the principal subjects we discussed were political union and aid to the Soviet Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Before going on to describe the outcome in more detail I should like to outline for Deputies the momentous nature of the proposals which the Community is now considering.  The creation of a Single Market of up to 340 million people requires not only the abolition of customs and trade barriers between the member states but also moves towards a single currency throughout the Community. The market would not be complete without such a move: and a single currency implies in turn a single institution or bank to regulate its value on the markets.  A central bank of this nature, in turn, implies an arrangement or institution to exercise a form of political control, so that the bank is accountable, in ways to be agreed, to the people of the Community. In this sense the internal market, economic and monetary union and political union are all part of the same unitary policy.  That is the nature of the measures we discussed and advanced in Rome.</P>
    <P>At the Dublin Summit last June, the Council asked that the future developments of the Community be considered under four broad headings: competence of the union; democratic legitimacy; efficiency and effectiveness of the Community and its institutions; and foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>On these subjects, our discussions in Rome were facilitated by the preparatory work for the IGC carried out by Foreign Ministers and their personal representatives. I should particularly emphasise that, as the meeting here last June of the European Council had already agreed, each IGC will settle its own agenda.  The Rome meeting has not pre-empted the outcome of the IGC, but has set out guidelines and matters for consideration by the conference, which will make its own recommendations.  Depending on the nature of these recommendations, I would envisage a referendum being <Col N="423" /> necessary for the Single European Act, to enable Ireland to ratify the Treaty changes involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the conclusions begin with the European Council's agreed statement on the underlying principles of the political union such as solidarity between its member states, a proper balance between the responsibilities of the individual states and the Community, economic and social cohesion and the fullest realisation of the aspirations of the Community's citizens.</P>
    <P>In my statement in the House on 1 November last, I reported at length on the issues arising under each of the four chapters I have mentioned, together with a comprehensive outline on the underlying principles which will guide the Government's approach in the IGC.  I do not, therefore, propose to repeat all this here today and will confine myself to commenting briefly on some of the most important points contained in the Presidency Conclusions.</P>
    <P>It is very satisfactory that particular areas which we have been advocating such as economic and social cohesion, the environment, health, education and culture are singled out by the European Council as is also the emphasis that the union must have at its disposal all the necessary resources to achieve its objectives and carry out its policies. Deputies will recall that, under the terms of the Delors Plan which was agreed in 1988, the adequacy of the existing Community budgetary resources is to be considered again next year.  The question as to whether some new areas such as immigration, visas, drugs and organised crime can be brought into the scope of the union and whether, in these circumstances, there might be a need to separate these from the Treaty's classical decision-making system and framework are for the IGC to consider.</P>
    <P>As I have previously explained to the House, we have no objection to the inclusion in the new Treaty of a definition of subsidiarity.  We would, however, be anxious to ensure that there is full clarity about the legal implications of such a <Col N="424" /> definition and that this would not be used to limit the development of the Community in areas of national interest to this country, such as cohesion.</P>
    <P>The European Council outlined a number of measures for consideration by the IGC to strengthen the role of the European Parliament.  These include such issues as extension and improvement of the co-operation procedure, extension of the assent procedure for international agreements, involvement of the European Parliament in the appointment of the Commission and of its President as well as increasing the parliament's budgetary powers and its monitoring of Community policies.</P>
    <P>As far as our national position is concerned, we are prepared to consider proposals aimed at improving and enhancing the role of the parliament in the decision-making processes of the Community.</P>
    <P>However, like the majority of our partners, we have difficulties with co-decision arrangements with the European Parliament on the grounds that this would upset the existing balance between the Community's institutions which has been such a fundamental feature in ensuring the success of the Community up to now. As I explained in my statement in this House on 1 November last, we should not lose sight of the fact that in all of this the European Council and the Council of Ministers are fully representative of the peoples from the member states who democratically elected them and in turn are directly answerable to their own parliaments for decisions taken by them in Community fora.</P>
    <P>Other areas singled out by the Rome Summit are that of the role of national parliaments in the Community's development and that of sub-national regional institutions.  On the former, the House will recall that the Oireachtas was represented at the European Congress of National Parliaments and the European Parliament which was held in Rome on 27-30 November.  The declaration which was adopted at that congress will form an important input into the IGC's consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion put forward <Col N="425" /> by some partners for the establishment of a body to represent regional interests, this country is defined as one region within the Community and we do not have the autonomous regional structures which some member states have.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note from the Presidency Conclusions, that the European Council singled out in Rome three areas for attention by the IGC, namely, the possible strengthening of the role of the European Council, the extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers and improvements in the effectiveness of the Community's other institutions.  As regards the European Council, this I believe has played a useful role in giving an impulse across a broad range of Community policies as well as acting as an arbitrator in the past in settling key substantive issues. I believe we should agree to extend this role to include that of settling future Community targets and agreeing the broad agenda of work, together with any supportive role in a political union with increased powers and competences.</P>
    <P>As regards majority voting by the Council of Ministers, we will be prepared to consider its extension on a case-by-case basis, as was done at the time of the Single European Act.  The Community's experience since then with the implementation of the internal market has shown how effective it has been in speeding up decision-making.  However, we will, like a number of our partners, wish to have unanimity retained in certain key areas such as taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall from my statement in the House on 1 November, that the European Council meeting in Rome in October had already agreed guidelines and conclusions for the Inter-Governmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union.  Consequently, there was a detailed discussion on EMU at the Council's meeting last weekend in Rome beyond our taking note of the report by the Committee of Governors of the central banks on the draft statute and on the draft Treaty on EMU which had just been submitted by the Commission.</P>
    <P>As was expected, discussions on the chapter on common foreign and security <Col N="426" /> policy were the most significant and in particular raised important issues for us. I emphasised that the Foreign Ministers' work had set out a good basis on which to proceed and that it had the particular merit of identifying issues which the IGC will have to address but without foreclosing options or trying to curtail debate as some partners were seeking to do. These questions must, I stated, be for the IGC itself to discuss.</P>
    <P>I indicated that a common security policy is a sensitive one for this country and sought understanding and co-operation from my colleagues on this issue. The IGC will examine how to proceed under this heading against the background of the guidelines set out in the Presidency Conclusions.  These envisage the gradual extension of the union's role in the area of common security to issues debated in international organisations such as arms control and disarmament; CSCE matters; UN peace-keeping operations; economic and technological co-operation in the armaments fields; co-ordination of armaments export policy and non-proliferation.</P>
    <P>The conclusions distinguish between security as a whole and defence matters. With a view to the future, we say, the prospect of a role for the union in defence matters should be considered, without prejudice to member states' existing obligations and without prejudice to the traditional positions of other member states.  This takes account at my request of Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The Conclusions also describe the institutional framework and the decision-making procedures which it will be for the IGC to examine in order to work out how to implement the policies effectively.</P>
    <P>Given the enormous changes in Europe over the last 18 months, it is not surprising that almost every country in Europe is considering its position in relation to the fundamental issue of security.  Indeed the whole security architecture of post-war Europe is being reassessed to determine its continued relevance, in view of the collapse of one <Col N="427" /> of the military alliances and possible changes in the other.  Great caution is being shown and no one is rushing to abandon positions held for forty years though all are accepting that the whole scene has been radically altered and that new thinking is called for.</P>
    <P>The language used in the guidelines for the IGC on political union to accommodate Ireland's position can be seen as having important implications for the future extension of the Community.  It can be of considerable importance for a number of applicant countries as some of these countries will see it as lessening difficulties they may have in reconciling their traditional policy of neutrality with membership of a Community moving towards a political union, which will include a common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Generally it may well be that there will be a gradual evolution that will eventually subsume and reconcile the basic values and positions of those who have belonged to an alliance and those who have not, and that we will eventually have a security system embracing Europe as a whole, of which the Paris Charter of the CSCE will certainly be one element.  We would certainly wish to contribute to putting in place a forward-looking structure of that kind.</P>
    <P>The wish of some member states to include defence in a new common foreign and security policy for the union is a complex issue.  Member states have different ideas and priorities in regard to it and also because of their involvement in external organisations like NATO, WEU and the CSCE.  Apart from Ireland all the other member states are members of NATO but only nine are members of the Western European Union.  We are all participants in the CSCE.  A number of the member states wish NATO, mainly because of the involvement of the US, to continue in existence and see it as essential for their defence.  Others would like to see an expanded role for WEU and to have it linked in some way to the Community.  There is also increasing support and commitment to the CSCE <Col N="428" /> and a view, which I share, that ultimately it is through its development that all of Europe can find in the future the permanent stability and security which it requires.</P>
    <P>Our very considerable achievement in regard to common foreign and security policy is reflected in some of the international press comment.  The <i>London Times</i> on Monday noted that the Summit was careful, and that &ldquo;it took in both Irish neutrality and Britain's strongly pro-NATO stance&rdquo;.  The <i>Financial Times</i> referring to the reference in the conclusions, as being &ldquo;without prejudice to the traditional positions of other member States&rdquo;, noted &ldquo;In fact, there is only one such &lsquo;other&rsquo; State &mdash; neutral Ireland&rdquo;. John Palmer, the respected European correspondent of the <i>Guardian</i>, commented: &ldquo;It has become even clearer following the debate on political union that the way is now open for at least four other West European States &mdash; Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland &mdash; to join the Community, in spite of the neutrality of all but Norway&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The recognition given to our position and of the need to take it into account is a major achievement.  I think Deputies will agree that the Rome Conclusions go far beyond the Single European Act in according explicit recognition for the first time to our position, in the phrase &ldquo;without prejudice to the traditional positions of other member States&rdquo;.  This represents a welcome accommodation of our position in a way that has not been done before by any previous European Council.  It is a good basis on which to enter the important and complex Inter-governmental negotiations on political union.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances I am at a loss to understand the new militaristic stance of Fine Gael.  We have just demonstrated in Rome that Ireland need not abandon the general consensus that has existed up to now on military alliances but that it can be accommodated in a common security policy for the Community.  So there is no need to embrace militarism unless, of course, some would wish to do so for its own sake.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> Other recent domestic political comments on Community affairs have also been totally out of touch with reality. Ireland has been and is to the forefront of the movement toward European integration, fully supporting progress at each stage; constructively participating in the discussions and negotiations on arrangements for political union.  Under our Presidency major steps forward were taken, including decisions on the two Intergovernmental Conferences which have now been inaugurated.  I want to emphasise that there is no question of opting out of agreed arrangements for a common foreign and security policy.  It is instead a matter of determining what are the best arrangements that can be agreed at this stage, taking account of different countries' positions and the presence of existing organisations.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 Ireland has made a remarkable contribution to the construction of Europe, especially during our recent Presidency.  At home we have streamlined our economic performance, so that it is capable of fully participating in the Single Market and in economic and monetary union, on the basis that suitable arrangements are made to reinforce cohesion.  The European dimension has been of great importance in supporting our whole economic and social programme. We have taken up clear and positive positions.  In fact, we can take pride in the part we have played in what has been by far the most productive period to date in our membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>On the GATT negotiations, the Conclusions note that &ldquo;only a global approach based on balanced concessions made by all participants will enable the negotiations to be brought to a successful conclusion&rdquo;.  We were able to maintain EC solidarity and adherence to the existing mandate and we called on the Commission to intensify its contacts within the terms of the present mandate with a view to concluding a balanced agreement as soon as possible.  The onus is now on the US to make concessions to enable successful negotiations to commence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> A consensus readily emerged that the concept of European citizenship should be addressed in the IGC.  Deputies will note from the Presidency Conclusions that we have singled out a number of citizens' rights such as participation in elections to the European Parliament in the country of residence and possible participation in municipal elections, social and economic rights such as freedom of movement and residence, equality of opportunity and treatment for all citizens for consideration by the IGC.</P>
    <P>The second major item discussed at the Rome Summit was that of aid to the Soviet Union and to the countries of central and eastern Europe.  Deputies will recall that the European Council, at its meeting here in June last, asked the Commission to consult the Government of the Soviet Union and as necessary the international financial organisations with a view to preparing proposals urgently on short term credits and long term support for structural reform.</P>
    <P>The Commission services engaged in intensive discussions with the Soviet authorities but, because of uncertainties relating to the economic and constitutional frameworks, were unable before the Rome Summit to table substantive proposals.</P>
    <P>However, the European Council, taking all the factors in the situation into account, agreed on what I believe is a balanced set of guidelines embracing the short, medium and long term aspects.  In order to satisfy the urgent food and health requirements reported to us, the Community is to provide 750 million ECU in aid, of which 250 million ECU will be provided in 1990 and in the form of gifts.  The rest will be in the form of a medium term loan guarantee in accordance with procedures discussed by the ECOFIN Council at its meeting on Monday last.  The aid will be routed in accordance with arrangements to be finalised with the Soviet authorities guaranteeing that the aid actually reaches those for whom it is intended and does not jeopardise the gradual advance towards normality of supplies in accordance with market rules.</P>
    <P>As regards the more medium to long <Col N="431" /> term reorganisation and rehabilitation of the Soviet economy, the European Council felt that the Community's role must above all, be to co-operate with the USSR in order to help it to mobilise its own resources.  Thus, the emphasis was placed on technical assistance and the transfer of knowhow.</P>
    <P>The Commission was again requested to explore with the Soviet authorities the idea of a major agreement between the Community and the USSR, encompassing a political dialogue and covering all aspects of close economic co-operation and co-operation in the cultural sphere, with a view to concluding such an agreement as quickly as possible and certainly by the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>We were also agreed that we should support the Soviet Union Government's aim gradually to integrate its economy into the world economy and that the Community and its member states will use their influence to facilitate USSR membership of international financial institutions, in particular the IMF, which must form the main framework for macro-economic assistance.</P>
    <P>The Community's assistance to the countries of Eastern Europe is now to be taken further through a new generation of so-called &ldquo;European agreements&rdquo;, a deeper form of association agreement which will mark a new stage in the Community policy of developing increasingly close relations with those countries.</P>
    <P>However, in Rome we noted that the general process of reform in those countries is being threatened by external disturbances and constraints arising from, <i>inter alia</i>, the Gulf crisis, which are very seriously affecting their financial situation.  Czechoslovakia, for example, has extremely low resources of oil.  To help them meet these difficulties, we agreed that initiatives will be taken, within the G24 framework in particular, to meet the financing requirements of those countries which are not otherwise covered by public or private contributions and which are estimated at 4,000 million dollars.</P>
    <P>The European Council noted that the <Col N="432" /> second tranche of ECU 260 million granted to Hungary to support its balance of payments would be adopted this week. In addition, we confirmed that in the context of G24 the Community would support the programme undertaken by Czechoslovakia to stabilise and modernise its economy and to make its currency convertible.</P>
    <P>We also decided on emergency aid of ECU 100 million in the form of food and medicinal products for Bulgaria and Romania and called for urgent examination of the problem arising for these countries because of the risk of interruption of their oil supplies.</P>
    <P>We asked the Council to press ahead with examination of the Commission proposals on credit insurance for exports to the countries of central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Finally, the European Council stated that it was following recent developments in Albania with great interest, and it expressed the hope that that country would gradually move towards democracy.</P>
    <P>Other subjects discussed at the Rome European Council meeting included the internal market, with particular reference to the harmonisation of indirect taxes, the free movement of persons; transport policy and the social dimension; action to combat drugs, and relations with third countries.</P>
    <P>On the internal market, a recently submitted report from the Commission had highlighted that all the proposals required to meet the 1992 deadline have now been submitted and that over two-thirds of these have been adopted by the Council.  In the Presidency Conclusions we invite the Community institutions and the member states to make every effort to ensure that all the outstanding measures are adopted in 1991.  We single out for particular attention the area of indirect taxation &mdash; the House is aware of the severe budgetary difficulties which the Commission proposals in their present form pose for this country &mdash; free decisions to be taken to respect the 1992 deadline as well as calling for measures on immigration and related issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> I am, of course, particularly pleased with the European Council's call that special attention be given to the situation of the peripheral countries in the context of EC transport policy.  The House can be assured that we will be actively following up on that commitment, not least in the area of Community funding which needs to be significantly increased if the aims of the EC's transport policy, including integration and cohesion, are to be achieved.  For example, the EC's transport infrastructure fund, which we succeeded in finally getting agreement to last June under our EC Presidency after a delay of over 14 years, is clearly underfunded.</P>
    <P>The Summit stressed the importance of the social dimension in the Community's integration and that the Single Market must be accompanied by real improvements in employment and in the living and working conditions of all our citizens. We stressed the need to adopt without delay the proposals on health and safety protection as well as highlighting a number of other proposals whose adoption needs to be speeded up, taking account of the aim of creating and developing employment and the need to respect the different customs and traditions of the member states in the social area.</P>
    <P>On drugs, we asked for the rapid implementation of the programme submitted by CELAD, in fulfilment of the mandate given to it by last June's meeting here of the European Council.</P>
    <P>The House will note that the European Council also adopted guidelines on a number of external relations issues such as the EFTA countries, Mediterranean policy, Latin America and the ACP countries.</P>
    <P>The Council issued four declarations in the foreign policy field.  On South Africa, it welcomed the process of change and decided that, as soon as the South African Government take legislative action to repeal the pillars of apartheid constituted by the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, the Twelve will relax the sanctions they imposed in 1986.  It decided to lift one of these immediately, the ban on new <Col N="434" /> investments, in order to combat unemployment, to improve the economic and social situation in the country and to encourage the movement under way aimed at the complete abolition of apartheid. The declaration on the different aspects of the Middle East reiterated the earnest hope for a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis, the need for a just and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and to the Palestinian problem and the hope that recent developments are leading to national reconciliation in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Before the Council proper, I had a meeting with Prime Minister Andreotti and raised with him certain questions affecting Irish interests of the Council. Mr. Andreotti was most helpful in his approach.  I would like to take this opportunity of placing on the record of this House my appreciation of the courtesy and understanding he showed during our stay in Rome and our gratitude for the smooth and effective way in which he and Foreign Minister De Michelis ran a complex and what could have been a difficult Council.  Our thanks are due to them both and to the Italian officials who carried through their demanding work with such efficiency.</P>
    <P>I had a brief informal meeting with Prime Minister Major and congratulated him on his appointment.  We agreed to have a further meeting in the New Year for a discussion on Community and bilateral issues.</P>
    <P>Our discussions on political union in Rome were among the best I have witnessed at a European Council meeting, both for their thoroughness and comprehensiveness on all the issues involved as well as their taking place in a friendly and co-operative spirit throughout.</P>
    <P>As a result of the meeting, the stage is now set for the two IGCs which were officially launched immediately afterwards to begin their work on issues which could alter fundamentally the relationships between the member states and the Community and change the way the Community does its business in the world at large.  These conferences have rightly been described as being the most critical <Col N="435" /> conferences held since the EC was established in 1958, and it is in all our interests that their work be carried through effectively and with full understanding of the historic importance to the issues with which they are dealing.  The House can be assured that the Government will throughout both of the IGCs take all necessary steps to ensure that this country's interests are protected and advanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the results of this meeting in the format in which they were covered in the Presidency conclusions: first, with political union.  This was the first and, for many members, the most important aspect of the entire Council.  Political union was dealt with under a number of headings. The first of these was the creation of a democratic legitimacy for the new political union of Europe.  In order to give a genuinely democratic legitimacy to this new European union, the Council proposes that extra powers be given to the European Parliament in matters such as assent to international agreements, the appointment of members of the Commission and to increase the powers of the parliament over the budget and the monitoring of Community policies. Therefore, it would seem that it will not be long before it will be the European Parliament, not the Irish Government, that will have the final say in the appointment of the Irish member of the European Commission.  It would also seem that it is the intention of the Council in Rome that many of the powers currently exercised by the Council of Ministers &mdash; where Ireland has one vote in 12 &mdash; will soon be exercised by the parliament where Ireland has a smaller proportionate voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From newspaper reports it would appear that the Irish Government is one of the few governments in Europe opposed to the creation of a greater democratic legitimacy for European political union along these lines.  I can understand the feelings of the Taoiseach that Ireland's vote at the Council of Ministers <Col N="436" />&mdash; one vote in 12 &mdash; is a lot more valuable and powerful than the number of votes we would have in a European Parliament in comparison with our size and its size.</P>
    <P>I do agree that small countries need protection when they enter into a federal system of this kind.  When the smaller states formed the United States of America with the larger states, they insisted that there be a two-Chamber Parliament. In the Lower Chamber seats were to be allocated on the basis of population but, in the Upper Chamber, the US Senate, seats were to be allocated on the basis of equality between states.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a federal structure in Europe &mdash; I believe we should and that it is inevitable that we will have &mdash; then I believe we should have two Houses, not one, in the European Parliament.  The Upper House should be one in which Ireland would have as many seats as Germany or France.  The Upper House should be given equal powers to the Lower House, as has the United States Senate in comparison with the United States House of Representatives.  If Vermont can have as many Senators as Texas, why should Ireland not have as many Members of the Upper House of the European Parliament as France?</P>
    <P>Instead of putting forward a proposal of this kind, or indeed any proposal, to protect Ireland's interests &mdash; which would be consistent with democratic legitimacy but would recognise the problems of smaller countries like ours &mdash; the present Irish Government seem to be simply attempting in a churlish way to resist any enhancement of the powers of the European Parliament.  This is typical of the approach of this Government to almost all European matters.  They resist change rather than try to harness change to suit Ireland's interests.  They are gradually out-manoeuvred and by-passed because they have no active policy of their own.  I want to know why the Taoiseach did not suggest a bicameral system for the European Parliament at the Rome Summit.  Surely he should have tabled an Irish proposal before the meeting suggesting this so as to have the issue on the European agenda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> The Council said: &ldquo;Consideration should be given to arrangements allowing national parliaments to play their full role in the Community's development.&rdquo;  This commitment to giving national parliaments a say in Community affairs is gloriously unspecific.  What exactly do the European Heads of Government have in mind?  Has the Taoiseach tabled any ideas of his own as to how Dáil Éireann should be involved in European decision making in European political union?  Is he simply waiting for others to make suggestions along these lines or has he any ideas of his own?  He certainly put no ideas before the House this morning.</P>
    <P>The European Council conclusions also state that they note the particular importance of arrangements to &ldquo;take account of the special competence of regional or local institutions as regards Community policies.&rdquo;  This seems to mean that the Rome Summit has in mind that county councils in Ireland will have a role in EC policy.  What role does the Taoiseach envisage for local or regional institutions in Ireland in this context?  He has tabled no proposals of his own on this matter nor has he told the House his intentions in regard to this aspect of the Rome Summit conclusions.  Again he seems simply to be waiting for the European Commission to table proposals on this matter to which Ireland will then react rather than table his own.  We need to know how this EC conclusion will affect proposals for local government reform in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance attached by the European Summit to local institutions and local government, it is extremely regrettable that this Irish Government have failed to publish the report prepared by experts, commissioned by them at public expense, on local government reform in Ireland.  I understand this is a very thorough document but because it contains politically embarrassing ideas the Government are unwilling to publish it.  I believe the Government should immediately publish that report of the <Col N="438" /> committee of experts on local government reform which is particularly important in view of the prominence given to local government by the Rome Summit.</P>
    <P>I now turn to common foreign and security policy.  The Summit conclusions contain proposals for an institutional framework which, in regard to security matters, would involve the possibility of recourse to qualified majority voting on the implementation of agreed policies. This seems to mean that on security matters Ireland could find a Community decision imposed on it by a majority vote. I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would clarify exactly what area of security policy will be covered by this proposal for qualified majority voting instead of the present system of a unanimous vote.  There is no definition in the Presidency conclusions of the Rome Summit as to what constitutes &ldquo;security&rdquo;.  We are told this will be developed with particular reference &ldquo;initially&rdquo; to issues such as arms control, disarmament and CSCE matters.  If these matters are to be dealt with initially, what are the matters that will be dealt with subsequently?  We are not told that, and the Taoiseach has not told us that this morning.  We should have a clear and full definition of what constitutes common security in Europe, otherwise we are all talking at cross purposes in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Presidency conclusions on the development of a common European defence policy make no reference to Irish neutrality.  Indeed, the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; does not appear in the Rome conclusions. There are vague references to &ldquo;traditional positions of other member states&rdquo;, not even named.  That could refer to the German position in regard to membership of NATO; it could refer to anything, but there is no reference to Ireland in this context, no reference to neutrality in this context, it is simply a play on words for the Taoiseach to pretend to read that into what is said.  What matters is not what people say in briefings afterwards, but what is actually said, and there is no reference to this matter.  The word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; does not appear anywhere in the Presidency conclusions.</P>
    <P>I want to state my position on that.  If <Col N="439" /> Europe is to have a common defence policy it is literally and logically impossible for any part of Europe to remain neutral in an area covered by a common defence policy.  Does the Taoiseach agree or disagree with that statement?  Does he believe it is possible for Ireland to remain neutral and yet be part of a European Community which has a European defence dimension?  The answer is a simple yes or no.  If he does not believe that to be possible, what value is to be placed on any &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; there may be on the part of other countries of Ireland's &ldquo;traditional position&rdquo;?  It may be the sort of understanding that is extended to an eccentric relative at Christmas time: people will put up with him for the duration of the Christmas season but hope not to see him for the rest of the year.  They may understand it all right but that does not mean that when it comes to the crunch Ireland will be able to avoid deciding whether to be a full member of the Community with a defence dimension or opt out and become a sort of external economic protectorate which is not fully a member of the Community. That is the choice we are facing and that is the choice the Taoiseach this morning tried to dodge and continues to dodge.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if Europe is heading towards EPU then there must be a common policy to defend that EPU. Without a common defence policy it would be hard to say there would be genuine political union.  If that is so then Ireland cannot be part of EPU without being part of a common European defence arrangement as well.  That is logical. You cannot create a political union and then say you are not prepared to defend it.  If that is logical the Taoiseach should now start preparing Irish public opinion for this.  He should not wait for this issue to be imposed on the Irish people by somebody else.</P>
    <P>We are always, in this House and in Irish politics generally, waiting for others to tell us we must do things.  If it is not the EC that is telling us what to do, it is the Supreme Court.  Politicians seem to <Col N="440" /> lack the ability to say something should be done because it is right.  They would far prefer to tell the electorate that something must be done because the Supreme Court or the EC said it must be done. Never do we wish to take responsibility on ourselves as political leaders for changing policies.  Irish political leaders here and now should state clearly that if there is to be a common EPU, then that political union must be capable of defending itself.  If it is to be capable of defending itself, then all parts of the political union must be prepared to take part in common defence arrangements.  We should say that now and not adopt this crab-like arrangement where the Taoiseach takes one step forward, two steps backwards and another step forward.  We should not wait for other people to tell us that we should say it.  We should not pretend we do not understand the implications of what is happening.  We should not adopt the &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; attitude. We should face reality now and say that as Irish people we are prepared to take our place in Europe.  We should not be dragged along in a slip-stream created by others.</P>
    <P>The present Government's attitude of ignoring the reality of EPU will damage Ireland's genuine interests in this area.  If Ireland says it is prepared to take part in European defence in certain circumstances it can then try to influence the policies that will be adopted for European defence.  For example, we could insist that any arrangement for European defence would be on the basis of conventional arms only.  We could also insist that any commitment to European defence should be confined to the defence of the European homeland and should not involve external intervention of any kind outside Europe.  These might be sensible policies from anybody's point of view but if we simply ignore the whole process and say it is not really happening, we will not be able to influence it.  That is my main criticism of the present Government.  They are actually damaging Ireland's ability to influence events because they are pretending certain events are not happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> Under the heading of European citizenship I welcome the proposal to establish an EC ombudsman to defend citizens' rights in Community matters.  However, it is very important that this ombudsman have real power.  We have had a spectacle for a number of months where the Irish Government have continued to defy European law by operating a 48-hour rule on cross-Border traffic.  Of what use will a Community ombudsman be if member states continue to ignore his rulings, just as the Irish Government have ignored the ruling of the European Court for several months as regards the 48-hour rule?</P>
    <P>I now refer to the internal market. I note the Rome Summit places major emphasis on the need to give greater urgency to the harmonisation of rates of VAT and excise duties.  The Presidency conclusions states that the Summit believes that &ldquo;proceedings must be completed in the near future and be accompanied by the approximation necessary to satisfy the requirements of a true internal market&rdquo;.  It would appear this must be completed in 1991.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Single European Act a commitment was given that the EC would give help to member states who had particular financial difficulties in approximating their levels of indirect taxes to European averages.  However, no reference is included in the communique issued at the end of the Rome Summit to this commitment.  The Taoiseach should have insisted on the renewal of this commitment to help poorer states in the Rome Summit conclusions.</P>
    <P>In view of the very clear statement of the Rome Summit, I am asking that the Minister for Finance make a full and comprehensive statement of Ireland's plans to harmonise its rates of VAT and excise duties, to European levels, in the Budget Statement next month.</P>
    <P>We should have, from the Government, a five year plan for the approximation of Irish VAT and excise duty levels to those obtaining in Europe.  This should be set out in detail in the budget. <Col N="442" /> This is not an issue that can be left hanging in the air, or dealt with on a year-to-year basis.  We should have a clear plan. I am demanding that the Government should publish such a plan in the 1991 budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I write my own scripts. Unfortunately, I had not noticed the debate was taking place at this time.  I had to work late last night to finish this.</P>
      <P>The passages in the Presidency conclusions of the Summit on the social dimension are extremely weak.  There is a statement that the establishment of a large single market, &ldquo;must result in a genuine improvement in employment and in the living and working conditions of all Community citizens&rdquo;.  Yet there is no clear commitment from the Summit to actually do anything to ensure that this really happens.</P>
      <P>I believe that the European Community should accept responsibility to support the budgets of poorer member states across the board.  Within the German federal system the budgets of poorer Lander are supported, across the board by richer Lander.  There are straight transfers of money from the rich to the poor.  The poor Lander are allowed to use these transfers in the way that they think best in the interests of their citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in marked contrast to the system whereby the European Community transfers resources from the rich parts of the Community to the poor.  Under the European Community's system, officials in Brussels lay down detailed criteria for the use of the money.  For example it is possible to get money for training, but not for education.  As a result of this detailed prescription laid down in Brussels, we have the ludicrous situation where one can get EC aid to train <Col N="443" /> accountants in University College Dublin, while no European money at all is made available for primary education. From the point of view of employment it is far more important to ensure that people do not leave our primary schools illiterate, than it is to provide additional subsidies to accountancy firms for the training of staff that they would be training anyway at their own expense.</P>
    <P>This illustrates the ludicrous system of aid from the rich to the poor in Europe.  I believe that the Irish Government should have tabled their own proposals demanding a complete re-structuring of the European system of budgetary support for poorer countries.  We should have demanded an across the board system of support for budgets of member states on the basis of objective criteria like income, levels of dependency and general demographic structure.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a particularly high dependency ratio in Europe.  On that basis we have a right to demand that Europe give us extra support for all matters, such as old age pensions and education, which require exceptionally high expenditure because we have a high dependency ratio.</P>
    <P>I note that the Rome Summit emphasised &ldquo;the importance of the family as an essential aspect of solidarity and social cohesion&rdquo;.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Irish Government are currently in breach of the European Social Charter, adopted by the Council of Europe, in the way they treat children in Irish society.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the House's attention to the fact that the Irish Government are currently in breach of the European Social Charter, adopted by <Col N="444" /> the Council of Europe, in the way in which they treat children in Irish society. They breach this under two headings. We have no tax allowance for children, although we have a tax allowance for adults.  There is no allowance at all for children in the matter of determining eligibility for a hospital services card. These two provisions are in direct breach of the relevant provisions of the Council of Europe's Social Charter.  I have taken this matter up with the Council of Europe.  If Ireland is to genuinely take part in a European policy for the support of the family, it should ensure that it complies with the existing Council of Europe Charter provisions on this matter.</P>
      <P>I now refer to external relations.  The brief paragraph on the breakdown of the world trade negotiations in the Summit communique displays no sense of urgency about this.  The reality is that we may well be facing an outbreak of protectionism in the world of a kind similar to that which plunged the world into depression in the thirties.  Let us never forget that it was protectionism that aggravated and spread the disease initiated by the collapse of stock markets in 1929 and 1930.  Without protectionism, these problems would have been overcome.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the US Government will soon be unable to enter into a world trade deal because the authority conferred on them by Congress will have expired.  The attitude of US legislators to world trade is extremely narrow minded. They have a view that it is simply a question of striking bilateral deals with individual countries.  They have no understanding of the fact that world trade is an arrangement in which everybody gains from opening up their market.  A third country can gain indirectly from the enhancement of trade between two other countries.  It is not simply a question of one dimensional relations between one state and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly criticise the Irish Government for failing to use their contacts in the United States, during the Irish EC Presidency to argue for a more enlightened attitude to world trade matters on <Col N="445" /> Capitol Hill.  I realise that Ireland, on its own, could not change this situation.  But we failed to make any effort in this area at all.  If the world trade talks fail, and if the Irish economy suffers, the failure to use the Presidency constructively to influence opinion in the United States, will have been a contributory factor.</P>
    <P>Finally, I refer to the Gulf crisis.  I note that the Taoiseach has supported, in this context, the sort of dialogue offered by President Bush to Saddam Hussein.  I note also that he has supported the concept of complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty and of its legitimate government. This seems to rule out any compromise involving even the most minor territorial concession to Iraq or the restoration of any Government other than the one that was ousted by the Iraqi invasion.  This is the correct position to adopt but it must be recognised that it leaves very little room for manoeuvre in any discussions.  I do not think the House should be under any illusion about this matter or pretend that somehow or other it will all be all right on the night.  In fact, the positions adopted at the Rome Summit are extremely hard and leave very little room for manoeuvre, and it is significant that these are conclusions from which the Taoiseach has not dissented in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is important that the Taoiseach should report back to the House and that we should have an opportunity of commenting on the events that took place at the European Council in Rome.  It is not the ideal form of debate and we are not doing ourselves a service by having it.  Obviously, we might be as well off faxing in our statements at this stage in terms of who is listening.  It is unfortunate that we do not have the opportunity of putting some questions to the Taoiseach, and some very important questions were raised as a consequence of the meeting last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we have sought a proper debate in relation to these conclusions in the past and I would again ask today of the Minister for Finance, and the <Col N="446" /> Government, that an opportunity be afforded in the first instance to get a written report from the Government.  We should be given an opportunity to study the contents of that report and then a proper debate should take place in the House during which an exchange of views could take place and the Taoiseach could respond to points raised.</P>
    <P>We can take some comfort from what the Taoiseach mentioned in the House yesterday.  He now appears to be relenting on his continuous opposition to the notion of a Dáil committee on foreign affairs.  I would like to believe that the Taoiseach has in mind an independent and strong foreign affairs committee, one which would be properly funded and staffed and one which can be of assistance to the Department of Foreign Affairs and, indeed, to the Government in the formulation of European economic and foreign policy, an area which will be far more demanding in the future than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it is extremely unlikely that anything we say will have any influence on the Taoiseach.  I propose to use this opportunity to place on record my views on where the national interest lies in this whole debate and on where the interests of the ordinary people of Europe lie.  On the last occasion the Taoiseach outlined to this House his vision of where the future of Europe lay, which was on 14 June last, he spoke of the economic and budgetary discipline that would, of necessity, flow from economic and monetary union.  I remember saying at that time that the speech which the Taoiseach made on that day would not have surprised me if it had been made by Chancellor Kohl in the Bundestag or, indeed, by Mrs. Thatcher or her successor, Prime Minister Major, in the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>One passage in the Taoiseach's speech on 14 June has certainly found echoes in what the Taoiseach has said since and in what he is saying this morning.  I quote that reference:</P>
    <P>On the economic side, while the system would be more decentralised, <Col N="447" /> it should provide for close co-operation between member states on macro-economics and budgetary policies.  To the latter end, it should contain rules and procedures designed to ensure budgetary discipline, including rules prescribing the monetary or compulsory financing of budget deficits and the automatic bailing out by the Community of a single member state in difficulty.  At the level of the member states and the Community the system should also embrace policies to promote cohesion, efficiency, competitiveness and integration across the Community.</P>
    <P>This House must be clearly aware of the priorities inherent in this passage. Cohesion is lumped together with efficiency and competitiveness as an after-thought.</P>
    <P>The big issue, however, is budgetary discipline.  One would think, listening to all of this, that our Taoiseach had secured the services of Mrs. Thatcher from her elegant retirement.  One might even think that he was a Taoiseach who was presiding over a budget surplus with all the country's social needs being met.  The reality is that we know exactly what the Taoiseach means when he talks about discipline.  He means wholesale cuts in health, education, housing, and essential social spending will not be redressed.  In the hands of the Government, budgetary discipline means that it is the poor, the handicapped and the marginalised who must be disciplined.  As far as the ordinary people &mdash; the young, the old, the disabled, the children, the women, the workers and the unemployed citizens of Europe &mdash; are concerned the question they want answered is what will European economic and monetary union mean to them.  The question I pose is: who remembers the Social Charter? When was the last time it was mentioned, other than in passing, at a European summit and how high is it on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference?</P>
    <P>What must be recognised is that the economic and monetary union that we <Col N="448" /> are talking about is a process designed essentially to increase the wealth of the Community.  That is as it should be, and we should be supportive of that concept. But there must be another process too, a process designed to ensure that that extra wealth is used wisely and fairly, and that the people of Europe are enabled to share in it.  That must happen at two levels. At the European level, there must be developments in European social policy and in European industrial policy whose purpose is to ensure the fair distribution of prosperity.  Without such developments, power, wealth, influence and privilege will all gravitate to the centre. But where are they?  Why is it only possible to talk about discipline, and common currencies, if one wants to be a good European?  Why does it not seem posible for good Europeans to demand a Europe that is good for all its people?</P>
    <P>The other level at which there must be development is here at home.  We face the prospect of strict control of spending imposed by the disciplines inherent in monetary union.  We face that prospect apparently sublimely unaware that there are huge neglected areas of the social life of this country which need to be addressed &mdash; and which will never be addressed by the rules of the marketplace. The marketplace may be a very efficient mechanism for offering individuals choice, but it is not a mechanism which enables anyone to claim their rights.  In health, education, shelter, the protection of the environment, the advancement of the rights of women and minorities, and in relation to the whole issue of poverty in our country, we have obligations as a community which we cannot discharge if we allow our hands to be totally tied by arbitrarily imposed disciplines.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union is a logical next step from the internal market process &mdash; I accept that.  Its purpose is to present Europe with the possibility of currency and price stability, and with an end to damaging fluctuations in interest rates.  The overall concept may well demand both an EC central banking system, and perhaps ultimately a single currency, and we fully accept the need <Col N="449" /> to proceed with work on both of these concepts.</P>
    <P>However, I have no interest in EMU simply for its own sake, or as part of a process of liberating financial markets to greater heights of speculation.  The EC and its member states must not be sacrificed on the altar of strict monetary policy, unconnected to broader economic concerns.  EMU must imply both economic and monetary policy considerations. The overall approach must support an economic policy aimed at securing sustainable growth, and the translation of that growth into jobs through a coherent industrial strategy. The issues of regional development and convergence must remain central to the economic policies of the Community, together with policies to end the poverty and marginalisation of so many of our people.</P>
    <P>Turning to the subject of political union, the Taoiseach is sending out very confusing signals on the subject of Ireland's military neutrality and I suspect that he is doing so quite deliberately.  I thought that he was laying the bait for the largest Opposition Party to clarify their position in the first instance but, after Deputy Bruton's statement this morning, we can now take it that Fine Gael are saying quite clearly that neutrality should be abandoned by the Irish State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make our position very clear and I will not mince my words. I will state our position in regard to neutrality as opposed to what happened in the last 15 minutes.  It is vital that not only should this House know &mdash; in this area I agree with Deputy Bruton &mdash; but that the people should know where the Government and the parties stand on the issue of neutrality.  I have been seeking a debate on neutrality, which means different things to different people.  It is also important to debate the issue within the parties before it is debated in this House. The Taoiseach has been, quite deliberately, using the words &ldquo;security&rdquo; and &ldquo;defence&rdquo; to imply totally distinct and unrelated concepts in the hope that people will not notice what is happening, that the concepts will become blurred and that things will happen without the people becoming aware of them.  I am not sure if the Government want to change policy but, if they do, they should first seek the approval of the people and of <Col N="451" /> this House, and they should also make it very clear what they want to do.  They should not allow themselves to be dragged, reluctantly or otherwise into making a decision, or hoping that the decisions will be made by others and that they can say they have no choice.  It is a policy matter which has served this country well, and even though people dispute its origin and the reasons for Ireland adopting a neutral stance, we should certainly not give it away.</P>
      <P>There is now reason for genuine hope of lasting global peace, for a new era of world-wide co-operation in the face of world-wide problems &mdash; poverty, ignorance, arms trading, drugs, health &mdash; and in coping with regional problems and confrontations. This co-operation must be speedily reflected in major arms control successes which will, at last, give the world an opportunity to transfer cash, human resources and expertise from armaments to developmental projects.  In this regard, I welcome the decision of the EC to offer assistance to Russia in dealing with its present problems.  But I would warn against any such assistance being offered at the cost of a dilution of the EC's commitments under the Fourth Lomé Convention.  There is still major famine in many parts of Africa, and the starving people of the Sudan must not be ignored in the face of the troubles in Russia.</P>
      <P>I want to state our position on neutrality again in this House.  We believe that it should be made clear that there will be no preconditions to a full involvement in the developing Europe relating to military entanglements or doctrines. Ireland has, I believe, played its full part in the emerging Europe, and can continue to do so.  We are also, and for my part we must remain, a country free of military entanglements.  There has been some debate in our country, and particularly within some of the larger parties, on this issue.  But for as long as I lead the Left in Ireland, we will oppose any abandonment or dilution of that neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be no confusion on this <Col N="452" /> score.  I hope the debate will clarify the issues and rid us of the confusion which has bedevilled the subject for the last couple of years.  A country which will not join any military entanglement but which volunteers to take part in every UN peacekeeping effort is just as entitled to respect as the most powerful member of NATO.  A country which has refused to have any truck with the nuclear game is just as entitled to be taken seriously in discussions on security as a country which pollutes the open seas with toxic wastes derived from lethal weapons systems.  It is not the mark of a good European that he should be willing to send Irish soldiers to die in wars over issues which can and must be settled by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his statement mentioned &mdash; I think he was quoting some newspapers &mdash; that an opportunity has been created for West European states, Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland, to join the Community in spite of the neutrality of all except Norway.  Certainly the issue of neutrality of Austria, Sweden and Finland has been raised in discussions with politicians from those countries over the years, even though most of them want to wait until after 1992 to see how the Community evolves before they open up full discussions.  I would welcome access by those neutral countries, if it is possible for them, as we are being led to believe, and it certainly needs clarification, to retain their traditional neutrality.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister for Finance, and the Government, that the time is long past when the Government should have published a detailed position paper outlining their policies in regard to all the issues in a developing Europe.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that the Government should lead the debate on this matter. The people of Ireland want to be better informed on what is happening.  Whether we like it or not, whether we are pro-European or anti-European, the reality is that our future is very much tied up with the development of Europe.  We should be pro-active rather than being led, as appears to be the case despite the Taoiseach's protestations and despite efforts in this House to clarify the <Col N="453" /> Government's role, their submissions and their lead or lack of it in these events.</P>

We are looking to the future, a future where the ideals we have believed in for all of our existence can find their full expression in a European society committed to justice, equality and freedom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has expressed pleasure and satisfaction at the outcome of last weekend's European Council in Rome on 14 and 15 December but I fail to see the basis for such an optimistic assessment.  His optimism may be due to the fact that no immediate major changes in the area of security and defence policies were announced.  If so, it simply reflects the Government's persistent &ldquo;let's hope we'll escape again&rdquo; mentality.  The facts are that the European Council meeting provided precious little to benefit peripheral regions, weaker economies within the Community or recognition that Irish neutrality could play an active role in shaping future EC security policies, as distinct from being ignored, pushed away into a corner and told to be quiet.  Neither was there anything new or decisive on issues such as implementation of the Social Charter, or ensuring greater democracy for the Community's institutions.</P>
      <P>The question of democratic accountability in the Community is another area which needs close attention.  I notice that while political union and democratic legitimacy are mentioned on the first page of the communique, there is still a great deal of vagueness on the matter. While there are many proposals which suggest extension of the Parliament's powers, such as developing co-decision procedures on acts of a legislative nature, these proposals are only to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another proposal for extension and <Col N="454" /> improvement of the co-operation procedure with the European Parliament, shows the vagueness of the commitment to enhancing the powers of the Parliament. It gives no indication of how, in what areas and when such co-operation will be developed.  To take yet another example, the proposal for involvement of the European Parliament in the appointment of the Commission and its President is welcome, but what does &ldquo;involvement&rdquo; mean?  The Parliament should have a direct say, but &ldquo;involvement&rdquo; could turn out simply to mean making recommendations that can be ignored, or even merely commenting or debating on appointments after the event.  On the vital area of EC common foreign and security policy, there is only reference to &ldquo;consulting and informing the European Parliament&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given the current rapid development of the 1992 process, such vagueness will only serve to deprive the democratically elected European Parliament of a real and effective say during this crucial stage in the development of the Community and will heighten fears among national parliamentarians.  With the move towards increasing centralisation of powers in the Community, there is need for ever greater attention to be paid to the rights of the citizen to a meaningful participation in the Community.  This means first, of course, granting increased powers to the European Parliament.  But a Parliament in Strasbourg, not matter how democratic, is still very far removed from the immediate and day to day needs of regional and local areas.  The Community must ensure the development of structures and funding arrangements for local democracy, which will facilitate the transfer of real decision-making powers to local communities.</P>
    <P>On the question of the social dimension, lip service is again paid to implementation of the Social Charter. On the one hand stress is placed on the importance of pressing ahead more actively with the application of the action programme for the implementation of the Charter.  On the other hand emphasis is again placed on the need to respect the <Col N="455" /> different customs and traditions of the member states.  This is nothing more than a euphemism for toleration of widely varying standards in social legislation between member states, and an excuse for any member state which wishes to deny basic rights to its citizens and allow the continuation of various discriminatory practices.</P>
    <P>We still have the scandalous situation of no legislative protection for low paid workers here in Ireland.  Wage levels in the Republic run at 67 per cent of the EC average.  Rights for young workers, the disabled, women with young children and other vulnerable sections of the society and workforce are weaker here than in many other member states.</P>
    <P>The question of a common security policy is dealt with in the conclusions of the European Council under &ldquo;Aims&rdquo;, &ldquo;Institutional Framework&rdquo; and &ldquo;Decision Making Process&rdquo;, Under &ldquo;Aims&rdquo; it makes no reference to denuclearisation as an objective, no reference to destroying the chemical and biological weapons capability of various EC states.  Under &ldquo;Decision Making Process&rdquo; it clearly envisages a continuation of arms exports by those countries already engaged in that deplorable trade.</P>
    <P>On defence policy the EC clearly envisages not only the continuation of NATO and the welding of WEU and the EC, but the continued treatment of Ireland's neutrality as an irrelevancy, while at the same time requesting examination of commitment by member states to provide &ldquo;mutual assistance&rdquo;.  On virtually all of the above issues Ireland as a neutral country should have a unique point of view to express, considerably different from the position of other member states, who are members of NATO.  To take one such example, what did Ireland have to say about co-ordination of armaments export policy referred to in the conclusions? It is, after all, arms exports from the developed world which have created the nightmare scenario of a war in the Gulf in which chemical and highly sophisticated conventional weapons may <Col N="456" /> cause untold casualties.  Instead of coordinating export of such weapons of mass destruction, we should propose a halt to such deadly exports.  But did we? Clearly we did not or we would have been told about it by the Taoiseach today.</P>
    <P>There is also reference to non-proliferation. What case did Ireland make on examining ways of reducing and eliminating the nuclear stockpile in the EC, both those controlled by NATO and those maintained individually by some member states?  Again, clearly, it was not raised or we would have been told so by the Taoiseach today.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that other countries, particularly those with militaristic, expansionist or repressive governments, will seek to produce or acquire their own nuclear capability.  If we want a world which is genuinely free of the threat of nuclear destruction, then we must seek to eliminate such weapons from this Continent as well as prevent their proliferation elsewhere.  It is clear that the Irish Government are having no impact on development of policy in this area and probably never even raised the issues. The relatively slow progress towards a common, and increasingly binding, EC security policy, which is hailed by the Taoiseach, is due more to varying emphasis and priorities within the European NATO powers than the active promotion by Ireland of an alternative view.  But then this is hardly surprising as Ireland does not seem to have an alternative view of how the EC security system should evolve, confining itself simply to saying, &ldquo;our traditional neutrality precludes us from joining military alliances &mdash; but of course if you chaps come up with a system of defence you can count on us to join in.&rdquo;  If the EC decides to go to war in some future Gulf style scenario, Irish troops could be expected to join in.</P>
    <P>Although this is projected for some future date we are undoubtedly talking of a time span of just a few years, not decades.  Mr. Jacques Delors has warned that another Inter-Governmental Conference may be needed in a few years to tidy up on such issues.  In this sense the Taoiseach can argue to be correct when <Col N="457" /> he says our traditional neutrality, as he calls it, has not been compromised, but of course there is no evidence that anyone is seeking to compromise it.  Our neutrality as enunciated by the Taoiseach effectively neuters us in the development of the EC security area.  There is no need for us to be seduced by anybody within the European Community.</P>

      <P>There is no vision from the Taoiseach or the Government on the future of Ireland and Irish neutrality in the European Community, in Europe generally or in the world.  His situation is more one of continually coming back from European capitals, his brow mopped, to tell us that his masterly silence has once again postponed the day when our neutrality will be no more.  Such an ostrich-type attitude gives the impression at home and further feeds the view abroad that Ireland's neutrality is indeed out of date and negotiable, that we are not ready to ditch it just yet but we will as soon as the price is right.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the communiqué could not even bring itself to refer to neutrality.  It referred to our &ldquo;traditional position&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the traditional and outdated position of a Europe divided along NATO and Warsaw Pact lines is being revised by the other member states. They are endeavouring to ensure a framework which will maintain many elements of the old aggressive military structures in devising their new approach despite voices of former NATO generals who argue for the abolition of NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach clearly lacks the vision to insist on the aim of a Europe in which a policy of positive and active neutrality and non-alignment, denuclearisation, elimination of chemical and biological weapons, conversion of arms industries to useful production and the withdrawal of foreign troops from members states is the aim.  There is not even a mention of the application for membership of two <Col N="458" /> other neutral states, that of Austria, gathering dust for the past two years, and that of Sweden, which virtually on the eve of the European Council took a decision to apply for EC membership.</P>
    <P>An Oireachtas foreign affairs committee could and should be developing a policy on these lines, could and should be encouraging public debate on these issues, could and should be addressing urgently the definition of neutrality and non-alignment in the post-cold war era. Clearly different countries will have differing definitions and requirements, but in basic terms for Ireland it must mean working for peace and against war, in favour of disarmament and against militarism and military blocs.  It must support the process of dialogue at all levels between all countries as a means of preventing confrontation.  It must serve to support human rights.</P>
    <P>Instead of attempting to ignore the existence and importance of various forms of neutrality and non-alignment, the Government should actively seek closer contacts with neutral and nonaligned countries like Austria, Sweden and Finland in Europe, and further afield with India and other members of the nonaligned movement.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an Oireachtas foreign affairs committee to deal with these issues in detail is needed now &mdash; not when all major decisions have been taken.  It should be established with the necessary funding and technical arrangements to allow it to produce a report on a positive new definition for Irish foreign policy which will ensure that our voice is heard with respect in all international fora.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the crisis in the Gulf, I want to begin by stating The Workers' Party's total opposition to war in the region.  It is unnecessary, uncalled for and would result in the desert sands of Iraq, Saudi Arabia and perhaps many other countries running with the blood of men, women and children.  It would be a catastrophic war which would affect the lives of millions of people, not just in the Middle East but on every continent.</P>
    <P>To object to war is not to support in <Col N="459" /> any way the actions of Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein.  I have made my condemnation of the Iraqi invasion clear from the day of the invasion.  Indeed, recent demonstrations in America involving tens of thousands of people, show there is an increasing unease and dissatisfaction in that country with the open warmongering of the US Administration and the constant setting of deadlines of war.</P>
    <P>According to estimates from US officials, a full scale war in the Gulf would result in up to 30,000 US casualties alone. The war would not be the <i>blitzkrieg</i> that military public relations and strategy people would like us to believe and could last many months, if not years.</P>
    <P>There is no need to spill human blood in the deserts of the Middle East.  There is a need for the steady pressure of the economic sanctions to ensure that Iraq's aggression against and occupation of Kuwait is reversed.  Full and comprehensive use of United Nations sanctions should be the means by which this crisis is resolved.  There has already been unprecedented international solidarity in support of sanctions on this issue &mdash; East and West, North and South.  Continuation of sanctions would undoubtedly bring freedom to the people of Kuwait.</P>
    <P>I would raise a question about this idea that is being promoted and supported by the European Community about the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait.  I notice in relation to other issues that there is insistence that the people of the Lebanon, for instance, be given the opportunity to elect their own Government.  There is no such insistence with regard to Kuwait, and I wonder why.</P>
    <P>As I said, continuation of sanctions will undoubtedly bring freedom to the people of Kuwait.  Already there are different signals coming from the Iraqi leadership, which indicate an increasing appreciation of the economic consequences of the world economic blocade.</P>
    <P>Iraq cannot survive sanctions indefinitely, or even in the medium term, without trade with the outside world.  Its army will not be able to function without the <Col N="460" /> necessary spare parts for imported military equipment and hardware.  The combined effect of halted exports and imports will grind its industry to a halt.  No country of Iraq's size could bear up under such economic pressure.</P>
    <P>What do we want?  We want freedom for the people of Kuwait.  I would be happy to have that freedom in 12 months by peaceful means rather than so-called freedom after a bitter and bloody war, in 12 weeks, a war which would destroy the prospect of peace and stability in the region for years to come.</P>
    <P>We have already provided refuelling facilities for US warplanes and indeed continually give overflight permission.  To what extent does the Security Council Resolution 678 passed by 12 of the Council's permanent members commit the other members of the UN?  To what extent should we continue to allow such a small and unrepresentative body dictate whether we go to war?  Ireland should insist that the UN General Assembly meet on the issue before 15 January, as I am quite certain that, while virtually everyone wants to maintain sanctions on Iraq, very few want to go to war for what are essentially US strategic ambitions in the region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was discussing spending by the Department of Justice, part of which is dealt with by the Minister for Finance in the past speech on law and order, in which the Minister said expenditure on prisons will increase by 11 per cent, that a great deal of this will go on recruitment of up to 170 prison staff, including medical orderlies, and that an extensive refurbishment programme is under way in St. Patrick's Institution.  This will include significant improvements to the women's prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is on that issue I would like to make my remarks.  We have had in Estimate debates and in other debates on the Department of Justice the same kind of two-line comment about the women's prison.  Still there is no sign that conditions are improving, that the women are being moved or that anything is changing.  Most of the 40 women who are in Mountjoy Prison are there because of social deprivation of one kind or another. It is generally accepted that half of these women should not be in jail at all.  They should have other facilities for which there have been numerous appeals and <Col N="466" /> calls over the years, for example, open prisons, like a non-detention centre. They should not be incarcerated in what is in effect a Victorian dungeon-like prison where rehabilitation is almost hopeless.  Indeed, in many instances it proves to be an academy of drug taking and crime for younger short term prisoners. Why is there always a higher priority in the scale of spending on areas other than on the women's prison? Above all, how can this Government stand over the serious situation which we have had in the last few months in which two 15 year old girls are in jail?  This week the detention of these two young girls is to be challenged in the court again.  Once more we will probably see these young people, who are in great need of help, being bounced around like a rubber ball from one agency to another and from one court to another, and probably inevitably they will be back on the streets.  It is an utter scandal that no one wants to take responsibility for dealing with these girls and others like them.</P>
    <P>Reform of the women's prison was one of the main recommendations of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights earlier this year in its submission to the Minister for Justice.  The recommendations at that time called for a number of changes.  A fundamental recommendation was the need for a secure purpose-built women's prison, divided into appropriate units. That submission also called for an open women's prison for those women prisoners whom the protection of society, does not require to be detained in a closed prison, a separate remand prison for those who, by definition have not been proved guilty by due process, segregation of long term and short term prisoners and segregation of hardened criminals and drug users from prisoners who, on entering prison, are not in that category, and a secure and supportive remand centre for young female offenders, at the absence of which the Joint Committee on Women's Rights continues to be concerned.  Every other category of prisoners have better conditions than women.  I am not saying their conditions are commendable but in every <Col N="467" /> area they have a better quality of life while in prison than do women.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has shown enlightenment and concern in a number of other areas in his Justice brief and he is to be commended for that.  I would ask him now not to have a blind spot about women in prison &mdash; it is a most important area &mdash; and to immediately provide the necessary funding for a concerted policy to change the present conditions under which the 40 women are living and to let us see the effects of the changes.</P>
    <P>This year I visited Maghaberry Prison in Northern Ireland mainly to see the women's prison there.  I was told it was the most modern women's prison in these islands.  The visit was made possible through the Northern Ireland Office.  I found it was easier to organise a visit to that prison in Northern Ireland, and all the other prisons if I want to, than it was to get into the prisons in the Republic. Despite numerous applications to the Minister for Justice earlier in the year for access to Wheatfield and Arbour Hill Prisons I have not been successful.  I know others in this House have an interest in seeing our prisons for themselves and I think we are entitled to be facilitated. What happens inside prison walls is as much our concern and our responsibility as what happens to people outside.</P>
    <P>I deplore the sense of secrecy and suspicion from the Department of Justice on this matter.  I ask the Minister for Justice to facilitate requests for visits from Members of this House.  People who want to go into the prison are well-meaning and probably have an interest, as I have, in the area of prison reform.  I suggest there should be all-party machinery whereby Deputies can apply to go on a prison visit without having to go through a great rigmarole to get in.  Maybe what we should be talking about is an all-party committee on crime, lawlessness and vandalism for which there is a great need.</P>
    <P>At Maghaberry Prison there were only 25 women who occupy a modern building in grounds close to the main men's prison. It is situated about 20 miles from Belfast. Each woman occupies a single cell with <Col N="468" /> toilet facilities and very attractive, brightly painted walls and floral curtains. The facilities include a well equipped three bedroomed hospital, classrooms, an industries workshop, a gym, as well as mother and baby rooms.  The atmosphere throughout that prison was bright and cheerful and the environment of the prison, unlike Mountjoy or any other prison, does not add stress to the time of detention and further punish the inmates. It allows all involved to feel of some worth and deserving of care and commitment.</P>
    <P>This prison's objective is primarily to detain those who have been given a custodial sentence in the courts, but it further aims to seduce inmates away from lives of crime and violence.  It has gone a long way in achieving this through the personal commitment of the Governor of Maghaberry Prison, Mr. Duncan MacLaughlin &mdash; who accompanied me on my tour &mdash; to whom much is owed for the work being done in this prison.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me I would like to refer briefly to another area about which there is great concern that the Government are taking seriously, that is, the chronic need of residential accommodation for people with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that this group can be ignored indefinitely?  Five thousand moderate to severely handicapped people are living at home and are being looked after by their parents who have sacrificed their lives to care for them. Most of these parents will only cease to provide physical care for their children when they become too ill to cope or die. They have made themselves servants for their children but they are now unable to go on.  They have held public meetings, made submissions and even taken to the streets with their children, most of whom are now adults in wheelchairs, trying to get support for their cause.  Apart from an unconvincing commitment to open the empty wards at Cheeverstown House, something which should have been done a long time ago, there has been no response from the Minister for Health or his Department.  No time-scale has been <Col N="469" /> set for the opening of these wards which would only be a small response to this problem.</P>
    <P>This is a most harrowing issue.  It is the most crucial area of neglect in the brief of the Minister for Health.  According to the Eastern Health Board, accommodation is urgently needed in their area for 300 people.  It will cost in the region of £6 million to resolve the problems in this area.  Will the Government give them this money or will they continue to put this problem on the long finger?  There can be few areas of greater need or more deserving of spending than the families who have a severely handicapped person in the home.</P>
    <P>The inadequate level of accommodation has gone beyond a crisis.  There is inadequate respite and rest care for carers.  I know for a fact that the staff in a day centre in my constituency often take their charges home with them if parents are ill or have to go to a family wedding or funeral.  These staff are willing, without any additional pay or being insured to do so, to take their severely handicapped charges home with them for the night in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>This debate is mainly about magnificent amounts of money, the finances of the State, macro-economics, etc.  I believe that people and their needs can get lost in this socio-economic plan and all the jargon that goes with it.  I want to refer to a number of cases which will illustrate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In another case a woman of 26 lives at home with her parents, her father is 75.  Again they have nowhere to put her.  These cases are <Col N="470" /> well documented and indicate the chronic crisis in this area which is deserving of funding.  I ask that these people be considered in this year's budget.</P>

      <P>Tugann an tairiscint atá ós comhair an Tí seo deis dúinn labhairt ar na Meastacháin Choimrithe don bhliain atá le teacht agus, ag an am gcéanna, féachaint siar ar an dul chun cinn a rinneadh i rith na bliana atá beagnach thart.</P>
      <P>Firstly, 1990 will be an historic year because of the progress we have made in the environment area.  We had the Green Presidency for the first six months of the year which raised environmental awareness to new heights and, last week, the Bill to establish the Environmental Protection Agency was published and presented to Seanad Éireann.  My declared intention over the past few years to bring environmental issues to centre stage has paid off handsomely and these issues are now recognised as a major agenda item for Government.  Our record in Europe in dealing with environmental issues during our Presidency has been acclaimed by all our partners there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, 1990 saw the economic progress, which was begun by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987, continue.  We now have one of the lowest inflation levels in Europe, an achievement of which we should all be proud.  Other major economic indicators have remained positive throughout the year, thus giving the country the firm confidence boost it needs, especially when there is so much doom and gloom in other economies.  I was particularly heartened by the results of the labour force survey published last October.  It showed that the total number of people at work <Col N="471" /> increased by 30,000 in the period mid-April 1989 to mid-April 1990.  This was the largest annual increase in employment for over a decade.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson for all sectors of the economy in these results.  We want to continue this impressive achievement and to build on it through a new Programme for Economic and Social Development.  Some of the partners in the negotiations may have different goals to achieve, but I do not think I am wrong in saying that a goal shared by all sectors is to secure further reductions in the overall unemployment level over the next few years.</P>
    <P>As far as my Department's Estimates for 1991 are concerned, I am pleased to say that the various provisions will contribute to increasing employment next year, while at the same time providing very worthwhile infrastructural and social services for the community, particularly in the roads and housing areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer initially to the construction industry which, according to many experts, acts as a barometer of the state of the economy.  In that case, I have good news.  The recovery in the construction industry, which began in 1988, has been maintained and growth in output is set to continue in 1991.  Overall output increased by nearly 8 per cent in 1989 and by a further 10 per cent in 1990. The total value of construction output in 1990 is estimated at over £3,000 million and direct employment in the industry now stands at 77,000.  The recovery in the residential property market, together with growth in new commercial and retail construction, have been primarily responsible for the continued strong performance of the industry.  New house completions in 1990 are running at 9 per cent up on the 1989 level.  Retail and commercial volume output increased by one-quarter in 1990.  This increase, following on increases since 1987, reflects the confidence which private investors have in the Government's economic policies. I am satisfied that further prudent <Col N="472" /> management of the economy will maintain the conditions and climate which are necessary for further growth in the industry.</P>
    <P>Nineteen hundred and ninety-one will also see a further significant increase in the public capital programme affecting the building industry.  The £51 million increase, provided for in the &ldquo;Summary of Public Capital Programme, 1991&rdquo;, represents an increase of 5 per cent over 1990.  This will have a positive impact on overall output in the industry and should generate up to 1,500 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that the improvement of our national road network is essential to offset the effects of Ireland's peripheral location within the EC.  The recently published operational programme provides for roads investment of £616 million over the period 1989-93, of which £416 million will be financed by the European Regional Development Fund.  Other non-programme investment will bring central Government expenditure on roads in the period to over £900 million.</P>
    <P>The fundamental objective of the operational programme is to reduce the impact on economic activity of Ireland's peripheral location and, in particular, to reduce the cost of internal and access transport.  This complex undertaking requires a balanced, co-ordinated approach to the whole question of transport investment strategy.  The operational programme goes a long way towards meeting that objective by setting out a coherent medium-term strategy for investment in roads and other transport infrastructure.  Activity under the programme will underline our commitment to providing support to industry, tourism and other forms of positive economic development.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Estimates provide £233 million for State road grants.  This is the highest provision ever in the history of the State and £17.3 million more than in 1990.  A sum of £200 million is being provided for improvements, which is an increase of £15.5 million or 8 per cent over 1990.  The maintenance grant is £33 million, an increase of almost 6 per cent. <Col N="473" /> These grants will enable work to start next year on a number of major improvement projects including the Dunleer by-pass, Northern Cross Route in Dublin, Clonee by-pass and the Lucan-Kilcock by-pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary work and I look forward to an early start to it next year.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am pleased to inform the House that the commitment given in the 1989 budget that £150 million would be provided over three years in discretionary grants to county councils for regional and county roads has been more than fulfilled: in fact total grants for regional and county road development over the three years will amount to £173 million.</P>
      <P>The operational programme for water, sanitary and other local services 1989-1993 was also published recently.  It will bring EC assistance of some £92 million, giving a co-financed programme of £184 million.  At national level we are, of course, committed to investment in water and sanitary services over and above the level provided for in the operational programme. This additional spending is needed to meet domestic and other essential needs and generally to improve water quality and waste water treatment standards.</P>
      <P>To illustrate this wider programme, I recently published a document called &ldquo;Water and Sanitary Services in Ireland &mdash; Policy and Programme for 1989-93.&rdquo; This document, which has been circulated to Deputies, sets out the wider policies and priorities governing the additional investment which will be undertaken in the water supply and sewerage programme over and above the level being co-financed by the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year, I have issued approval for the construction of some 133 water and sanitary service schemes costing in excess of £68 million.  Work on many of these schemes is to continue through 1991.  Planning for an additional 51 schemes, costing about £146 million, is at a very advanced stage.  I intend that <Col N="474" /> construction on these schemes will commence next year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Government have provided for an expansion of the local authority housing programme in 1991.  The overall allocation for 1991 is £62.6 million, an increase of £11.6 million or 23 per cent on the 1990 provision. As in 1990, the capital proceeds of local authority sales schemes, amounting to £32 million next year, will be used to assist the financing of the local authority housing programme.  The Exchequer's contribution to the expanded programme is being increased from £6 million in 1990 to £30.6 million in 1991 &mdash; an increase of more than 400 per cent.  In addition, I am actively considering some new and innovative social housing measures on which I hope to make announcements in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing scheme enables local authorities to advance capital grants to approved voluntary organisations for the provision of accommodation for disadvantaged groups, including elderly persons in need of housing, and the homeless.  In line with developments in other European countries, the voluntary sector is playing an increasingly important role in the provision of housing for persons unable to house themselves.  The voluntary housing sector will provide about 500 units of accommodation this year bringing to approximately 1,500 the total number of units provided since the inception of the scheme in 1984.  The 1991 provision of £9.275 million will ensure that the voluntary sector can maintain their important and valuable contribution towards meeting the social housing needs of some of the most disadvantaged groups in the community.</P>
    <P>One area of Government policy which has been particularly successful over the past few years is that of urban renewal. The Government's success in restoring favourable economic conditions and a climate conducive to investment has been a major contributory factor in the regeneration of cities and towns the length and breadth of the country.  The designated areas scheme for urban renewal, under which generous incentives are available <Col N="475" /> to promote development and which targets private-sector investment on rundown urban areas, has had enormous impact.  The scheme has been vigorously promoted by the Government and we have taken a number of important measures to ensure its continued success.</P>
    <P>In 1988, the scheme was extended to ten towns.  On 1 May last, I again extended the scheme to eight further towns and also to additional areas in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  We have also extended the deadline for take-up of incentives by two years, to 31 May 1993.</P>
    <P>One of the yardsticks used for measuring the success of the scheme is the level of development activity and investment generated in areas previously shunned by the private sector.  In all, projects involving investment of some £490 million have been generated or planned, and these will give rise to over 10,000 construction jobs, as well as long term employment.  We are succeeding in eradicating the decay and dereliction which has blighted many of our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I recently allocated to local authorities their rate support grants for 1991, which were increased by nearly 4 per cent over 1990 which is in excess of the current inflation level.  The total rate support grant was increased by £6 million to £168.75 million.</P>
    <P>I wish to commend local authorities for the business-like way in which they have adopted their estimates for the coming year.  All of them have disposed of the estimates at this stage.  Setting spending levels is never an easy task, but praise is due to local authorities for the responsible approach they have demonstrated in drawing up budgets over the past few years.  Their resolve in maintaining strict spending discipline is commendable and I am confident that they can maintain this approach for the future.</P>
    <P>Before I move on from the area of local finances, I want to mention new financial arrangements in relation to courthouses. For many years, local authorities have pressed for the removal of the financial <Col N="476" /> burden of the cost of providing and maintaining courthouses, on the basis that courthouses are integral to the administration of justice and should be a central charge.  The Government have accepted this proposal and provision has been made in the Courts Estimate &mdash; for which my colleague the Minister for Justice is responsible &mdash; for such expenditure in 1991.  This means that local authorities will receive capital grants for courthouse improvement rather than having to raise loans.  Where there are existing loans from the Local Loans Fund, the balances outstanding are being written off.  In addition, a provision has been made towards the cost of maintaining courthouses. Local authorities will continue to look after the maintenance of courthouses at local level on an agency basis under the new funding arrangements. This is an additional financial burden removed from local authorities which I believe will be widely welcomed and will enable local resources to be redirected to other pressing needs.</P>
    <P>Most people now accept that our future is very much dependent on the way we treat the environment.  This new awareness of the importance of the environment must guide the work of businesses, large and small, international trade and the relationships between nations.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to the environment is clear and unambiguous. The Government have set out in the environment action programme a whole range of environmental measures to be undertaken by public bodies across the broad public sector over the coming decade at a cost of £1,000 million.  This level of investment underscores the Government's intention to ensure that our natural environment is fully protected and enhanced for the health, safety and wellbeing of this and future generations.</P>
    <P>The Government are continuing to provide a high level of resources for the protection and improvement of the environment through the Environment Vote and otherwise.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million is provided for <Col N="477" /> the start-up costs of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1991.  This figure excludes funds which may be transferred to the agency as a result of the assignment or transfer of staff from other bodies for which budgetary provision has been made separately.  The actual funds available for the agency in 1991 will accordingly be considerably more than the £1 million specifically provided in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency proposals have been developed in response to a specific undertaking in the Programme for Government 1989-1993. The objective is to reform and modernise Irish institutional arrangements for environmental control.  Many countries are operating or developing specialised agencies to provide environmental regulation of heavy industry and other activities with major environmental impact.  It makes particular sense to establish such a body in a small country like Ireland where the full range of environmental expertise cannot easily be replicated through a large number of local authorities. Public confidence in the control of development which poses a risk of pollution will be greatly enhanced by an agency which will be fully independent, professionally competent and dedicated to improving the quality of, and access to, environmental information.</P>
    <P>Government action alone, however, will not solve environmental problems. Individuals must play their part in protecting and saving the environment on which we all ultimately depend.  My Department have made a special allocation in recent years in respect of environmental activities and this will be continued in 1991.  My Department will also be developing special promotional campaigns in respect of particular environmental issues which need to be highlighted.  A total of £410,000 is being provided for these activities.</P>
    <P>The outstanding innovation in the environment awareness area in 1990 was the establishment of ENFO, the Environmental Information Service.  I am delighted to say that a high level of funding for this service is being maintained <Col N="478" /> in 1991 with £600,000 included in the Estimates.  The public response to the establishment of ENFO has been extremely encouraging.  Since it opened in September, it has had over 1,000 visitors each week.  Such a high level of demand for environmental information is an encouraging sign which should lead to increased levels of participation by the public in an even wider range of environmental issues and concerns.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to take this opportunity, a Cheann Comhairle, as the busy holiday period commences, to ask the public to take extra care on the roads or in areas where there is a fire risk. People should abide by the advice that is generally available and in particular the advice from the National Safety Council. If driving, avoid alcoholic drink and use seat belts.  Compliance with a few basic rules would avoid more tragedies and make the holiday season more enjoyable for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Labour Party spokesman on Defence, I wish to refer briefly to the Defence Estimate.  The report of the first independent commission to examine pay and conditions within the Defence Forces in the history of the State was issued last July.  On the basis of the Estimate we will not see any real movement in 1991 towards implementing the recommendations of the Gleeson report, except for salary increases.  This is gravely disappointing in view of the number of recommendations contained in that report.  It seems that it will be assigned to the shelf.  I recommend to the representative bodies that they do not allow this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has not been made in the <Col N="479" /> Estimate to improve the working conditions at the apprentice school to ensure that they comply with the basic standards in FÁS training establishments.  The commission recommended that workshops in various barracks should comply with minimum health and safety standards.  Is it too much to expect that the personnel in our Defence Forces should work in conditions which meet basic requirements? The Government have not provided the money to deal with any of these areas and the Estimate can only be regarded as totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The commission visited barracks throughout the country and noted that the quality of sleeping accommodation was extremely poor.  It is deplorable that members of our Defence Forces are sleeping in draught-ridden conditions.  In one instance cardboard was being used in window frames.  Is that not totally unacceptable to us as a nation?  The allocation for maintenance barely keeps pace with the rise in the cost of living.  Clearly there is no commitment on the part of the Government to implement the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>There is a need to establish a representative body for the members of the reserve force, the FCA.  At Question Time in November I asked the then Minister for Defence to give statutory effect to the establishment of such a body.  His reply was a cop-out, a delaying tactic. Members of the FCA are working on the ground with the PDF but in many cases they are not receiving adequate recompense, being paid for perhaps only one shift.  In relation to sleeping accommodation, they get the worst of the poor accommodation available.  The Taoiseach, who is the current Minister for Defence, was himself a member of the FCA and I would ask him to consider the real needs.  Let us not have a repetition of what happened two or three years ago when members of the PDF were looking for their legitimate rights.  The Taoiseach might give a commitment to consider this matter before Christmas.  When he nominates a new Minister for Defence he <Col N="480" /> should give that Minister the responsibility of dealing with that issue as a priority.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Environment Estimate. A matter which I have consistently highlighted is the local authority housing crisis.  Do the Minister and the Government acknowledge that over 60,000 individuals throughout the country are living in intolerable conditions?  In County Dublin alone there are over 1,000 applicants on local authority housing lists.  In respect of those fortunate enough to have the money to purchase, or who may receive the present of a mobile home, would the House consider for a moment the cold, damp conditions that prevailed this very morning; consider the condensation on and dampness of bed linen in such mobile homes affecting adults and children alike?  Does the Minister for Health, present in the House, not realise the effects of such conditions on the health of our children?  It must also be remembered that there is the extended family with perhaps ten, 12 or 14 individuals living in a three-bedroomed dwelling who may have been awaiting a local authority house for three or four years.  Yet we hear the Minister say that he does not accept that there is a problem.  Are the Government or the Minister really not aware of the problem obtaining?</P>
    <P>I believe that their moral conscience must be awakened once and for all to this fact so that there may be some hope of greater social justice obtaining here. In a Christian country such as this how can the Government and Minister continue to overlook such a problem while everybody knows that a house is an absolute prerequisite to the growth and development of the individual and family alike?  Is it any wonder that we have the current levels of marital breakdown while we have not only unemployment but a huge lack of housing for people who cannot afford to provide housing for themselves?</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer briefly to a matter of grave concern to all Members.  The passage of the Child Care Bill through <Col N="481" /> this House last week was warmly welcomed by most people involved in the area of child abuse.  While it was appropriate that this House should update legislation to deal with this evil in our society, there is needed a definite commitment on the part of the Minister for Health and Government to provide the necessary resources for the treatment of victims and their families.  From my experience dealing with people in this area &mdash; particularly in Temple Street Hospital &mdash; such assistance has not been forthcoming. Temple Street Hospital centre caters for child abuse cases in the greater north city and north County Dublin areas.  The St. Clare validation clinic attached to Temple Street Hospital is relatively well staffed and operates effectively, particularly when one acknowledges the unprecedented increase in references thereto in recent years.  I would remind the Minister that the crisis extends to the treatment unit at present provided by the child guidance clinic attached to Temple Street Hospital which, five years ago, had a staff of six but which today has three only. Given the increased workload and the unprecedented increase in references in recent years, one must pose the question: is there not something wrong here?  This service for the treatment of cases of child abuse scratches the surface only.  It is my belief that the requisite personnel and knowledge are available within the overall health services, with people prepared to give of their expertise and knowledge to the Department and the Eastern Health Board in order to provide that service.  What is needed is a firm commitment on the part of the Minister and Government to do something about this. What is needed is the establishment of a special unit, properly staffed, in order to treat victims of child abuse and their families.  As we all know, it can take anything from eight years to a lifetime to come to terms with such tragic occurrences.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that the Minister would take some action in relation to some of the points I have made.  Not only do we need legislation but it must be implemented alongside the provision of <Col N="482" /> the requisite resources which are not available at present.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the Agriculture Estimate, in particular its effect on Teagasc and its knock-on effects on horticulture, the field vegetable industry on our eastern coast, particularly in my constituency. I noticed a headline in last Sunday's <i>Business Post</i> to the effect that the State commitment to Teagasc falls £3 million short of requirements which, in turn, highlighted its effect on the services they provide.  I understand that the board of Teagasc are expected to examine personnel and other cutback possibilities in addition to the disposal of assets.  On the basis of this Estimate, if Teagasc are to carry through their proposals on the premise of cutbacks in their allocation from the Department, that will have major implications for horticulture and the food and fresh vegetable industry in north County Dublin.  If implemented, the proposal to transfer the vegetable research programme from Kinsealy to Oak Park would have serious implications for the future development of the fresh vegetable sector here.  When research into vegetable crops was initiated in Kinsealy &mdash; not far from the Taoiseach's home &mdash; in 1959 that location was chosen because of the concentration of fresh vegetable growing on the east coast, particularly in the north County Dublin area with its climatic advantages and proximity to the capital city and its growing population.  This remains a relevant factor in 1990 as the growing of vegetables has expanded into the adjoining counties of Meath and Louth, so that north County Dublin, along with Meath and Louth, now account for 33 per cent of the national fresh vegetable acreage. There has also been an expansion of vegetable growing in Counties Kildare, Wicklow and the coastal areas of Wexford, Waterford and Cork where the use of plastic cloches helps to extend the growing season further.</P>
    <P>Current trends favour the production of fresh rather than processed produce. This means there will be extended acreages of vegetable growing in milder areas around our coast where the growing <Col N="483" /> season can be extended, thereby taking advantage of import substitution and exploring a potential export market.  If we are serious about our agricultural and horticultural industries, we must examine their potential.  It is illogical to take the research area out of north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>In regard to asset disposals I want to put the Minister on notice that the Teagasc proposal to sell up to 60 acres of vital agricultural land at Kinsealy will have major implications for the horticultural industry.  I will resist this move as far as possible.  The proposal is mind-boggling. When we want to expand our horticultural industry I do not want to see this proposal making millionaires of a couple of people at the expense of the entire industry.  I hope I will not have to come back here to say that these proposals have had that effect.  The Minister should take on board what I have said. This Estimate does not deal adequately with the social and economic problems we face today.  Therefore, I have no problem in opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the 1991 abridged Book of Estimates.  The overall provisions in the book reflect the Government's sensible approach to the public finances and strike a balance between control of public expenditure and maintenance of essential public services.  This balance has been made possible by meeting the challenge which the public finances have presented over the last few years and by making informed and courageous choices.</P>
      <P>The health service has played its part in this process and has contributed to bringing about renewed confidence in the economy generally, while at the same time management and staff in the health agencies have met the challenge and maintained the basic fabric of the services which are being delivered with commitment and dedication in a very high quality of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have recognised the needs of the health service.  For example, <Col N="484" /> in the 1990 budget, £10 million was announced to develop further services for the elderly, the mentally handicapped and the dental service.  Furthermore the House agreed to a Supplementary Estimate yesterday to provide additional funding in order to support the enhanced services in our acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the provisions in the 1991 Book of Estimates, the Government are continuing their commitment to providing a first class health service. Table 5 in the Book, which lists gross non-capital supply services by functional classification, shows that while overall spending on social services shows an increase of 5 per cent, the health services provision increases by 9 per cent over the comparable 1990 figure.  It is also clear from a summary of net non-capital Estimates &mdash; Table 2 in the Book &mdash; that the health service share of the total expenditure has risen from 21 per cent in 1990 to 22 per cent in 1991.  This further demonstrates that, despite a continuing difficult economic situation, the Government are determined to continue to provide high quality health care for the community.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition have stated that, despite the increases in health funding contained in the Estimates, the proportion of national spending devoted to health is considerably short of what is regarded as a basic minimum.  I would have to ask what is the basic minimum, and who determines it.  The Commission on Health Funding, a distinguished independent committee of experts, have gone on record to state that, &ldquo;the appropriate level of expenditure can only emerge in the context of the resources allocated to each of the services, having regard to their relative cost effectiveness&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The commission also advance the view that the overall level of funding required for the Irish health services cannot be determined by reference to international comparisons, due to the fact that there are no universally accepted statistical definitions for what constitutes health expenditure.</P>
    <P>There has also been much attention given to the fact that a considerable proportion <Col N="485" /> of the increase in health spending is in respect of pay awards.  It is true that these awards will add considerably to the pay bill in 1991.</P>
    <P>Compared with the equivalent 1990 provision, the Health Vote for the coming year includes an additional £59.4 million for pay awards and the effect of the one hour reduction in the working week.  Given the 24 hour nature of the health services this latter measure will actually result in an increase in health services employment mainly in the area of care staff.  In my view such increases are deserved by the hardworking staff to whom they have been awarded.  This reflects society's recognition of the fact that health staff provide a much-valued service in difficult circumstances.  If we wish to continue to attract and retain staff of the high calibre necessary to provide a modern service, we must pay the appropriate salaries.</P>
    <P>The financial resources being provided in 1991 do not obviate the need for agencies to continue to use such resources in the most cost-effective manner possible. The quest for greater efficiency and better value must be unending.  Given the huge public investment in the health services we must ensure that the budget is spent for the maximum benefit of the people for whom we have responsibility. In this regard my Department will continue the efficiency drive throughout 1991 which, with the outcome of the Fox-Kennedy studies and local initiatives by health agencies, will free up resources which can then be applied for the betterment of services.  I intend to continue to work with the health boards to ensure the maximum benefits for patients from the resources available.</P>
    <P>The combined purchasing muscle of the health agencies will be a very powerful tool in securing the very best value in the procurement of supplies and services. One small example of how this is already working is in the area of hip replacements, where a combined procurement initiative co-ordinated by my Department has resulted in quite substantial savings in the purchase of hip implants. <Col N="486" /> As well as purchasing and stockholding, initiatives can also be shared in relation to income generation, the management of risk and a whole range of worthwhile and cost effective management techniques.</P>
    <P>In the past year or so the number of acute hospital beds has increased by 1,000 to about 12,000 and the number of people employed has also risen by about 2,000. The 1991 provision allows for services to be maintained at this level, while at the same time allowing for enhancement, in the quality of the service through the bringing on stream of new facilities. These will include acute hospital developments in Waterford, Wexford and Sligo and the development of acute psychiatric services in Kildare.</P>
    <P>Since the middle of last year the Government have progressively improved services in the acute hospital sector.  In 1989 an additional £15 million was made available to address some of the gaps which existed, and these funds were used primarily to make inroads into waiting lists in specialties such as ENT and orthopaedics.  This extra £15 million was reflected on a full year basis in the 1990 base provision.</P>
    <P>In February of this year I gave a commitment in this House that I would provide sufficient resources to fund 12,000 beds, nationwide.  This represented an increase of 800 beds on the number which had obtained in the middle of last year.  Furthemore, I promised that funding would also be made available to meet the costs associated with the `flu epidemic which occurred last winter and which, as is always the case in such emergencies, stretched the resources of the health agencies.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that by providing an additional £23 million for acute hospitals in the Supplementary Estimate which was passed yesterday, I was able to honour in full the commitments I had made.  This additional provision is fully reflected in the expenditure base for 1991 and I am confident therefore that the national acute bed stock can be maintained at the appropriate level and thus <Col N="487" /> cope with the ongoing level of demand for acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>I referred a moment ago to the resources that were targeted at waiting lists and I would like to touch again on this point.  I constantly make the point that the existence of waiting lists is not an indicator of an inappropriate level of funding.  As we all know, the demand for health services is dynamic and can never be fully satisfied, no matter what level of resources is provided.  Indeed, this is true of all developed countries.  The United States, Britain and Germany, with much stronger economies, all have the same problem.  As long as there is a health service, any service, there will be patients waiting to avail of it.  The position is further complicated by the fact that the frontiers of medicine are constantly being pushed back and new developments result in previously unmanageable conditions becoming amenable to treatment. Indeed, we heard a lot of talk about hip replacements over the last few years. Now there is more and more emphasis on knee joint replacement and the number of patients coming forward and the number of knee joint replacement operations being performed is rising at a very rapid rate.</P>
    <P>At the same time one cannot ignore waiting lists, and I have made determined efforts to ensure that long waiting lists in particular areas are reduced and these efforts have been fruitful.  In my speech to this House yesterday on the Supplementary Estimate I detailed the very real improvements which have been made in relation to hip replacements and ear, nose and throat services.  I accept that we must build on these results and push for even greater improvements, not just in these specialties, but in other areas such as cardiac surgery.  I am confident that we will continue to make good progress.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to increase the monthly threshold above which patients can recoup in full the cost of drugs purchased from £28 to £32. Given that there has been no increase in this figure for quite a number of years, <Col N="488" /> the change is a modest one, and is only half the increase which could be justified if general inflation had been used as a guideline.</P>
    <P>I have already introduced a new drugs subsidisation scheme for those patients who are regular users, which reduces the personal financial burden on these patients.</P>
    <P>The daily charge applying to those patients who use public hospitals is also being increased from £10 to £12.50 per day from 1 January next.</P>

      <P>While I take the Chair's advice, it is important to point out to that party the difficulty they have in trying to hold both ends of the political spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charge on in-patients of £12.50 per day will mean that the maximum that patients will be charged will be £125 in <Col N="489" /> any one year and exemptions will continue to apply to particular groups of patients, including those covered by medical cards.  This charge is only a small contribution, by those who can afford to pay, to the overall cost of hospital treatment.  It will provide additional income to hospitals which will be a valuable supplement to the net allocations provided by my Department.</P>
    <P>As regards psychiatric services the implementation of the report &ldquo;Planning For The Future&rdquo; will continue in 1991.  As Deputies will be aware this programme focuses on de-institutionalisation to ensure that patients receive services in a more appropriate setting.  The provision of hostels, day care facilities and training workshops has been invaluable in the rehabilitation of former patients of psychiatric hospitals.  Such placement in the community undoubtedly helps society in general to come to terms with a type of illness which in the past was often scorned and ignored.  The greater concentration of services in the community is not the cheap option.  Rather this concentration is being made because it offers the best level of care and treatment of mental illness.  Of course not all psychiatric conditions can be treated at community level, and acute psychiatric units are of vital importance to the delivery of an integrated and comprehensive psychiatric programme.</P>
    <P>Continued progress is also being made in this area and in 1991 health provision will be made in a number of areas.  I am very pleased that Deputy Durkan is here to learn that one of the areas where there will be new development is Naas.  This will provide a much needed boost to services in Kildare.  I would like to pay tribute at this point to the broad spectrum of professionals delivering the psychiatric service who have been enthusiastically supportive in the implementation of &ldquo;Planning For The Future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As with the psychiatric service, the programme for the mentally handicapped has also concentrated in recent years on moving mentally handicapped persons from an institutional setting into an environment which is more suited to <Col N="490" /> their needs.  There is a requirement for continued close co-operation between the regional health boards and many voluntary organisations who provide services in this area.  It is only with this type of co-operation that a unified plan of action can be developed which maximises the benefits from the resources devoted to this area.  Since coming into office I have provided funding for this sector which ensured that this sector was fully protected.  The 1991 Health Vote is structured to continue this fundamental protection. The provision for the coming year reflects in full the additional resources provided in the 1990 budget. This provision was of great benefit in allowing improvements in the service to take place, in line with the multi-annual plans of the regional co-ordination committees, which are representative of the main statutory and voluntary agencies in each region.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the national lottery has contributed valuable complementary funding in this area targeted mainly at community-based voluntary grants, and I would also urge the agencies providing services for the mentally handicapped to ensure that funding available in 1991 from the European Social Fund is applied to the maximum advantage in enhancing the relevant services.</P>
    <P>In 1990 an additional £5 million was provided to improve services for the elderly. The Government remain committed to continue the process of providing care for the elderly in the most appropriate setting with access to the necessary acute facilities as required.  The 1991 allocations to the health boards which I announced yesterday reflect a continuation of the improvements achieved last year and also provide for the implementation of the Nursing Homes Act, which is a response to the need for updated legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>1990 saw the provision of a special allocation of £3 million for dental services. This was in recognition of inadequacies in the service, provided by the health boards for eligible persons which had been obvious long before I became <Col N="491" /> Minister.  The improvements in the service which this special allocation has allowed are very heartening.  This funding facilitated 28,000 additional dental treatments and 2,500 orthodontic patients were dealt with.  I want to see these achievements built upon and I will be providing a further £3 million in 1991 for this purpose.</P>

      <P>While the revised remuneration package for participating GPs introduced in 1989 has as I said yesterday, operated very satisfactorily, I nevertheless, remain concerned about the cost of drugs.  Since I came into office there have been two rounds of negotiations with the drugs industry and both have resulted in very satisfactory agreements on pricing.  However, the cost factor which most concerns me at present is the type of drugs being prescribed. Earlier I referred to medicine constantly pushing back the frontiers, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the area of drug treatments.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the new drugs formulary which is due to be issued shortly will be of great assistance in this area.  I am also approving the restoration of analgesics and antacids to the GMS prescription list in order to obviate the prescription of more costly alternatives. It is my view that the hospital-community relationship in the prescription of drugs needs to be explored.  A considerable proportion of drugs prescribed initially at hospital level follow the patients into the community.  Given this feature, hospitals are being asked to take all steps possible to review prescribing habits in a manner consistent with the needs of the patient.  It is important that the patient is prescribed the drugs necessary for his or her particular illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General practice will continue to have a leading role in determining the development of primary care and the current <Col N="492" /> review process will allow us to focus on key issues in this area.  Deputy Ryan referred to the increase in the reporting of child abuse and the need for facilities. I am glad to be able to tell Deputy Ryan that since I came into office we did put in place a number of new facilities in Temple Street and the Children's Hospital in Crumlin.  We made a special allocation to each of the health boards to ensure that there would be proper services available for the provision of the necessary care and management of children who are the victims of child abuse, and we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>The provision in the 1991 Book of Estimates for balances of grants due in respect of previous years is £98.5 million. This represents an increase of £18.2 million or 23 per cent on the comparable 1990 figure.  These balances will be used to improve the cash flow of health agencies in the coming year and come on top of the extra £9.75 million which was provided in the Supplementary Estimate for 1990.  Cash flow difficulties have resulted in the agencies being unable to take full advantage of favourable credit terms from suppliers.  A proper level of liquidity is essential in the drive for efficiency on procurement to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>A sum of £32.33 million has been provided for capital in the 1991 Estimates. This will be supplemented by a further £9 million from loans and balances in the hospitals trust fund, which represents the proceeds of the sale of surplus properties. Of the total £41.33 million capital available, £4.83 million will be used for the acquisition and implementation of information systems both in the health agencies and in my Department.  The health services are vast in their complexity and adequate systems must be in place to ensure that appropriate, accurate information is available when and where it is required.  The investment in such systems will result in an efficient, cost effective allocation of resources and <Col N="493" /> will allow the services to respond quickly to the ever changing demands placed upon them.</P>
    <P>A sum of £36.5 million will be available for the building, equipping and furnishing of health facilities.  This will allow contractual obligations to be met in 1991 and will also allow for some minor essential works, such as fire precautions.  During 1990 I have conducted a very thorough review of the capital needs of the health services and I remain committed to introducing a five year programme for capital expenditure.  Given the multi-annual nature of major projects in the health area, this represents a sensible and rational approach to the renewal and development of our health facilities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am of the view that, given the additional pressures created by the effects of public service pay increases and the uncertainties in the wider international environment, the overall Estimate for 1991 balances the need to maintain services at reasonable levels with the duty to maintain order in the public finances.  Within the overall provisions, 22 per cent of Exchequer funding, the Government have again signalled their intention to provide a first class health service responsive to the needs in 1991.</P>
    <P>The allocations now being made to the health agencies in respect of 1991 should enable the existing level of service to be maintained and limited developments in specific areas to be undertaken if agencies co-operate fully at local and national level.  As I said earlier, in 1991 we will be intensifying our commitment to ensuring that we get value for money spent, and that all the money allocated to the health services will be spent for the maximum benefit of the patients for whom we all have responsibility.</P>

I welcome many of the positive measures incorporated in it, particularly in relation to my constituency of Kildare.  I am glad to note the development of the psychiatric services in Naas, which is long overdue.  All of us, including the Minister, have been beavering away for the provision of that facility, and hopefully it will be part of a superstructure within which the services will operate in the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibilities for south Kildare will thankfully be transferred back to Kildare, which is their rightful place.  I am not saying that Carlow did not provide a very good service but we needed such a service in Kildare and I welcome this move.  While everybody understands that health services are very obvious consumers of funds, because of the age structure of our population it has been difficult for the Minister to provide sufficient funds for the services in line with the increased demand, not just politically but by virtue of the increased numbers of people who require the services.  That applies to hip replacements and all the other operations that have been referred to.  Those of us who are members of health boards have first class knowledge, as has the Minister, of the obvious urgent needs there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I met an unfortunate constituent who, last year, required surgery for the removal of cataracts.  Thankfully the service in that area is not as bad as it was a year ago, but it is still not great. The person in question was grateful that <Col N="495" /> I had helped him last year but said he now needs an operation on his second eye, and hopes he will not have to wait three or four years for it.  I am not going into detail again on what I said in the House about long waiting lists, and the Minister referred to this both today and yesterday in the Estimates debate.  Waiting lists can be determined in many ways. I am sure the Minister knows quite well the difficulties that exist, with conflict between public and private services and the way they operate.  There is great difficulty with the system that operates here. I have my own views on that but I will not go into it today because it would take too long.</P>
    <P>One matter I want to address briefly, and which has been covered already in the debate, is the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.  At a time when trade and marketing is obviously to the fore in the context of the GATT negotiations I have been very disappointed with the total lack of imagination that has gone into the production of this year's Estimates in that area.  At a time when the GATT negotiations have reached a crucial stage, which will have a very obvious impact on this country's economy over the next 20 or 30 years, very little time, effort and energy have apparently been given to producing a careful programme and providing the necessary finance in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>Let us quickly look at what has happened. I have to blame the Government &mdash; this is not a political allegation but a fact &mdash; because while this country held the Presidency of the European Community we failed to play a pivotal role internationally.  While it was all very well to have photographs taken and to give regular interviews, this Government were silent on the very important and sensitive area of trade.  Nothing was done, and no impact was created internationally as to the importance of the GATT negotiations from this country's point of view.</P>
    <P>I wonder what was the reaction of the Americans and the CAIRNS group to the response from the national parliaments in <Col N="496" /> Europe to the GATT negotiations.  There were repeated requests in this House for a debate on that very urgent issue, but on every occasion the Government deflected the attempts of the Opposition to have a full scale debate.  Consider the advantages of having a full scale debate on that matter at that time.  The people in other countries would have taken on board the reaction of the parliamentarians throughout Europe.  They would have seen what the politicians, particularly in this country, thought about the proposals. But what happened in this House?  Absolutely nothing.  We had statements on a couple of occasions and questions were raised on the Adjournment, but no time was given specifically to a full scale debate on a major economic issue.  That was an abdication of responsibility on the part of the Government, and whoever on that side of the House is prepared to accept responsibility for it, let them step forward.  It was a total dereliction of duty on their part.</P>
    <P>The Americans and the CAIRNS negotiators saw, throughout the summer, that there was no concern expressed in this Parliament on the Government side although the Opposition clamoured for a debate.  There was no public expression of concern in this House on an issue which has a huge impact on the lives and future of every man, woman and child in the country, which is very sad.  During Ireland's Presidency of the EC and throughout the summer months we lost a great opportunity to nail our colours to the mast and to let it be known to the Europeans and the other parties in the GATT negotiations that we were fully aware of what they were doing, what they intended to do and that we resented and rejected it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately and ironically, a mere three or four days after Ireland relinquished the Presidency the then British Prime Minister.  Margaret Thatcher, went to a meeting in Houston, Texas, with President Bush and announced a new policy which appeared to be on behalf of the European Community but which was not. from its tone, in the <Col N="497" /> interests of Ireland.  Since Ireland is a full member of the Community I thought it was very poor form that somebody somewhere did not say that, while it was Mrs. Thatcher's point of view, it was not in the interests of the European Community and that those interests were paramount as far as Ireland was concerned.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to the Single European Act was fully supported by the great majority of the people and it showed our commitment to the European concept without reservations.  We gave responsibility to the Europeans &mdash; with ourselves &mdash; for looking after our affairs.  In so doing &mdash; and this has been referred to already by my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, in another context this morning &mdash; we were then in a position where our own reaction to world events and to EC policy would obviously be reflected in our input at ministerial and commissioner level.  That input, from the point of view of the Government, was most disappointing.</P>
    <P>Many people in this country believe that GATT affects only the farming community: it affects the entire community, industry and agri-business generally. Since we are basically an agricultural nation, one can imagine the impact on this country if the current proposals are allowed to go unchallenged.  My information is that the Americans and the CAIRNS representatives are surprised and shocked at how easy it has been to &ldquo;cannon&rdquo; the European negotiators. They very skilfully adopted the usual US negotiating policy of talking big, well ahead of their target, making exorbitant demands and hoping that they would come home with more in their pockets than they had ever dreamed possible. Their technique has been worth watching over the last 12 months because, in response to their exorbitant demands, the European and Irish negotiators were so cowed, they immediately withdrew from the arena and &mdash; before they reentered it &mdash; they offered huge concessions, including the offer of 30 per cent by the commissioner.  He adopted a timid approach, he barely poked his nose in the door of the negotiating conference <Col N="498" /> and his approach was met with disdain by the other negotiators.  That was understandable as it was the object of their exercise, they wanted to gain something before they started negotiating and they got it.  It was a soft target, they fully relished the opportunity before them and took full advantage of it.</P>
    <P>Since then there have been prolonged negotiations in Brussels and &mdash; more recently &mdash; in Paris which, as we are aware, have been inconclusive.  There is a threat over the heads of this country and Europe generally that there could well be a total breakdown which would be a catastrophe.  Interestingly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; the first time I heard a Minister indicate any awareness of what was happening &mdash; asked yesterday in the House why Europe and European interests should have to concede to US demands.  That is a very valid and interesting point because we have no greater liability in that area than anybody else.  The people involved in the negotiations have equal responsibility and the Minister was quite correct in pointing that out.  I am amazed that nobody else on that side of the House mentioned it.  There seems to be a tendency to repeatedly touch the forelock to the power and might of US proposals, which is dangerous.</P>
    <P>Farming and business interests in this country are aghast at the reaction of the Europeans and our representatives &mdash; in this House and outside it &mdash; in Europe and rightly so because the farmers and business people fully recognise what the consequences will be.  Because of that they are now attempting to make the running.  They are now making representations and coming forward with proposals, and I appreciate what they are doing, simply because there is a lack of action in other quarters.  We have been elected to represent interest groups but the Government represent the country at the negotiating tables in Brussels or anywhere else.  The issues now being talked about all over the country are the ultimate responsibility of the Government. If the Government do not accept <Col N="499" /> their responsibilities and deliver, they will pay a very heavy price.</P>
    <P>As I said before, my only conclusion in regard to the Government's attitude &mdash; and the European attitude &mdash; in the GATT negotiations is that they have acted wimpishly.  They have whinged and whined and changed tack on several occasions and each time they have lost ground.  They remind me of a sailor who finds the going rough and tries to utilise the wind as much as possible but who, on every occasion unfortunately, turns into the wind and loses ground.  I plead with the Government, before it is too late, to recognise their role in the GATT negotiations at ministerial and heads of Government level.  I also ask the European Commission to recognise its responsibilities which have been delegated to it by the various people throughout Europe to look after Europe's interests.  We should remember that the European Community consists of 340 million people who are also a worthwhile trading bloc. They are a powerful consumer force and they are also a powerful producer force. When the European Community was first instituted it was assumed that this new powerful trading bloc would be the biggest advantage for a Europe which had been war-torn for years, in our lifetime, perhaps forever.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that at the very first obstacle, the first international joust at economic level, they seem to have floundered and gone in diverse ways to accommodate themselves.  For some unknown reason this House has never had an opportunity to state clearly exactly what we think about the matter. I am sorry that other Ministers with more direct responsibility are not present in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment was in the House this morning.  I thank him for his proposals in relation to road realignments, the national primary routes in particular which are of major concern, and the Lucan bypass in which I have a personal passing interest.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the housing programme.  As a former <Col N="500" /> member of a local authority the Minister should take account of this.  I warn him that we have an acute housing problem for a segment of the population which requires urgent attention.  The problem arose due to the large scale sale of local authority houses a few years ago which meant that since then there has been very little movement.  Very few people have sold those houses and moved out of them. We are not catering for housing for the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a policy in relation to the banks, where the banks have responsibility for housing those with an income of over £10,000.  Who will house the people whose income is under £10,000? It is virtually impossible to get a local authority housing loan because the local authorities fully recognise that they are only getting the tail end of the market, those that the banks and the building societies have refused.  In order to get a loan from a local authority one must have a refusal from a bank and a building society.</P>
    <P>What incentive is there for local authorities to give loans at all?  We are failing miserably to live up to the requirements of the 1966 Housing Act.  We are treating people in an awful fashion.  Families with three, four or five children are living in mobile homes and they have not a hope of being housed within the next year or year and a half.  Will the Minister, for God's sake, recognise the problem and do something about it before it is too late?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech on the Supplementary Estimate yesterday mentioned special grants for disabled persons.  Will he look at the way they are operated at present?  Like the housing loans to which I referred, they are extremely hard to get and the operation of these grants would need to be reconsidered if the Minister is to live up to the commitment in the original Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1991 Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare provides for an increase of £100 million in overall expenditure.  Gross expenditure for 1991 <Col N="501" /> is projected at £2,900 million as compared with a projected outturn of £2,800 million in 1990.  This amount will finance and preserve all our existing schemes and services, including the new schemes which were recently introduced such as the carer's allowance, the lone parent's scheme and the free travel scheme for companions of the handicapped.  It also provides for a back to school clothing and footwear allowance next autumn.</P>
      <P>Each day of the year we now spend in support of the elderly over £2.3 million, the unemployed over £2 million, families over £2.1 million, the sick and disabled over £1 million, and in total £7.4 million.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal practice, the Estimate provides for the carry-over cost of increases given in the 1990 budget &mdash; some £100 million.  It does not include any provision for increases in 1991.  These will be provided for in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for 1991 to be provided by the general taxpayer is £1,554 million.  This is the Exchequer's contribution to the social welfare services and is £78 million higher than the published Estimate for 1990.</P>
      <P>Gross expenditure in 1991 is estimated at £2,900 million.  This comprises insurance based payments, funded from the social insurance fund, and assistance payments which are totally Exchequer funded.  The social insurance fund is funded by the Exchequer, employers, employees and the self-employed.  The Abridged Estimates show the Exchequer contribution to the SIF which is 23 per cent lower in 1991 than in 1990.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the Exchequer's contribution to the social insurance fund of £28.367 million, or 23 per cent is mainly due to the projected increase in PRSI income, arising principally from increased numbers in employment.  This is offset mainly by the extra cost of the 1990 budget improvements.  There are substantial increases in expenditure on a number of schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 estimate for family income supplement is increased by 14 per cent to £9.7 million.  This takes account of the <Col N="502" /> carry-over costs of the 1990 budget improvements to this scheme.  Substantial improvements introduced last July include increases in the income levels and maximum payments for eligibility for the scheme and a new minimum payment of £5 a week.</P>
    <P>The 1991 estimate for unemployment assistance is increased by 11 per cent. Again the increase arises primarily because of the carry-over costs of the 1990 budget increases.  Personal rates for the long term unemployed were increased by almost 11 per cent while the short term rates were increased by over 7 per cent last July.  The forecast for 1991 is an average number of 221,000 unemployed.  This estimate provides for the continuation of the special arrangements under which the long term unemployed can now avail of second chance education.</P>
    <P>A sum of £116.1 million has been provided in 1991 for the new lone parent's allowance.  There is a corresponding reduction in the Estimates for the widow's and orphan's non-contributory pension and the deserted wife's and unmarried mother's schemes.  All lone parents with children, who were catered for under these schemes, are now part of the new lone parent's scheme.  In addition, a major feature of the new scheme is that it caters for the first time for separated spouses rearing children without the support of a partner.  Overall, the 1991 provision for these families shows an increase of £29.75 million, 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Estimate provides £9.7 million for the carer's allowance which I introduced in November last.  This was a major innovation and has been widely welcomed.  It provides, in addition to improving the basic rates of payments, a direct payment to people on low incomes who provide full-time care and attention for invalided social welfare pensioners.  It is expected that up to 10,000 carers will qualify and to date some 3,500 claims have been received.</P>
    <P>The overall provision for grants to voluntary bodies in 1991 is £1.3 million. This includes the provision for once-off <Col N="503" /> grants to voluntary social service organisations and the continuation of the community development initiative which I introduced this year.  In the 1990 budget additional provision of £500,000 was made for grants to locally based women's groups.  There was a very positive response to the introduction of the new scheme which was seen as recognising the increasing involvement of women in identifying the issues and tackling the problems which affect them in their daily lives.  The scheme is now being reviewed and provision for a further scheme will be a matter for consideration in the budget.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Estimate for my Department provides for the preservation of all existing schemes and services and the continuation of the new schemes which were recently introduced.  Further increases in payments and other improvements are matters which will be considered in the context of the 1991 budget.  Along with controlling expenditure we have ensured that the position of those on the lowest levels of income has been continually improved in real terms.  At the same time, our duty to the taxpayer requires us to be vigilant and to ensure that this money is spent effectively and directed towards those who are genuinely in need.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has underpinned the developments in social welfare and provided the framework within which substantial improvements have been achieved for those dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare I am particularly conscious of the need to ensure that those dependent on social welfare benefit from the improvement in the economy as a whole.  Over the past three years considerable improvements in the basic rates of payment have been achieved.  For example, a special increase for those on the lowest levels of payment, the abolition of the rural rate of unemployment assistance, the streamlining of adult dependant and child dependant rates and the introduction of a minimum payment for child dependants have all resulted in substantial improvements for <Col N="504" /> this group.  The basic rate of unemployment assistance, long term, has been increased from £36.70 in July 1986 to £52 in July 1990, an increase of 42 per cent in nominal terms and almost 26 per cent in real terms.  A family with three children has come from a rate of £89.45 up to £116, in July 1990, an increase of £26.25 in money terms representing an increase of almost 30 per cent in nominal terms and 15 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of contributory old age pension has increased from £53.45 in 1987 to £61.50 this year.  The rate payable to married pensioners where the dependent spouse is over 66 years increased from £93.35 in 1986 to £107.20 this year. The rate for married non-contributory pensioners was increased from £68.75 to £79.50.  This year, for the first time, special additional increases were made not only to the long term unemployed but also to old age non-contributory pensioners and widows.</P>
    <P>The personal rate for contributory widow's pension and deserted wife's benefit was £48.10 in 1986 and has increased to £56 this year.  A lone parent with three children on assistance payments received £87.80 in 1986 and this has increased to £101 this year.  Again the highest increases have been targeted at lone parent families who depend on assistance payments.</P>
    <P>Contributory widows and recipients of deserted wife's benefit have received increases of over 16 per cent in the personal rates of benefit.  The personal rate in 1986 was £48.10; in July 1990 it increased to £56.</P>
    <P>In addition to improving the basic rates of payments, a number of other important changes have been made in the social welfare code.  The most significant of these changes this year were the new carer's allowance and lone parent's allowance schemes which I have already outlined.  Other important improvements have also been made.</P>
    <P>The £5.3 million back to school clothing and footwear scheme was introduced this year to help social welfare recipients provide for their children's needs.  This provided £25 for each child at primary <Col N="505" /> school and £40 for each child at second level at this expensive time of year for families.  Over 170,000 children have benefited and will benefit again this year.</P>
    <P>The process of introducing greater flexibility into the unemployment payments system was continued by the introduction of the vocational preparation and training scheme and a new pilot scheme to enable the long term unemployed pursue a third level course.  This latter scheme is a particularly innovative one and at present 68 people are participating at various third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Further improvements in the family income supplement scheme include increases in the income limits and maximum rates of payments; the introduction of a minimum payment of £5; receipt of FIS no longer affects entitlement to a medical card and workers who expect to be employed for at least six months as against 12 months can now qualify.</P>
    <P>We have introduced new arrangements to allow a companion to travel with a person on disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Many recipients of the disabled person's maintenance allowance were unable to avail of the free travel concession because a companion brought along to assist mobility had to pay the appropriate fare.  To date almost 6,500 free companion travel passes have been issued.</P>
    <P>A new social welfare appeals office was established.  This is a major development in the social welfare area as the new appeals office has been set up as a separate office under its own director and chief appeals officer and administrative staff.  This new office acting independently will ensure that social welfare clients have an appeals system which is clearly seen to be modern, efficient, fair and easily accessible.</P>
    <P>A special smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week is being paid from mid-October 1990 to mid-April 1991 to recipients of social welfare and health board payments in restricted areas under certain conditions.  There will be PRSI exemption for up to 50,000 low paid workers.  Workers with gross earnings of <Col N="506" /> £60 or less weekly paying class A contributions are exempt from paying the employee's insurance contribution.  The Christmas bonus was paid to 595,000 people on long term social welfare payments and their 370,000 dependants.  The bonus cost £25.6 million this year, an increase of £1.6 million on the 1989 allocation. The introduction of a pre-retirement allowance scheme for those on long term unemployment assistance who are over 60 years of age allows those concerned the option of transferring to payment by pension order book which they cash at the local post office.  They are only required to make a declaration regarding unemployment once a year.  To date approximately 6,500 claimants including smallholders have availed of this option.</P>
    <P>I have spoken often of how social welfare services should meet the needs of clients in an efficient way.  I want to provide clients at a local level with access at one point of contact to all social welfare services.  I introduced, and I am committed to developing, the concept of the one-stop-shop.  This involves providing access to a broad range of services at local level.  Ultimately, my intention is that clients will be able to have all their social welfare needs catered for at their local office.</P>
    <P>Early in 1991 I intend to set up a regional structure for social welfare services. This will be a major development for my Department.  The new regional management structure will bring greater efficiency to the services, will enable greater devolution of responsibility to the local level and give easier access to social welfare clients.  Eight regional centres will be established at Cork, Limerick, Sligo, Longford, Dundalk, Dublin, Athlone and Waterford.</P>
    <P>I will continue the process of introducing one-stop-shops, of modernising the system to make it more accessible and user-friendly and of enhancing the dignity of those who rely on our services. In the period since 1987, under the Government's decentralisation programme, we opened a new pensions services office in Sligo and a new child benefit office in Letterkenny this year. Nine new employment exchanges were <Col N="507" /> opened throughout the country while extensive renovations were carried out at ten other centres.</P>
    <P>In addition projects are currently under construction or at an advanced planning stage at eight other centres. Renovation works are proposed at three further centres over the next year.  We have also invested heavily in computerisation to speed up and simplify payments and claims.  This will result in an integrated and much-improved service for the public.  A wider range of services will be provided, information services will be improved and extended.  There will also be adequate private facilities for transacting business in a private and confidential way.</P>
    <P>Computerised facilities will in turn open up the possibility of providing more flexible payment methods for social welfare clients.  I see the introduction of more modern payment methods as an essential pre-requisite to enabling us to provide a better service.  Ultimately as we get away from the need to provide payments in cash at all offices with the security and other restrictions which this imposes, and begin to use more efficient payment methods, in co-operation with other bodies like An Post, we can develop our own offices to provide a broader range of personal services to social welfare clients.</P>
    <P>One of the other benefits of having a more modern system of payment is that it will enable the introduction of more flexible signing arrangements for unemployed people.  There will still, of course, be a need to exercise proper control over schemes.  The introduction of new payment systems, however, would enable the present signing arrangements to be modified in certain cases and be replaced by more systematic and selective, and therefore more effective, reviews of claims.</P>
    <P>One of the major developments in the social welfare system in recent years has been the increasing involvement with voluntary organisations.  I see my Department as not just being in the business of providing money but also being involved <Col N="508" /> in the welfare of people in the broadest sense.  Voluntary organisations have a major role in this regard.  Many such organisations are working on a daily basis with social welfare clients and are aware of their needs and their difficulties.  I was glad to be able in recent years to provide assistance to many such organisations.  In particular I have received a great deal of assistance from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in meeting the needs of the poor. The society now have over 10,000 voluntary workers in the field.  The society have been to the fore in tackling the problems associated with moneylenders, in providing job opportunities through a major innovative, community-based scheme and in organising a programme of home management and personal development courses, designed to help families acquire basic skills of budgeting and self-development.  In April 1988 I made a special grant to the society to fund the setting up of these courses on a nationwide basis.  The success of the courses has convinced the society of the value of these courses.  Over 7,000 families have already benefited under the programme and it is regarded by the society as, &ldquo;the Society's most effective strategy for helping families on low incomes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The value of this sort of practical action in helping people to help themselves is evidenced by the number of groups which applied for funding to run similar courses, under the new scheme of grants for women's groups which I introduced earlier this year.  About 70 women's groups received assistance for this purpose this year which benefited an estimated 1,400 women.  Further courses have been provided through the voluntary grants scheme.  In all up to 10,000 families have benefited from these courses over the last three years.</P>
    <P>I am therefore pleased to announce that I am making a grant of £100,000 to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to expand and develop these innovative and worthwhile home management and personal development courses.</P>
    <P>We have made substantial progress in the last three years in improving the <Col N="509" /> position of the least well-off in our society.  This progress has been underpinned by the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and, in particular, the consensus which the Taoiseach initiated between the Government and the social partners.  Through the programme the imbalances in the public finances have been addressed and inflation has been reduced to below 3 per cent.  Over the three year life of the programme, total non-farm private sector employment has increased by some 70,000.  This is striking evidence of the success of the programme.  It is crucial to the interests of the less well off who depend on social welfare that a new programme for the nineties is agreed.</P>
    <P>Despite the continuing need to control expenditure, we have maintained and significantly improved our social welfare system and made sure that special consideration is given to the most vulnerable sections of our society.  We have also introduced many new and innovative schemes.  There is, of course, much more to be done.  I am confident that, with the agreement of the social partners on a new programme for economic and social development, we will be in a position to lay the foundations for further major improvements in social welfare in the years ahead.</P>

The Minister for Energy should either decide to be a member of the Cabinet or a member of Galway County Council.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Most other Departments have made good progress in transferring the greater part of their pre-1961 records but will not meet the deadline in full.  I have, therefore, decided to accept a recommendation by the director of the National Archives to extend the deadline to 30 June 1991.  I will, however, be asking <Col N="516" /> the director to ensure that Departments comply with the revised deadline.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach raised this matter at Cabinet with a view to inviting each member of the Cabinet to give instructions within their Departments that the new deadline will be complied with?  Would he agree that it is not desirable in any matter however esoteric, that Departments should be seen not to comply with their obligations under the law in view of the fact that these Departments are responsible for enforcing the law on others?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that after almost 120 years, the time has come to review the method of appointing the members of the governing bodies of these institutions and, in view of the fact that Dublin will be the European City of Culture in 1991, that that would be the appropriate year to introduce the necessary legislation?  Would he further agree that the terms of office of some of the members of these governing bodies appears to be very long and that some turnover might be desirable?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the Deputy's general approach but I do not think there is any great, urgent and immediate difficulty about it.  I would like to suggest to the Deputy that we should regard this as a tidying up matter to be dealt with on some suitable occasion but I would not think it warrants legislation.  In the meantime, I can assure the Deputy that I will appoint the very best, most fully qualified people to these boards in so far as it is within my power to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will accept that the difficulty is that his scope for appointing members to these bodies is very limited.  For example, eight members of the board of the National Library are appointed by the RDS while only four are appointed by the State. Would the Taoiseach not agree that a wider range of bodies should be entitled to nominate members to the board and that he should have greater discretion in the matter instead of appointing only one third of the membership?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the composition of these boards represents the financial contributions made by bodies such as the Royal Dublin Society during the 19th century to these institutions and that this is no longer the case because nowadays the State makes almost the entire contribution towards the running of the bodies in question?  Would he further agree that this method of appointment has tended to create the condition where the average age of members of boards is rather high?  Would he also agree that in a modern era when we are trying to develop our heritage to the fullest extent, particularly to reach young people, we <Col N="523" /> should aim to have a greater representation of younger people on the boards of bodies such as these?</P>

I suppose the Deputies have a point and, as I said, perhaps we will get around to having a look at it in some other context.</P>

    <P>The Bill extends the benefits of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, together with six other major enactments, to all part-time employees who work more <Col N="526" /> than eight hours per week and have at least 13 weeks' continuous service.</P>

      <P>As the Minister responsible for equal opportunities legislation, would the Minister not accept that he has a particular responsibility to try to discriminate positively in favour of women to allow them to pursue their careers more fully?

      <P>No, I would not agree. My personal record in that area is probably one of the best in the whole Government. That is generally known and can be taken in conjunction with all the other initiatives I have undertaken on the equality area.  In the past ten days four different aspects have arisen.  The question of positive discrimination in favour of women or men is contrary to the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, but section 15 does allow positive measures to be undertaken specifically in regard to training where a particular sex is under-represented.  In that area we have been making significant progress within the Civil Service and the semi-State and private sectors.</P>

The chairman and members of the Commission are: Chairman, Mr. Dan McAuley, former Director General of the Federation of Irish Employers.  ICTU nominees, Mr. Kevin Duffy, Assistant General Secretary, ICTU.  Mr. Phil Flynn, General Secretary, Local Government and Public Services Union.  FIE nominees, Mr. Finbar Flood, Managing Director, Arthur Guinness Son &amp; Co. <Col N="530" /> (Dublin) Ltd. Mr. Turlough O'Sullivan, Director, Federation of Irish Employers. Minister's nominees, Dr. Joyce O'Connor, Director, National College of Industrial Relations.  Mr. Michael Keegan, Former Secretary Department of Labour.  The chief executive officer of the commission will be Mr. Kieran Mulvey, General Secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The commission will have responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations through the provision of a number of functions both new and existing. The commission will: provide conciliation and advisory services; prepare and offer guidance on codes of practice; provide an equality officer service; provide a rights commissioner service; conduct or commission research; review and monitor industrial relations developments and assist joint labour committees and joint industrial councils in the exercise of their functions.</P>
      <P>An important objective is to bring about a change in attitudes so that the responsibility for dispute resolution is shifted back to the parties themselves where it primarily belongs.  Through their various services, the commission will encourage and facilitate a more active approach to dispute prevention and resolution.</P>
      <P>The staff employed on the existing functions will be automatically transferred to the commission on its establishment. The question of additional staff will be a matter for the commission in consultation with the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Grant assistance from my Department's Vote to non-statutory organisations catering for the welfare needs of Irish emigrants to Britain is provided only on the recommendation of DÍON, the Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare Services.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in this House on 20 November 1990, in response to a similar question, it has been the practice of successive Ministers for Labour not to bring ministerial pressure to bear on DÍON in arriving at its grant recommendations.</P>
      <P>However, in accordance with standard practice I arranged to have copies of these questions and my reply forwarded to the chairperson of DÍON at the Irish Embassy in London for consideration in the context of DÍON's terms of reference and their priorities for 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> In the context of the resources available, DÍON, on a continuing basis, advise me on proposed changes of emphasis, refinements of services and on the development of new services.  The Deputy will be aware that in 1990 DÍON recommended seven new projects for grant funding.</P>
    <P>Because of their long experience and expertise in this whole area, I am satisfied that DÍON are in the best position to assess the need for further initiatives.  I am prepared to consider sympathetically any proposals I receive from DÍON in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is no drop-in day care centre for the Irish community in Birmingham and the fact that they are encountering a major problem there at present with homeless Irish people, especially middle aged homeless Irish people, would the Minister make urgent representations to the DÍON Committee to sympathetically consider their application next year?  Does he realise there is a major problem obtaining in the Midlands apart from London?  We hear about cardboard city in London but I can assure the Minister that there is an equally difficult problem being encountered <i>vis-à-vis</i> homeless in Birmingham.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  I know that Deputy Deenihan takes a particular interest in what is happening to our emigrants. I have read the full papers produced by the Birmingham Welfare Information Centre.  What they were endeavouring to do was to get a considerable grant from Birmingham City Council for housing.  At present, they have three staff in the centre there and want to extend the number, so the DÍON grant for this year will help in that endeavour.  I know they still experience problems.  I will certainly talk to the committee about them.</P>

It is not sufficient to say we are leaving it to the DÍON Committee and so on.

      <P>I should say that the <Col N="534" /> authorities here do not leave it to the nationals of other countries to look after the problems of our emigrants and the same applies abroad.  We provide outreach, frontline services, helping the voluntary organisations to run their administrations and provide services, advice and guidance.  As far as the provision of accommodation is concerned, it is our view and that of Irish organisations &mdash; whether it be the chaplaincy or other services &mdash; that these matters of capital funding are for the local authorities in the United Kingdom.  We endeavour to help, through CARA and the various other services, to achieve the maximum result. That is the work the DÍON committee carry out in conjunction with the Irish federation societies and many other bodies.</P>

      <P>I outlined the general position in this matter in my reply to the Deputy on 20 February of this year.  The general position in this matter and my position in relation to it have not changed since then.</P>
      <P>In the history of the State, members of the Oireachtas have been drawn from a great variety of employments.  There is no evidence that a general problem exists. In the majority of cases employers and employees negotiate suitable arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the reply the Minister has given, would he agree that employers who refuse to grant leave of absence in this manner to persons who have been elected to the Dáil or Seanad could be described only as bad employers and that always legislation is required to bring such employers into line?  Would he consider it would be important, therefore, not only to deal with issues which have already arisen in <Col N="536" /> this regard but also to avoid circumstances arising in the future when persons who present themselves for election, and are elected, are deprived of their chances to return to their jobs? Would he agree that such a procedure renders it very unattractive for people who work for a wage to put themselves forward for election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say this issue has never arisen because it has, but there is a wide range of arrangements at present in operation.  All Dálaí have been comprised of a large range of people from various walks of life, from the public sector generally and the private sector. In the Civil Service there are procedures whereby one must resign or there are arrangements for secondment within the private sector and so on which are normally negotiable.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arises in the non-public service sector.  Normally legislation would not seem to be necessary.  I accept that if it was to become a problem, or if a problem was irresolvable and people were not allowed to participate in active politics because of these difficulties we would have to look at it.  As I said to Deputy De Rossa the last time, if we were to look at the legislation which is there we would be looking at Acts like the Unfair Dismissals Act and it would not be most appropriate to try to amend it.  We would be accepting a certain fate for an individual going up for election, and that would be the wrong course.  I have heard suggestions on this and in all my years in the House I recall it being a problem once only.  For one problem I am not too sure that we should review the legislation.  I am prepared to listen to any suggestions the Deputy has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my colleagues, Deputy O'Sullivan, was affected in the past, not by an employer refusing to give leave of absence but because the law itself precluded him from standing. He was a post office employee at the time and was precluded from standing for election therefore.  The Dáil moved to remove that anomaly and, happily, <Col N="537" /> Deputy O'Sulilvan is with us now.  Will the Minister consider asking his colleague the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, whom, I understand, is due to introduce new electoral legislation to consider including a provision which would prevent discrimination against people seeking to be democratically elected to the Dáil or to the Seanad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will refer the issue.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan who is very much with us, it applied to me once because I was a public servant and had to make a special arrangement.  These special arrangements were always forthcoming and a number of times over the years legislation has had to be amended. It never precluded people from seeking election to the House.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to further my case because it is late in the day for that, but this goes back to the foundation of the State.  As the only victim of the 1923 Electoral Act, legislation which had been on the British Statute Book and transferred to ours, I feel people in the public sector are discriminated against.  There is a need for amending legislation and the amendment to that Act.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be difficult or talk about any cases that arose, but in the private sector many contracts prohibit people taking on outside duties in either the commercial or non-commercial sectors.  I do not think we can legislate for that.  We all know from our own political parties of people who wish to stand for election being told that under their contracts they have to resign from their job before the election, never mind on their election.  A number of semi-State bodies have corrected these provisions in contracts but I am not too sure that we can legislate to the private sector.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of apprentices in the country at the latest date for which figures are available; and of these, the numbers who are female; if he has any plans to increase the number of female apprentices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of registered apprentices is currently 12,167.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers, with FÁS and the educational system providing the off the job element of training. FÁS are implementing, in relation to female apprentices, a positive action programme in favour of women one of whose objectives is to increase significantly the rate of female participation in apprenticeship over the three year period 1990-93.  As a result, there has been an increase in the number of female apprentices from 117 at the end of 1989 to a current level of 145, an increase of 29 per cent.  The action programme has been developed in such a manner as to encourage and help more and more women to participate in sectors that have been traditionally dominated by men in the growth sectors of the economy. However, such initiatives cannot be successful without the active support and commitment of employers and I would urge employers to sponsor female apprentices.  In order to provide an additional incentive to companies and potential female apprentices, FÁS have intitiated bursaries in 1990 for new female apprentices to assist with apprenticeship support costs during the off the job training period.  The results of these initiatives will be evaluated and it is my intention to request FÁS to expand these initiatives where possible.</P>
      <P>The general question of equality and equity in relation to apprentice recruitment has been addressed in the review of apprenticeship undertaken by FÁS at my request.  These proposals are currently being examined in the context of the negotiation of a programme for economic and social development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the number of female apprentices, standing at just about 1 per cent of the total number of apprentices, is still abysmally inadequate, that it does not suggest an adequate response to the programme of action he refered to?  Does he accept the recent report to FÁS that a quota <Col N="540" /> of 10 per cent of apprenticeships as a minimum should be women?  Has he taken any steps to give effect to that report or to advance it in any way, or to introduce a quota system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A year or 15 months ago I issued the figures when I became aware of how few there were.  We set up a group to improve that.  At that stage we set 3.5 per cent quota to be reached by 1992, which would be 400.  We believe we can achieve that figure.  I do not think there is any point in trying to go for higher figures.  We would not achieve them.  We started the bursaries to try to convince employers that they would get women who would prove extremely good in the apprenticeship system.  Also there are various moves in the education system to get away from sex stereotype programmes that mean very few women seek apprenticeships.  FÁS are actively trying to increase the figures.</P>
      <P>The figures are one thing, but to get the necessary support from employers is another.  It is extremely difficult, even when positive discrimination is directed at maintaining the places.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore but the only way to achieve what he asks is by setting a quota and implementing it.  That is the policy we are now following.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that one of the reasons we have such a paucity of women in apprenticeships is that most of the apprenticeships tend to be traditional, and that there has been very little broadening of the base from which the apprentices are drawn?  There is a need to have an indepth analysis of the areas where we should have apprentices and that is the high-tech area, the computer area.  That should be part and parcel of any review and should be tackled as a matter of urgency with a view to redressing the imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. There is a far broader scope of apprenticeships in other countries.  The situation <Col N="541" /> here is primarily the result of our educational system and we hope to provide for far more apprenticeships than are there at present.</P>
      <P>The key issue in getting the numbers up is funding.  Every apprentice costs FÁS £8,000 per annum which is fairly high. FÁS have an input in two areas, in off the job training and where FÁS are linked with the employer in partial training. If we could make progress in those two areas that would be an achievement. The other aspect is to try to get more resources from employers but that is a matter which is under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the role of FÁS is central in this area let me ask the Minister if in the recent changeabout in the top positions in FÁS any consideration was given to what role the occupiers of those positions might play in promoting greater access to apprenticeships for women, what consideration we give to the track record of the appointees in the area of equality for women and if the Minister has had any discussion with the new chairman and the new chief executive of FÁS on any particular approach or any policy approach they might take to improve what everybody accepts is an absymally low figure of female apprentices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had discussions with the chairman but with the chief executive who is the former chairman. He is the one who has implemented the policy of 3½ per cent which is 400. Another point I would make is that where FÁS have held a quota of positions for women, women came out in the top three in most of these courses.  It is discrimination and traditional attitudes of blocking women from the courses rather than their ability to succeed in the courses that has been very unhelpful but it will take some time to change those views.</P>

Is the Minister also aware that many young people in rural areas find it almost impossible to get a sponsor?

The trade union movement were extremely unhelpful. Not alone did they not welcome the initiative for bringing full equality into the system, they changed the educational status for women entering.  The other side of the problem is the cost of getting the numbers up.  It is the employers we are dealing with at the moment.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline, using as a basis the definition of low pay used in the EC Social Charter of 68 per cent of average earnings, the number of persons on low pay in this country, if he will give the number of such employees who are (a) women and (b) aged under 25; if he intends to take any new initiative against low pay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In attempting to assess the extent of low pay a number of different thresholds are used rather than relating it to any single measure such as the standard set by the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>The ESRI in their research have used a number of thresholds based on the distribution of earnings and on a poverty standard.  This research using 1987 survey data estimates that about 28 per cent of employees fell below a threshold of £130 per week and 17 per cent below a £100 per week threshold.  The £130 threshold represented 65 per cent of average weekly earnings in June 1987.  The data confirmed that women and young workers under 25 years of age were particularly affected by low pay.  About half of the workers falling beneath each of the thresholds were under 25.  Two thirds of those below the lower threshold and 62 per cent of those below the higher one were women.</P>
      <P>Low pay is associated particularly with certain sectors of industry and services where categories of workers such as women, school-leavers, part-time workers and older workers predominate. Much of the low paid work tends to be unskilled, requiring few qualifications and with little prospect of promotion and subject to high rates of labour turnover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence, measures to comprehensively tackle the problem must therefore cover a range of areas such as education, training, social benefits and taxation as well as the question of pay. A major contribution can also be made <Col N="544" /> by increasing the level of job opportunities available.  Policies to address these issues are already in place and will be given further consideration in the negotiations on a new programme for social and economic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the numbers concerned are very high, over a quarter of the workforce under the threshold of £132 per week, and since the numbers of workers affected are predominantly women and young workers, can the Minister state if in the talks for a new programme for national recovery which I understand have now been completed any special measures have been agreed between the Government and the social partners to tackle the problem of low pay in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks are far from completed.  There is still a number of weeks to go.  The kind of measures we are talking about, the range of areas such as education, training, social benefits, taxation, as well as pay have to be looked at.  We have to look also at the number of job opportunities that are available in the economy.  The general view would be that all of these areas must be co-ordinated to improve the level of take home pay of people in low paid jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the problem of low pay is not so much due to factors such as education and training but to good old-fashion exploitation of cheap labour?  Could he indicate if he has any ideas in mind, for example, the introduction of minimum pay legislation to oblige employers who are exploiting both women and young workers in the area of pay to pay them an adequate wage for the work they do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions there.  Education and training has a lot to do with the plight of young workers and low paid workers.  They are in that position because of their educational standards and cannot get out of it.  It is due to the education system.  FÁS and a number of other schemes have been <Col N="545" /> developed in the last year or two to enable people who are unemployed or on low pay get back into education, and this helps significantly.  As regards the people who are being exploited, if they are not covered by trade unions, the joint labour committees which were strengthened by legislation during the course of the years should be used.  An independent chairman together with the trade union movement can look at the pay levels in each sector and fix them by registered agreements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock asked in his question what initiative the Minister intends to take.  I accept what the Minister has said about the joint labour committees but despite the best efforts of these committees, due to the shortage of inspectors their findings are in vain.  For instance, one inspector covers the whole area of Munster.  Bearing in mind that the type of industry affected includes hairdressers and other small industries, it is not possible for one inspector covering a whole area to react in a positive way to complaints he may receive.  These people have such a heavy workload that they are unable to cope with the problems.  That is the first point that should be taken into account if we are really serious about stamping out abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>There is, but we will consider the matter.  Deputy Mitchell has raised on a number of occasions in the House the whole question of the distribution of income, social welfare and taxation, and has referred to what was done last year by using the PRSI thresholds.  All these matters can affect the level of take home pay.  The family <Col N="546" /> income supplement is another such measure.  We are considering a combination of all these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the talks that are taking place &mdash; this is very crucial &mdash; I would ask the Minister not to exclude other matters such as means testing which can have an effect on the value of take home pay.  He should also consider basing all means tests on net pay rather than on gross pay.  That would make a significant impact on the value of take home pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a whole range of employments outside the remit of the joint labour committees where education and training is not the answer to the problem? There is a serious problem of low pay in employment, ranging from solicitors' offices to shops and so on.  The Minister has not signified what measures he as Minister for Labour will take to address the problem of low pay in those areas.  It is his responsibility to address this matter, which so far has not been addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a number of discussions on this matter recently. For example as regards shops there are indications of abuse.  We have been in discussion with the unions concerned and with the Labour Court about setting up a new joint labour committee in this area. Most of the low paid workers are either covered by unions or by the present joint labour committees, with a few exceptions such as the cleaning and security areas. There are applications in to extend the committees to these areas &mdash; they already cover the city areas but not the country as a whole.  In any area where I believe there is abuse and that it would be of value to extend the service of the joint labour committees, we are prepared to do so.  We are extending the service at present to at least two areas and will be glad to extend it to other areas.  On the other hand we are considering the take <Col N="547" /> home pay of low paid workers.  What has to be taken into account here is taxation in the broad sense, PRSI, the family income supplement and social welfare benefits generally.  It is taking all these matters together that we will make progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has overall responsibility for the well-being of Irish citizens abroad.  My brief is limited to welfare consideration relating to Irish workers in Britain.  Although I am in sympathy with the Deputy's general aim of attempting to smooth the passage of involuntary emigrants.  I do not consider this suggestion to be feasible for several reasons.</P>
      <P>Government policy is aimed at bringing involuntary emigration to an end through increasing the level of employment available at home.  For those who have the skills, qualifications and financial and other resources which will give a reasonable chance of success should they emigrate, the Government, through FÁS, have introduced a comprehensive pre-departure information service. Ireland is obliged, under EC law, to facilitate those who wish to exercise their right to seek employment elsewhere in the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My particular concern is for the young, the unqualified, the unskilled and the disadvantaged who are at serious risk should they emigrate.  If such persons approach FÁS for information or advice every effort will be made to dissuade them from emigrating.  As well, FÁS have a film, used as part of a module in training programmes for the educationally less qualified, highlighting the dangers of <Col N="548" /> emigration.  Attractive Youthreach programmes have been introduced by FÁS and the Department of Education to encourage potantial drop-outs to stay on in school and acquire qualifications.</P>
    <P>There is a real risk that a grant scheme for emigrants would encourage those most at risk to take the decision to emigrate. I know that no one in the House would wish to see anything being done which could unintentionally result in further human misery.  There is also the question of how it would be decided as to whether any particular person had been &ldquo;compelled&rdquo; to emigrate.  While some emigrants have been unemployed before leaving, many have given up jobs to do so.  A person in a job which they regarded as unsuitable might consider that they had been obliged to emigrate.</P>

      <P>The policy of the British Government at present to provide an extra £47 million towards housing giving priority in particular to people in &ldquo;cardboard city&rdquo;, has been a great help.  That is not to say there are no difficulties but it is far better that we do our utmost to identify the people who are at risk here. It is these people who are also at risk when they go abroad.  Not many people who are faring well here end up in &ldquo;cardboard city&rdquo; when they go abroad, and all the people in the emigrant services will tell you that.  These people continually ask us to try to identify people at risk, to keep them in the education system and to assist them as best we can.  For the people who do go abroad there are welfare sevices to assist them, and I acknowledge the great work of these services. We should not exaggerate that there are thousands of people involved.</P>

      <P>In view of the reply the Minister has given to Deputy Higgins as regards giving emigrants a start in England, I would ask him to request the Government to ensure that the &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; money paid to emigrants in travel tax on leaving this country should be returned to emigrant services.  I think this is a very plausible request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will investigate that. <Col N="550" /> It should be said also that the welfare services in many instances act with discretion in assisting people who are going abroad.  I know the welfare officers have a discretionary role in this regard and that they are quite helpful to people emigrating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has done a considerable amount and that he has doubled the DÍON fund. However, does he acknowledge that he has received very strong representations from the Irish Episcopal Conference on Emigration and that they instanced, as the number one priority, the difficulties faced by young people who go to England in the teeth of a recession without any money in their pockets?  They start and end up on the streets and, too often end up in the canals.  This point has been made to the Minister, in very forceful terms, by the Bishops' Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we give most of our money to the chaplaincy services but I agree with the Deputy that we must work harder in this regard.  The best solution is to try to identify these people while they are here before they go abroad and run into further difficulties.  Some of these people are often on the run from the security forces, they are a small group of people easily identifiable.  I give a commitment to the House that we will redouble our efforts to assist these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1990, the latest date for which statistics are available, the average weekly industrial wage was £255.23 for men and £153.34 for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there is a significant <Col N="551" /> imbalance between male and female earnings and I am not satisfied with the gap that exists.  The differences in industrial earnings result from a wide range of factors.  These include wage rates but, also, hours worked, overtime payments, shift or unsocial hours premia, payment by results, bonuses for output levels and payments for length of service.  It is as well to recognise that industrial wage statistics cover only a percentage of women who are at work and describe a situation where there is a tendency for women to be segregated into certain low pay areas and confined to a restricted range of jobs.</P>
    <P>While I want to make a number of changes to the employment equality legislation to simplify it and make it more effective, I am attaching equal importance to improving access for women to a wider range of jobs.  The employment of women in a wider range of jobs and at higher levels is essential to reducing the imbalance between male and female earnings.  In this regard several steps are being taken, particularly in the areas of improved training and access to employment and positive action.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that positive action programmes are implemented in both the public and private sectors. Towards this end in conjunction with the EEA during 1990, I launched the Equality Focus Award Scheme to encourage employers to implement positive action initiatives.  The first awards were presented last week.</P>
    <P>I am also monitoring positive action policies in State-sponsored bodies.  The Employment Equality Agency are actively continuing their work in the area of promoting positive action.  I am confident that these and other initiatives will help to improve the situation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will the Minister accept that if one included workers outside the manufacturing industrial area, the gap of £100 per week which exists between men and women in relation to average earnings, might actually be larger?  Will he also <Col N="552" /> accept that employers are now systematically structuring their workforces in such a way as to avoid claims under equal pay legislation?  Will he also agree that there is a necesssity to amend the equal pay legislation in order to allow women workers a greater facility to process claims for higher pay where they believe their work is under-valued?</P>

I must also acknowledge the efforts of the Federation of Irish Employers recently &mdash; and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights have also been helpful &mdash; in regard to equal opportunities.  We have emphasised the positive benefits to employers of equal opportunities and yesterday the FIE issued a very good explanatory booklet to 3,500 of their members.  I had been calling on them for some time to do that and, taken in conjunction with the efforts of the ICTU and people in the retail market earlier in the year, it is clear that employers are beginning to look at the positive aspects, apart from the provisions of legislation.</P>

    <Title>Estimates for Public Services 1991 and Public Capital Programme 1991: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on 18 December 1990:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the 1991 Estimates from the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1991 Summary Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notes that the Estimates will do nothing to repair the social and economic damage of the last three years, and notes in particular that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;no money is provided for the hiring of one extra teacher at primary or secondary level &mdash; as a proportion of GNP, overall education spending is 5.6 per cent &mdash; the lowest level since the start of the 1980s;</P>
    <P>&mdash;third world aid, which has been savagely cut in recent years, has been cut again in real terms;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" />&mdash;increases in health spending are totally inadequate to meet the needs of long queues for services, and will neither reopen beds nor hire sufficient extra staff &mdash; the proportion of GNP spent on health, according to these Estimates, will be no more than 6.3 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Social Welfare Estimate will not even begin to paper over the cracks in the extent of poverty in Ireland;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the revenue available to local authorities, many of whom are in crisis, is frozen for another year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;there will be almost no public housing starts next year, and Dáil Éireann further notes that in capital terms, there is a shift in spending away from social infrastructure towards other sectors.  Critical capital needs in the health and education areas are not going to be met for another year, and calls on the Government to take note of these major concerns and criticisms in the framing of the Budget for 1991.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to remarks in relation to the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Office of Public Works.  With regard to the Vote for the Office of Public Works, I have a particular interest in the Vote for National Monuments which has been increased to £7.85 million from £5.632 million in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a totally inadequate sum to have any kind of meaningful policy in relation to the protection of our national monuments. I appreciate that the Office of Public Works are well meaning and that they understand the problem, but the people who provide the money &mdash; and <Col N="600" /> this of course is an historical thing &mdash; do not realise the wealth of historical monuments and, worse, the level of neglect to which they are subjected. There are, according to some estimates, almost 100,000 monuments of various kinds and ages in this country and probably 20,000 of the field earth work monuments date from the pre-Celtic period, the Bronze Age and the early Christian period.</P>
    <P>The national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works have been in existence since 1886, 114 years ago, and in that time about 700 monuments out of a possible 100,000 have been taken into care by them.  We are not arguing that we should be able to take on the 100,000 monuments, even in 114 years it would have been difficult to have a policy which would take every monument into care. However, it is not a great record of the way the resources have been targeted during the period that it is the sum total of the achievements of the national monuments branch of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Many of our monuments, significant archaeological sites, have been encroached upon and are being destroyed by so-called farm improvements, so-called afforestation and by urban spread.  There has been no response to that kind of thing taking place because we do not have the personnel or the resources to respond. We welcome any increase in the amount of money provided but the sad part is &mdash; it is a pity the Minister for Finance is not here because the Office of Public Works are part of his responsibility &mdash; that the increase will probably do no more than cover the increase in costs within the Office of Public Works in the coming year in relation to national monuments.</P>
    <P>Another area covered by the Office of Public Works which is very rarely referred to in this House is wildlife and nature conservation.  We have an appalling record in this area.  In the Estimates under subhead I the allocation for the National Wildlife Service operated by the <Col N="601" /> Office of Public Works goes up from a pathetic £1.263 million in 1990 to £1.637 million in 1991.  In percentage terms that is a 30 per cent increase but it is an increase on a very small amount of money.</P>
    <P>To say the very least the Wildlife Service is understaffed and underfunded and compared to similar organisations in other countries the level at which it is allowed to operate is pathetic.  The Minister said before in the House that there has been an increase in contract work, but there is a limit to the number of contracts that can be handled and processed by existing properly trained staff. I am talking about the problems in relation to the environment with which ordinary administrative staff are not qualified to deal.  There is a limit on the number of pieces of paper any member of an administrative staff can move around. What we need is an increase in the number of qualified people in the Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>We have nature reserves which cannot be protected because we do not have the personnel to manage them.  We need wardens for game reserves, slob lands or whatever.  According to figures I have, about 3.28 per cent of the surface of Ireland is designated as areas of scientific interest.  These are nature reserves, the last undisturbed places in the country where wildlife and fauna have a safe haven to breed and flourish.  Of that 3.28 per cent, at least 50 per cent is directly threatened by events taking place around it.  Only a fraction of 1 per cent of that total area has been designated as protected. It is one thing to say we are protecting them by putting a protection order on them, but there is still no personnel to provide that protection and to stop these areas being encroached upon and destroyed.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in relation to land acquisition.  There is no funding worth talking about providing for land acquisition. A number of opportunities in which the State could have bought land were <Col N="602" /> lost but every time we were beaten off because there were not any resources to buy these lands.  We all remember the famous Inch peninsula case.  It was lost to a private developer despite the goodwill of the owners who wished to sell it to the State.  The State could not provide the funds and hence it was lost.  There are cases of that kind all over the country. I know we are on a tight budget, but we have obligations under the Wildlife Act. We are promised another Wildlife Act but we are not honouring the obligations of the present Act.  We are at present breaking the law under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  We have obligations under EC regulations in relation to the protection of wildlife and nature conservation but it seems that we are in violation of those regulations.  We are also bound by international agreements we entered into, for instance the Ransar Agreement which deals particularly with wetlands in environmentally sensitive areas.  It is clear that we are not honouring our responsibilities under that agreement. We need a full-time acquisitions staff and a regular acquisitions vote.</P>
    <P>I noticed that as one of the Minister's proposals, wildlife and national parks, which have been set apart here, are to come together after Christmas.  Will we now get what one often finds in the public service, competition between two sections of the Department which are being brought together?  One often finds that the stronger section will pillage the already weaker resources of the other and almost cut out of existence any work they may be engaged in.  That is another fundamental question that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I would like to share my time by giving five minutes to Deputy Hogan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just a formality of getting the House to agree. Is it agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Environmentally sensitive areas come within the ambit of the <Col N="603" /> Department of Agriculture and Food but they are closely related to wildlife and nature conservation.  Last year in the Book of Estimates £100,000 was provided for environmentally sensitive areas.  There is no increase this year. What is not stated is that £65,000 of this sum is provided by the EC; all that the Exchequer is providing is £35,000.  That would not pay the salary of a principal officer in the Department of Agriculture and Food, but that is the Government's contribution to putting in place a plan or a policy on environmentally sensitive areas of special scientific interest.</P>
      <P>We often make comparisons, some of them odious, with what takes place in Northern Ireland but the Northern Ireland budget is £75,000 and there is a Government objective which supports farmers incomes and that is at the basis of these ESA schemes.  There is a Government objective that supports farmers' incomes while at the same time protecting the environment.  There is an important link.  They are asking the people who live in these areas to be environmentally sensitive in the way they farm so as to enhance and protect a particularly delicate environment.  It does not cost a lot because it is the people who live in these areas who must ultimately protect them.  A warden scheme in areas where people do not live is fair enough, but there are many areas which are environmentally sensitive and of scientific interest where thousands of people live, and we can link those people quite cheaply into being wardens and conservationists. That is what is being done in Northern Ireland, and that is EC policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the Vote for Agriculture very disappointing.  I refer particularly to the subheads which cover things like headage payments and income supports to farmers.  Despite what the Minister has been saying, the amount of money voted for income support is down by 4 per cent <Col N="604" /> on the 1990 figure.  This is crucial.  We go along with a policy which says we should provide income support for farmers. About 55 per cent of farmers in Ireland are marginal.  That means that under the GATT round, these people in the short term will go out of business.  However, for the short time they will be there, it seems that the Government support the idea of income supports by what they say but not by what they do.  The only tangible income supports we have in this country which reach out to these people are the headage payments.  It is unbelievable that the Minister announces that the disadvantaged areas in Ireland will cover 72 per cent of the land area in Ireland in 1991; it was 62 per cent in 1990, that is an increase of 10 per cent on what it has been since 1981 and yet the fund is reduced from £76.3 million in the current year to £73.5 million.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance are not present but I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pass on what I have to say.  I would hope that either of the Ministers will hear it on their monitors.  Can the Minister explain how we can extend headage payments and income supports to farmers whose incomes will be adversely affected in the coming year by a world trade agreement while, at the same time, we cut the amount of money that finances these income supports?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Estimate for the Public Service, the first item I want to speak about is the need for an allocation in respect of an extension to St. Luke's Hospital under the Health Estimate.  The Minister for Health made commitments in this regard during 1990.  Throughout the entire year he and public representatives from the Government constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny clearly indicated that moneys would be made available to commence work on the project of extending St. Luke's Hospital.  I regret that doubt is cast on this allocation of finance in the 1991 Estimate.  I plead with the Minister for Health to find the appropriate money; if not in the context <Col N="605" /> of the Public Capital Programme through Exchequer support, he can do so through an allocation from the national lottery in order that work can commence in 1991.</P>
      <P>You will be aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that St. Luke's Hospital, the staff and patients, have put up with much inconvenience for the last number of years.  It caters for a population of over 100,000 people in Carlow and Kilkenny. It has been kicked around as a political football for far too long.  On this occasion I hope we will see the end of the controversy and that the people who are outside at the gates as we speak &mdash; who are demanding proper facilities for the patients and staff and for all the people who contribute enormously to the health services in Kilkenny &mdash; will receive fair treatment in the Estimates for 1991.</P>
      <P>I want also to refer briefly to the income crisis in agriculture.  I am sorry to say this Government have done nothing, in spite of the signals given over the past 12 months, to alleviate the problem of the income crisis in farming.  One would imagine that nothing could be done and that there was no precedent for doing anything in relation to giving direct income support to the farming community in their hour of need.  We had a precedent in 1985-86 when farm organisations were on the streets because of bad weather conditions when we had nothing as serious as the present income crisis.  Unfortunately, late in the day they are beginning to realise that the small and medium-sized farmers are on their knees in terms of needing direct income support. I am besieged daily by farmers to give more flexibility to the social welfare code so that they will have some direct income support for Christmas.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food, with the help of the good offices of the Irish Commissioner for Agriculture on this unique occasion to put on the agenda of the EC and GATT negotiations which are taking place at present that the whole country of Ireland be declared as a disadvantaged area, particularly in the context of compensatory mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> The outlook for the agricultural community is not good.  I should say the Minister is doing his damndest in a European context to soften the blow.  I would like to hear him articulate what type of plan and compensatory measures are in the mind of the Government at present to compensate rural economies for the effects of this savage blow to their incomes at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to an item under the Department of Defence Vote where £11 million is being allocated for air and sea rescue craft, under the heading of Maritime Protection.  This is another political football.  Some of the worst aircraft, which have a range of only 100 nautical miles, are being purchased by the Government from a Spanish company. We have not got any details from the Minister for Defence of the extent to which this maritime rescue service will operate, where it will operate from, whether the craft will be sufficiently equipped and whether the personnel will be trained or whether there is an allocation for this purpose in the Estimate? These are some of the matters that need to be addressed and fleshed out more fully in the context of the winding up speech of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few years we have seen a striking turnabout in the economic position of this country.  From a situation where we were facing economic ruin, we have moved to where we can now look back on a period during which: an average economic growth rate of 4 per cent per annum has been achieved; emigration has fallen rapidly and there has been a significant decrease in unemployment levels; Government borrowing at around 2 per cent is at its lowest level for over 30 years; and we have seen real decreases in personal and indirect taxation rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the past week we have seen how our inflation rate is now, along with <Col N="607" /> Denmark's, the lowest in the European Community.</P>
    <P>All this has not come about fortuitously. It has happened because of decisions taken by Government, hard decisions, which often went against the grain, but which it was recognised had to be taken if we were to ensure a return to economic prosperity for our country.  It was possible to do this, not alone because there was a will within Government to do it, but because within this time there was a new consensus between the Government and the social partners on how our economic problems were to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Within the past 18 months, the agreed Programme for Government has given a clear orientation to that task.  The programme, and the way it is being carried out, has shown how wrong were those who, in good faith or otherwise, claimed that a coalition could not work in this country.  What will not work and what has been shown not to work is a coalition where the partners are basically ideologically incompatible.</P>
    <P>In formulating the 1991 Estimates and Public Capital Programme the Government have been very conscious of the need to continue a restrained approach if we are to continue to improve our economic position and meet the targets we have set ourselves, especially in the priority area of job creation.</P>
    <P>In formulating the Estimate for my Department care was taken to ensure that expenditure would be allocated to areas which could most constructively lead to increased employment opportunities taking account of the measures set out in the operational programme for industry agreed with the Commission, and the need to further improve the public finances.</P>
    <P>The second Triennial Review of Industrial Performance carried out by my Department was published yesterday. The review records the improvement in the performance of industry in Ireland in the period 1987-89 as compared with the <Col N="608" /> earlier part of the eighties.  Output and exports have grown strongly while the trend of employment losses has been reversed and net job gains have now been achieved.</P>
    <P>The review is primarily a review of performance, not of policy, and while certain policy changes are announced in it, I intend to review and, when necessary, change policy on a continuing basis. In doing so, I will have particular regard to the views of the social partners in the context of the current discussions on a new Programme for Economic and Social Development.</P>
    <P>The total cost to the State of the industrial promotion effort between grants, advisory services, tax reductions and administration costs amounts to some £600 million each year.  Given the overall results achieved to date, I am not convinced that the correct balance of industrial policy instruments has as yet been achieved.  I am, therefore, considering the possibility of instituting a comprehensive reappraisal of industrial policy on the lines of that carried out in the early eighties.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I am arranging for measures to be taken to further improve the selectivity of grant supports to industry and reduce their costs while maintaining the key target of 20,000 gross new jobs per year in industry. These changes include: a reduction in the average grant cost per job for overseas industry to 75 per cent of the current level: this will all happen over a three year period; a reduction in the maximum fixed asset grant rate for overseas expansion projects to 15 per cent of investment; 50 per cent of all financial supports to medium-large indigenous industry is to be in the form of equity or other repayable or remunerating forms of aid; a maximum fixed asset grant rate for small industry expansion projects is to be set at 25 per cent as currently applies to medium-large indigenous industry; and a maximum rate of employment grants for <Col N="609" /> small industry start-up projects of £4,000 per job.</P>
    <P>The review concludes that there is scope for a significant rationalisation of the industrial development agencies.  As a first step I have agreed with my Government colleagues that: as previously announced, the IDA will function as the sole overseas industrial promotion agency for Ireland; the activities of IDA and NADCORP will be more closely integrated; and Coras Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council will be merged to form a new Irish Marketing Agency.</P>
    <P>The allocation for 1991 to the Industrial Development Authority in respect of grant payments to industry has reduced from £110 million in 1990 to £106 million. When account is taken of revenue generated by the Authority, their total grant budget will fall by £6 million.  The changes in grant programmes that I announced above plus the continuing effects of previous reductions will allow for this reduction to be accommodated without any adverse effect on the job creation effort.</P>
    <P>In so far as Shannon Development is concerned the House will be aware that I announced certain changes in relation to the company's responsibilities in July last.  During 1991 the company will, however, continue to be responsible for all indigenous industry in the mid west region, operating under delegated authority from the IDA, and all Shannon Free Zone industry, including aviation-related projects in the greater Shannon Airport area.</P>
    <P>The company's grants provision has been increased to provide for payment of capital and training grants already approved by the Government in respect of what will be, I hope, the first of many such aviation projects in the area.  This project, Shannon Aerospace, is a joint venture between the GPA Group, Lufthansa German Airlines and Swissair involving an aircraft maintenance facility for Boeing 737 and MD 80 aircraft and <Col N="610" /> will provide over 1,000 jobs at Shannon over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development will also have responsibility for promoting, in conjunction with the IDA, Plassey Technological Park, including, particularly, International Business Incubation Centre of Japan projects, and the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The allocations to IDA and SFADCo, £11.95 million and £3.78 million respectively, in respect of the provision of industrial land and buildings include increases of 4 per cent in line with the European Community GDP inflator.  The levels of State expenditure in this area are considerably down on the very high levels incurred in the early eighties.  State policy now is to act in a pump-priming role with the State providing the basic infrastructure and private developers providing the factory space.  Private developers have already agreed with IDA to provide 25 new factories in various locations around the country. SFADCo have also been successful in this regard with private developers being involved in the provision of an International Science Centre and a high tech factory unit at Plassey Technological Park as well as the provision of space in the Shannon Business Park.  I believe that the time is now opportune to carry out a fundamental review of State involvement in the provision of industrial space.  I have, therefore, requested my Department to initiate such a study during the course of 1991.</P>
    <P>Another successful job creation area is, of course, the International Financial Services Centre.  To date, over 140 projects have been approved to set up in the centre and these will provide over 2,430 jobs when in full operation.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to trade.  One issue which will certainly take up a considerable amount of my and my Department's efforts in 1991 is the continuing negotiations on the GATT.</P>
    <P>The suspension of the negotiations at <Col N="611" /> the Brussels Ministerial talks was disappointing. We must hope that there will be greater realism on the part of our trading partners when the talks are taken up again in mid-January.  The Community's united strength and its determination to follow, in the words of the European Council, a global approach, based on balanced concessions, will significantly contribute to the achievement of a global package of trade liberalisation in the present talks.  The importance of our agricultural sector underlines the necessity for Ireland, and the Community as a whole, to convince other contracting parties to re-examine the Community's proposal on agriculture, which is both meaningful and realisable.</P>
    <P>Our objective for the nineties and beyond has always been a newly invigorated and reinforced GATT which sets out unambiguously the undisputed rules by which international trade is conducted. In this way, new markets will be opened up for our exporters and existing markets secured against threats to close them in the course of trade disputes.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to marketing. The very strong growth in our export performance in recent years has slowed considerably in 1990 and CTT are now predicting exports for the year to approach £14.6 billion the same as 1989. While the volume of our exports is expected to rise by 6 per cent, a similar level of price deflation will result in no growth in the value of exports this year. Structural changes in agri-business and in computers combined with a marked slowdown in some of our major markets and the uncertainties created by the Gulf crisis are all negative factors which will impinge on this year's outturn.</P>
    <P>Expectations for 1991 of course are subject to developments in the international arena.  However, it is evident that some major economies are slowing considerably and with recession in Britain and possibly also in the US, 1991 will be a difficult year for our exporters.  However, <Col N="612" /> our low inflation rate and continuing gains in competitiveness, especially in comparison with the UK, should help offset these trading difficulties to some extent.</P>
    <P>As I have said our export performance in 1990 has not been as strong as in previous years.  It is, however, the case that many indigenous companies are now undoubtedly fitter, leaner and more competitive. Indeed CTT surveys this year indicate that the value of indigenous exports has risen by some 4 per cent compared with the static position for total exports.  Given the challenges that lie ahead in terms of both increased access to and increased competition in overseas markets, it remains essential that Irish companies respond by placing a greater emphasis on the marketing function.  For too long Irish industry has paid lip service to the need for improved marketing performance.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, an important part of the process towards a more integrated Europe after 1992 is the doubling of Structural Funds to less developed regions, including Ireland, by 1993.  As part of the support package negotiated for industrial development we have succeeded in attracting significant financial support from the European Commission for programmes which are designed to improve the marketing capability of Irish firms.  Marketing programmes operated by Coras Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council will attract the highest support, 75 per cent, available under the industrial programme.</P>
    <P>This level of Structural Funds support is the underlying reason the Government are able to allocate in 1991 £32.5 million to Coras Tráchtála, an increase of 32 per cent and £2.065 million to the Irish Goods Council, an increase of 15 per cent.  The exceptional degree of support is pretty well unique these days.  It reflects the Government's, and indeed the European Commission's, will to do what they can to tackle a fundamental weakness which <Col N="613" /> has plagued Irish firms in the past and which is still very evident today.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear, however, that the continuation of this level of assistance has a timescale and it should not be seen as a panacea for the marketing ills of Irish industry.  Funds will only be devoted to projects which promise strategic development and major incremental growth within companies.</P>
    <P>The additional allocations for marketing services will be devoted to specific new programmes which have been developed over the past two years.  CTT's regional markets programme is helping Irish firms build long term business relationships in selected regions in Europe which are showing above average economic performance.  Regions where the programme has already commenced, like Baden Wurtemburg and Rhone Alps where work started this year, will be the subject of further follow up activity.  CTT will also bring new regions like Portugal, the Rotterdam area and East Germany into the programme in 1991.</P>
    <P>The other area of CTT activity which will receive additional resources next year is its targeted marketing consultancy programme which was launched in January this year.  Over 30 approvals under this programme have now been made by CTT involving grant payments over the next two years in excess of £11 million. The target sales of the projects approved to date amount to over £500 million.  I am hopeful that this programme will prove of major benefit to our exporting efforts in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The picture which emerges from the Estimate for my Department and the reorganisation measure which I announced yesterday is of a more focused delivery of increased State resources to support the marketing efforts of industry. I expect to see a significant response from industry.  State support can only be an instigator and catalyst for action by firms themselves.  What is on offer are attractive but disciplined supports which will <Col N="614" /> be extremely helpful to firms which are committed to significant development.</P>
    <P>The Science and Technology Programme, initiated in 1987, will in 1991 have an allocation of £26.882 million. This will allow us to continue to build on the considerable success which has already been achieved in the existing elements.  These include various programmes in advanced technology, dealing with such areas as biotechnology, advanced manufacturing technology and optoelectronics, as well as initiatives in the area of higher education-industry co-operation which is succeeding in improving the linkages between the expertise available in our third level institutions and the needs of our industry.  All these elements will be continued and, indeed, strengthened in 1991.  A number of initiatives intended to strengthen the regional scientific and technological infrastructure will also be commenced in 1991.  These initiatives will focus on the potential of the RTCs to respond to the needs of industry.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to refer briefly to important legislation involving the commerce area of my Department.  I intend to bring forward early in the next session a Bill to give effect in Irish law to the EC Council Directive concerning liability for defective products.  The main purpose of the Bill will be to impose strict or no fault liability on the producer of a defective product irrespective of whether any negligence was entailed in the manufacture of the product.  This will make it easier for consumers to obtain redress in cases of damage arising from defective products.</P>
    <P>The year 1990 has certainly been a landmark year as far as company law reform is concerned, with two Acts of major importance passed.  The Dáil was, of course, recalled in August, and passed the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990 which introduced, ahead of schedule, new company protection provisions.</P>
    <P>Only last week, the Seanad passed the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which had <Col N="615" /> earlier in the month been passed by the Dáil, and this Bill has now been submitted to the President for signature. This Bill is, by any yardstick, a major piece of reforming legislation, and I think Deputies from all sides of the House deserve a great deal of credit for improving and refining it along the way.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we now have, as a result, a modern code of company law within which Irish companies can operate in the years ahead, one which is at least on a par with what exists in most other developed countries, and indeed is more advanced than many, in some respects.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not the end of reform in the company law area, however, since we must now turn to the implementation of several outstanding European Community Directives in this field.  While the Bill made modest gains in this respect, implementing three such directives along the way, there are still another eight due to be implemented within the next two years, and my Department will be working on these in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Further important new legislation will be introduced at the beginning of next year in the area of competition policy. The Programme for Government contained a commitment to incorporate provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome in Irish law.  These Articles prohibit anti-competitive behaviour and the abuse of dominant position within the European Community.  The objective is to bring these rules and codes of behaviour to bear on business activity within the State.</P>
    <P>In effect this will amount to a new and radical approach to the competition law here.  We will be adopting a general system of prohibition on anti-competitive behaviour in place of the existing legislative tools which permit us to control anti-competitive practices on a case by case basis.  Work in my Department has been proceeding at an intensive pace which has included thorough interdepartmental consultation.  This process <Col N="616" /> is now complete, and the parliamentary draftsman, who has been occupied with other legislation emanating from my Department, is now in a position to give his full attention to the final and definitive draft of the competition Bill.</P>
    <P>We are also well advanced in the process of significant reform in the area of unit trusts legislation.  The Unit Trusts Bill, 1990, which updates and repeals the 1972 Act, has just completed its passage through this House and is due for consideration by the Seanad later this week. The Bill provides for revised, modernised arrangements for the control and regulation of unit trust schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Estimates have been formulated to continue the improvement in this country's economic position, and ensure the provision of a better business climate.  The Estimate for my Department will contribute towards this with the creation of a significant level of sustainable employment in manufacturing and the services area and a greater concentration of resources on upgrading the marketing and technological performance of Irish industry, where we have traditionally been weak.</P>
    <P>Europe is changing rapidly with the completion of the internal market and developments in Eastern Europe.  I believe that we can look forward to the future with optimism.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had known the Minister for Industry and Commerce was going to speak, I would have geared my remarks specifically to the publication of the second triennial report on industrial performance.  I did not know that and, to the best of my knowledge, the Minister has not yet provided us with a copy of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry about that.</P>

    <Col N="617" />
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he will do this during the course of the day as it is probably the most critical question we should address.  A great deal has been said about unemployment and poverty being the alternate sides of the same coin but it can only be tackled if we create more wealth and generate more jobs in the economy and that brings us back to our industrial strategy.  From what I have seen in the newspapers, I would welcome a number of aspects of the analysis of our performance in the period under review. However, the Minister did not go as far as we might have reasonably expected him to in a number of areas.  It is disappointing that he should say at this stage, having regard to the contents of the report, that he will now initiate a major review of industrial policy.  A great number of the reports which have been produced show where our industrial policy is going wrong and that, having spent billions of pounds on industrial policy during the past 20 years, we are not getting good value for money.  Those areas have been identified.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that it is more than ten years since the publication of the Telesis report it is disheartening that we are only now getting a commitment from the Minister to act on it.  He has stated that he is going to implement a number of measures immediately, most of which I would welcome, but he shied away from the rationalisation of agencies we might reasonably have expected him to enagage in.  I presume the reason for this is the fierce political lobby which is capable of being mobilised in that area. However, there is no doubt that there has been waste, overlapping and duplication in this area and I presume this caused the publication of the report to be delayed.  The Minister has trimmed the edges but has not initiated the fundamental institutional reform we might have expected and that is disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other matters in the report that I welcome.  I am a bit surprised at the figure of £600 million <Col N="618" /> per year being the cost of our industrial promotion policy in terms of direct grants and the cost of tax breaks.  I am virtually certain that in recent times I have been quoted figures in excess of that in replies to parliamentary questions.  Even if the figure of £600 million is correct it is still a great amount of money and there is no doubt that we have not been getting value for money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's seal of approval for the taking of stakes and equity participation in companies as a way forward in the future; in other words, when people look for loan capital or grants in the future, the agency will have the right to look for equity participation and this is to be welcomed.  The targeting of money on companies who have the capacity to grow is also welcome.</P>
    <P>The performance of our indigenous sector has been lamentable.  That is where the major defect in our industrial strategy has taken us.  Whatever one might say about foreign owned companies, they provide employment &mdash; the figure stands at about 90,000 people at present &mdash; but the performance of the indigenous sector has been very poor and concentration on it is well merited.  I sincerely hope the Minister will make arrangements for us to debate this very important subject in the future.  He has said that he is considering the possibility of instituting a comprehensive reappraisal. The reports point in the right direction.  The Minister must take his courage in his hands and confront his colleagues in Cabinet with the facts of life which have been established since the Telesis report.  Some of these measures must be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance referred to the role which the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has played in creating the climate which has brought some economic indicators right, albeit not employment. The apparently successful termination of discussions yesterday between the social interests on the parameters for a new programme will be <Col N="619" /> widely welcomed as good news for the economy.  It will be seen as continuing the unprecedentedly favourable climate of stability and certainty that was provided by the previous programme.  It is a matter for the parties to the negotiations to choose when to reveal the contents of the new draft agreement.  The deadline of 20 January which they have set as the date by which they must secure the allegience of their respective constitutencies presumably means that we will know the details quite shortly.  If changes are necessary by 20 January the Minister will have to see whether these changes can be accommodated in the budget.</P>
    <P>My party have traditionally supported the concept of national bargaining because we believe in seriously addressing the question of the social wage rather than notional percentage increases.  The Government must necessarily be involved along with the other social interests if the social wage is to be delivered. If we are to make serious advances on issues such as job creation, income tax reform, profit sharing and a national minimum wage we need new legal and institutional structures to allow for these.</P>
    <P>If the proposed new programme for social and economic development does not seriously and in a relevant and meaningful way address these issues then it will founder.  I say that as a former trade union official because in the eyes of a great many workers the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was no more than a mechanism for wage control.  It heralded a period of bonanza profits for leading companies in which workers who contributed to the creation of those bonanza profits may not by definition share. Therefore any new agreement, as well as establishing a pay norm, must have the flexibility to permit bargaining at plant level, based on the performance of the individual plant or enterprise.  For all the sacrifices made by workers and their families during the three-year period of the <Col N="620" /> recent programme, they understand that very little of the profits spiral was reinvested in new job creation and that the problem of poverty in our society has worsened.</P>
    <P>In publishing the triennial report on industrial performance the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reported today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as stating:</P>
    <P>Around £1,400 million has been raised by Irish companies on the Stock Exchange but only £100 million has been invested in manufacturing in Ireland.  The rest of it went abroad or was used for non-manufacturing purposes. I find that very disappointing.</P>
    <P>I too find it disappointing.  The major challenge facing our economy is to cause a greater proportion of the substantial profits being generated here to be reinvested in productive job creation.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that while this is going on the Government are engaged in a rampant programme of privatisation of some of our most successful State enterprises such as Irish Life, Telecom Éireann and the Irish Sugar Company.  This is happening in regard to the Irish Sugar Company in the context of the desperate need to create a substantial food industry, the collapse of the Goodman effort in conjunction with the IDA to do that, and the fact that the Sugar Company has the skills and technology to enable it to be built upon and used as an engine for job creation.  It would be very regrettable if the Government continued that programme of privatisation.  It is an ideological assault on the State companies.  I should like to have had a great deal more time to expand on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me thank all those Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  I want to begin my summing up by looking at the amendments to the Government motion under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I must say, an element of <i>dejà-vu</i> about the proposed amendment <Col N="621" /> by The Workers' Party.  Last year they also called on the Government to redraft the Estimates &ldquo;...to enable unemployment and emigration to be tackled by stimulating a far more rapid rate of job creation&rdquo;.  This year The Workers' Party have used exactly the same wording despite the fact that this Government's record, and that of our predecessor, on job creation has been outstandingly good.</P>
    <P>In the year to April 1990 total employment is estimated to have increased by 30,000 or 2.8 per cent.  This rate of increase compares more than favourably with that for other EC member states: the 1990 forecast for the total Community is an increase of 1.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the three years to last April there was an increase in total employment of 40,000.  This figure masks an even more impressive reality.  When one allows for the full reduction in public sector numbers, one finds that the increase in sustainable non-farm private sector employment was well over 60,000.</P>
    <P>The increase of 30,000 in total employment to last April was the best performance since 1979 and contrasts very favourably with the fall of 76,000 in the seven years to 1987.  More important, the employment growth now taking place is soundly based and is sustainable.  The Government could, of course, do as The Workers' Party want and increase employment by means of inflated public expenditure.  This would be a very short term measure indeed and is probably the fastest way one could think of to wipe out the gains we have made in the past three years, kill off our growth prospects and raise both unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>All available indicators since April 1990 point unambiguously to further strong increases in employment throughout the economy, with the key manufacturing sector doing particularly well.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Labour Force Survey also showed a further large fall in unemployment, down 19,000 as compared with <Col N="622" /> April 1989, giving a total fall of 49,000 or 21 per cent in the three years since April 1987.  On a live register basis unemployment will fall again this year, although not as fast as in 1989.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there was a reduction of 15,000 in the total net emigration figure in the 12 months to last April as compared with the figure for the previous 12 months from 46,000 to 31,000.  The limited information available since April, while not a direct measure of emigration, strongly supports the view that the figure is continuing to decline. Inevitably, this trend affects the level of registered unemployment, but it is not a reason for a departure from the successful policies of the last few years.  On the contrary, the best hope for the unemployed is that the thrust of policy remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>What The Workers' Party are apparently unable to grasp is the basic fact that the rate at which employment can be created is dependent primarily on the rate at which the economy can grow.  I am glad Deputy Quinn acknowledged this point in his contribution when he linked economic growth with the wealth creation needed to provide services and employment.  Let me stress that we ignore this essential relationship at our peril.  Artificial job creation &mdash; for example through increases in employment financed from unsustainable levels of public expenditure &mdash; is ultimately self-defeating and extracts a heavy price.  We have only to look at the experience of the eighties to see this: mounting indebtedness, a rising tax burden, lost competitiveness and falling employment.  We will not repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
    <P>We have already put in place many of the essential building blocks for real employment growth and general economic and social progress over the medium term.  I reject out of hand the assertion in the amendment in the name of Deputy Quinn that Government policy since 1987 has resulted in social and economic damage.  The welfare and best interests <Col N="623" /> of the least well off have been and will remain high on our social agenda.</P>
    <P>Our progress over the past few years under the policies of sound economic management pursued since 1987 has been remarkable.  For example, the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been brought down to levels below those prevailing in most other EC countries.  As a result the national debt/GNP ratio is firmly on a downward trajectory.  Interest rates here are lower than in the United Kingdom &mdash; still our main market &mdash; and inflation is now down to 2.7 per cent lower than the German rate.  While on the subject of interest rates let me once again put on record the dramatic gains made since March 1987.  In March 1987 three-month money raised in the Dublin interbank market was over nine percentage points more expensive than on the three-month money market in Germany.  Today it is only 2 percentage points more expensive. This gain of over 7 percentage points is attributable to the disciplined economic approach we have followed since 1987 and represents a major competitive advance for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The exchange rate is stable within the EMS.  On the question of the exchange rate, I want to assure Deputy Noonan and indeed the whole House that there is no uncertainty whatever about our exchange rate policy.  As I made clear in my 1990 Budget Statement, my objective is to pursue a strong currency policy within the EMS and to implement whatever monetary and other measures may be necessary at any time to secure this position.  Some people have quoted the example of Belgium to me for quite some time.  Anybody who looks back over the last couple of months will see how often Belgian, indeed the Netherlands and others within the EMS narrow band, had to raise their interest rates.  This is a feature that will come more into play as we move towards full capital liberalisation in 1992.</P>
    <P>Throughout his contribution Deputy <Col N="624" /> Noonan criticised the Government, and me in particular, for not cutting back more on spending.  He then proceeded to fall into the old trap of picking a pet spending area &mdash; compensation for criminal injuries &mdash; and wondered why the Government had cut so much.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways, or indeed the Members of his Front Bench either, some of whom complained that the cuts had not been sufficiently severe while others sought more and more spending in various areas.  I want to enlighten Deputy Noonan, as he failed to grasp what I had said yesterday.  The Government made an additional £4 million available this year to complement the £2 million included in the Estimate to pay for the criminal injuries awards that had stacked up over a number of years past.  The £6 million provided in total in 1990 will go a long way to reducing that backlog.  In fact 84 per cent of that backlog will be eliminated this year.  The £1 million provided for next year will clear the remainder of that backlog and indeed many of the awards that will be made in 1991.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the question of the sale of State companies.  With regard to changes in the ownership structure of commercial bodies in the State sector I have made clear frequently what is the position of the Government which was set out in the Programme for Government.  Any change in the ownership structure of such bodies will take place only where it is in the national interest, the interest of the body concerned and its employees, after consultation with the social partners.</P>

      <Col N="625" /> With regard to specific companies named by Deputy Noonan &mdash; he mentioned some going through the system at present such as Irish Life, CSE and ICC.

      <P>But I want to assure the House that the proceeds of asset sales will not be used to fund current Government expenditure.  To date such proceeds have served to increase the capital resources available to Government to reduce borrowing and, therefore, the burden of debt.</P>
      <P>In the amendments to the Government motion before us today criticism has also been levelled at a wide range of areas such as health, education, welfare, local authority housing, overseas aid and so on, many Members seeking more and more expenditure with other Members from the same parties complaining that the cutbacks have not been sufficient.  For example, allocations for health in 1991 have been increased by 5.5 per cent to make an indent on the queues obtaining. I should say those queues have been lessened which is a reflection of the caring philosophy of this Government.  I might add it is mischievous to label the 1991 provision for health as inadequate.</P>

In addition 3,000 people will be housed through casual vacancies and 1,000 new houses will also be completed this year. I might add that 4,500 social housing units have already been provided this year and total outlay on local authority and voluntary housing will increase from £60 milllion this year to at least £71 million in 1991.</P>
      <P>Poverty is a symptom of all industrialised societies.  To those who want to paint it I would say to them: would they ever tell me where there are to be found the levels of poverty about which they speak in this House.  This Government have done more in that £3 billion have been expended on social welfare this year, £1.5 billion on housing, education, social housing and other areas.  There have also been increases in overseas development aid, details of which have been lodged in the Library if Members would only take the time to get the facts right before coming into the House and make some of the silly statements they do from time to time.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the need to continue a policy of tight control of public finances is clear-cut.  The Government will not be deflected from that goal.  Finally, Deputies can be assured &mdash; Deputy Noonan may have some doubts about this &mdash; that I will do the right thing for this economy in the forthcoming budget on 30 January 1991.</P>
      <P>In the meantime may I wish all Members on all sides of the House a very happy Christmas.  We look forward to a reasonably good year in 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 35 together.  I do not intend to increase the rates of payment under the employment incentive scheme which currently stand at £60 per week for a long term unemployed person and £45 for an early school leaver or other disadvantaged person.  Any increase in the rates of the subsidy would, in the absence of additional Exchequer resources, effectively reduce the number of people who could be recruited under the scheme.  At present, the long term unemployed represent about 40 per cent of those recruited under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The slight reduction in the Exchequer allocation for the employment incentive scheme &mdash; from £2.464 million in 1990 to a proposed £2.448 million for 1991 &mdash; arises as a result of a slight increase in the EC assistance available for the scheme in 1991.</P>
      <P>The available funding will allow the same level of activity in 1991 as in 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In their report, <i>The Nature and Functioning of Labour Markets</i>, published in December 1988, NESC identified three broad aspects of the labour market which required analysis, as follows: (i) unemployment &mdash; the causes of the increase in and persistence of Irish unemployment; (ii) employment &mdash; the determinants of employment at the industry and the enterprise level and (iii) labour supply &mdash; in particular, the implications of emigration and the labour supply of married women.</P>
      <P>Since the council identified these research topics in 1988, it has undertaken a programme of studies.  First, the council have had a technical study of the growth of unemployment completed.  The council drew on this work in preparing their report strategy for the nineties and, in particular, in formulating their policies for employment and the labour market in that report.  The council did not publish this study separately because of its highly technical nature.  A part of the study was, however, published in the Economic and Social Review for July, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the council investigated the possibility of a study on the determinants <Col N="556" /> of employment at the industry and enterprise level.  However, the council considered that there was insufficient data for a detailed study of this topic.</P>
    <P>Third, the council have had separate studies undertaken on emigration and on female labour force participation.  The emigration study has been completed, it is currently being considered by the council and it will be submitted to the Government shortly and published in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The council's study on female labour force participation has also been completed. It will be discussed by the council shortly and will be submitted by the NESC to the Government in due course.</P>

      <P>I am happy to say that the level of awareness and the commitment of the social partners on equality issues is already quite encouraging.</P>
      <P>Both have taken many initiatives and have been instrumental in creating wide awareness of the need for equality of opportunity and treatment in employment. The Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have developed important guidelines on several aspects of employment equality. The level of collaboration between Government and social partners is an important factor in promoting equality in the workplace and is reflected in their membership of very many of the important public bodies which have a role in that aspect of public policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.  The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>The census of population, conducted every five years, and the annual labour force survey provide information on the numbers of persons who indicated that their principal occupation involved working on farms.  Persons engaging in farming on a subsidiary or part-time basis are not included.  No distinction is made between family-run and other farms; however, the number of non-family farms is very small.</P>
      <P>The available information is given in the following table:</P>

      <P>The Government are very seriously concerned about the dangers that submarines pose to shipping and about the nuclear hazard in the event of an incident involving nuclear powered or armed submarines. We avail of every opportunity in international fora, such as the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation, to focus attention on the problem.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs have raised specific incidents with the authorities of the countries concerned and will continue to do so as the need arises.</P>

      <P>An Post, through its network of 2,000 offices countrywide is responsible for paying about 70 per cent of social welfare payments.  Over 400,000 pensioners are paid each week in addition to about 70,000 unemployed persons.  Some 475,000 families receive their child benefit payment each month at post offices. In general the service provided by the post office network is very satisfactory and operates reliably and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a choice of payment facilities for pensioners is currently being considered in the broader context of developing the most appropriate range of payment methods for all social welfare clients.  My Department is liaising with An Post on the development of its counter services to ensure that the needs of social welfare clients are being met.  One of the objectives being pursued is the provision of greater flexibility to clients as regards date, time and place of encashment.  This would eliminate certain problems which can occur at present due to peaking on certain days, for <Col N="576" /> example, with regard to the monthly payment of child benefit.</P>

These documents relate to a wide range of premises to which the public has access and their recommendations deal in a comprehensive manner with fire safety in those buildings.</P>
      <P>While consideration is currently being given to the most appropriate manner in which legal backing might be given to the recommendations, I would point out that it is the responsibility of persons having control over premises of this type to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on the premises and to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.</P>

    <P>The timing of the issue of creditors payments is a matter for each individual agency to decide.  It should also be noted that in considering the above figures the amount outstanding to creditors on any particular date is related to the timing of payments rather than an indication of its overall financial position.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the position in respect of 1990 in relation to deficits.  I will not be in a position to supply this information until the final allocations for 1990, in respect of each board, are determined and the actual expenditure incurred has been established.  Any excess expenditure will be a charge against the 1991 allocation of the agency concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what information the Deputy is seeking in the final part of his question.  I am not aware of any major problems in respect of payments for invoices being delayed for six months, though this may have happened in a small number of cases where a query arose on a particular invoice.  In relation to the question generally the Deputy will be aware that an extra £9.749 million is being provided to improve the cash position of health agencies this year.</P>

I have made inquiries from the Mater Hospital who have informed me that this person has been on the waiting list for cardiac by-pass surgery since 2 October 1990.  The hospital is unable at this stage to give a precise admission date for her operation.  However, if this person feels that she needs more immediate attention she should contact her general practitioner who would be in the best position to highlight her case to her consultant.</P>

      <P>There is no crisis in the supply of influenza vaccine.  It is my policy that the necessary flu vaccine will be available.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health have taken all the appropriate measures to ensure that the health boards have sufficient stocks of influenza vaccine to meet the demand from persons in the groups deemed to be at risk.  In the context, the WHO and the Department do not recommend vaccination of the general population but of those who are at risk due to chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, chronic renal disease and diabetics melitus or other endocrine disorders or similarily compromised patients.</P>
      <P>In May 1990, the World Health Organisation identified the virus strains of influenza for 1990-91 and recommended the appropriate influenza vaccine strains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1990 the Department of Health advised the health boards of the virus strains and the recommended vaccines and asked the health boards to ensure that they ordered adequate supplies, directly from the suppliers, for the at risk groups in their area.  The health boards were also asked to advise people in these at risk groups to get the vaccine.  In October 1990, the Department of Health again contacted the health boards reminding them to ensure that they have sufficient vaccines in stock.  At that time, the Department also sought information on the numbers of vaccines on hand and on any additional stocks required to meet the needs of the boards.  As a result of this request the health boards requested <Col N="593" /> a total of 12,065 additional doses to meet their needs.  The Department immediately ordered 12,500 doses to meet this need and this has been distributed to the boards.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, having evaluated the situation with the health boards, that the boards have identified the likely demand for this vaccine in their areas and that this demand has been met.</P>

      <P>As part of this agreement my Department have implemented a reduction of one unit in the enrolment-staffing schedule for national schools from 1 September 1990.  This agreement has led to an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools for the 1990-91 school year.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements negotiated under the auspices of the Central Review Committee, school authorities, in particular the principal teacher, are responsible for arranging the organisation of the school so as to ensure that no class group exceeds the following guidelines set down by my Department: 39 (in the case of a single-grade class-group); 38 (in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades) and 35 (in the case of a multi-grade class-group.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at Shercock national school on 30 September 1990 was 184. Staff consists of six teachers &mdash; a principal and five assistants.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are no classes at this school in breach of the maximum class size guidelines.  The board of management of this school have not applied for sanction to appoint an additional assistant teacher.</P>
