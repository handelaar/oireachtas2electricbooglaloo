      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 16 and, subject to the appropriate order being made, the Unit Trusts Bill, 1990.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that (1) business shall be interrupted at 11 p.m. tonight; (2) the order fixing the Committee Stage of the Unit Trusts Bill, 1990, for Thursday, 13 December, shall be discharged and the Committee and Remaining Stages shall be taken at 10 p.m. and, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the order shall not resume.  Private Members' Business shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. and shall be No. 28.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it is possible for the Taoiseach, having read the papers <Col N="2074" /> this morning, to make up his mind and announce the appointment of a Minister for Defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Deputy's Front Bench?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach reached the point where he could divest himself of responsibility for this Department and allow a full-time Minister for Defence to be appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an element of repetition in this.  That is a luxury we cannot afford on the Order of Business and I wish it were determined in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that we have a new system of dealing with the Order of Business which restricts matters which may be raised to a well defined list.  Perhaps the Chair in his great wisdom and with his great parliamentary skill could persuade the new Leader of the Opposition that he does not really impress anyone by being grossly disorderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, would the Chair not agree that the appointment of a Minister for Defence would require Dáil time because if the Taoiseach thinks that will be put through on the nod, he has another think coming. It is relevant to the ordering of Dáil business because this business must be taken if the Taoiseach intends to appoint a Minister for Defence.  Having received no answer from the Taoiseach I will not pursue the matter in deference to the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question appertaining to the matter in the name of the Deputy today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach might be able to make up his mind between now and Question Time.  In respect of promised legislation, when is it proposed to introduce the Roads Authority Bill in view of the fact that we are <Col N="2075" /> spending £150 million on road building, a good portion of which is being wasted due to lack of proper co-ordination?  This is money we will only get once from the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can ask a relevant question but there is no need for elaboration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation will not be taken this session.  I am happy to see that the Leader of Fine Gael has acknowledged the fact that £150 million is now being spent on roads compared to the derisory £15 million which was spent while he was in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community is providing the money and the Government are wasting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion the Taoiseach indicated that he was willing to consider a debate on the Gulf and the implications for Ireland arising from the Security Council motion. Has he decided to allow a debate before the Dáil adjourns in view of the fact that a deadline has been incorporated into the motion and that this could mean the launch of hostilities against Iraq by the United States before the Dáil resumes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this House has any control over the United States launching attacks on anyone. There is no time available.  As the Deputy can see from the agreements the Whips made, we are sitting long hours in an endeavour to get through a necessary programme of legislation.  There will not be time between now and Christmas for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that as we are sitting on Tuesday and Wednesday next week it would not be a great inconvenience if we were to sit an extra day, on Thursday, to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2076" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Whips.  We ought not to deliberate on it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try, on the Order of Business, to remain within the parameters set down by the Taoiseach.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990 which was agreed to be taken tomorrow has now been deferred.  When will Committee Stage be taken or is it intended to abandon that and put a fresh Bill on the Order Paper?  I ask so that those who are currently operating on the legislation that was enacted three years ago by this House will know how they stand.</P>
      <P>Let me also, while I am on my feet, ask a question in relation to time.  I agree there are a number of important issues, one of which is the GATT negotiations. Is it intended before the Dáil rises to afford the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture and Food, or both, an opportunity next week to report to the Dáil on the progress to date on an issue which obviously has huge implications for Irish industry and Irish agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to reopen the wounds of yesterday but, as the Deputy knows, a rather unfortunate contretemps took place over the fisheries legislation.  It was no fault of his.  There was no fault here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>You are in better humour today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation, of course, will be continued with but, unfortunately, it cannot now be taken before the next session.</P>
      <P>On the question of the GATT negotiations, I suggest to the Deputy that we have had a number of discussions about it and, as the Deputy knows, the whole process is now suspended until the New Year.  I do not believe there is time for any further reports to the Dáil on it but perhaps we might be able to fit in something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of <Col N="2077" /> Business, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to ask the Taoiseach two things. First, I note from the schedule of the business for the week that the Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1990 was due to be taken at 10 o'clock this evening. It does not appear on the Taoiseach's programme today.  Would he kindly indicate when the Committee and remaining Stages of that Bill will be taken?</P>
      <P>The second question I would like to ask the Taoiseach is, in view of the answer he gave to Deputy Howlin regarding the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990, would he indicate what, if anything, will be substituted for that Bill on Friday afternoon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All stages of that Bill have been taken.  The Exchange Control Bill finished last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order Paper for some time there has been a second interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the Appropriation Accounts of 1987.  Since we are moving towards 1991 I wonder would it be possible &mdash; I have raised it here a couple of times &mdash; to find even two hours to debate the matter before we go into the recess, even if it is done during a Wednesday sos?  It has been on the Order Paper for some time and I have raised it here on a few occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it but I will ask the Whips.  We will keep it in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which was circulated yesterday and which is being put before the Seanad initially, may I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment if they anticipate that this Bill will be brought before this House in the next session and if they can indicate if there is some target date for the enactment of that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly hope it would be brought before this House next session.  It is the intention to do that. The only target date I can suggest to the <Col N="2078" /> Deputy is that, subject to giving it the attention and discussion and detailed debate that it deserves, we would get it through as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Taoiseach has said that this House has very little control over the United States. Would he have any plans to call in the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> once more to help us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is of no relevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps another poem from the Deputy might be in order on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach to think again about the possibility of discussing the Gulf crisis.  It is very clear from the operation of the Order of Business this week and, one can anticipate, next week that some legislation may not take the time allocated.  I very much agree with the suggestion which has been made that this House will not have resumed until after the crucial end date for the Iraq-United States talks, but also the deadline that has been set.  I urge the Taoiseach to give serious consideration to allowing some time to discuss the present changes in the Gulf crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think the Taoiseach's attitude to this would be important.  The other point I wanted to raise was that in view of the widespread publicity and now the referral of conditions in our prisons, particularly Mountjoy, for consideration by Amnesty, I would like to ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for Justice is disposed towards allocating some period of time for discussing conditions in our prisons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is not relevant to the Order of Business, Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anticipating a reply to my first suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter raised by Deputy Higgins &mdash; perhaps the Taoiseach would reply to them both &mdash; would it be the case that the Taoiseach will be raising at the Rome Summit the deadline for the possible outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East and will there be an EC position over which he will, presumably, have some influence, if not over the US?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say in response to Deputy Higgins, even though he was totally out of order, the indications are that there will be a discussion on the Gulf crisis in Rome and if I am, as I hope, reporting to the House on the Rome Summit, perhaps it could arise in that connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want your assistance on a certain matter.  I had a question down to the Minister for Education yesterday which was only partially answered.  I think it defeats the purpose of Question Time if the Minister can get away with that.  I would like if you would study the question and the answer and take the matter up with the Minister.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's reference to the more restricted form of the Order of Business, would the Government Whip support the termination of the trial period of grievance time which has degenerated to farce, and a return to the orderly spontaneity that was the procedure previously?</P>

      <P>Apropos Item No. 8 on the Order Paper, that is the establishment of the Select Committee on Crime, in view of the fact that the Whips have collectively pursued this relentlessly week in and week out at Whips meetings, I would like to ask the Taoiseach if at this stage he will accede to our collective request that this committee be set up?

      <P>At the Special Committee after amendments Nos. 50 and 51 had been discussed I withdrew them on the basis that the Minister would be bringing forward his amendments to deal with this matter.  Will the Minister clarify whether his amendment No. 49 encompasses all the points I referred to?  Amendment No. 50 is a technical expansion of &ldquo;health&rdquo; into &ldquo;health and welfare&rdquo;. When the gardaí take a child into a place of safety, as proposed in amendment No. 51, we are suggesting they have a right of entry without warrant.  We want that explicitly stated.  I would like confirmation that those matters have been cleared up.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 49 in my name covers amendment No. 50 tabled by Deputy Yates and which he also tabled on Committee Stage.  There are two main elements in amendment No. 51: first, that a garda should have a right of entry without warrant when exercising his powers here and, secondly, that he should be required to have regard to the wishes and best interests of the child.  With regard to the first element I would refer Deputy Yates to amendment No. 49 which confers powers of entry without warrant on a garda for the purposes of this section. In relation to having regard to the wishes of the child, it makes no sense to expect a garda to intervene while at the same time expecting him to have regard to the wishes of the child.  What would the garda be expected to do if the child did not wish to go?  This would place the garda in an impossible position, and for all of these reasons I cannot accept amendment No. 51.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 49 is an improvement on the provision that is in <Col N="2084" /> the Bill.  I welcome the inclusion of suggestions made by the Opposition during Committee Stage.  I regret that the Minister did not deem it appropriate to accept amendment No. 48 last night.  It would have given a more direct and obvious role to social workers in interventions of this sort.  Instead he simply provides that the member of the Garda Síochána be accompanied by such other persons as may be necessary.  That is an all-encompassing phrase that would not preclude social workers being present, but it is a pity the Minister did not go one step further and provide that those who are trained specifically in the whole area of child care be present.  It would be helpful to the family, the child and the member of the Garda Síochána who is called upon to act in a very delicate and difficult situation.  That is no longer an option but the Minister's amendment No. 49 is a significant improvement on the existing provision and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 39, to delete &ldquo;the custody of his parents&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the parent having custody of him&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical change similar to those made on Committee Stage to section 4, subsections (2), (3) and (4).  It is necessary to take account of the change in the law following the enactment of the Status of Children Act, 1987, and to deal with cases where married parents are separated from each other.  One of the effects of the 1987 Act is that the word &ldquo;parents&rdquo; automatically includes the natural father of a child whose parents are not married to each other, even if the father is not living <Col N="2085" /> with the mother and has no legal rights over the child.  Clearly, in the present context it would make no sense to require the health board to return a child to a father in that situation.</P>
    <P>As regards parents who are married but separated, the existing draft gives no guidance to the health board as to which parent the child should be returned.  It is proposed, therefore, to change the reference to refer to &ldquo;the parent having custody&rdquo; of the child.  In the case of the child whose parents are not married, this would generally be the mother although it could be the father if he had been awarded custody by the courts.  In the case of a married couple who have separated, it would mean the partner having custody of the child.  Where both parents had custody of the child, be they married or unmarried, the rule of construction that the singular imports the plural means that the child would be returned to both parents.  I hope the House can agree to this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 41, after &ldquo;district court district&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or, in the event that the next such sitting is not due to be held within three days of the date on which the child is delivered up to the custody of the health board, at a sitting of the District Court, which has been specially arranged under section 13 (4), held within the said three days,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in response to points raised during a lengthy discussion on this section at a meeting of the Special Committee on 13 February last.  On that occasion, a number of Deputies expressed concern about subsection (4) and at the possibility that a child who had been removed from the custody of his parents by a garda acting without warrant and handed over to a health board could be held in care by the board without the backing of a court order for a lengthy period if there was not a sitting of the <Col N="2086" /> District Court to which an application for an emergency care order could be made. I promised to look at the matter again for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>My Department have had further discussions with the Department of Justice and there have also been consultations with the President of the District Court. This amendment makes it clear that where a child is removed to safety by a garda under section 12 and is duly delivered up to the health board, the board must apply for an emergency care order as soon as possible.  Where no sitting of the District Court is due to be held within the following three days, it will be necessary to arrange a special sitting within three days to consider such an application. It will not be lawful for the board to retain custody of the child beyond the three day period unless the court make an emergency care order.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that what is being proposed now represents a reasonable balance; it provides a maximum of three days for the health board to obtain an emergency care order; it also means that parents will not, in any case, be deprived of custody of their children for more than three days unless there is a court order to authorise it.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>In page 9, after line 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) It shall be the duty of all child care and medical personnel to report cases of concern as to the possible maltreatment, neglect or abuse of children to the appropriate officer of the Child Care Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the most significant matters in relation to the Bill.  This and the issue of barring orders against defending adults were the two principal areas of recommendation by the Law Reform Commission. This matter was briefly discussed at the Special Committee and it was decided to defer the matter pending the <Col N="2087" /> final report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>If should like to refer extensively to the initial consultation paper on child sexual abuse by the Law Reform Commission in relation to this area.  They said that mandatory reporting law may, on balance, do more good than harm.  I will quote from page 27:</P>
    <P>We believe that the current level of reporting is probably, despite increases in recent years, still low.  The introduction of mandatory reporting would represent a clear and unequivocal public statement that child sexual abuse is something that society will not tolerate and that its potential for damaging children is such that the uncomfortable feelings that many professionals have about reporting must be put aside.  We think that the duty to prevent harm to a child overrides the normal obligation of confidence which may arise in a professional relationship. The existence of a mandatory reporting law would offer the clear guidance that many professionals desire as to where their duty lies and in what manner that duty must be performed. The existence of statutory exemptions would relieve bona fide reporters of any lingering fear of being sued or prosecuted.</P>
    <P>In their final report, having received detailed submissions on the matter, they stated their clear view.  I will quote from their Summary Paper &mdash; Report on Child Sexual Abuse &mdash; from September of this year.</P>
    <P>Doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, health workers, social workers, probation officers and teachers should be placed under a legal obligation to report cases of suspected child sexual abuse.  Failure without good reason to report should be punishable summarily with a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and/or a fine of £1,000.</P>
    <P>Express immunity from civil and criminal proceedings should be given <Col N="2088" /> to any person who in good faith and with due care reports a suspicion of child sexual abuse to the appropriate authority.</P>
    <P>Health boards should be under an express duty to take certain mimimal investigative steps in response to a report of alleged child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission went on to state why they are in favour of mandatory reporting and said:</P>
    <P>In summary, our consultations have confirmed our initial view in favour of the introduction of a mandatory reporting law, and we repeat here the basic reasons given in paragraph 2.04 of the Consultation Paper.</P>
    <P>The general principles which should inform a mandatory reporting law were set out in the consultation paper at paragraph 2.05 as follows:</P>
    <P>The law should be specific enough to discourage over-reporting, whether by the over-zealous or the defensive reporter...  We recommend that doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, health workers, social workers, probation officers and teachers should be placed under a legal obligation to report cases of suspected child abuse...  We recommend that the obligation to report should arise when the mandated reporter knows or has good reason to believe that child sexual abuse has occurred.  The test of knowledge or belief should be objective rather than subjective, the question being whether the individual ought reasonably to be aware that sexual abuse has occurred ... we recommend that a mandated reporter should be required to make an initial oral report followed by a written backup report identifying the child and the nature and basis of the suspicion that he or she has been subjected to sexual abuse ... we recommend, in line with the Department of Health guidelines, that the person to whom all reports should be made should be the Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health within each health <Col N="2089" /> board...  Failure without good reason to report should constitute a summary offence with the maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and/or a fine of £1,000.  Prosecutions for failure to report should be subject to the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions...  We recommend that express statutory immunity from legal proceedings should be given to any person who bona fide and with due care reports a suspicion of child sexual abuse to the appropriate authority... We would emphasise that the need for this statutory immunity arises whether or not mandatory reporting laws are introduced.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to delay the House, a Cheann Comhairle, with such extensive quotations but I wanted to prove that this is no longer a matter of ambiguity or debate.  It is a question of whether this House is prepared to make a clear statement that child sexual abuse is so intolerable, degrading and inhuman that it must be got rid of.  In the normal course of events, any child who is abused will come in contact with professional health workers, professionals in the medical field or teachers.  Those people, when they become deeply suspicious regarding child abuse, should fall in the category of mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>I notice, with regret, that there is no grouping for amendment No. 55.  That means the Minister has not tabled an amendment in regard to this matter.  I am acutely disappointed because, on 20 February this year when the matter was debated by the Special Committee, the Minister said that it would be premature to reach a final decision on the matter until they had the benefit of the commission's report.  He suggested that the amendment be withdrawn and the matter considered again, if necessary, on Report Stage by which time the commission's report should be available.  I dutifully withdrew my amendment at that time in the expectation that the Minister would table an amendment.  However, on the list circulated so far there is no grouping of this amendment.  This is a matter of <Col N="2090" /> fundamental importance, it is a case of whether we are prepared to pay lip-service or take legal action to rid us of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The House is now at a crossroads in regard to this matter.  The Minister commissioned experts to advise him in this regard and they contain a very distinguished list of names including Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, John Buckley, William Duncan, Maureen Gaffney, Simon O'Leary and many others.  As I said, the Minister sought advice from these people and received submissions arising from the consultation paper.</P>
    <P>This amendment is one of the most important in relation to the Bill.  It will be a grave omission if it is not dealt with now.  I ask the Minister to bring forward an amendment which will allow us to make progress in this area.</P>

      <P>Last evening we came up against one of the &ldquo;biggies&rdquo; in the Bill. Up to that we made some considerable amendments, and we are grateful for any amendments proposed by us and accepted by the Minister.  However, we came up against what we are really talking about in the context of a realistic and effective Child Care Bill last night when the Minister dispassionately and coldly threw out any notion that we would have a barring order as part of this legislation. Mandatory reporting is another substantial and important provision.  If we do not have it in this Bill the Bill will be weaker.  This proposal has been put forward again and again by all the organisations working close to the coal face of the problem of child sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to the ISPCC recently.  They run Childline, and they know what they are talking about.  They are very disturbed and concerned at the level of reporting we are getting.  They accept that perhaps something like 40 per cent of all the instances of child sexual abuse is coming to the attention of one or other of the child care agencies.  They make the point, with which I agree, that when we talk about this section relating to the protection of a child in an emergency, the emergency has already occurred.  The <Col N="2091" /> problem has occurred long before we talk about getting in the Garda Síochána or the social worker.  We have to consider questions such as why the child was left as long as it was in that situation, and were the provisions for dealing with it adequate.  The answer is that the provisions are not adequate.</P>
    <P>The reason why reporting is not as realistic as it should be is that people will not push reports because they know that the structures are not there to deal with them.  There is a great deal of confusion. What training is there for the Garda Síochána to whom reports of child sexual are made?  Do they know how to deal with it, at what point to begin reporting, or how to handle sensitively the child or individuals concerned?  This is an extremely important and essential amendment.  I know there is no agreement among the various agencies on whether there should be mandatory reporting or on whether it is fair to people like teachers or social workers or anybody else who would take on the role of reporter.</P>
    <P>It would go a long way towards resolving this matter and giving people confidence to report suspected instances of child abuse, if we accepted that there is child abuse here, that we are not the only country, that it is a phenomenon of the last few years and that it should be treated for the serious and heinous crime it is. We should define sexual abuse and deal with it.  We should bring in structures to protect this most vulnerable group in society, small children who cannot take action for themselves and who are totally confused, distressed and oppressed by this offence.  We can start here.  We have all the documentation we need.  We have a consultative document, the commission report, recommendations from all the organisations in the child care coalition, and they are all saying the same thing to us.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not stonewall on this and will come back to us with a reasonable and understanding response that will go a long way towards relieving the problem where reporting is not <Col N="2092" /> adequate or where reports are made but not adequately dealt with.  The Minister should once and for all make a statement saying that we do not accept instances of child sexual abuse, that it is wrong and that we have an obligation and a responsibility as legislators to deal with it effectively and realistically and to be seen to deal with it effectively and realistically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all committed to this Bill.  I expect the Minister to respond positively to this amendment.  This amendment refers to the core value of the Bill.  It is a test of how seriously we are prepared to treat an incredibly damaging and serious crime against children.  It is up to the legislators to protect them.  They cannot protect themselves.  We know from the Rape Crisis Centres and from the counselling and therapy that is going on that sexual abuse causes life-long damage.  We must do everything in our power to prevent it happening or to have it immediately treated when it is discovered. That is our first consideration. As Deputy Yates said, this will show how serious the community are in protecting our children from this desperate attack upon them.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that one of the biggest difficulties that people working in child care have encountered is being empowered to take action but being afraid that action will be taken against them.  Because of that fear voluntary and professional workers, rather than putting themselves into an invidious position where they might be sued or have to face outraged parents or people suspected of carrying out child abuse, pull a curtain across it and decide not to take action. This occurs where children cannot take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation document put forward by the Law Reform Commission discussed both sides of the argument. Their arguments in favour of this provision are absolutely compelling and there is no equivocation in their final recommendations.  The document makes the point that in the United States of America the introduction of mandatory reporting laws beginning in the early <Col N="2093" /> 1960s was followed by a dramatic increase in the number of reports of suspected child abuse of all kinds, and that one commentator had suggested that mandatory reporting laws combined with a public awareness campaign &mdash; and this Bill is doing that &mdash; have been strikingly effective.  The document went on to say that to many professionals the most attractive feature of a mandatory reporting law is its empowering nature which relieves them from some of the onus of discretion, and suggested that a teacher or social worker is in a less invidious position if he or she is able to explain perhaps to an aggrieved parent that the making of a report is a matter of legal obligation rather than a purely personal decision.</P>
    <P>Another argument in favour of mandatory reporting is that it would secure consistency in the management of the disclosure of child abuse, that it would enable better asessment of the nature, the instance and the location of child abuse which would result in an improved provision of services.  This is of the utmost importance.  Unless we have mandatory reporting and unless we protect the people on whom there is a requirement to report we could have a huge inconsistency with regard to reporting because of the demographic the traditional areas and cultures that would prevent such child abuse being reported.  I am aware that other Deputies wish to add to the debate on this amendment so I will not take up too much time.  What we have shown so far is an overwhelming argument in favour of mandatory reporting and also of empowering the people who need most the benefit of such provision, that is, the people who are dealing with the problem.  Above all this Bill is about providing the utmost protection for the children who cannot protect themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little more optimistic about the Minister's response to this amendment than is the mover of the amendment.  My optimism arises from the Minister's original response, columns 330 and 331 of the Report of the Special Committee, when he was dealing with <Col N="2094" /> this matter and the possibility of the report of the commision being available at a future date he said then:</P>
      <P>The Commission will then submit their final report to the Government, setting out their conclusions and recommendations.  I think it would be premature for us to reach a final decision on this matter until we have the benefit of the commission's report.</P>
      <P>I agreed &mdash; and I think Deputy Yates agreed at the time &mdash; that because the issue was being discussed by the Law Reform Commission and as they had not arrived at a decision, it would have been premature for us to have reached a final decision.  Deputy Yates is rather modest because he did not quote the next statement from himself in which he said:</P>
      <P>Should the Commission come out in favour of this I hope it will be given constructive and positive consideration by the Minister and the Department.  I agree that there is not a consensus on this matter but if there is the possibility of abuse of a child not being detected because of lack of reporting by medical or other personnel, it is a serious matter and needs to be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There the Deputy rested his case and withdrew his amendment on the basis that we were waiting for the professionals to report.  They have now reported and have come down in favour of a system of mandatory information being given and sought.  Those of us who are involved at constituency level see, unfortunately and tragically, that this problem is becoming more widespread.  We are not so silly as to believe that this problem is a new trend that has commenced.  The abuse of children, sexually and otherwise, is becoming common knowledge.  This is because parents, and particularly mothers, and children themselves are coming forward in the knowledge that there are people there to protect them. Unless we treat the crime of child sexual abuse with the seriousness it deserves, treat the perpetrators of this crime as criminals, report them as criminals and treat them with the disrespect and disdain <Col N="2095" /> we all have for them, this problem will remain with us and we will continue to have an Irish solution to an Irish problem or the nod and the wink syndrome whereby if somebody of importance is involved, and for whom that revelation would create a problem in the community if it was generally known, there seems to be an understanding that certain cases could not be reported.  There must be no exemption for anyone in so far as this serious offence is concerned.  That is what makes it sufficiently serious for the Minister to look at the possibility of accepting this kind of amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not satisfied with the wording we would all listen to his suggestion as to what should be the proper wording.  Unless there is an obligation on medical or other personnel, who deal with the consequences of these cases, to report the matter to another authority, unfortunately, the problem will continue to be swept under the carpet.  It would be great if all of us here today could say it was a matter of minimal importance and that maybe sweeping it under the carpet was the way out of the problem.  I am afraid that is not the case, and we are now faced with the dilemma that unless we take action to rid our society of this dreadful problem, one that is becoming more widespread, at some future date mandatory reporting will have to be introduced in other legislation.  We are taking this line in the knowledge that once a report is made legal action will not perhaps take place unless those taking such action are satisfied that there is a case to be answered.  That is the final safeguard of the Minister.  If he accepts this amendment he should know, even if there is mandatory reporting, that another process will take place to tease out the information made available and if a court case is justified, so be it.</P>
    <P>In spite of all that the human factor will still be involved.  Even where husbands are jailed for child sexual abuse there are still wives who would wish them to be released for, say, Christmas.  In making representations in this area at the request of a wife one often wonders <Col N="2096" /> whether one is doing right but when a mother in her love for the man who was jailed, a factor which may supersede all other difficulties she has had with him, often has a desire to be reunited with that man and there is a process of reconciliation. If this crime was treated as seriously as it should be treated the offenders would know they were being treated as outcasts and criminals.</P>
    <P>In any other area of crime it is suggested that people should report such crime as drunken driving, shop lifting, dishonesty etc.  We are not a nation of informers but in this type of special case if the person reporting or informing is given the protection they deserve there is no reason the Minister should not concede this amendment, or similar type wording, which would allow for mandatory reporting of these extraordinary outbreaks of criminal acts against children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I would like to echo the support Deputy Sherlock gave for this proposal at the Special Committee.  We consider it to be one of the most important amendments that can be considered in the context of this legislation.  Needless to say, the entire Bill is significant but this amendment in one that goes to the workability of the legislation and is central to giving to the legislation the means whereby it can be effective in the field, ensuring that the entire process the Minister proposes to establish under the health boards &mdash; under his guidance and authority &mdash; will present the opportunity to come to grips with the basic problem of child sexual abuse and neglect.  For that reason the amendment is crucial. At the Special Committee the Minister recognised that there were arguments for and against, such a proposal that the issue is a complex one, that the notion is one which was devised in America where, once introduced, it worked effectively as a policing device.  The Minister took the correct position at the Special Committee and said that he would await the report of the Law Reform Commission on child sexual abuse.  We now have that report <Col N="2097" /> in which the commission clearly and succinctly recommend that people generally, not only those working in the area and who have professional responsibility but all people in the community, should have a duty and a responsibility to report to the appropriate authority where cases of child neglect and abuse come to their attention.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission have considered the matter, consulted and reported on it, and it is incumbent on the Minister and on all of us here to accept their recommendation.  If I understand the Law Reform Commission report correctly, it goes much further than this very succinct, modest but nonetheless important amendment: it proposes that failure to report in circumstances where it is clear there is abuse should be an offence. While I support that position it is not advocated by the amendment which merely proposes to lay a duty on persons to recognise the special position they hold.</P>
      <P>The amendment is important because it recognises that we all have a responsibility to the children who are particularly vulnerable.  In general principle, I presume it is the primary responsibility of the victim or complainant to come forward and give evidence about any offence or injury occasioned or committed against him, but clearly that is not possible for young children who do not have the knowledge or opportunity to come forward.  This amendment recognises that all of us in the community have a responsibility to protect and help the innocent child who is neglected, maltreated or abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point that in Europe this kind of regime does not exist. There are some peculiar features attaching to the Irish situation which deserves a different regime.  Deputy Ferris referred to the traditional notion that we are not a nation of &ldquo;grasses&rdquo;&mdash; that we do not inform.  I hope that attitude is changing and that the overall thrust of the campaign of the Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice for community watch will get rid of this ridiculous and <Col N="2098" /> outmoded notion.  Hopefully we are getting to the stage where we recognise that crime generally is an affront to the community and that we have a responsibility to respond.  Perhaps it is a problem of history or outmoded culture, but it must be recognised and tackled.</P>
    <P>We are a small, confined, close island community and I have no doubt that daily, no matter what town or street you are in, you invariably come across someone you know or someone who knows someone you know.  This illustrates the difficulties for professionals and others working in the field.  They have to confront their neighbours, peers or even community leaders if they suspect this type of child abuse is going on.  This is a particular problem for them.  It can also be described as the nod and wink phenomenon of Irish society which is prevalent and which must be recognised by us as legislators.  There is no doubt that the people working in this field experience extreme difficulties when pressure is put on them, either directly or indirectly.  Do they ask themselves, if this is a case in which they can intervene or if they should bring it to the attention of their superiors or the authorities so that it can be confronted in an open and democratic way?  There are major worries about this.</P>
    <P>As a lawyer, time and again I have come across people who have been assisted greatly by, for example, a subpoena which requires them to come to court to give evidence in any kind of dispute.  Because they receive a subpoena, they believe they have no option but to attend and give their testimony. This is a good device to help people get over the psychological, cultural or other barriers which make it difficult for them to come forward to testify in aid of the civil authorities and the Garda in the prosecution of crime generally.</P>
    <P>I believe that laying down this duty in the legislation would be an amazingly strong support for the people working in the field who, when they are inevitably confronted by this type of sensitive issue, would be able to look at the Bill and say, &ldquo;I have a duty and I will be failing in my <Col N="2099" /> duty under the law and&rdquo;&mdash; if further amendments are accepted &mdash;&ldquo;I am possibly in confrontation with the law if I do not report this incident so that action can be taken&rdquo;.  This is not simply a vacuous amendment.  I believe it will have very strong and real relevance to people who work in the field and who will be charged with the responsibility of policing this area.  As I have said, it is a responsibility which should rest on all of us.</P>
    <P>At the Special Committee the Minister deferred making a decision on this issue until the emergence of the Law Reform Commission report.  He now has that report which puts forward a well reasoned and structured argument in favour of this proposal.  The commission looked at all the pros and cons which the Minister recognised and have come down clearly in favour of a duty on all of us. I hope for that reason this reasonable amendment will be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Members have referred to the brief discussion on mandatory reporting at the Special Committee.  At that time serious concern was expressed by Members on all sides about the very sensitive issues involved in the area of mandatory reporting.  This is a very sensitive area because it deals with the relationship between doctors and patients, teachers and pupils and so on. I have no great problem with the general concept of mandatory reporting.  One very important point emphasised in the Law Reform Commission's report, the submissions made and the statements made by Opposition Deputies, is that mandatory reporting will give everyone a very definite signal of society's attitude to child sexual abuse.  Anything which does that has to be good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another element mentioned &mdash; this is one of the pluses of this proposal &mdash; is that mandatory reporting will take the responsibility of making a decision from people who are aware that a child is being sexually abused: mandatory reporting will make it a duty for them to report such instances rather than leaving it to <Col N="2100" /> them to decide.  That can be good in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, the Law Reform Commission report is not as clear as Opposition Deputies have said.  Some people have said that the Law Reform Commission have come out in favour of mandatory reporting.  That is true and I do not think anyone would deny it, but they say many other things as well.  It is important that these points be noted.  If we are going to introduce something as important and fundamental as mandatory reporting, we should not take a sentence here and there from the Law Reform Commission report, make a very bald statement by way of an amendment into a child care Bill and leave it hanging there with very little else.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a sensitive area and there are divisions on it among every professional group.  The majority of organisations may have decided that mandatory reporting would be a good idea but within every organisation, whether teacher, medical or professional care organisations, there are significant numbers of people who have severe difficulties with it and who have expressed strong reservations about its introduction.</P>
    <P>The submissions to the Law Reform Commission split two-thirds/one-third in favour of mandatory reporting.  The reason one-third of the submissions were against mandatory reporting is not that people do not want to have cases reported but rather to ensure before mandatory reporting is introduced that the proper procedures to be followed are clearly spelled out instead of merely having a simple amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission stated at paragraph 1.03 that certain conditions should be met before mandatory reporting is put in place.  The first of these is that those given legal responsibility for reporting should be given training on how to discharge that responsibility.  It is very important that this be done.  It is probable that professional child care workers and social workers have that qualification and will know how to discharge that responsibility but a person such as a teacher, a <Col N="2101" /> career guidance counsellor and so on has not had such training on childcare.  The second condition that should be met is that health boards be given adequate resources to investigate and manage an increased workload and caseload.  I have no doubt that this will be met.</P>
    <P>The third condition that should be met, on which the Law Reform Commission lay emphasis in their report, is: &ldquo;Changes in the legal system are necessary to enable it to respond more sensitively and effectively to individual cases&rdquo;.  The report goes on to state that mandatory reporting laws are clearly not a complete solution to the problem of under-reporting child sexual abuse, they can only be part of the solution.  It is most important that we do not get caught up in the thought that by putting reporting mandatory in this Bill, or any other Bill, automatically all cases of child sexual abuse will end or be discovered.  The Law Reform Commission at paragraph 1.04 of their report emphasised this point and stated, &ldquo;We wish to re-emphasise that a mandatory reporting law was never suggested as a panacea but as one part of a series of legal and social reforms designed to protect children from the scourge of sexual abuse&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have emphasised that point and accepted the notion that mandatory reporting is necessary but not on its own.  This is precisely in line with the reasoning of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>Let me make one other point on the way the professional groups feel about this.  The professional coalition on the Child Care Bill, which was made up of the various groups involved in child care had this to say about mandatory reporting and the suggestion put forward originally: &ldquo;This is a very large issue which would require more extensive debate as it has implications for clinical practise, children's and parents' rights.  There are differing views between and within professional groups&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The problem of over-reporting has been mentioned by everybody.  One of the dangers in this is, of course, that valuable time and resources are wasted in following up every case which has been reported.  The Law Reform Commission highlighted this danger and we should take careful note of it.  In their report they quoted from their consultation paper and stated that in the absence of mandatory reporting in 1987 only 456 of the 926 reported cases of child sexual abuse were confirmed.  Therefore, even without mandatory reporting difficulties have been encountered in relation to the reporting of child sexual abuse it appears that there has been over-reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a point about taking something as important and as basic as mandatory reporting and including it in the Bill on its own.  The Law Reform Commission in their report referred to the various elements of mandatory reporting and highlighted the following: the reportable conditions, the persons placed under an obligation to report, the nature of the obligation to report, how and to whom to report, the sanctions for a failure to report and the immunity provisions.  Therefore, there <Col N="2103" /> are a series of other elements of good mandatory reporting law which clearly are not met by this amendment.  It is also clear that legislation would be required to meet these rather than including an amendment in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Everybody should look at paragraph 1.08 of the report of the Law Reform Commission in which they state that, &ldquo;it would in our view be appropriate, given the advanced stage of the Child Care Bill, to embody mandatory reporting laws in separate legislation&rdquo;.  It would be both sensible and wise to take that precaution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <P>Amendment No. 55 proposes to place a legal obligation on certain persons to report suspected cases of child abuse through the health boards. Such a proposal was discussed at length at the Special Committee and it was agreed to defer consideration of it pending the final report of the Law Reform Commission on child sexual abuse.  I have listened with great interest to the fine contributions made this morning and I can identify with the desire of many people to have mandatory reporting but we must look at the report of the Law Reform Commission in detail in which they recommend the introduction of legislation providing for mandatory reporting.  However, they added a rider to their recommendation which has just been quoted by Deputy Dempsey.  They stated in paragraph 8 of Chapter I that, &ldquo;it would in our view be appropriate, given the advanced stage of the Child Care Bill, to embody mandatory reporting laws in separate legislation&rdquo;.  We have had much discussion, several consultations and long deliberations on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the report, one finds that the Law Reform Commission have at least 20 paragraphs of recommendations on mandatory reporting.  They regard it as a very sensitive, delicate, complex issue, a very important one.  They have clearly recommended that if there is to be mandatory reporting then it should be <Col N="2104" /> in separate legislation.  We cannot just take mandatory reporting and include it in this Bill without a very detailed mandatory reporting system, without putting alongside it a detailed proposed structure, a system that would protect not alone children but also those drawing up the reports and, in addition, a follow-up system.</P>
    <P>The Government agree that it would not be appropriate to endeavour to deal with the complex issue of mandatory reporting laws on Report Stage of this Bill.  Therefore, they concur with the Law Reform Commission in this matter.  In the circumstances I will not be able to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleagues in Opposition for their support of my amendment No. 55.  There is an element of <i>déjà vu</i> about all of this in so far as we hear incessantly from Members on the opposite side of the House that, yet again, this issue is too important to deal with now; it is too important to deal with on Report Stage; it is too involved to be encompassed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>So said the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that shortly also.  I do not know what play there is on words that renders things too important that they cannot be dealt with because the record shows &mdash; by way of a recent parliamentary question I tabled &mdash; that the Minister for Health has no further proposals to legislate in the area of child care; there is no promised second child care Bill.  There was no promise anywhere on the part of the Government that when this report was published by the Law Reform Commission they recognised that its timing meant that issues of barring orders against adults, issues relating to mandatory reporting, issues of juvenile justice, issues <i>vis-à-vis</i> the establishment of a children's court are matters on which they will have further legislation, or that this Child Care Bill is a stop-gap measure only.  Quite the opposite.  This Bill has been heralded by <Col N="2105" /> the Taoiseach as a major piece of law reform in the child care area, the piece of legislation for the decade.  As we go through it we see it is most incomplete, is full of gaps, does not attempt to deal with any of the real, current controversial issues in this area.</P>
      <P>It seems to me quite extraordinary that the Minister, in all his contribution, did not say whether he was for or against mandatory reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read the record again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>He sat firmly on the fence, gave no commitment as to how, when or where further legislation would be introduced in this area.  Therefore, I must conclude, in all fairness, that there is no commitment whatsoever to give a clear, public declaration that this matter of child sexual abuse is so serious, so heinous a crime it must be dealt with in similar fashion by making it mandatory to report.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have referred to the international experience.  Taking the broad spectrum of international experience it is quite clear to me that it is better to err on the side of over-reporting than under-reporting because of the potential misery caused people who may go through life, having been abused, never having been able to tell anybody about it let alone get any help.</P>
      <P>We do not know the level of child sexual abuse in this country; it could be 1 per cent; it could be 7 per cent.  We have differing information but we can be certain that, whatever is the real level of child abuse, it is nowhere near what we actually know in so far as there is a huge level of undetected cases, a huge degree of misery never reported.  It seems to me quite extraordinary and sad that no clear structure is being established now within which professionals, faced with an enormous burden of discretion, would know whether to be suspicious, whether to forget about it or what to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us place ourselves in the position of a general practitioner faced with such circumstances in his or her surgery, when <Col N="2106" /> they are virtually certain that, in a physical sense, there has been child sexual abuse.  This House has no comment to make to such a doctor as to what should happen in those circumstances.  That is a disgrace.  Indeed, it is one of wilful neglect.  While I might have some understanding of the Minister saying that this report, published in September of this year, the final report, was sprung on him and his officials so that they were caught sitting on their hands and did not have time to deal with it, the fact of the matter is that the initial consultation was over a year old when all the arguments for and against were analysed.  In the nature of things, such reports are available to Government before being published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just clarify that point?  The Deputy made a statement to the effect that this report was available to Government before it was published. The report of the Law Reform Commission was published on 27 September last; we sought that report and we received it on 1 October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That point does not take from the fact that this major&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making the point that we had something and kept it under the bush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me spell it out for the Minister.  I do not think it possible that we got it before the Minister but, leaving that aside, the consultation paper on child sexual abuse was published in August, 1989 which dealt comprehensively with all of the arguments for and against.  In fact, the final report does not add to the sum total of research into or arguments advanced on the matter; it merely adds to the confirmation of the conclusions of the Law Reform Commission.  I do not know what may be the staffing or other problems encountered in the Minister's Department or, I suspect, the lack of political will to deal with these issues but the fact of the matter is that adequate time was available to them to draw up enabling legislation for mandatory <Col N="2107" /> reporting, subject to detailed regulations being prepared by Government.  I would be quite happy had the Minister come forward, at some time between Committee and Report Stages &mdash; as he had committed himself to doing at the Special Committee &mdash; but he has totally reneged on his commitment.  Do I have to repeat it; it was absolutely clear; I thought we had reached an understanding.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I think it would be premature of us to reach a final decision until we have the benefit of the commission's report. I would suggest, therefore, that this amendment be withdrawn and the matter considered again on Report Stage by which time the Commission's report should be available.</P>
      <P>The amendment was withdrawn.  Yet, when it comes to the Minister's turn to do something about this, he does nothing. The Law Reform Commission came forward with a package of proposals, as Deputy Dempsey said, a package of proposals I favour.  An integral part of that package is immunity because, obviously, some of these matters are subjective and require professional judgments.  Therefore, it is essential that we not only have immunity but we must also establish consistency among all of the professional codes.  There is no consistency in reporting between professions and within professions. Different doctors have different views, different psychotherapists and different psychoanalysts have different views.  There are no suggestions from the Minister's Department on how this matter might be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is too important a matter to deal with; it is probably too <Col N="2108" /> difficult to deal with.  I do not wish to delay the House.  This matter has been comprehensively debated.  But, arising out of what was debated last evening when there were no media representatives present in the dark of the night, the message must go out that the Minister failed to incorporate the first significant recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, that was, that we remove the offending adult, as opposed to always removing the child from the family home. I might add that the very first recommendation of the Law Reform Commission was mandatory reporting so that we might get to grips with the level of lack of detection of this problem.  This is being neglected as well.  This legislation is a cop out in the major areas of reform in which children need protection to allow them live their lives in a home invironment without an offending adult.  In all these cases it is quite obvious that the psychological approach of a child is that it feels it is the guilty party.  The abused feel they have done something wrong and are in some way dirty.  Now, these people who are so vulnerable, so defenceless, are not to be afforded the protection of the professionals in this area who would be empowered, as Deputy Barnes said, to remove that burden of discretion and make it obligatory on them to report.</P>
    <P>The Minister has kicked to touch, he has not said he will have further legislation in the New Year, he has not even put forward any enabling proposals.  He has just said that it is too important to deal with it now.  That is sad for these children.   We will be pressing amendment No. 55.</P>

      <P>In page 9, after line 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) (a) The Minister shall prescribe a code of practice for the Garda Síochána in operating the provisions of this section.</P>
      <P>(b) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (a), these regulations shall provide that:</P>
      <P>(i) appropriate treatment and counselling be provided for offenders;</P>
      <P>(ii) a level of specialisation in core personnel and in the provision of treatment centres be attained; and</P>
      <P>(iii) following disclosure of sexual abuse the child victim be immediately separated from the offender.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This was discussed at the Special Committee. It relates to the specialist training of the gardaí who would be involved in executing emergency care orders and basically removing children at risk and taking them into care.  It is important that a code of practice be established by the Minister which would allow for a level of specialisation in core personnel and the provision of treatment centres where appropriate treatment and counselling could be provided for the offender.  Following disclosure the child victim should immediately be separated from the offender.  In the debate at the Special Committee the Minister was sympathetic to this and seemed to indicate that it was primarily a matter for the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice. There was reference to ban-ghardaí and the fact that they would have a particular role to play.</P>

      <P>The point made in amendment No. 57 is also worthy of support. We could not expect every member of the Garda to have such specialist training, expertise and sensitivity.  Within each Garda division or local district there would need to be designated personnel to implement the code of practice.  Gardaí who happen to be women would be particularly suitable in most cases.  This is an important area.  I have resubmitted the amendment and I hope the House will support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Yates's amendment.  I want also to advert to the amendment in your own name, amendment No. 57.  Both amendments reflect the complexity of the legislation with the vast new range of duties and powers that are being conferred on the Garda Síochána.  In some respects the legislation represents dramatic departures and advances in the area by bringing in the Garda Síochána to police and supervise a sensitive and complex area of human and family relationships.  Therefore, the setting down of a code of practice, as suggested in Deputy Yates's amendment, should be supported and provided for in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate in Special Committee centred on the proposals which were current at that time with regard to the extension <Col N="2113" /> of the college at Templemore to provide new courses of training and education. All that is very welcome.  Nevertheless it does not address the central point of Deputy Yates's amendment, nor the issue included in amendment No. 57 with regard to the designation of central officers in each district with primary responsibility for the working of the legislation. One can provide all the educational devices and facilities at Templemore and elsewhere, but unless there is a code laid down in law in clear, concise language, one does not know for what one is educating one's members or what standards one is seeking to achieve or maintain.</P>
    <P>It is important that the legislation should reflect, and legislators should have the opportunity to talk about, the standards and the codes of conduct to be employed.  The educationalists working in the various Garda schools should know exactly the standards required of them and the gardaí themselves, working the legislation on a day-to-day basis, should have guidelines.  There are two elements involved, the laying down of standards and a code of practice, which is the only device available to us in laying down standards.</P>
    <P>The central idea of The Workers' Party amendment is that each division of the Garda would have a designated member who would have primary responsibility for seeing that the legislation works and would have the primary responsibility for exercising the powers available to the Garda Síochána under the Act.  The suggestion is that this would be done without prejudice to the rights of the Garda Síochána generally to exercise authority and power under the legislation. Because of the sensitivity of the area we are suggesting that there would be an identifiable designated person within the Garda to liaise with the community and the professionals in regard to problems that might emerge in the working of the legislation or with regard to the inefficiencies or deficiencies in the role of the Garda in a particular area.  It would be seen that the Garda were coming behind the people working in the <Col N="2114" /> civil area, such as social workers, doctors, psychiatrists and so on.  It would enable good working relationships to exist at all levels centring on the Garda who have the primary responsibility to act under the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the context of the special powers now being conferred upon the Garda we should ensure that there are identifiable people, specially trained, with primary responsibility for acting in the area.  Just as we recognise that drug trafficking is a problem in certain areas or that juvenile offending is a problem in other areas and appoint Garda members in a division with specific responsibility for acting, if not exclusively, then primarily in that area, we want to designate an identifiable person in the Garda to ensure that there is constant attention given to this area and that we develop a Garda awareness of the legislation and the problem in the community.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to set up the legislation but there is a need for a specific response not just on an educational level but on the structural level in the divisions in which the Garda work so that the community will know to whom to go, so that there will be someone who will be known as the person in the Garda who is charged with ensuring the continuing development and response of the Garda to the problem.</P>
    <P>The amendment does not impose any additional strains on the Garda and their resources.  It merely says, recognising the importance of this legislation, that within each division there should be designated officers with primary responsibilities for exercising the powers and ensuring that the legislation works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record Deputy Howlin's support for both amendments.  He spoke strongly in favour of them on Committee Stage.  The Garda Síochána have special needs in this area and we should go down the road of participation by them at a specialised level, as outlined in amendment No. 56, or of designating a member or members of the Garda with special responsibility. This has been done in other areas, such <Col N="2115" /> as the drugs area where specialist knowledge was required, and it is quite obvious from the debate that there will be a need for specialised training and knowledge in the areas of the care of children.</P>
      <P>In the Special Committee the Minister pointed out that the gardaí of the female sex had attended courses.  I know the Minister realises that there are not gardaí of the female sex in every parish in Ireland, much as we would like that to be the case.  We would hope that gardaí of both sexes would have access to special training and I have no doubt that the new curriculum in Templemore takes this on board.  It must be recognised, however, that there are many gardaí, who qualified before this legislation was thought of, who need special training, and I hope the Minister will give some attention to that either by conceding this amendment or by making suggestions as to how he will come to grips with the specialised knowledge that will be required by members of the Garda Síochána in dealing with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments, and I would like to concentrate on Deputy Yates's amendment in particular. We know there is now a completely different procedure in regard to the training of gardaí and we all welcome that because they are called upon to protect us.  They are involved in the most sensitive and complex aspects of our society and it is only right that the training they get equips them to do that work.  I am sure that in Templemore at present specialised training is being given to men and women.  As other speakers have said, members of both sex are needed in this work and that should be taken into account in the in-service training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I take the point that there may be certain occasions when women gardaí may be more suitable, for instance when dealing with frightened victims, particularly of sexual abuse, it is very important that the male members of the Garda are included in this whole training process.  I stress that good male role models are needed to counterbalance the effects of <Col N="2116" /> sexual abuse and to remind victims that even though the offender was male there are very good, caring, supportive men to help them.  It is very important, therefore, that men are included in this type of training.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appropriate councelling provided for offenders, Deputy Yates is absolutely correct to include a provision to cater for this.  Research has shown that some sex offenders abuse many children.  We know that without treatment the offender will continue to offend.  It can be seen from counselling sessions in other countries that there is a high level of denial by the offender.  The most difficult and demanding task in the treatment of offenders is to get them to face up to the seriousness of what they have done.  They should be helped reach the stage where they will discontinue offending.  The treatment is of absolute importance or otherwise, the cycle of offending will continue.</P>
    <P>Because of a lack of treatment centres for these offenders on release from prison continue to sexually abuse vulnerable children.  That should not be allowed.  I know the Minister will agree that unless there is treatment for offenders, children will be constantly at risk.  This leads to Deputy Yates's proposal that treatment centres must have the resources to allow them to carry on their work.  I must record my disappointment that at certain times it is the child who is removed from the family rather than the offender.  The last part of the amendment provides that the victim be separated from the offender.  On Committee Stage the Minister had difficulties with that because he felt it could lead to certain complexities.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned by Deputy Yates the guilt factor is of the utmost importance. The child is usually considered by the offender to be in some way guilty. He or she may feel that they have also offended.  In treating the victim the first thing to do is to remove him or her from the offender and in that way begin the process of healing that will allow the child get out from under the guilt.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this amendment are <Col N="2117" /> fundamental to the law.  There is an educative and practical side to what we must do with regard to protecting and treating children.  I know the Minister will recognise that the provisions contained in these amendments are essential.  To have on the Statute Book a law such as that which exists, without these resources being made available, is useless.  It is only a disillusionment to all those who have such a high expectation of what should be in the Child Care Bill.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, we are discussing this Bill in the context of a Department of Health mandate rather than that of the Department of Justice.  I do not think a Minister for Health can prescribe a code of practice for the Garda.  Nevertheless, much has been said on all sides to which I would subscribe. Copies of the debate should be sent to the Garda Commissioner and the director of training in Templemore for their perusal.</P>
      <P>What we are discussing here has more to do with the social role of the Garda rather than the legal role.  It might do a lot of good if the gardaí were trained in regard to the signs and symptoms of sexual or any other kind of abuse.  We are focusing here on sexual abuse but children can be abused in other ways. Many children are abused without ever a hand being laid on them.  We have all dealt with people in our clinics whose self-confidence has been sapped, eroded or destroyed over the years, until they reach the point where they can barely function.  This begins in childhood, probably from the day these children are born. However, I am wandering away from the amendments put down by Deputy Yates and Deputy Sherlock.</P>
      <P>The most a Minister for Health can do &mdash; it would be different if we were arguing this in front of the Minister for Justice &mdash; is ensure that the awareness of the range of child abuse here is imbued in the gardaí.  In-service training should be given to all gardaí.  They should be put through courses, and this matter should be a core element of these courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us keep my personal life out of the Chamber.  Section 12 (3) states: &ldquo;Where a child is removed by a member of the Garda Síochána in accordance with subsection (1), the child shall as soon as possible be delivered up to the custody of the health board for the area in which the child is for the time being.&rdquo;  We were very emphatic that a child would not be hanging around a Garda station for hours and would be seen to as quickly as possible.  We spoke last night about the whole idea of having gardaí involved and how traumatic it can be when they are called to deal with difficult situations.  I am adamant that the role of the Garda should be mimimal.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ferris that the changes in educational training are very welcome because every garda will sometimes face a situation for which they have not been trained.  The Minister for Justice or the Commissioner's Office should provide some type of courses for all members in this new legislation in regard to their role.  The educational and training aspect is very important because, in a country area, where only a sergeant and a garda are stationed, they cannot wait for a specialist in the field to help as such a person might not be available.  Everyone should have the training and the capability to deal with an emergency.</P>
      <P>This is a caring Bill and I will be sexist in saying that women are not the only caring people within the force&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know it from personal experience.  Men are just as capable as women of caring but, from what I know, the biggest problem of the Garda is ensuring liaison between themselves and the social workers.  The follow-up is not as quick as it should be and I would not like to see children sitting around Garda stations for three or four hours waiting for a social worker.  That is a very real administrative problem which no amount of training of gardaí will rectify.</P>
      <P>I do not see how subsection (5) (b) of this amendment has anything to do with the role of the Garda because (i) deals with appropriate treatment and counselling for offenders.  That role is not within the realm of the Garda.</P>
      <P>I can see some merit in Deputy Sherlock's amendment as I presume he is thinking of something along the lines of the junior liaison officer scheme and that there might be a co-ordinating role for one or two members within a district. I do not know whether that would be feasible, it is always a great problem for chief superintendents and the commissioner's office.  I do not know whether it is a good idea but it deserves some thought.</P>
      <P>I cannot really understand why Deputy Yates's amendment includes 5(b).  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the code of practice; all I know is that it is contained in a huge book which is the bible of most gardaí.  I do not know whether the Minister for Health can have an input to the code of practice for the Garda but I am sure the Minister would be able to clarify that.  I presume it is within the realm of the Department of Justice.  Perhaps the Departments of Justice, Health and Education have too many roles regarding children's welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prompted to make a few comments by some of the arguments on the Government side.  The necessity for both these amendments was well made on Committee Stage and the Minister did not argue very effectively against them then.  The two matters at issue are (i) that there would be a code of practice outlined by the Minister; and (ii) that <Col N="2120" /> there would be a specialised corps of trained gardaí to implement the provisions of this Bill when enacted.  This would be without prejudice to the rights of every member of the Garda Síochána to act in an emergency.  The fact that there could be a corps of specialised trained people would not in any way minimise the powers of the Garda to act in accordance with the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We hear again and again about the core problem regarding child care generally, that, whenever a problem is to be addressed, there is a great deal of buck passing between the three relevant Departments.  It is the same in regard to this Bill.  We had hoped that this legislation would signal that primarily the Houses of the Oireachtas are deciding that responsibility in the area of child care would rest with the Department of Health and that the Minister would have responsibility so that there would not be a row every time a case was highlighted, betwen the three Departments and the respective Ministers and public relations officers, blaming someone else.  It is time we decided that someone is responsible. The Minister for Health is the appropriate Minister and whatever powers are required by him to do the job effectively should be devolved to him.  If we intend to continue with the notion &mdash; even after the enactment of this legislation &mdash; that the Department of Health are only one of a triumvirate of responsible Departments, we will have made very little progress. It is important that the Minister for Health should do that awful thing &mdash; tread lightly on the corns of that most august Department, the Department of Justice, which seems to many to be enveloped in cobwebs and ancient thinking on a variety of matters.  I will not go into all of them here as it would not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should decide, in relation to children, that he will be responsible, get Government approval for that responsibility and lay down whatever regulations are required to properly implement legislation which he and his Department have steered through these Houses.  He should grasp that nettle and <Col N="2121" /> decide on it as a matter of principle.  For those reasons, there is no cogent case against having a corps of specialist trained gardaí who would have the expertise, when called upon, to go to a household where they are needed.  They may be faced with a situation of great trauma, a child who is a victim must be treated properly and not further victimised.  They may also have to deal with distraught parents.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say today that somebody else must decide in relation to these matters. It is now time for the Minister to give a clear signal that, when it comes to child care, he will be responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this amendment.  Deputy Howlin was tempted to speak because Deputy Coughlan contributed, as he was enamoured of her beauty.  I am also tempted to speak &mdash; not because of Deputy Howlin's beauty &mdash; but because of his remarks.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin in relation to the problem of co-ordination between the Departments of Justice, Education and Health, but it has nothing to do with the amendment before us or the section. We are talking about a very general area which needs to be addressed.  What we are talking about in section 9 is a specific code of practice being drawn up for the Garda Síochána for the operation of the provisions of it.  It is not a general provision. Lest anyone thinks that the Minister or the Government are trying to evade responsibility, I should like to say that what the Opposition have said is not relevant to the amendment.  It would be extraordinary if a Minister for Health could introduce regulations in relation to the Garda.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be in any way nasty or to hurl insults across the floor, but from listening to what has been said on the opposite side, one would get the impression that few members of the Garda have any sensitivity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not appropriate for a Minister for Health to lay down regulations for the Garda.  The first thing he would be accused of would be interfering with the day to day running of the Garda Síochána while he was not the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much of the spirit of what is contained in this amendment, especially the need for the gardaí to be properly trained to deal with sensitive matters such as child sexual abuse. Members may be aware that the training arrangements within the Garda Síochána are being revamped following a detailed review of Garda training conducted by a committee of experts established by the Minister for Justice a few years ago.  A new Garda college is being developed in Templemore.  Phase one of the project has been completed and phase two is in progress.  The training schedule has been changed from a six month period to a two year period.  Instruction is provided to members of the force on all legislation which the gardaí are called upon to enforce.  The most modern education and <Col N="2123" /> training techniques are being used in the Garda training programme.  In addition, regional and divisional in-service training schools have been established.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Garda authorities and I am satisfied that any training or instruction required to enable the Gardai to properly and effectively operate the provisions of this section can and will be provided through the various training arrangements I have outlined.</P>
      <P>I have listened with interest to contributions and while I appreciate that it is important to have specialist training, it is important also that general training given to gardai would encompass training skills and advice to ensure that gardai can deal with any situation.  We can have all the specialist training we would like but we can only give specialist training to a select number.  If those specially trained people are not available on a given day at a given time when an emergency arises, one must resort to the judicious and immediate decision of the available member of the force.  I have the utmost confidence in the Gardaí to discharge their duties in a positive and sensitive way at all times.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister for Health to prescribe a code of practice for the Gardaí. The training of gardaí, and the development of operational procedures, are the responsibility of the Garda authorities and it would not be helpful for the Minister for Health to interfere in this area. I have every confidence that the Garda authorities will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all members of the force are familiar with the provisions of this section and are advised on how to operate it.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons why I cannot accept amendment No. 56.  For example, a number of the matters mentioned in it have nothing to do with the Gardaí Deputy Coughlan alluded to the fact that paragraph (b) (i) talks about providing treatment and counselling for offenders.  Paragraph (b) (ii) refers to the provision of treatment centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we would all agree that these are desirable developments, they are not <Col N="2124" /> matters for which the Gardaí have any responsibility.  As such, these references are totally out of context here.</P>
    <P>I also have difficulties with paragraph (b) (iii) concerning the immediate separation of a child and an alleged offender in alleged cases of child sexual abuse.  All the advice available to me is that instant intervention of this kind is fraught with danger and can result in unnecessary distress for all concerned.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the Amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House as all the arguments have been well thrashed out.  I concede that amendment No. 56 could be improved in relation to having a code of practice for the Gardaí and having some parts of paragraph (b) as standard practice in relation to emergency care orders.</P>
      <P>A point to which the Minister did not reply yesterday or today relates to the juvenile justice system.  That system is in a mess because not one Department are prepared to take responsibility for the residential and care requirements of people who find themselves before the courts as juvenile offenders.</P>
      <P>The Government issued a statement in May of this year stating that very shortly, a Cabinet decision would be taken as to which Government Department would be responsible for child care.  No further communication has been issued as to which Department will be responsible and we have the almost weekly occurrence of people being shuffled from one Department to another.  This is unacceptable and I hope that at the earliest date possible the Minister will take the opportunity to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Dempsey has left, but perhaps his colleagues will tell him that in future it might be better if he spoke after the Minister, as then he might get clearer riding instructions.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 13 (2) as amended on Committee Stage, the emergency care order and the length of time for which it should exist.  I consider that four days would be more appropriate than eight days but I am also proposing in amendment No. 60 that the District Court be given discretion to extend it to a further four days, which would bring it up to eight days.  I am allowing greater flexibility but as a general norm the emergency care order would not exist for longer than four days unless the District Justice felt it was necessary.  The reason I have suggested four days is that it would cover a weekend and it would allow time for a further order to be obtained.  We must remember that on Committee Stage an interim care order was introduced, so a number of options are facing the courts, the health board and the Garda.  I consider that this amendment would fine-tune the legislation and improve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are two very sensible and interesting amendments and, as Deputy Yates has said, they would help to fine-tune the working of the legislation in this area.  Certainly, the current situation under the 1908 Act is one where there is great uncertainty in regard to the time periods in which the various applications for a place in safety and custody orders can be made.  It is often a matter of great exasperation and frustration for parents &mdash; as they are the people against whom applications are moved &mdash; to wait and see when next the moving party, usually the health board, will bring the matter before the court. They can obtain a place in safety order <i>ex parte</i> under existing legislation, have the child put in a place of safety and there <Col N="2127" /> the matter tends to rest, sometimes for weeks and sometimes for months, before the matter comes back before the court.</P>
      <P>The idea suggested in the amendments is a sensible one.  It puts the onus on the moving parties to always keep the matter before the court and to move without delay.  As has been pointed out, a period of four days will allow for any eventuality or combination of days, coupled with the weekend, that might intervene.  It does give discretion to the court to extend for the period of the emergency care order. It places an onus, first on the moving party, the health board or the authority, to move with speed and expedition and, second, it places the court, as the primary arbiter, in the place of primary responsibility in all these applications.  These are sensible amendments and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept them. I will certainly support them on behalf of The Workers' Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at issue with my absent colleagues on this amendment. Deputies will recall when we discused this matter on Committee Stage I suggested that the maximum time be increased to 21 days.  That was at the behest of the carers organisations and the social workers who were very concerned that we were putting in an upper limit. It is possible for a shorter period to be specified but not for a longer period to be specified.  The preparation of detailed reports or investigations would take some days and four days struck me as extremely confining in relation to preparing any detailed report or having any positive evaluation carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed that, in the submission from the professional care workers &mdash; which many of us used as a yardstick to judge suggestions &mdash; they suggested a period of 14 days in this regard.  On balance I would prefer the Minister's suggestion of eight days to the shorter period.  It allows the courts to specify a shorter period and I would not wish to reduce it any further in order to allow those who are professionally involved to carry out whatever <Col N="2128" /> investigations are necessary and to prepare whatever reports are required.  On this issue I am in agreement with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to a reduction in the duration of an emergency care order to four days, even allowing for the possibility of an extension of the order for a further four days.</P>
      <P>While I accept that we should keep to a minimum the length of time that parents may be deprived of their children, and <i>vice versa</i>, we must at the same time be careful not to make the time limit so short, as to render the order unworkable. I am concerned that a four day order is too short and would be almost inoperable in practice.</P>
      <P>This is because there can occasionally be gaps of several days between sittings of the District Court.  This is particularly so at Christmas, as Easter and during August.  The problem is that if we change to a four day order, and there is no sitting of the court on the fourth day, it would not be possible for the health board to apply for an extension of the order for a further four days and, presumably, the child would have to be allowed return home, to whatever danger he or she had been removed from just four days previously. I am sure that this is not what Deputy Yates intends, but I am afraid that this could be the effect of his proposals.</P>
      <P>Under the 1908 Act no time limit is specified for a place of safety order; a child may be detained until he can be brought to court.  In practice, it is usually some weeks before a child is brought before a court.  In 1986 a married couple whose child had been taken from them under a place of safety order took a High Court action challenging the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the 1908 Act. (D.C.<i>v.</i> Midland Health Board, 1986 No. 424 S.S).  In his judgment Mr. Justice Ronan Keane made the following observations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...Section 24 (of the Children Act, 1908), while clearly essential in the interests of children who are at risk <Col N="2129" /> for a variety of reasons, is a serious abridgement of the rights of parents and any statutory scheme which did not keep to a minimum the interval of time which may necessarily elapse between the removal of the child from his or her parents and the determination of its future custody by the Court would constitute, in my view, an impermissible violation of those rights.</P>
    <P>Although the court found in favour of the health board on that occasion, it is clear from the judgment that the duration of an emergency care order must be strictly limited if it is to be able to withstand constitutional challenge.  Following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, it is felt that a period of eight days stikes a reasonable balance between giving the health board time to prepare an application for a care order and ensuring that parents are not deprived of the custody of their children for too long before having an opportunity to put their side of the case to the court.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Yates would reconsider his amendment in the light or what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What I will consider, in the light of what everyone has said, is that I will withdraw amendment No. 59 and press amendment No. 60.  Amendment No. 60 would give the courts more discretion and might meet the point raised by Deputy Howlin.  Emergency care orders, as Deputy McCartan said, should as a rule be kept to a minimum.  An emergency care order should not extend to 14 or 21 days.  If that happend the health board would have to convince the court that it was necessary; saying they had to complete files would, in my view, be dangerous.  I will withdraw amendment No. 59 but I will be pressing amendment No. 60.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 31, after &ldquo;available&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or where the urgency of the case warrants or where there is a doubt as to the jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 13 (4) (b) which provides that where a justice for the district in which the child resides or for the time being is not immediately available, an order may be made by any justice of the District Court.  My amendment proposes to insert the words &ldquo;or where the urgency of the case warrants or where there is a doubt as to the jurisdiction&rdquo; offer the word &ldquo;available&rdquo;.  At the Special Committee we discussed a number of circumstances which could arise where there would be a difficulty.  I believe the inclusion of my amendment in section 13 (4) (b) would improve it and would allow for the provision of emergency care orders in a wider variety of District Court circumstances than the Minister has provided for.  I believe my amendment would improve the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider this amendment. There is nothing more certain in the area of District Court jurisdiction than the issue of jurisdiction itself.  This issue can and often does arise with regard to the basis upon which a court in any one district can have specific jurisdiction to deal with an issue which arises.  This amendment contains the omnibus proposition that in cases where there is doubt with <Col N="2131" /> regard to jurisdiction it should not deprive a District Justice from taking on a case, hearing it and making an order. This would not in any way take away from the jurisdiction of the District Court; if anything, it would facilitate it whenever doubt arises.  Doubt arises regularly with regard to the place of residency, the place where the primary cause of action arose and a number of other problems.  If in the event of a court being found in operation and a District Justice located a case can be made that there is a doubt with regard to jurisdiction or there is urgency, it would be useful to have this provision included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister for Justice, if I dare mention him &mdash; I know there is a great reluctance to trespass on his area or acknowledge its existence &mdash; has plans to cut back on the number of rural venues for the District Court and centralise its working in country areas.  The availability of District Courts may become a problem in working this legislation.  If a social worker or Garda can find a court in a neighbouring jurisdiction and there is urgency about the case, then he or she would be greatly aided by the inclusion of this provision in the Bill.  This is an enabling provision.  It is eminently sensible and would help people working in the field.  As I said, it would not in any way inhibit or take away the inherent jurisdiction of any court to assume responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the amendments with which the Minister should have no difficulty.  It simply seeks to copperfasten the provision he wants to enact. If there is any doubt about the comprehensive nature of the jurisdiction we should spell it out.  This amendment would improve the wording of the section. I support it and urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements in this amendment and I am advised that both of them are adequately covered by other provisions of this subsection.  The first element refers to &ldquo;where the urgency <Col N="2132" /> of the case warrants&rdquo;.  The purpose of section 13 (4) (b) is to provide a mechanism in cases of urgency where the justice for the district is not readily available.  The remedy provided is that the order could be obtained from any other justice.  Thus, urgent cases are already covered by the existing draft and there seems no need for this additional phrase.</P>
      <P>The second element is the reference to &ldquo;a doubt to the jurisdiction&rdquo;.  I presume this was intended to deal with cases where it might not be clear which justice should deal with the case.  Any such doubts have been resolved by amendments made on Committee Stage which provide that the order is to be made either by the justice for the district in which the child resides or the justice for the district in which the child is at the time.  Since, as a result of these insertions, there will always be some justice who will have authority to act, I cannot see how doubts could arise about jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy McCartan, as a rural Deputy I concur with what he said. I understand it is proposed to reduce the number of rural courts.  This would be a good move because there are many rural courts in very remote areas which are run down and have very bad facilities.  The centralisation of better equipped courts in small urban towns would ensure that there would be more regular court sittings and more access and availability by ordinary people in rural Ireland to District Court sittings in a proper and modern facility.  Deputy Yates's proposal is already covered in the Bill.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment and I hope the House understands why.</P>

      <P>No, I do not understand. Section 13 (4) (b) clearly refers to a child who is not for the time being available. There could be different circumstances in relation to urgency which we cannot predict.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 49, to delete &ldquo;revealed to&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;withheld from&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the discussion on this section at the Special Committee there was agreement on all sides of the House about the need to safeguard, as far as possible, the rights of parents whose children have been placed in care under emergency care orders.  I have looked at this matter again and at the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in their report on child sexual abuse, that health boards should be obliged to inform the parents of the address or location of the place in which their child is being kept unless the district justice orders that this information should be withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now proposed that there should be a presumption that the parents would be told exactly where their child is being cared for but that the justice would be able to order that such information be withheld if, for example, it was feared <Col N="2134" /> that the parents might try to snatch the child.  In view of this I would be grateful if the House would agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(8) Where the provisions of this section are availed of written notice of the relevant procedures and rights of parents shall be issued to them at the time the child is taken into care.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would add a subsection to section 13 which deals with emergency care orders.  It was discussed at the Special Committee and I think it is important. It proposes that parents whose children have been removed from them should be given written notice of the relevant procedures and their rights.  Very often parents are confused and, in many respects, ignorant of the law.  It is important, in the interests of fairness, that they would be advised to contact a solicitor, and be informed of the timescale within which they should lodge an appeal and what the legal procedures are as many people are totally baffled by this.  Very often, they have to depend on free legal aid, if available.  Therefore, in the interests of balance and fairness, without prejudice to what the court may decide and regardless of whether the parents were right or wrong on the question of abuse, there should be this formal procedure of written notice.  This amendment should be inserted to ensure there would be precision where otherwise there might be confusion.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure clarity, where possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deserves specific support and, again, I hope the Minister will accept it.  In general terms, where the State, at our behest, infringes or trespasses upon or <Col N="2135" /> restricts our rights in any area there should be a duty and responsibility on the State to advise the person of what their rights are and the opportunities open to them to seek redress or to address and deal with that infringement.  This is the position which prevails whenever a member of the Garda Síochána takes a person into custody.  Under the existing rules and regulations, the Garda have a duty and do in fact deliver to the detained person a note advising them in general terms of where they stand under the law, what their entitlements are, which include the right to consult a lawyer, or the occasions on which they are obliged to comply with requests for fingerprints or other tests.  The same is true in respect of someone suspected of drunken driving and taken into the Garda station.  They are handed a small sheet advising them of where they stand under the law and what their obligations, requirements and duties are.</P>
      <P>We are making provision for the rights of parents to be curtailed, interfered with or trespassed upon and the rights of the family to be curtailed.  In those circumstances, it is only fair and proper that there be an obligation on the Garda or the welfare authorities to deliver to the parents a brief note outlining the consequences of the action taken, what is likely to happen when an application is made to the court and advising them of their right to legal advice and assistance and legal aid, where appropriate.  This is an eminently sensible amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience in this area it is very harrowing to meet parents who walk into the office bewildered, confused and indeed shattered by what happened in the preceding hours or days when their child was taken from them.  No criticism is being levelled on that point &mdash; we are legislating for this and believe it is right &mdash; but we should also seek to respect the rights of parents and assist them in what obviously is for them a very harrowing and traumatic experience, often not of their own making, which nonetheless requires their rights to be curtailed.  It is a very sensible and eminent amendment <Col N="2136" /> and Deputy Yates is to be commended for bringing it forward.  What would be required would be no more than a printed sheet outlining the position under the law to be handed over after the child or children have been taken.</P>

I withdrew the amendment as the Minister gave a commitment to consider the matter again and to come back on Report Stage.  We discussed it before Deputy Yates's amendment at the Special Committee where it was voted down.  This is an eminently sensible and reasonable amendment and I hope that in the interim period the Minister has had an opportunity to reflect upon it and acknowledge that it would not impose any great burden and would ensure that people are given notice of their fundamental rights.  These people may very well be confused and not <i>au fait</i> with the legal procedures involved.  It is a fundamental right which should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>

However I would like to reiterate that any legislation we introduce must underscore and safeguard the rights of people, particularly when they get caught up in circumstances which bewilder or overwhelm them.  It is very important that when the State act at our behest those at the receiving end must be made aware of the importance of such action and the reasons it has been taken.  That is a basic right.  Like other Members, I commend Deputy Yates for bringing forward the amendment which not only lays emphasis on basic rights but also on the caring side.

      <P>In cases of child abuse the parents may have fled to avoid prosecution and it may even be that the parents do not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of legal proceedings. The amendment does not allow for the type of situations I have mentioned or any others which might arise. If we were to enact it in its present form and a health board were unable to contact the parents the danger would be that all subsequent action in relation to the child could be invalidated because of the failure of the health board to adhere to the proposed statutory requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it would be desirable that parents be given a written explanation of the relevant procedures.  Indeed, my <Col N="2138" /> Department are already engaged in consultations with health boards on devising leaflets and other explanatory material for the parents of children in care. However, I would be reluctant to accept this amendment because it might not always be possible to furnish parents with such a notice at the time the child is taken into care, as this amendment would require.  The danger is that such failure could invalidate all subsequent action.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Deputy Yates might consider withdrawing these amendments and leave matters of detail like this to be dealt with administratively, which will have to be looked after when the provisions of the Bill have been brought into force by good professional and administrative practice.

      <P>I can understand that might be so, but what criteria are used?  On what basis does one Department as distinct from another decide that all representations must go through the Minister's office?  It does not seem to make sense.

      <P>Deputy Bruton is not here.  He was a member of the working group but as he has moved to higher things he has now given the responsibility to Deputy Carey.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the procedures and practices of the House have changed very little since 1922, that what we have in this Chamber is essentially based on the Westminster model?  Will he agree that it is essentially slow and cumbersome in that only one-165th of the talent of the House can speak at the one time, that is one Deputy at a time?  Furthermore, will he agree that there is little meaningful debate, particularly on Estimates when billions of pounds are often voted through with only cursory examination <Col N="2141" />&mdash; we will see a good example of that shortly &mdash; and that there is an urgent need to revise the procedures of the House?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that good work can be done in this House by referring Bills, particularly Committee Stages, to Special Committees? Will he agree that if we were to do that proper facilities would have to be provided so that, the Press, radio or TV and the public have access to what happens during Committee Stage of a Bill?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to be critical and make these sort of sweeping, denigratory statements.  In fact, this House has got through a major programme of legislation and is pursuing a major programme of legislation.  I have no particular objection to the committee system.  We have availed of that for dealing with legislation on a number of occasions.  Of course, experience was not always happy.  There have been occasions when a Bill has gone through the whole Committee Stage in a Special Committee and then exactly the same procedures followed here on Report Stage.  That is wasteful.  However, I believe legislation can on its merits be considered as to whether it should go to a special committee. I have no objection to special committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than having no particular objection to specific committees or special committees, will the Taoiseach not agree that on the rare occasions when this House has employed special committees, for example in relation to the Judicial Separation Bill, the Child Care Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill, these committees have worked exceedingly well and have allowed the work to go on parallel to the work in the House proper?  Secondly, they have managed, particularly in relation to social legislation to engender a degree of de-politicised debate that was extremely constructive.  Rather than giving a cursory snarl, &ldquo;I do not agree with that at all&rdquo; the Taoiseach should acknowledge that these are serious supplementaries which should be dealt with on their merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I dismissed shortly, so to speak, the Deputy's long rigmarole, particularly when he said this House has not changed since 1922, was that I could not possibly accept that.  This House has changed considerably in my time.  It has changed radically and will continue to change.  I said in my reply that the appropriate place for these matters to be considered was not across the floor of the House in the form of question and answer but in the mechanism established for the purpose, namely, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the working group on Dáil reform.  I have no opposition or objection to the committee procedure though sometimes it did not save time at all.  On the other hand, we must not forget that the Dáil is a deliberating assembly and would still have a very important part to play in regard to most legislation.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that Question Time gives us an opportunity to question the Taoiseach <Col N="2143" /> about what he thinks of various aspects of Dáil reform or whatever?  It is not always done in a strictly opposition sense but in an effort to try to improve on what we have.  Would he agree that because all stages of legislation tend to be taken in the Chamber we do not have time for other debates or the examination of reports, for example, reports of the Committee of Public Accounts or other major issues?  The fact that a Committee Stage of a Bill is taken in a different room does not mean that we are not acting as a Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy accepts that during Question Time I am as helpful as possible and elaborate as much as I can in reply to questions, but sometimes the adversarial aspect exhibits itself on both sides of the House.  Some members are inclined to confuse our situation with the British House of Commons. The basic difference is the large numbers they have which enable them to man a whole series of committees without any difficulty.  We are a relatively small House and when you take Ministers and Junior Ministers out of the overall quantum there are not that many people available for detailed and persistent committee work.  Deputies who wish to attend to all legislative matters could be placed at a disadvantage if too much work were done in committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have already undertaken quite an amount of work in preparation for the forthcoming review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  As part of this work, I and my officials, have had ongoing consultations with industry representatives.  I have assured these representatives that they will be consulted at all stages of the work and will be afforded every opportunity to make a constructive input to the process.</P>
      <P>I am optimistic that we can continue to work closely together on this issue in the future.  I am at present considering how best to involve the industry and other interests in the more formal consultative process.</P>
      <P>I have already asked the Commission to meet with industry representatives here in Ireland when the review process gets under way here in 1991.  The sole criterion I intend to apply in relation to arrangements is that they facilitate a clear and complete presentation to be made to the Commission.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations leading up to the mid-term review of the Common Fisheries Policy I will be pursuing vigorously the best interests of Irish fishermen in all areas with the aim of ensuring that they are fully protected.  I will in particular be pressing the case that the Common Fisheries Policy should, in all its aspects, make a positive contribution to bringing about greater economic and social cohesion within the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in <Col N="2151" /> a position to elaborate to the House on the case that will be presented by the Department of the Marine?  Will the case be based on the proximity of Ireland to the natural resource which is the fishing resource?  Being a peripheral State we are at a disadvantage, and in other areas, such as agriculture, we are given special consideration under the Structural Fund because of that.  Will the Minister consider preparing a case based on peripherality?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to outline to us whether the industry will be involved in a review committee?  I appreciate the Minister, and the Department, are examining the case but is it intended to set up an official committee, including members of the various sectors of the fishing industry, to present a common case for all of Ireland?</P>

The Commission representatives will have an opportunity to meet all sectors of the industry and those in the industry will be able to express their views to the Commission. I want to assure the Deputy that the special problems of the low income areas will also be considered.  Furthermore the Common Fisheries Policy was established on the basis of a Council regulation in 1972 and the review of the policy is scheduled for 1992, as I have already indicated.  The Commission will <Col N="2152" /> be making a submission to the Council before the end of 1991.  The report itself will cover the fisheries situation in the Community.  As I have already indicated, the economic and social development of the coastal areas as well as the state of the stocks and their likely evolution will be considered.</P>
      <P>As late as 17 October officials of my Department met with Mr. Van der Poele, the officer appointed by the Commission to draw up the review of the Common Fisheries Policy and they had an informal discussion on the aims and scope of the review.  Mr. Van der Poele will visit Ireland as soon as possible to meet the officials of the industry and my Department in order to secure first hand knowledge of the matter.  I want to assure the Deputy that her concerns are being taken into consideration and are already on board.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Arising from his dual responsibilities for the safety of life at sea and for the development of the fishing industry, the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, recently publicly expressed his concern at the incident referred to by the Deputies. He is taking a keen interest in the outcome of inquiries established to investigate the incident with a view to taking every possible positive action to protect the lives of Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>The Government are very seriously concerned about the dangers that submarines pose to shipping and about the nuclear hazard in the event of an accident involving nuclear powered or armed submarines. We avail of every opportunity in international fora, such as the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation, to focus attention on the general problems.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs have raised specific incidents with the authorities of the countries concerned and will continue to do so as the need arises.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs have been seeking information from the British authorities in relation to the specific incident to which the Deputies refer.  The question of further approaches to the British authorities will be considered in the light of this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is widespread concern among the fishing community who fish in the Irish Sea that until such time as submarines are obliged to travel on the surface through the fishing grounds, this danger will continue to exist?  Would the Minister agree that he should forcefully <Col N="2155" /> put the Irish position to his counterparts in the United Kingdom and the United States and demand immediate action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to assure the Deputy that this is being done.  Ireland's national control over foreign vessels ends at the limit of our territorial waters.  Inside that limit vessels must travel on the surface, as the Deputy has indicated, and show identification. Beyond that limit vessels operate in international waters over which we have no jurisiction.  Vessels travel freely through international waters.  I want to assure the Deputy that we are as concerned as he is about the safety and lives of our fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is now a necessity to take this issue beyond the level of generality which is contained in the Minister's two replies to this matter to date?  Would he agree that there is already considerable information available that over a period there has been a series of incidents involving submarines, most of them from the United Kingdom; that an RTE programme documented the extent of submarine activity in the Irish Sea; that this activity has already claimed the lives of a number of fishermen; that there is now a necessity for the Government to raise with the UK authorities this specific matter of submarine activity in the Irish Sea and to seek an international treaty which would ban submarines travelling underwater in the Irish Sea?  Would he agree that there is a necessity for that kind of specific action?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to assure the Deputy that in the aftermath of the most recent tragedy I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to continue to avail of every opportunity to raise in the appropriate international fora the dangers which submarines pose to fishing vessels.  I have also asked him to <Col N="2156" /> voice with the relevant bilateral contacts the concerns of our fishermen about submarine activity in the fishing grounds and other waters around our coasts.  As the Deputy knows, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have raised this issue in the past at the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been asked on a number of occasions to raise these incidents involving submarines with the authorities in the countries involved and he will continue to do that.  In short, my Department will continue to do everything possible to enhance the safety of vessels at sea whether in territorial or international waters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The first step in the enforcement of EC fish quotas is the monitoring of landings both qualitatively and quantitatively.  This task is carried out by my Department's inspectors at landing ports around the coast.</P>
      <P>As part of this procedure, catches by fishing vessels at landing ports are subject to inspection by my Department's inspectors. All vessels greater than ten metres in length are required to carry EC log books in which catch details are recorded. Completed log book entries must be passed on to my inspectors within 48 hours of landing.  However, vessels greater than ten metres but not more than 17 metres in length need not have a log book on board for fishing voyages of 24 hours or less but must, nevertheless, make a declaration to my Department of fish landed.  The licence conditions imposed on all vessels operating in controlled or quota fisheries are a further means of ensuring the orderly and effective exploitation of fish stocks.</P>
      <P>When a quota as set by the EC is reached, the fishery is closed by ministerial order.  The closed fishery is then policed (i) at sea, on behalf of my Department by the Naval Service and (ii) at landing ports, by Department of the Marine officials.  Boats which continue to fish in contravention of a closure order are subject to prosecution.</P>
      <P>The actual detailed methods of enforcement in other member states are primarily matters for the relevant authorities in those states.  All states are required to manage the quotas allocated to them, to enforce the various technical conservation measures adopted and to implement log book regulations, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effectiveness of enforcement and fisheries surveillance in member states is subject to review by the EC Commission. <Col N="2158" /> EC inspectors visit member states from time to time and report on the level of compliance with EC Regulations.  The Commission may initiate court proceedings against member states for alleged non-compliance.  I am satisfied with the workings of the current enforcement procedures in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Individual fishermen and representatives of fishermen's organisations do on occasion complain that the practices and levels of enforcement are uneven across the Community.  This is a concern which I share with colleagues in the Council of Ministers and which is pursued with the Commission on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am satisfied with the enforcement procedures conducted in Ireland and it is part of my concern that similar procedures are not being conducted in other member states.  Will the Minister say how often this matter is discussed at EC level?  In relation to the allocation of quotas, is the Minister aware of the significance of member states applying for &mdash; and getting &mdash; very small quotas for certain species in different zones which entitles them to go into the zones and fish the species?  However, the right of entry to the zones does not mean they are taking out more than the quota and, in some cases, more than the allowed quota is being fished in those zones.  Is the Minister aware that in other member states the same level of vigilance is not being maintained and that greater catches of species are being landed in other member states of the EC?  What action does he propose to take to stop this practice which is depriving our industry of its resources?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is time for the EC to put in place a proper enforcement procedure in relation to the fishing of quotas?  It is all very well to talk about reports but, while they are being compiled, laws are still being breached by member states and Ireland are losing out most by this.  Will the Minister tell the House if there are any plans by the Government to impress on the Commission the need for a very definite enforcement and policing procedure?  Have the Department made any proposals regarding that matter to the EC?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As I have already stated, the obligation is on each member state to enforce the regulations laid down by the EC.  Furthermore, the necessary action can be taken by the Commission to see that the regulations are adopted and implemented.  Indeed we saw evidence of that in the very recent past.  The effectiveness of enforcement and fishery surveillance in member states is under review on a continuous basis by the EC Commission.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take questions Nos. 11, 12, 20, 36 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Let me begin by saying that there has been no undue delay in setting up the formal investigation into the Ballycotton tragedy.  As many Deputies will be aware, no such formal investigation under the Merchant Shipping Acts has been held in this country since 1955.  It is a complex and intricate legal process and every available resource has been devoted to ensuring that all the legal requirements are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation will be chaired by a justice of the District Court sitting with two assessors with suitable nautical experience or knowledge to assist the court in its deliberations.  A formal application to hold the investigation will be made to Justice M. C. Reilly at the <Col N="2161" /> District Court in Midleton on 17 December. It will be a matter for the court to decide on the date for the commencement of the formal investigation.</P>
    <P>The court will investigate all aspects of the Ballycotton incident at a public hearing and may call any person it sees fit to help it in its deliberations and it may also hear from any interested parties or their legal representatives.  Having considered the circumstances of the case, the court will make a report and include any opinions or observations it thinks fit.  This report will then be published in full for the information of the general public and the interested parties.  While publication of the report will be a matter for the court, I do not anticipate that there will be any undue delays in its publication.</P>
    <P>On 17 August last I announced that I had directed the fisheries boards to undertake immediately an urgent review of equipment including personal safety equipment, personnel, training, procedures and vessels used in deep water patrols to ensure the highest possible safety levels.  I also indicated on that occasion that I had directed the marine surveyors of my Department to provide such technical assistance as the boards may require in the conduct of this review and in ensuring the application of the safest possible operational procedures.</P>
    <P>I await the results of that review and when I receive the results I shall consider the implications and take whatever decisions are required.  I am assured that, pending the results of the review, the boards are taking a precautionary approach and that the interests of safety are being accorded paramount importance.</P>
    <P>In the interim, my Department have provided the boards with guidelines to be followed in the operation of their seagoing patrols.  These include guidance in relation to equipment, communications and training.</P>
    <P>In view of the seriousness of the incident, and also in view of my responsibility for safety of life at sea, I decided that it would not be appropriate to await the outcome of the inquest before taking action.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I wonder if the formal application to Midleton District Court would be made on 17 December if this question had not been tabled today.  Is that how the formal application was initiated?  Since this inquiry was announced on 18 September why was there such a delay before the formal application was made to Midleton Disrict Court?  Does the Minister not agree that a week before Christmas is a bad time to place an application before the court as this means that the relatives of the four victims who died so tragically will not have any details before Christmas as to how their relatives died?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, responsibility for the provision and maintenance of lights services, comprising lighthouses, light vessels, beacons and so on, around the coasts of Ireland and Britain is vested in three bodies, known as General Lighthouse Authorities, viz. the Commissioners of Irish Lights who serve the coasts around Ireland, Trinity House which has responsibiity for England and Wales and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, who are responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man.  While the lights in the three <Col N="2166" /> areas are separately held and managed by the three lighthouse authorities, the whole system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single financial unit.  Expenditure is met from the general lighthouse fund which derives its income from the collection of lights dues in ports in Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department contribute to the general lighthouse fund in accordance with the terms of a financial agreement reached in 1985 between the Irish and British authorities.  The payments over the last five years have been: 1986, Nil; 1987, £1,286,969; 1988, £1,315,369; 1989, £1,463,445; 1990, £2,043,000.</P>
    <P>My role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Commissioners of Irish Lights can best be characterised as that of trustee of the general lighthouse fund.</P>
    <P>As regard prospective redundancies among lightkeepers this is an industrial relations matter which is appropriate for settlement between CIL and the relevant unions or under established industrial relations machinery.  I have no function in this matter but I am aware of the terms payable to those under 40.  They are: preserved pension and additional allowance at age 60; plus a lump sum compensation payment based on age and length of service.</P>
    <P>In addition £4,000 per person has been offered to compensate for lack of entitlement to unemployment benefit.  CIL inform me that not more than 20 lightkeepers will be under age 40 when made redundant.</P>
    <P>I understand that the lightkeepers' union took the redundancy issue to the Labour Court which found that the Commissioners of Irish Lights would not be in breach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> should they issue redundancy notices to their staff.  The court recommended further that the terms offered by the Commissioners, including the £4,000 lump sum, be accepted.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Labour Court's recommendation, it would be improper of me to interfere in the manner proposed by the Deputy and in any event, as I have already indicated, I have no power to act in that way.</P>

Will the Minister not agree that it is unacceptable that these unfortunate people are now being made redundant and being actively prejudiced because no immediate pension is being provided for them?  Will the Minister agree that, as a contributor of £2 million to the fund in 1990, he has a role to play?  Will the Minister undertake an examination to improve the position of those workers?</P>

He has a responsibility to provide employment for them.

Will the Minister not agree that his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, having put these men on D1 contributions only it would now be a shameful abandonment of them to leave them without any immediate pension rights?  Effectively he is saying to men, under the age of 40, that they will have to wait until they reach the age of 65 years before they receive a contributory pension.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am fully aware of certain evidence.  I should also say that draft guidelines are being prepared by a working party under the auspices of the Forest Service of the Department of Energy.  This working party was composed of representatvies of the Forest Service, Coillte Teoranta, the Irish Timber Growers Association, the Department of the Marine, the Fisheries Research Centre and the Central Fisheries Board.  The guildeines set out precautionary measures to be taken by forestry undertakings in the major areas likely to cause problems for fisheries, such as ground preparation and drainage, fertilisation use of chemicals, such as weed killers, avoidance of shading, harvesting and road making.  The guidelines set out more stringent requirements in relation to areas on the west coast where calcium levels are low and water sampling by the fisheries boards indicated that the pH and water hardness levels were already near those found to be stressful to fish life.  We are taking the necessary precautions and investigations are taking place.</P>

      <P>Therefore, any points I have to make should be made when concluding. I should say that there was support in principle on all sides of the House <Col N="2213" /> for amendment No. 64 but the Minister had a difficulty with it.  He outlined that it may be difficult to give parents written notice in all cases because the whereabouts of parents, whose children are being taken into care, might not be known.  I am now proposing to withdraw amendment No. 64 and make two changes, the first of which is to insert the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; so that the Minister's fears can be met and, secondly, the amendment would apply to a parent or parents, as the case may be.  I am making that change having received advice from both the Bills office and the Minister's office.  I formally request your approval, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to withdraw amendment No. 64 and I will be pressing amendment No. 64a in the hope that we will reach agreement in the House.</P>

      <P>I want to be as helpful as I can but I have gone as far as I can in accommodating Deputy Yates and the House.  If I take an amendment on board I will do so in an effort to have the best Bill passed into law.  I appreciate that Deputy Yates in the substitute amendment, amendment No. 64a, has gone a long way towards eliminating the difficulties I mentioned when we discussed amendment No. 64 prior to lunch. I want to repeat that I sympathise with the principle that parents should be fully informed of the implications of their child being taken into care.  However, the very strong advice available to me is that this <Col N="2214" /> is not the best way to achieve what we all desire.  Let me explain further.</P>
      <P>In this instance, we are talking about a major family crisis.  A child being taken into care is likely to have a very traumatic effect on the parents who are likely to be upset, confused, perhaps even angry and aggressive.  I do not believe that handing them an official document containing legal terminology is likely to be of much help to them in that situation.  What would be of much more value would be for the social workers involved to sit down with the parents to explain exactly what is happening and what the parents should do.  I understand that this is what happens at the moment.</P>
      <P>I reconsidered this matter during lunch and had consultations about it.  I want to give the House a firm commitment that I will direct that the practice of consultation, advice and guidance for the parents will be included in the guidelines to be drawn up and which will be issued to the health boards.  I will recommend that in implementing this section the parent or parents should be kept fully informed.  A leaflet outlining their rights and the services available to them will be made available to them at that time.</P>
      <P>I give this firm commitment here having reconsidered the matter.  I regret that I was unable to accept the amendment prior to lunch and I further regret I cannot accept this new amendment. Instead, I am prepared to give a pledge that this practice will be included in the guidelines and the information will be made available to the parents.  In view of this, I would be grateful if Deputy Yates withdrew his amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 11 to 16 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>14.&mdash;(1)  Where a child is delivered up to, or placed in the custody of, a health board under this Part, the board shall as soon as possible inform or cause to be informed a parent having custody of him or a person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> of that delivery or placement unless that parent or person is missing and cannnot be found.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to have been informed of the placing of a child in the custody of a health board under section 13 if he is given or shown a copy of the emergency care order made under that section or if that person was present at the sitting of the court at which such order was made.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Special Committee there was agreement that every effort should be made to ensure that parents are informed as soon as possible when their children have been taken into care in an emergency. The existing section is inadequate in a number of respects.  For example, it requires a health board to inform the <Col N="2217" /> parents when an emergency care order is made.  Where a child has been removed by a garda under section 12 it may be some days before the order is made and thus some days before the health board would be obliged to notify the parents. The existing draft does not take account of situations where the parents are missing. The new subsection remedies these defects and I hope the amendment can be agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 18, to delete &ldquo;managers&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;registered proprietors&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment effects a minor technical change required to facilitate the radical overhaul of Part VIII of the Bill which deals with children's residential centres. I might refer Members to amendments Nos. 186 to 203 on pages 25 to 31 of the list.  At the Special Committee there was an unanimous agreement on all sides that the Bill should be amended so that it would not be lawful for any person or body to operate a home for children unless it was registered with the local health board.  The later amendments seek to give effect to Deputies' desire that the registration system for such homes be set in place.  I might add that the registration scheme we are proposing is modelled <Col N="2218" /> closely on the new Nursing Homes Bill recently passed by the House which has since been enacted into law.  I hope these amendments will receive the support of all sides of the House so that we can strengthen the Bill and clarify the position.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, when dealing with a group of amendments like this, we allowed ourselves the luxury of actually accepting the principle but allowing some time for debate in the context of the section as we get to it.  Would it be possible to follow that precedent from yesterday, accept the Minister's amendment No. 68 &mdash; the specific one we have reached &mdash; and not agree to take them grouped, as you suggested, Sir, so that we can have some degree of discussion when we reach the amendments in the context of the registration of homes, which is completely separate from what we are dealing with here?</P>

I have indicated to the House what is the relevant Standing Order.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 70:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;It shall be an offence for any person to conceal a child who is the subject of an emergency care order.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am proposing in this amendment is that it shall be an offence to conceal a child who is the subject of an emergency care order.  In any practical circumstance this would be a very serious matter, <Col N="2220" /> where there would be already a court order, and emergency, where it was decreed that the relevant child would be taken into care.  This must be dealt with in such a manner as to show that this is a crisis.  Anyone who would seek to conceal a child in those circumstances deserves to be put in a position that there must be a deterrent to their so doing.  Therefore, I believe it should be an offence to conceal a child in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said that we must bear in mind that difficult circumstances may arise, that people who have abducted a child may react in an unpredictable way.  Notwithstanding that, there is a need that something so serious, affecting someone as defenceless as a child, be treated as a crime against a person, that is to abduct them against their will.  I feel strongly that this provision should be inserted into law, should be part of this Bill, and that in so doing we would be giving a clear message of the gravity with which we view the concealment of a child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Both amendments address the same problem.  As the Minister's amendment suggests a penalty, perhaps that is the road we should travel.  Perhaps the provision is in a more appropriate section than Deputy Yates suggested.  I have just read through the Minister's amendment.  Probably it meets Deputy Yates' point.  Possibly the Minister's amendment is better.</P>

      <P>The need for a provision along the lines of amendment No. 70 proposed by Deputy Yates was discussed at the Special Committee.  At that time I promised to look into the matter.  As a result, I now propose amendment No. 128.  That amendment is designed to deal with circumstances in which a parent refuses to hand over a child to a health board despite the fact that an emergency care order, an interim care order or a care order has been made. As the District Court does not have a contempt of court jurisdiction, it is necessary to create a statutory offence in order to enforce these orders.  In view of this <Col N="2221" /> perhaps Deputy Yates might be prepared to withdraw his amendment No. 70 and accept amendment No. 128.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that personal characteristics are not always accepted in the House. However, in this case we will be happy to accept them and move on to amendment No. 71 in the name of Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 71:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 23, after &ldquo;appears&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on the basis of its own investigation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to Part IV of the Bill which deals with care proceedings.  I am seeking to firm up the provision by inserting &ldquo;on the basis of its own investigation&rdquo; after &ldquo;appears&rdquo;.  I have been advised by health workers that this would be clearer because things like this do not appear out of thin air and it would be more logical to allow a legal basis for the health board to carry out prior investigations into cases requiring care proceedings before they come before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one little problem with this.  The amendment provides that &ldquo;on the basis of its own investigation&rdquo; it shall be the duty of the health board to take a certain course.  If the health board, got information in any other circumstances, would the amendment prove a restriction?  Is it superflous to insert that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I was going to make on this amendment. Rather than strengthening this section, to include &ldquo;on the basis of its own investigation&rdquo; would restrict the health board unduly.  It would mean that a health board or an agent or employee of the health board would have to have <Col N="2222" /> carried out their own investigation.  I do not think that wording would be suitable in this section.  We are dealing with urgent cases that need to be tackled quickly.  My reading of this is that it would exclude the possibility of acting on, say, a report received from a teacher, a social worker who was not employed by a health board, a voluntary organisation involved in child care or whatever.  A whole range of responsible people and bodies would be excluded if we put this in.  On mature consideration the Deputy might withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dempsey did not mention that perhaps a health board would not be able to take on board a medical report from a doctor outside the health board who may have been involved in the case.  This could be restrictive; it could be a legal minefield.  Some very smart lawyer could say, &ldquo;You cannot use that report because it was not a result of the health board's own investigation; it was the result of an investigation by someone else.&rdquo;  I ask Deputy Yates to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to find the text in the report of the Special Committee because I thought we had dealt with this previously.  We want to achieve in this legislation a broadening of powers to health boards and I am of similar mind to those Deputies who have raised concerns about the narrowing of this provision. This legislation will be under close scrutiny in the courts, section by section, as individual cases arise and it is incumbent on us not to build into it loopholes or flaws that might be exploited to overcome the objectives we in the Oireachtas seek to put in place.  For that reason I share the concerns of the other Deputies that by this amendment we may be building in unnecessary difficulties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 23, after &ldquo;health board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or approved agency&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a most important issue and there is no adequate way I can get this matter dealt with other than by this amendment. I remind you, Sir, that my amendments Nos. 3, 5, 6 and others were ruled out of order and this is the best device I have to get those issues discussed here.</P>
      <P>Whether the health board should be the sole instrument or body operating this legislation, in my view, is very questionable. I am seeking to allow at some future date a more enlightened Government to establish a different structure to operate this legislation.  Call it what you may, &ldquo;a child care authority&rdquo; or &ldquo;other approved agency&rdquo;, for the third time I would like the Minister to respond to a question he has chosen to neglect so far: which Department of State will be given responsibility now or in the future for all child care issues?  Umpteen reports, umpteen commissions, umpteen working parties committees and every other consultative structure, conclude that the biggest single problem in the area of child care is the fact that across the range of issues there has been a shuffling of administrative responsibility between the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  We have seen juveniles brought before courts where they had to be remanded repeatedly and brought back to the court because there was no place or centre for them simply because the health board in their own jurisdiction were not able to cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate we have had references to the fact that particular matters pertain to the Minister for Justice rather than the <Col N="2224" /> Minister for Health and are, therefore, taboo in our discussion.  It has becomes self-evident in this debate that health boards are too narrow to deal with the facilities and procedures required under this new legislation.  Anyone who is a member of a health board will tell you he is overburdened between the general hospitals programme, the special hospitals programme and the community care programme and he cannot cope with additional powers, let alone take on board new structures.  I feel very strongly that the Minister is flying in the face of all the advice and all the interdepartmental necessities for a new structure.  Therefore, I am seeking to provide in these two amendments that at some future date the Government of the day can allow some structure other than the health boards &mdash; they may be abolished in the fullness of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a window that should be left ajar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present health board structure <Col N="2225" /> cannot take into account the work of the gardaí, the juvenile liaison officers, the school attendance officers and the main-steam work of our education system, not to speak of the voluntary community related work that has been done by social workers and others.  In all those contexts this legislation must be seen to be limited and narrow in its outlook and for that reason I ask for support for this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Yates appears to be suggesting is that if he became Minister for Health he would abolish the health boards.  That means that his amendment is superflous because health boards were set up under the Health Act, 1970.  If Deputy Yates wished, at some future time, to abolish health boards, other legislation would have to take the place of the present legislation and the functions of the health boards would have to be transferred to some other body or bodies.  That would be the time to decide what to do in relation to care proceedings.</P>
      <P>My view is that since health boards were set up by legislation, taking over the functions of local authorities, they can only be dissolved by legislation.  I take the view that Deputy Yates' amendment is, to say the least, and with the greatest of respect, ill-timed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That interpretation of what Deputy Yates said is probably the greatest stretch of the imagination I have ever heard.  If Deputy Yates wants to abolish health boards he would have an amendment down to remove the words &ldquo;health boards&rdquo;.  When Deputy Yates was trying to achieve was a change of heart by the Government and get them to decide that the most appropriate way to handle child care problems would be to set up a national children's council.  This has been advocated by many professional people and many members in this House.  My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has continually pursued it as has Deputy Yates. Many of us hoped the Minister would concede this but he has not done so.  We must not rule out the possibility that in <Col N="2226" /> the future some other approved agency could be responsible for or, indeed, assist health boards if necessary.  I see nothing wrong with having this provision written into this section.  If the words, &ldquo;or other approved agencies&rdquo;, were inserted after &ldquo;health boards&rdquo; that would leave flexibility for a possible change of heart on the part of the Government to agree with all the suggestions about setting up a national children's council.</P>

      <P>While this is a very small amendment it has very wide implications for the health boards.  The amendment shows the problem the Fine Gael parliamentary party have with the role of health boards.  There was a much vaunted proposal before the last election that Fine Gael would, if they got into power, abolish health boards and put in regional bodies which, in my opinion, would be more cumbersome, to oversee the health of children and adults.  It again brings to mind the ideological hang up that Fine Gael have about decentralising decisionmaking into the regions.  I, for one, would be vehemently against any dilution of our health board system because I feel they have stood the test of time since they were set up in 1970.  Prior to that health services were run by the county councils and that was not a particularly great system.  While the county councils and local authorities do not run our health services now the proposal from the far side is that the health boards would be done away with and everything would be run by the Department of Health.  I do not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I beg the indulgence of the House because I have not taken part in this debate up to now having been involved with the British/Irish parliamentary body.  I do not see anywhere in the Bill a definition of an approved agency. This amendment should not be passed in its present form.  I do not agree with it. <Col N="2227" /> Health boards should have sole responsibility for the care area.  That amendment is defective because it does not say what an approved agency is.</P>
      <P>I do not necessarily agree that some other agency outside a statutory agency should have a say in the care of children. I admit that from time to time cases are thrown up where there is difficulty deciding where the responsibility lies, whether a case comes under the jurisdiction of Education, Justice or Health.  That could not be dealt with in a Bill of this sort.  In future some effort should be made to properly define the areas of responsibility and ensure that the odd case that comes up does not hit the headlines.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with the care of children in extreme or emergency cases and where their physical well-being is at risk.  If any Department should be looking after that it should be the Department of Health, and the responsibility should devolve on the health boards.  I reject the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>I must say that I greet with a wry smile an attack by a Government Deputy on Fine Gael for having ideological hang-ups.  It has been my experience that neither his party nor Fine Gael were overly burdened with ideology, much less ideological hang-ups.</P>
      <P>I want to address the amendment before us.  A lot has been read into it on the other side of the House.  It is as if there was a proposal to abolish the health boards, centralise all health administration and radically reform health administration here.  There is no such intention and no such impact would follow from enacting this simple amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just re-read the debate we had on this amendment on Committee Stage. It was interesting to read the degree of tension that it raised.  We addressed two fundamental issues.  One was the refusal of the Government to legislate for a national children's authority, although the huge weight of opinion on the Opposition benches, and from all the agencies outside, indicated that was the correct <Col N="2228" /> course to follow.  Parallel to that was the view expressed again and again by Government speakers in the Special Committee that there was a need to achieve a centralisation of policy in relation to children and that Health was the appropriate Department to co-ordinate such a policy.  I commented at that stage that the basic aspiration seemed to be, &ldquo;make me good, Lord Jesus, but not yet&rdquo;.  We have not progressed much beyond that because the aspiration is still there.</P>

      <P>We hear the aspiration again and again from that side of the House indicating that it is a good idea to have central co-ordination but that we do not have the mechanism to do that. Therefore, when a crisis arises, when a difficult case arises, it will be juggled between the three Departments, Education, Justice and Health, and that is sad.  When it comes to the crunch they will all buck-pass, one to the other.  It is important, as I said on another amendment, that we focus in on this.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly the two amendments in Deputy Yates' name would obviously be a lot more meaningful had the Minister accepted the strong argument on Committee Stage to establish a child care authority.  At least he has given an indication that he is not abandoning the aspiration to work towards better things, and we might, in the fullness of time, have such a body.  It is a long time since we addressed this issue by way of legislation. It is important that we at least put some signpost in the Bill if we cannot have the milestones that all of us on this side of the House have sought with such vigour over the last number of months.</P>

      <P>With a lack of child care facilities we could not really allow it to degenerate to nursery status.  It is no wonder there is a sense of tension here because this amendment is fundamental to the history of child care and also to the present position.  Hopefully we will have a brighter future.  What has bedevilled and beleagured the whole area of child care, and indeed left a lot of tragedy and victims in its wake, is the fact that we had no central agency to deal comprehensively and constructively with this matter.  There was no central body with responsibility for the lives of our children, particularly those at risk.  That is an outrage and everybody in the House must recognise that.  District justices and judges in the courts dealing with these cases have expressed their total disappointment, disillusion and indeed anger at the fact that there was no responsibility by Government Departments in this area.  The buck has been passed from Health to Education to Justice and nobody wanted to take responsibility.  In <Col N="2230" /> the light of what we are attempting to do, in protecting and supporting children and giving some sense of independent support to those who most need it, how can we argue that what we are doing will even begin to fulfil our duties and responsibilities? That is the basis of this amendment and out of this whole Bill.</P>
      <P>In a debate on an earlier amendment today the Minister said that he could not talk about guidelines regarding the specialist training of gardaí in this area because it is outside his responsibility. He said there is no way in which he as Minister for Health could dictate to the Minister for Justice.  That is at the centre of this discussion.  Our difficulty is that there is no independent agency that can take complete responsibility for this area and, as a result, children are wandering the streets of Dublin and other cities. Anybody who denies that is denying what has been happening and particularly what has been highlighted by our courts in the last two to three years.</P>
      <P>The Minister and everybody in this House have committed themselves to bringing in a Child Care Bill that will provide for all our children, but how can we do that when there is a total denial of responsibility by Departments and health boards?  That is the fulcrum of this amendment and that is why we have to approach it in this way.  Up to now we have not been able to get through to people that it is only by setting up authority with responsibility in this area and by giving them the necessary resources and powers that we are going to meet the crisis of children in our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. Since listening to the arguments I am more convinced of the need for such an amendment.  Part IV of the Bill provides for care proceedings.  Throughout the Bill the health board are mentioned as the agency involved but as has been pointed out there are other agencies that could also be involved.  As we proceed with the legislation, that will come very clearly to the fore.  In view of that it is important that &ldquo;approved agency&rdquo; be inserted.  In the final analysis it is the <Col N="2231" /> Department who will have to make the decision on what is an approved agency. There are many problems in the whole child care area and perhaps it is not right to confine the question of care proceedings to health boards.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to add to the tension in the Chamber.  At the equivalent stage of the Special Committee I may have added to the heat but I will try to avoid that now.  One of the points made by speakers opposite is that there is a necessity to avoid a repetition of the situation that has arisen over the past six to 12 months whereby one Department or body passes the buck as regards young people and children, with nobody taking responsibility.  I would ask people to read what is being proposed here.  In the Bill the Minister proposes that it will be the duty of health boards to institute proceedings.  If a phrase such as &ldquo;where it appears to a health board or approved agency&rdquo; as is suggested in Deputy Yates' amendment is accepted we would be back to the position that everybody on the other side of the House wants to avoid.  The health board would pass the buck and say that a certain approved agency should take the court proceedings and that it is not their responsibility.  If we accept the amendment we would be making it easier for health boards to evade their responsibilities, although I am not saying they would want to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barnes in particular made a very strong point &mdash; I have no problem with the general concept of what she said &mdash; that there should be a central agency for child care.  The amendment would simply let health boards off the hook and would allow them to say that this is not their duty, that an approved agency or the Department should take responsibility. The amendment would have the opposite effect to what Deputy Yates intends.  For that reason he should reconsider it.  All Members have been talking about providing for, as, I think, Deputy Yates said, &ldquo;some stage in the future&rdquo;.  If <Col N="2232" /> an approved agency is to be set up at some time in the future obviously there will have to be regulations or legislation to enable the approved agency to be put in place.  That is the appropriate time to amend this Bill and to insert &ldquo;other approved agencies.&rdquo;  I have tried not to raise the tension in this debate but I should like this amendment to be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>In the final analysis everybody agrees that it is not who does the job that counts but how the job is done.  If adequate resources were made available to a health board &mdash; or a section within the board &mdash; to do the job effectively, that is what would count.  The health board have the capacity to do that provided, as I said, they get adequate resources.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the purpose of this section is to impose a clear statutory duty on health boards to institute care proceedings where this appears necessary.  This is fully in keeping with one of the primary objectives of the Bill which is to establish the health board as our statutory child care and child protection agency.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to contributions from the other side of the House and I identify with their desires and aspirations to have all child responsibilities incorporated in one body.  If Utopia was a computer probably that would be possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps but we must look at the facts.  The Department of Education have a clear, legal constitutional duty to look after the <Col N="2233" /> education of our children; the Department of Health have a similar legal duty in regard to health and the Department of Justice have a clear duty in relation to the legal, criminal justice side.  Major changes like this would involve the total transformation of the whole departmental and governmental structure and it could not be done without setting up a very broad, highly skilled, professional commission to examine the connotations. I do not think it would be possible to make changes in a Bill which would take all the legal and statutory duties under one agency and tell them that it was their responsibility.  It is a huge area and something on which we must make haste slowly.  I advise caution in this regard.</P>
      <P>The amendment, on the other hand, proposes that the duty to take care proceedings in appropriate cases would be vested in the health boards and in other agencies at the same time.  This is not desirable; in the first place I am not aware of any agency &mdash; I presume the House has voluntary agencies in mind &mdash; which would have the necessary staff or expertise to take on such a difficult task.  I am not aware of any agency who have indicated their desire to perform such a role.</P>
      <P>The proper investigation and management of child abuse demands clear lines of responsibility and accountability. This can best be obtained by placing the statutory responsibility clearly and unambiguously on the health boards, who are the statutory bodies under the 1970 Health Act, charged with the responsibility of administering the health service right across the regions.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned that this amendment could lead to confusion.  For that reason I regret I will not be able to accept it.</P>

      <P>Initially, in some of the contributions from the Government side there was a reference to health boards and their future.  I realise that within the Government party, especially at local authority level, it is considered a particular perk to be able to go to regional meetings and to be a member of a <Col N="2234" /> regional health board.  However, this amendment is not about that issue.  The Minister talked about setting up a commission to examine the whole matter and to analyse it.  A commission already reported in the late sixties &mdash; and their views have since been endorsed &mdash; that we need a new approach in this regard. Obviously, the report was a total waste of time because imagination and new thinking have not extended to &mdash; or beyond &mdash; health boards at this stage.  It is obviously not possible to gain agreement on this.  However, the marker must be put down.  I would have preferred if we had been able to debate my earlier amendments on child care authorities but it was not possible as they involve a charge on the Exchequer.  Time will tell but Deputy Sherlock was nearest the point when he said in yesterday's contribution that he knew of a case where three social workers were involved in one case.  That epitomises the problems on the ground.  The people most directly in touch with those problems have asked for structures &mdash; other than the narrow ones of the health boards &mdash; to be put in place. For that reason, I intend to press this amendment.</P>

    <P>I have looked at amendment No. 127 in the name of the Minister and I note that it contains a general statement that all information and documents will be referred to the parties.

      <P>Amendment No. 74 seeks to give parents of children involved in care proceedings a statutory right to details of the evidence to be presented by the health board at the court hearing.</P>
      <P>When this matter was discussed at the Special Committee on 6 March last, I gave an undertaking to examine the need for such a provision in consultation with the Attorney General.  Amendment No. 127 is the result of that consideration.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that rules of court may make provision for the furnishing of information and documents by parties to care proceedings to each other or to their solicitors.  These rules could require the health board to furnish the parents with details of the witnesses it proposes to call, to supply them with copies of the medical or other evidence it proposes to adduce etc.  The reason for choosing the rules of court approach rather than specifying the matters in legislation is to provide greater flexibility.  It would be quicker and easier for the relevant rules of court committee to amend their rules in the light of new requirements laid down by the High Court or Supreme Court rather than having to amend the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would refer Members of the House to our deliberations in the Special Committee on 6 March last.  This amendment is seeking a legal right for parents to obtain from the court a right to have a separate independent assessment carried out on the child where the assessment of the health board is in dispute.  We have had cases where fit person orders granted to the health board were subsequently found to be invalid when a second assessment was made.  The Minister in his reply to the original amendment in the special committee said that it was the practice that the health boards made arrangements to facilitate parents in obtaining second opinions if they wished to do so. It is not satisfactory to leave this to the discretion of the health boards.  There should be a legal right to a second opinion.  There is a point of substance here.  The House should try to ensure that consultation is minimised, and that justices can make the best possible decision.  These aims would be best served by accepting amendment No. 75.</P>

There was general agreement on both sides of the House on the desirability of affording parents the opportunity to have an independent assessment done if the health board assessment is in dispute.  It is important to put that into legislation.  The Minister's argument at the time was that parents had that right anyway and that it was the practice.  However the Minister accepted the principle.  If it is a good principle, if it is a right that we want to spell out, we should incorporate it into the Bill and the Bill will be all the better for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It was put to me that the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; is a requirement that is too strong in judicial terms, that a district court would have to have almost a judicial determination in order to be in a position to grant an interim care order.  I seek to remove the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; and replace it by &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo;.  I am advised that that would be preferable and would allow a greater scope to a justice to intervene in the case where an interim care order may well be required and allow for the child to be in a place of safety until a proper determination is made in the matter.  I am open to hearing the Minister's view on this.  It is important <Col N="2238" /> that we get the balance right in relation to the degree of proof we require before an interim care order can be made by the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Debates on other legislation will show the Minister for Health to have preferred the phrase &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo;.  The Minister as a busy practitioner before becoming Minister for Health would have used this terminology extensively.  Doctors and people in the care area regularly give their opinions. All they are expected to do is give their opinion.  It is important that this legislation is based on opinion which in turn is based on professional training and experience.  In medical terms &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo; is a much more definitive term than &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; and &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo; in legal terms.  &ldquo;Is satisfied&rdquo; is much more definite and it infers that a decision is made when the judge has taken all things into consideration.  I can see why &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; was put in.  In all these issues it is up to the health boards to be of the opinion and make an application to the court.  It is then up to the district justice to be satisfied taking everything into consideration before he makes an interim care order which in every case is a very important step in relation to the care of a child.  I am happier with &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; so that injustice would not be done, so that a child would not be taken from the parents without proper investigation or proof to the judge.  Putting in &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo; would not be judicially correct.  The justice has to be satisfied before making a decision and that is the way it should be left in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahern.  In criminal proceedings a district justice must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.  In civil proceedings he must be satisfied on the balance of probabilities. In virtually all judicial decisions a judge or justice has to be satisfied. The standard of proof in relation to how <Col N="2239" /> satisfied a judge should be is not set out in the Bill.  I suppose that the decisions of all courts could be described as matters of opinion.  In this instance the necessity to be satisfied is clearly very important because of the consequences of what the judge is doing.  This is a very serious matter.  A judge is deciding that an interim care order should be made in relation to a child.  It has to be done on a certain standard of proof because of the implications involved.  Accordingly, I strongly urge Deputy Howlin and Deputy Ferris to be satisfied to accept the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies may recall that during the Special Committee I moved an amendment to what is now section 13 (1) to provide that a justice need only be &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; that certain circumstances exist, in order to justify the making of an emergency care order. It is appropriate that in an emergency we should not impose a standard of evidence that is too strict; therefore the test of the justice being &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; is appropriate in section 13.</P>
      <P>However, here we are dealing with section 17 &mdash; interim care orders.  At this stage, the matter is somewhat less urgent. The child has been removed from the source of danger and has been placed in the care of the health board.  The question now to be addressed by the justice is whether the child should remain in care or should be returned to the custody of his parents, pending the determination of an application for a care order.</P>
      <P>It is important at this stage that the health board be required to satisfy the justice that the child should remain in care.  To require any less than this from the health board would do great injustice to the parents against whom unsubstantiated allegations had been made.  I am advised that the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; is the appropriate one to use here and that &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; would not be sufficient.</P>
      <P>I hope that in the light of this explanation the Deputies might be prepared to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 77:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 34 to 36 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  there is reasonable cause to believe that any of the circumstances mentioned at paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of section 18 (1) exists or has existed with respect to the child and that it is necessary for the protection of the child's health or welfare that he be placed or maintained in the care of the health board pending the determination of the application for the care order,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments arise out of lengthy discussions that took place at two meetings of the Special Committee on 20 and 27 February last when I moved an amendment to insert a new section in the Bill to provide for the making of interim care orders.  There were a number of matters which concerned Deputies on that occasion and these three amendments seek to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question raised was whether the section itself is constitutionally sound in view of the fact that the section gives a district justice wide discretion to deny <Col N="2241" /> parents custody of their children pending the determination of an application for a care order.  The first amendment seeks to copperfasten the constitutionality of the section by setting down clearer and more precise grounds which must be satisfied before the justice can make an interim care order.</P>
    <P>The second question related to the power given to the justice in subsection (2) to extend the term of the interim care order.  Some Deputies were concerned that an interim care order could, at least in theory, last indefinitely and suggested that some limit be placed on the number of extensions that could be granted.  I made the point then, and I repeat it now, that it would be undesirable to impose on arbitrary limit on the number of extensions that could be granted.  We cannot predict what difficulties may arise in individual cases and the need to extend orders must be considered by the justice having regard to the circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>However, while I am opposed to a fixed time limit, we must ensure that an interim care order is extended only where this is clearly necessary.  The second amendment here seeks to ensure this by providing that an extension could be granted only where the justice is satisfied that circumstances which would justify the making of the interim care order, continue to exist with respect to the child. I hope that this additional safeguard meets the concerns of Deputies in this regard.</P>
    <P>The third of these amendments, No. 80, seeks to clarify the circumstances in which an interim care order may be made <i>ex parte,</i> that is, without notice to the parents.  At present, subsection (3) provides that an application for an order or an extension shall be on notice unless the justice directs otherwise.  It is proposed to strengthen this by providing that the application must be on notice unless the justice, having regard to the interests of justice or the welfare of the child, directs otherwise.</P>
    <P>In view of this I hope the House can accept these amendments, clarifying, <Col N="2242" /> strengthening and firming the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 78:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 42, after &ldquo;the parent&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having custody of the child&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical adjustment to make it clear which parent is being referred to here; it is necessary to deal with cases where parents are unmarried or are married but separated.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) allows the court to make an interim care order for a period in excess of eight days if the parent consents. The use of the word &ldquo;parent&rdquo; here without qualification may create difficulties when they are unmarried or are married but separated.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, therefore, to require the consent of &ldquo;the parent having custody&rdquo; of the child.  In the case of the child whose parents are not married, this would generally be the mother although it could be the father if he had been awarded custody by the courts.  In the case of a married couple who have separated, it would mean the partner having custody of the child.  Where both parents had custody of the child, be they married or unmarried, the consent of both parents would be required.</P>
      <P>I hope the House can accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 84:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 18, to delete &ldquo;there are reasonable grounds for believing that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the Special Committee meeting on 13 March last, some Deputies expressed reservations about the fact that the grounds on which a supervision order can be made are the same as those for the making of care orders.  It was suggested that if the relevant circumstances existed, for example, if a child is being assaulted or sexually abused, the proper response should be a care order rather than a supervision order.</P>
      <P>I have been looking at this again and I propose to make a number of changes in sections 18 and 19 in order to make clearer the circumstances in which each order would be made.</P>
      <P>Briefly, it is proposed in amendment No. 84 that in the case of a care order, the court would have to be satisfied that the circumstances set out at paragraph (a) or (b) or (c) exists.  However, in the case of a supervision order the other two amendments provide that it would only be necessary to show that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the circumstances mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) or (c) exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These refinements help to distinguish between the two forms of order.  As the care order involves a significant intrusion on the rights of the child and his parents, it should only be granted where the court is satisfied that the conditions exist.  On the other hand, a supervision order is far less intrusive and is for a short term and so a lesser standard for evidence should <Col N="2245" /> suffice.  I hope these amendments clarify the orders and that they are acceptable to the House.</P>

      <P>With the approval of the House, we will discuss amendments Nos. 89, 113 and 136 together as they are clearly related.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 89:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 3 to 7.</P>
      <P>The new provisions in relation to access which were inserted on Committee Stage have been warmly welcomed by health boards, foster-parents and parents of children in care.  It is proposed that the access procedures be extended to all children in care and not just, as in the present draft, children in care under care orders.  This means the provisions would apply to children in voluntary care under section 4, children under emergency care orders under section 13, children under interim care orders under section 17 as well as those under full care orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to achieve this it is necessary to move this section from Part IV to Part VII of the Bill and to make a number of minor technical changes.  The first is the <Col N="2246" /> insertion of the phrase, &ldquo;whether by virtue of an order under Part III or IV or otherwise&rdquo;.  This is to make it clear that the provisions apply to all children in care no matter what the basis of their admission to care.</P>
    <P>The second is to change the proviso from &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this section&rdquo;, to &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  This is to deal with cases where directions as to access have been made by a justice in relation to a child in emergency care under section 13 (7) (a) (ii).</P>
    <P>The third change is the insertion of a provision allowing a child to reside temporarily with his parents or other person.  At present this is provided for in section 18 (4) but only in relation to children under care orders.  The Law Reform Commission expressed some concern about that provision and about health boards allowing children who had been placed in care to return home. These returns may be for one night, a weekend or holiday and are used selectively by health boards where there is a prospect of reuniting the child permanently with his parents.  The suggestion that each return home should require the sanction of the court is impracticable. However, I accept that the power of a health board should not be open-ended so the new provision refers to &ldquo;temporary arrangements&rdquo;.  I hope these amendments will be accepted by the House as we want to ensure that the Bill is as clear and firm as possible.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with <Col N="2247" /> what the Minister wants to do in his amendment, and I welcome his decision. My amendment to amendment No. 136 seeks to substitute the word &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;allow&rdquo; in subsection (1). The Minister's amendment would put an obligation on a health board to allow reasonable access to the child by his parents.  I feel strongly that the word &ldquo;allow&rdquo; is too passive.  In many instances allowances are made for visits but sometimes they meet in corridors or in totally unsuitable accommodation.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the word &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; would indicate that the Oireachtas requires health boards to take positive steps to allow such visits to occur, that they should make arrangements by way of transport and the provision of suitable rooms for such meetings.  The word &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; is a far stronger and clearer word than &ldquo;allow&rdquo;.  There is almost a begrudgery factor in allowing such meetings to take place; it almost means that one is opposed to them.  The word &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; would be far more positive, less passive, stronger and would be more in accordance with the wishes of the Minister and the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 90:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 8 to 11, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Where, on an application for a care order, the court is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it is not necessary or appropriate that a care order be made, and</P>
      <P>(b)  it is desirable that the child be visited periodically in his home by or on behalf of the health board,</P>
      <P>the court may make a supervision order under section 19.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There was much discussion about section 18 (5) at the Special Committee.  Conflicting views were expressed as to whether the subsection should be deleted altogether or retained.  One view was that there was a danger that supervision orders might be made in circumstances in which what was needed was a care order with consequent risks for the child left at home.  The contrary view was that the subsection is of value in that it allows a justice to make a supervision order where there is insufficient evidence to justify the making of a care order without the health board having to make a fresh application to the court.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission also considered subsection (5) and recommended that the subsection be retained but that the justice be placed under an obligation to satisfy himself that a supervision order will adequately protect the child.  Essentially that is what I am proposing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 90 provides that a supervision order could be made under the section only where the justice is satisfied that it is not necessary or appropriate that a care order be made.  This could arise where there was not sufficient evidence to justify the making of a care order or where the danger to the child's health or welfare was not so serious as to require that the child be separated from his parents.  In either event a supervision order could be made if the justice felt that the child should be visited by the <Col N="2249" /> health board.  This gives sufficient guidance to the justice on the use of this power and I hope it will reassure the Deputies who were unhappy with the original draft.  I also hope that Deputies Howlin and Ferris will consider withdrawing amendment No. 92 in the light of this new proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The House may recall there was certain amusement when I submitted a similar amendment at the Special Committee.  The Minister accepted the case I made and agreed to remove the section but the argument to retain it was not made from the Government benches but from the Opposition benches.  I feel the argument can still be justified and the primary decision on the appropriate form of action to be taken should rest with the health board rather than with the judge.  I am impressed by the Minister's amendment and will happily withdraw my own in favour of his.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with the Minister's proposal to delete subsection (5) of section 18 and replace it with the new subsection proposed in amendment No. 90 as that is an improvement.  We should remember that supervision orders are entirely new creatures in law and I welcome them, but my amendment, No. 91, deals with a different matter.  What I am trying to ensure is that, in circumstances where a care order is applied for and not granted, a supervision order, at the minimum, would be granted instead; in other words, if for some reason the justice adjourned the hearing and stated further evidence was required as he could not make up his mind whether to grant the care order or not, I propose that, at the minimum a supervision order would apply pending the completion of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> This matter was discussed at the Special Committee on 13 March and I refer the House to column 501 of the Official Report.  I should say that, unfortunately, I was absent on that occasion &mdash; this was the only committee meeting I missed &mdash; and Deputy Fennell filled in for me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reflect on that and ask in what areas do we want to remove this discretion.  The area involved in very narrow.  If for any reason a period elapses between the application for and the granting of a care order &mdash; this may be a month or a shorter period &mdash; at the minimum a supervision order should apply during that period.  We should remember that a supervision order is the minimal order which can be granted, it is a lesser order than an interim care order, or emergency care order or a care order. We are putting the judge in a position where he will have to decide whether to grant a care order or not.  However, if he is certain that a supervision order will automatically be granted, this might ensure that people who would be put in care wrongly will not be put in care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have little difficulty with the Minister's proposal in so far as it is an improvement on what is there, it does not meet my point.  I realise that these amendments are grouped together but different points are at issue.  I ask the Minister to reconsider what he is proposing. All of this pre-empts section 19 which deals with supervision orders.  If this change is made will there not be <Col N="2251" /> consequent changes in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of section 19? If subsection (5) of section 18 is deleted, then consequent questions will arise on section 19.  The point I want to emphasise is that the health board should know that when they apply for a care order they are guaranteed a supervision order pending a final decision on the care order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will accept that prior to deciding to make a decision order, as opposed to a care order, the court would be expect to be satisfied that a care order was not necessary. One of the things that concerns me about this amendment is that it provides that, where an application is made for a care order, I presume by a health board, and the court is satisfied that it is not necessary to make a care order and it is desirable that the child be visited periodically at home by or on behalf of the health board, the court may make a supervision order under section 19.  This clearly leads one to the conclusion that the standard of proof which would be required in respect of an application for a supervision order in the course of a care order proceeding would be the same as required in respect of an application for a supervision order only.  What concerns me is that under section 19 such an application must be made by the health board and nobody else.  However, it is not stated in this amendment who exactly will make the application for a supervision order.  Is it the intention that the justice in the course of the proceedings would decide that he is not satisfied that he should make a care order and, of his own volition, could decide to make a supervision order or would it be necessary for the health board to make an alternative application to the court and, if so, how would this be done?  It is necessary that any confusion be cleared up at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, amendment No. 95 in my name and that of Deputy Ferris runs parallel with Deputy Yates's amendment No. 91. <Col N="2252" /> Would it be in order therefore for us to discuss them together?  My amendment would insert an extra phrase in line 14 and give the justice the option of making a supervision order.  The only difference between the amendments is that under Deputy Yates's amendment this would be mandatory whereas under mine it would be an option available to the justice during the period between the application for and the determination of the care order.  Rather than go over the ground again when we come to amendment No. 95, would it not be more appropriate to take at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say a few words in relation to amendment No. 95?  The intent behind Deputy Yates' amendment is very important, that we give as much flexibility as possible to the court and, at the same time, ensure that children who are believed by a health board to be at risk be properly monitored.  I understand in Deputy Yates' amendment he mentions &ldquo;child care authority&rdquo;; and since that will not exist I presume it can be amended to read &ldquo;health board&rdquo;.  If a health board perceive that a child is at risk, it would be necessary that there be some monitoring of the position.  If there is a delay in preparing a case that would satisfy a judge that a care order is justified, at least there would be the monitoring that would take place under a supervision order under section 19, which we have yet to reach: that is eminently reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all seen, particularly across the Irish Sea, many cases of children whose plight had been brought to the attention of care agencies, but who had not made a determination in relation to what course of action should be followed, who were subsequently seriously injured or, in one or two instances, actually killed.  It is important that, if the attention of a health board is brought to a child at <Col N="2253" /> risk, there would be a necessity at least to have that child monitored.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the arguments being advanced by the other side in relation to the discretion a judge should have; I am also interested in the dichotomy between the views expressed by Deputy Yates and his colleague Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage.  Deputy Yates was not present at that meeting.  But the import of most of what Deputy Yates has tried to do in his contributions on this Bill is to give discretion to the relevant health boards and allowing the health boards in the regions take the lead in child care matters.  Deputy Shatter was very strongly of the view that somehow the Judiciary should have primacy in dealing with these matters and was very adamant in arguing against the case I was making on the last occasion.  Notwithstanding that, the halfway line between the two arguments would be that the court would have the capacity to grant a supervision order pending the determination of the application for a care order.  That would be an eminently acceptable halfway house.</P>

      <P>Matters are becoming a little confused at this point.  I have been trying to follow the procedure.  When the Minister is replying would he indicate whether it is envisaged that the court would be given authority to appoint a guardian?  In some of these amendments an interim period is mentioned.  Would the Minister say whether that is ever envisaged, or whether there would be a possibility of drawing up a statutory instrument to that effect?  I understand there is very little tradition in this country of the appointment of guardians.  Seeing that there are such differences between care orders and supervision orders, would the Minister say whether there has been any consideration given to the appointment of guardians, and having such provision enshrined in legislation?</P>

Now we are hearing the Minister's own argument on Committee Stage being thrown back at him.</P>
      <P>The most relevant contribution on Committee Stage, the reason this was reconsidered by the Minister, indeed the reason this amendment is before the House, is that &mdash; although it was one of those occasions in the course of Committee Stage when Government Deputies argued alongside Opposition Deputies, when people were being very flexible &mdash; Deputy Shatter's contribution made the case fairly strongly.  I might quote from what Deputy Shatter said, at column 517 of the Official Report of the proceedings of the Special Committee of 13 March 1990 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would deal with the problem of the interim situation and of what the <Col N="2255" /> position of the child would be pending the determination of the application. That does not deal with the problem that Deputy Ahern, quite rightly, referred to and that Deputy Fennell, Deputy Sherlock and I have raised, that is, when you come to the end of the court hearing, the judge feels a child is at risk.  The judge takes the view that he does not have sufficient evidence before him to take a child into court.  He is left with two choices about taking the child into care.  He does not take the child into care or he does.  Without substantial evidence or compelling reasons, as the Supreme Court stated, the child cannot be taken into care.  you will then have the child released home and the judge will not have the option of making any other order to ensure that the child is protected.</P>
    <P>I could continue to quote from the proceedings of the Special Commttee but I think Members have the Official Report before them.  Most of us agreed with Deputy Shatter's summary on that date and the Minister's amendment before the House deals adequately with it.  Rather than causing further confusion perhaps we should accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>May I follow on from what Deputy Dempsey has just said. Deputy Shatter went on to raise the matter of discretion, contending that a court should be given discretion.  It is very important that a court be given full discretion in all such cases.  My fear is that acceptance of Deputy Yates amendment would compartmentalise the case.  Within a court situation probably that would be very dangerous and might well lead to constitutional action.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Howlin's point about an alternative, the alternative is there in amendment No. 94 which would take care of what he was saying.  Therefore I think the Minister's amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>Do a health board <Col N="2256" /> have to apply for a care order in order to get a supervision order?  I gather not; the health board can apply because it is said here at section 19 (1):</P>
      <P>19.&mdash;(1) Where, on the application of a health board, with respect to a child who resides in its area, the court is satisfied that&mdash;</P>

      <P>(c)  there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child's health, development or well-being is likely to be avoidably impaired or seriously neglected,</P>

      <P>I am grateful, Sir, for your patience and concern to ensure there is no confusion and I will try to clear the situation.  The effect of amendment No. 91 would be to impose a statutory obligation on a district justice to make a supervision order in certain circumstances.  This would be a complete negation of the judicial discretion and independence vested in the Judiciary by the Constitution.  For that reason I regret I will not be able to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I point out to Deputy Yates <Col N="2257" /> that subsection (6) enables the court to give such direction as it sees fit as to the care and custody of the child pending the determination of an application for a care order.  It seems to me this gives a justice adequate power to secure the safety or welfare of a child pending the outcome of proceedings while not interfering with his or her judicial discretion.  In view of this perhaps Deputy Yates will reconsider the situation and withdraw his amendment. With your permission, Sir, I would like to formally move amendment No. 93.</P>

The existing draft of section 18 (5) which is to be amended by amendment No. 90 provides for the making of a temporary supervision order pending the determination of an application for a care order.  For the sake of clarity it is proposed to move this provision to subsection (6) which deals with the period between the making of an application for a care order and its determination. My two amendments Nos. 94 and 96 provide for this.  It will, therefore, be open to a justice during the period between the making and the determination of an application for a care order to give directions as to the care and custody of a child or to make a temporary supervision order in respect of a child.  I might also mention that these amendments Nos. 94 and 96 give effect to what Deputies Howlin and Ferris were seeking to achieve in their amendment No. 95. Perhaps these Deputies will consider withdrawing their amendment in the light of my amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to what I was alluding to earlier in regard to supervision orders under section 19 (1) (a) and (b).  I believe it is wrong to have the same criteria to put before a court to look for a supervision order as is the case for a care order. In other words, if the health board really believe, as is the language used in paragraphs (a) and (b), that a child is being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused, there should be no question of its getting a supervision order; instead I would say either a barring order or a care order.  Similarly in relation to paragraph (b), the gravity of the charge is such that a supervision order would be too lenient.  Paragraph (c) is lighter in tone and less specific certainly than paragraph (a); the criteria are different. Where under section 18 (1) (a) the child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused, a care order may be sought.  How are a health board to decide whether they are to look under this legislation for a care order or a supervision order, because they are quite different in their import for that child?  I think this ambiguity is bad law and puts the health board in a difficult situation.  The health board could be open to wrong type of representations. They could take a more lenient approach where a stronger approach should apply.  I do not think it is correct that the same criteria should apply to the health board's application for both.  The <Col N="2261" /> fact that they do will create more confusion for the health board and the court, and these are very serious matters.  I ask that the House accept that there be different criteria, and accept the deletion certainly of paragraph (a) whatever about paragraphs (b) and (c).</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Yates's amendment, in accepting amendment No. 98 we have provided that where, on the application of a health board with respect to a child who resides in its area, the court is satisfied that &ldquo;there are reasonable grounds for believing that...&rdquo;.  Is Deputy Yates not closing the door by removing section 19 (1) (a): &ldquo;the child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused&rdquo;?  I agree that looking for a supervision order in the context of that language might be a little incongruous but, even so, would it not be better to leave that language in rather than remove it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the objective of Deputy Yates's amendment because it is clear that where a child is in any way suspected of being vulnerable or at risk a supervision order would be the first line of defence, simply to require that the child be monitored.  It does not take the child out of his home setting; it does not impact on the child directly. Somebody from the health board will be keeping an eye on him and, obviously, there should not be very deep or profound grounds to require this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly under paragraph (c) of section 19 action can be taken if there are grounds to believe that the child's health, development or well-being are likely to be avoidably impaired.  One can move in on those grounds and I suppose there is no great harm in having the other two grounds there.  They are extra and not criteria standing on their own.  If a child had been ill-treated in the past that would be grounds to keep an eye on him even though there might not be anything currently happening.  I do not think it weakens the case although I see the point <Col N="2262" /> Deputy Yates is making, that it might seem to add a level of seriousness to the supervision order which we certainly would not wish to be there.  Quite frankly, I am of two minds about it.  On balance I do not see the necessity to remove those two sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be of the same mind.  Paragraph (a) is specific as is paragraph (b).  They provide respectively for a case where a child is being assaulted on the one hand and where a child has been or is being avoidably impaired or seriously neglected on the other.  As was pointed out by Deputy Howlin, the other provision gives that bit of scope in the event that there is suspicion or, even stronger than that, if there are grounds or, as stated here, reasonable grounds for believing that the child is being impaired. It would be in the interests of the child to have that retained so that it could be presented on the basis that there are reasonable grounds..</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see where there is evidence that the child had been ill-treated in the past there might be a case for monitoring.  I share Deputy Yates' concern that as a result of the words &ldquo;is being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused&rdquo;, which is in the present tense, there should be room for a supervision order.  It might leave it open to a health board to decide that that option would serve the purpose. In view of the seriousness of what might be happening, any loophole could have serious implications.  I can see the usefulness of supervision if something has happened in the past and one wants to make sure it does not occur again.  The fact that the present tense is used leaves us very concerned that a supervision order might be considered an option.  It is one of these dilemmas that we have. Our difficulty is in language.  I share Deputy Yates' concern, particularly as the present tense is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar amendment from Deputy Yates was discussed at the Special Committee.  On that occasion I <Col N="2263" /> put it to Deputy Yates that the effect of the amendment would be to greatly reduce the range of circumstances under which a supervision order could be made. The whole purpose of the supervision order is to provide health boards, and the courts, with an alternative means of safeguarding children short of taking them away from their parents.  Deputy Yates' concern was that a supervision order would not be appropriate where a child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused. However, this concern was based on the section as it stood which required that the justice be satisfied that the child was being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused.</P>
      <P>We have now amended this in amendment No. 98 so that a justice need only be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused.  As a result a supervision order would be available where there is suspicion but not proof of assault, ill-treatment, neglect or sexual abuse.  In the circumstances it is all the more appropriate that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) remain in the section, and I urge the Deputy to reconsider his stand and, perhaps, withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A few points arise out of the debate.  First, it would have been better if amendment No. 98, and my amendment No. 99, had been grouped arising out of the Minister's most recent explanation.  He is arguing now that I should withdraw amendment No. 99 because amendment No. 98 is so good. If we had taken them together it would have been better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I will put the case slightly differently.  Let us say that a Member of this House is defending a parent of a child whom it was alleged he had abused, assaulted, seriously neglected, or sexually abused.  They are very serious charges.  The barrister could say that the Oireachtas made it quite clear that for offences of this gravity it was quite all right to have a supervision order.  He <Col N="2264" /> could say that the Oireachtas provided for that in section 19.  There is the possibility of plea bargaining whereby someone could seek to mitigate the gravity of the offence by saying that the Oireachtas had given the justice the choice of whether to grant a supervision order or a child care order even if he was satisfied that these serious offences were taking place.</P>
    <P>In my early days in this House I remember a very senior Member saying that the purpose of law was to have clarity and certainty so that the courts were not left to make up their own mind.  The law is clear once the circumstances are clearly established by the justice as to what is happening in the case.  We have created, with very good intent, the situation whereby a justice could go either way. He could say he is satisfied that assault is taking place, that abuse is taking place and, therefore, find against the defendant. The next thing that may happen is that the barrister may stand up and tell the justice he has a choice, to grant a supervision order or a care order, and press strongly on him to grant a supervision order.  The child could then return to more of abuse.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the change the Minister has made whereby in one case it has got to be found that these things have taken place and there must be reasonable grounds to believe that is the case, but I do not believe it is going far enough. Section 18 (1) (a) (b) and (c) and section 19 (a) (b) and (c) are identical.  The circumstances where one would get a care order as opposed to a supervision order should be completely different.  A care order is a very serious matter indeed.  I am afraid I have to press this because we could be opening up a Pandora's box.</P>

    <P>This amendment was dealt with in the Special Committee in my absence on 13 March and was withdrawn by Deputy <Col N="2266" /> Fennell.  It deals with whether a supervision order or a care order should be granted.  If the health board apply for a supervision order and evidence is given in the middle of the case that so shocks the justice that he feels the matter should be taken a lot more seriously by the health board, the justice should be given the discretion to go further and grant a care order.  That principle that the judge has discretion has been accepted &mdash; the Minister and other went into detail on this matter.  Perhaps on first sight the health board may not realise the gravity of the case but as new witnesses give evidence under oath, it may be decided that a care order should be granted.</P>

If a health board go to court it would be incumbent on them as the complainant to have evidence that would stand up.  If the court is allowed to decide whether a supervision order or a care order should be made, the real danger is that the health board's case might not be as tight as it should.

      <P>If it appears to a health board during the course of proceedings that the application should have been for a care order, there is nothing to prevent the health board from making such an application.  I do not believe the health board should be given &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;incentive&rdquo;&mdash; an option as to the weight of its evidence.  It is important that the evidence presented to the court in relation to a care order be as tight as possible &mdash; the same applies to a supervision order.  The health board should decide which order to apply for. To give discretion to the justice would <Col N="2267" /> not be wise.  In the interests of clarity and certainty, I strongly urge that the provision be left as it stands in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is intended here is a very serious provision, that if in the course of an application for a supervision order it is clear to the Justice that such an order is inadequate to meet the demands of the case, he should be empowered to take a stronger line and provide a care order.  This would not be in any way letting the health board off the hook in relation to making their case. We often hear of guilty people who got off because the law was framed in such a way that the letter of the law was not followed.  The argument from the Judiciary or those who have notions of being members of the Judiciary seems to be that everything must be compartmentalised and if the exact order is not right you have to punish the applicant &mdash; in this case the health board &mdash; by denying them what appears to the justice to be the correct course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are dealing with here are children, and the only criteria should be what is in the best interests of the child. I support Deputy Yates's contention <Col N="2268" /> that if in the course of an application for a supervision order it becomes clear to the justice that there is abundant evidence that a care order would be more appropriate, that option should be available to him.  It would be appalling if he had to say: &ldquo;I believe that a supervision order is inadequate in this case; if I had my way I would make a care order but unfortunately the legislation prescribes that action&rdquo;.  It would be a shame if that were to happen.  We should allow the justice that measure of discretion.</P>
    <P>Even in the courts, when an application comes before a lower court and the case is more serious than was thought at first, it is possible for the justice to decide it is beyond the competence of the lower court and to refer it to a higher court.  In the same way, if in the course of an application for a supervision order it becomes clear that the gravity of the case merits a stronger order, the justice should have that discretion.  For those reasons I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must concur with Deputy Howlin that legal training makes it comparatively easy to argue the opposite case, as Deputy O'Donoghue has done.  In the previous amendment we argued that certain options should not be available in the case of very serious assault, but we were told that it might damage the case if those options were not left open, and that the care of the child is paramount.  Therefore we reluctantly accepted the argument.  In this case we are proposing that an option should be available, particularly where the health of the child is at risk, and Deputy O'Donoghue knows &mdash; this is why the legal profession continue to flourish &mdash; that nobody goes into court with the evidence so watertight that they are quite sure what the outcome is going to be. The giving of evidence, the teasing out of evidence, the interpretation of that evidence and the case for and against being presented, produces a drama that nobody can take bets on beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Court cases are not open and shut. That is what gives them a sense of drama and even interest.  I would say to the <Col N="2269" /> Minister and to Deputy O'Donoghue that no matter how much evidence a health board may have when applying for a supervision order, it may not always be sufficient.  This is particulary so where the evidence of children may be required, as happens in some court cases.  This is part of the difficulty that arises, as Deputy O'Donoghue is well aware, in the taking and interpreting of evidence where children are concerned.  I appeal to the Minister to make it as open as possible for the protection of the children because the evidence, even with the best will of the health board, might evolve in such a way that a care order would seen to be a safer and more protective way of dealing with it.  If we can leave that option open to the justice it is not alone just thinking of the paramount importance of dealing immediately with the care and protection of the child, it also means that we will not be traipsing back to court with different orders.  Deputies have made this point in regard to other amendments.  That would give an option and protection, particularly in the area of evidence affecting children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If the health board made this order to the court for a specific purpose and if, during the procedure which followed in court, it was found on the evidence that another purpose would be better served at the discretion of the court, naturally we should try to ensure that the legislation would allow for that. It would not be obligatory or restrictive, it would be an additional option, otherwise the court would have to throw out the application before it and request that a further &mdash; and more substantial &mdash; application be made.  In the interim period the child could be the sufferer and in danger because the court could not act without this additional requirement in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a reasonable amendment which would improve the legislation.  Of course nobody wants to railroad the Minister into accepting it, but perhaps he will consider it.  It is an option which would not be too restrictive that he might like to allow to the court.</P>

      <P>The first part of this amendment, which refers to the court having regard to the wishes of the child, is already dealt with in the new section 23 which requires the court to give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child.  As a result, this first part of the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the amendment seems to envisage giving the court power <Col N="2272" /> to make a supervision order even though the health board had not seen fit to apply for one.  I am not sure that this would be a good idea.  As far as I am aware, the general practice in legislation is that where an application is made for a particular type of order, the court may grant that order or, alternatively, an order of lesser significance; generally, however, the court is not permitted to make an order of greater significance than the one sought.  Similarly, in criminal cases, where there is a prosecution for, say, murder, the court can convict on the lesser offence of manslaughter, but not the other way round.</P>
    <P>I see no reason to depart from that general practice here.  Under this Bill, the decision on whether to apply for a care order or a supervision order is vested in the health board.</P>
    <P>In reaching its decision, the board must take into account a wide range of factors, including the nature and severity of the abuse or neglect, and the risk of a recurrence, having regard to the guiding principle laid down in section 3, that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family.</P>
    <P>In deciding to seek a supervision order rather than a care order, a health board will have to satisfy itself that the risk to the child is not such as to necessitate the child's removal from his home and that there is a good relationship between the board's staff and the parents, so that it would be possible to supervise the child at home.  In coming to this conclusion, the board may well have had discussions with the parents, who may accept that their previous conduct in relation to the child left something to be desired and that health board supervision would be helpful for them and for the child.  The parents would be justifiably aggrieved if when the application for a supervision order went to court, the court decided to make a care order instead.  On balance, the decision to seek a care order or a supervision order should remain with the health board.  For those reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I hope the House can understand the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very useful debate on this.  It should be seen in the context of the earlier debate we had on amendments relating to sections 18 and 19 of the Bill. We have already established that there are identical criteria for a health board looking for a care order and a supervision order.  I could easily foresee circumstances in which a health board would get a report of child abuse.  A teacher or a GP might have reported it but the parents might be absolutely adamant that this had not happened, that the allegations were outrageous and totally unfounded and that the health board could not prove it.  Then, in the secrecy of the court, new evidence which was absolutely irrefutable could come forward in relation to a brother or sister, or the parents could break down emotionally in the court and admit everything.  If the circumstances were so serious that it emerged in the court that the future custody of the child would be at serious risk, what the Minister is saying is that they should all walk out of the court and come back another day and open up shop and see how they might look at the whole thing again.  There is the risk that a child could be abducted in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>When I was proposing that a minimum of supervision order be given, when a care order was sought, the other side of the House referred to the utmost respect we have for our justices and indicated that this would not be necessary, that these justices knew what they were about and that we should not restrict them. Now we are being told that justices could not be told to up the ante at all, that it would be wrong to give the justices this power and that in court parents could feel very aggrieved that the justice took a fit of pique and was more liberal than he should have been.  These are the justices for whom they had so much respect earlier on in the evening.</P>

      <P>One must remember that supervision order are new territory, so the Minister's guess is as good as mine. There is no evidence to suggest that supervision orders are clearcut in terms of protecting the welfare of children in regard to these serious criteria.  We should in those exceptional circumstances give a justice the power to make a further order because, as we have established, paragraphs (a) (b) and (c) of sections 18 and 19 are the same.  There is already a grey area.  Because these are the same we should give the justice the power.  I will be pressing this amendment.</P>

      <P>As I said last night, The Workers' Party do not want to favour Unionist's aspirations at the expense of the aspirations of Northern Nationalists but we would challenge the claim that the majority of Northern Ireland Nationalists share in the traditionalistic thinking of Mr. Haughey's party.  Recent surveys have clearly demonstrated that those who put Irish unity at the top of the political agenda are a minority of Northern Nationalists.  The predominant objective is a share of power and justice within the Northern Ireland state, together with an institutionalised reflection of their Irish political and cultural identity.  These are objectives which many Unionists can accept.  Opinion among ordinary Catholics in Northern Ireland has moved beyond the arid territorial nationalism, as expressed by the Taoiseach.  Fianna Fáil appear to be as out of touch with the new realities of Northern Ireland as they are with the new and questioning political culture of the South.  The Ireland which voted for our new President voted for a pluralist and tolerant Ireland.  This is an Ireland which more and more Unionists will learn to respect and trust.</P>
      <P>Our Bill gives the parties in the Dáil the chance to demonstrate that the majority of people in the South feel uncomfortable with the aggressive nationalism embodied in these two Articles.  There are some expressions of nationalism which do and should embarrass any democrat in this House.  There is no need for divisiveness on this issue. Fianna Fáil would do better to follow the realism and moderation of the late Seán Lemass on these questions than the negative and outmoded thinking of their present leader.</P>
      <P>I must say I was bitterly disappointed at the contribution by Deputy Ahern.  He represents a Border county and areas very close to many sites of unbelievable murderous savagery committed by the maniacal Nationalists of the IRA in our name and, by implication, in the name of our Constitution.  He expressed a surprise and, in fact, chided the Protestants of Northern Ireland for not being grateful for our great gesture in removing Article 44 of the Constitution.  He said that they put this concession into their pockets and walked away without even saying thanks. He went on to say that this is exactly what they will do if we amend, as this Bill proposes, Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2279" /> Does Deputy Ahern really believe that the people of the Republic voted as they did to appease Northern Ireland Protestants and that by removing Article 44 they thought we might have a united Ireland quicker?  They did not and anyone who approaches the issue of amending Articles in our Constitution or removing them with the aim of enticing, seducing or fooling Protestants into a united Ireland are being disingenuous and stupid.  Was it not Article 44 which stated that the State recognised the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the Guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens?  Was that not offensive and repugnant to the vast majority of Irish people?  As the people of the Republic voted to remove Article 44 so they should also be given the chance to amend Articles 2 and 3 and remove the territorial claim not just because it is offensive to Northern Ireland Protestants but because it is offensive to us.</P>
    <P>We do not need the clap-trap of Fianna Fáil that the timing is somehow wrong or their style of green politics which, with a wink and a nod, they say to their supporters, &ldquo;we have the Unionists on the run and if we squeeze them a bit more they will be coming in with us any day now and there is no need for The Workers' Party having debates such as this&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The inward looking Taoiseach, his party, and their green nationalist approach to Northern Ireland are out of step with the thinking of the men and women of an emerging modern Ireland. The time is right for such a debate.  What better time could there be for amending our Constitution that at Christmas?  It is a great time to send out the signal that as a country we are awake, alive and happy to move forward into a more understanding pluralist society and world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the argument against this Bill has been ambiguous, contradictory, and full of the same kind of double-think, which underlines Articles 2 and 3 themselves.  The most common argument is that the timing is wrong.  It has been described as &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; by the Taoiseach, &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo; by Deputy Spring and patronisingly put down as &ldquo;poor political judgment&rdquo; by both.  Let us examine the timing argument.</P>
      <P>Almost every single initiative for significant political constitutional or social change here has had to overcome the bad timing criticism.  The introduction of equal pay was postponed, votes at 18 was put off and the introduction of contraception legislation was said to be too soon.</P>
      <P>The bad timing argument is particularly curious in the context of Articles 2 and 3.  The public debate about these Articles has been underway for some time.  Several prominent Members of this House have spoken often and at length about the need to change these Articles. I cannot recall anybody suggesting that these speeches, interviews or supplied scripts, some of which were issued over the last couple of weeks, were badly timed.  Is it being suggested, that after 53 years, to bring the debate into the Dáil Chamber is bad timing while making speeches outside the House on the same subject is not?  What is their understanding of democracy if they disparage the notion of debating in Parliament a topic which is being widely aired in public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most serious charge behind the bad timing argument is that the Bill comes in the middle of the Brooke talks <Col N="2281" /> and that, in some way, a debate here about Articles 2 and 3 is damaging to the talks.  This argument is strange coming from the Taoiseach, since, as Deputy Spring said last week, he has chosen not to keep the party leaders or this House appraised of the talks.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a two-fold argument here.  First, that to raise this issue now is, to quote the Taoiseach, &ldquo;to pre-empt something that may be raised during the negotiations themselves&rdquo; or, to paraphrase Deputy Spring, &ldquo;a concession to the Unionists which may be simply pocketed once it is given&rdquo;, and is, therefore, a bad negotiating tactic.</P>
    <P>This line of thinking implies, first, that our Constitution can be bargained for and, secondly, that the approach to the talks is full of suspicion of the Unionist population whom we constitutionally claim to be part of our nation.  Is this not simply a more sophisticated version of the not-an-inch thinking which has already contributed so much to the turmoil on this island?  Surely it is time to replace the notion of grudging concession with generous gesture?</P>
    <P>Far from pocketing the concession, moderate Unionist opinion has already shown in recent weeks a willingness to respond in kind.  The Taoiseach claimed here last week, that the secretary of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. Chris McGimpsey, had stated on a radio programme that changing Articles 2 and 3 would not matter to Unionist opinion. However, the following morning the same Mr. McGimpsey said on the RTE radio programme &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>I cannot really believe that an amendment of Articles 2 and 3 in the Irish Constitution would alter these. Indeed, to the contrary, it's quite clear that such a message, coming from the Oireachtas to the people of Northern Ireland, particularly the Unionists, would help to facilitate talks, would help set preconditions for a situation wherein we can all work together towards an agreed Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is far from the bad timing argument. This is the first time in 53 years that <Col N="2282" /> these issues have been debated in this House.  Surely it cannot be argued that it is bad timing after that length of time to have a debate about so fundamental an issue in our Constitution?</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to state that this Private Members' Bill, and its timing, are both opportunistic and divisive. The Government are committed to a process which is based on consensus, generosity and reconciliation.  This is the only basis on which a lasting solution can be found to the intractable problem of the partition of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Given the delicate situation in Northern Ireland at the moment one must question the wisdom of introducing this Bill at this time.  The talks between the Irish and British Governments are at a crucial stage.  The Bill, if passed would place these negotiations in grave danger and might well ruin the prospects of initiating a lasting dialogue between all the constitutional parties in all of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I know that the Supreme Court decision in the McGimpsey case, in March of this year, has aroused a certain amount of academic comment on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  This decision declared that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was not in conflict with Articles 2 and 3.  It also highlighted the true sense of Article 29 of the Constitution that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland, except through consent, because of Ireland's devotion to the ideal of peaceful co-operation among nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision reinforced the commitment of successive Irish Governments, as reflected in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that &ldquo;any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent <Col N="2283" /> of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The broad framework of the Government's agenda was outlined to the House last July when the Taoiseach reported on the Government's commitment to developing three sets of relationships, within new structures, that could transcend the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Taoiseach then said, &ldquo;There should be three sets of talks within the same timeframe: (a) internal between the political parties in the North of Ireland; (b) North-South between the political parties in the North and the Irish Government and (c) East-West between the British and Irish Governments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Government's approach, this Bill takes little account of either the political realities of Northern Ireland today or the sensitive political discussions that are going on to bring peace to the whole island.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Spring correctly questioned the political wisdom of those who would initiate a divisive referendum on this issue at this time.  He said that, &ldquo;any campaign, no matter how well intentioned, would stir up fires and passions that could only do damage to the political fabric of this island&rdquo;.  Deputy Spring should follow his own arguments to their logical conclusion and vote against the Bill.  In 1982, John Hume told Dr. Pádraic O'Malley, author of <i>The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today,</i> that such a referendum would not only be divisive, but also destabilising.  Also in 1982, the then Secretary of State, James Prior, stated that repeal of these Articles would not make &ldquo;any fundamental difference&rdquo;. Indeed, I would go further, and say that even a proposed amendment would be offensive to both Unionists and Nationalists.</P>
    <P>Even if only this amendment was put to the people, it would involve the reassertion of the aspiration to unity and the territorial claim <i>per se.</i>  In no way could such a reassertion be seen as a gesture of reconciliation.  Piecemeal amendments of these Articles would only encourage the <Col N="2284" /> polarisation and division that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is designed to transcend.</P>
    <P>There is only one way in which progress can be made and that is through the integrated approach outlined by the Taoiseach last July.  This approach is guided by a concern to build on and extend the framework provided by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to totally reject violence.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement has an important role in further reinforcing constitutional politics on this island.  This proposed Bill would compromise constitutional politics and the agenda which the Government are developing to strengthen this process.  The proposed Bill would have an adverse impact on the views of Northern Nationalists.  We have to be careful not to repeat the circumstances of the early seventies or to give the men of violence any excuse for their own murderous campaign and at the same time do serious damage to the prospects for reconciliation between the two communities in the North.  We have no intention of fuelling violence.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community have a legitimate right to their aspirations.  It is a right which, by extension, public representatives of all parties in this House should support.  Failure to do so will ensure that both parts of the island will drift further apart.</P>
    <P>As the Government seek to transcend the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Taoiseach's approach has been characterised by openness and generosity.  He has been careful to complement his discussions with an open and generous invitation to Unionist leaders to meet him, without pre-conditions, both to hear their concerns at first hand, and to achieve what the Forum report ultimately aspires to: peace on this island.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has also indicated that &ldquo;in the context of some new all-Ireland arrangement&rdquo;, a new constitution would, if necessary, be considered.  To my mind, this is the statesman's approach.  It is an approach that rejects the type of party-political propaganda and opportunism suggested by this Bill.  Instead it proposes an approach to the Northern Ireland <Col N="2285" /> problem that is integrated, sensible and realistic.</P>
    <P>The Border will become increasingly irrelevant with the completion of the Single European Market in 1992. Already business, agricultural, industrial and tourist interests are looking towards the opportunities we can share in the Europe of the nineties.  All the people of Ireland need to work together if we are to survive and prosper in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>Political and economic developments throughout Europe are rendering border divisions less and less important or relevant to every-day life.  This is nowhere more obvious than within the European Community itself where the trend has now become irreversible.</P>
    <P>When the Single Market is finally completed, border controls for intra-Community trade will disappear as will customs checks on travellers purchasing goods in other member states.  In such circumstances, the practical implications of crossing borders for citizens of the EC will be eliminated &mdash; such divisions will increasingly become mere lines on maps.</P>
    <P>This Bill is ill-advised.  A slice-by-slice approach to the Northern problem will serve no one.</P>
    <P>The report of the New Ireland Forum was supported by all the constitutional parties of Irish nationalism.  The forum reiterated that &ldquo;a unitary state&rdquo; should be achieved only &ldquo;by agreement and consent&rdquo;. It also reiterated &ldquo;the irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the Nationalist and Unionist identities&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Forum showed the consensus among us to listen, to change and to accommodate.  The Bill before us seeks to break that broad consensus, and to distract both the Government, and the Irish people, from the broader agenda that alone will bring progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa has tried to make out that there is a consensus for making a change in Articles 2 and 3 in isolation. In fact, the very opposite is the case.  The Labour Party Leader, while giving token support to the Bill, in fact argued strongly and cogently against a referendum, which in the way it was worded could be seen <Col N="2286" /> as writing a Unionist veto into our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The only genuine support Deputy De Rossa has got is from Fine Gael, who have changed their policy on Northern Ireland along with changing their leader. Last March, after the Supreme Court judgment, Fine Gael said that this present discussion should be held in the context of change in Northern Ireland and not in isolation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has been making an extraordinary series of statements on Northern Ireland.  Last weekend he claimed that there was &ldquo;no special relation with any community in Northern Ireland and that our concern must be to remove all claims, all historic dreams&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>He also said, &ldquo;both communities should stop looking over their shoulders to Dublin and to London&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Anglo-Irish Agreement specifically gives the Irish Government a special voice on behalf of Nationalists in Northern Ireland, and there is a shared belief on all sides of this House that Irish unity is a legitimate aim and aspiration.  In his speech Deputy Bruton appears to be not only abandoning and repudiating the historic dream of a United Ireland, but also the entire thinking behind the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night in this House he implicitly accused the SDLP of political immaturity because Northern Nationalists look to Dublin.  Even more extraordinary was his comparison of Northern Ireland with Polish Silesia.  The clear implication of that comparison is that the partition of Ireland should now be cast in concrete for all time, and that Irish unification <Col N="2287" /> should be definitely renounced.  In doing so he expressed himself in terms of his adherence to the two nations philosophy. If this is the spirit in which Fine Gael propose to put the case of amending Articles 2 and 3, it is quite certain that any such referendum would be resoundingly defeated.</P>
    <P>There is no objective basis for objecting to our Constitution, which already incorporates the principle of peaceful agreement in the resolution of international disputes in Articles 29.  Deputy Bruton is quite wrong in saying that Article 29 does not cover the North.  De Valera very carefully saw the question of Northern Ireland as being a dispute with Britain, in other words and international dispute, and that is certainly the way the courts interpret the Constitution today. The Supreme Court was quite adamant that Article 29 on the peaceful settlement of disputes could and should be read in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3.  The Provisional IRA derive no legitimacy from the Constitution.  The only danger is that they might seek to derive legitimacy from attempts to alter Articles 2 and 3 in a manner that would allow them to claim that Irish nationalism had been abandoned by the constitutional parties.</P>
    <P>However, if Unionists have a specific problem in relation to this, let them put it to us directly, when this can be considered in the overall framework of negotiations. It would really be far more satisfactory, if The Workers' Party and Fine Gael, instead of making the Unionist case themselves, were to encourage Unionists to put their case directly to the Irish Government in the context of direct negotiations.  This is the context in which all these matters can be discussed.  They cannot be dealt with in isolation.</P>
    <P>I call on the House to give a clear endorsement of the Government's consensus approach.  I urge the rejection of this narrow, divisive and, in the context of the current talks, insensitive and ill-judged Bill.  I would go further and call on all the parties in this House to return to the consensus approach adopted in the New Ireland Forum, to refrain from <Col N="2288" /> political confrontation on this sensitive issue and to support the Government in their efforts to bring lasting peace and stability to the whole island of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats, since their foundation almost five years ago, have clearly and unequivocally called for the development of a new, relevant and inclusive relationship between the Unionist and Nationalist communities on this island.  To us the establishment of peace, tolerance and openness precedes theoretical considerations such as sovereignty, the concept of a nation-state or whatever.  That is why we supported the Anglo-Irish Agreement from our inception, not because it was the end point of political efforts but because it offered a starting point for progress.</P>
      <P>Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 Constitution are clearly unhelpful and incompatible from a political point of view with the emergence of tolerance, peace and concord in Northern Ireland.  This much was even apparent to the all-party committee which reviewed the Constitution in 1967.  To those who feel that 1967 was a long time ago, politically let me point out that it was a time of optimism, openness and confidence in our identity and in our future.  It was also only a year after the 1966 golden jubilee celebrations of the 1916 Rising.  It is worth pointing out that the then all party committee was established in August 1966 and presented their final report in December 1967.  It is appropriate to recall the personnel of that committee which agreed that Articles 2 and 3 needed to be revised.  They were: Deputies George Colley, David Andrews, Don Davern, Seán Dunne, Denis Jones, T.F. O'Higgins, Gerard Sweetman, Jim Tully and, I am delighted to say, my now Progressive Democrat colleague, Robert Molloy along with Senators Jim Dooge, Michael O'Kennedy and Eoin Ryan.  I might add that Seán Lemass joined the committee in November 1966 when he retired as Taoiseach and played a full part in their proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> Nothing has happened in the ensuing 23 years to invalidate the consensus which then existed among all the parties in this House to change Articles 2 and 3.  Have 20 years of murder, carnage, torture, mutilation and distruction swept away the logic or the merit of changing Articles 2 and 3?  Does the political cause of peace demand less generosity or less trust than that offered by Lemass and O'Neill in that period of hope and optimism in the mid-sixties?</P>
    <P>I want to state clearly and uneqivocally that Articles 2 and 3, as currently framed, are of no use to nationalism, or to Nationalists, North or South, because they hinder peace and reconciliation with the Unionist tradition on this island. Before considering how they should be revised it is appropriate to review the Articles in their historical context.  The plebiscite which approved them was carried by a narrow majority of voters who turned out to vote on the 1937 Constitution. Only 38.6 per cent of the electorate of the then Free State voted in favour; 29.6 per cent voted against and 31.8 per cent abstained or spoiled their votes.  Nobody in Northern Ireland was consulted.</P>
    <P>Yet this is the mandate offered for a claim of right made in the name of the people of Ireland to the entirety of the island.  Article 3 speaks of &ldquo;the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory&rdquo;. What right has this House at the level of commonsense, morality or international law to exercise jurisdiction over Northern Ireland?  Such jurisdiction as we have can only be exercised in accordance with the Constitution.  What right have I, or we, to tell the people of Northern Ireland that they may not have divorce because 38.6 per cent of the electorate of the Irish Free State ordained it so in 1937?  We have no such right, politically, historically or legally.  The pretensions of Article 3 are as threadbare as they are absurd.</P>
    <P>It is well known that Ireland withheld <Col N="2290" /> submission to the full compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in The Hague precisely because the &ldquo;claim of right&rdquo; made in 1937 would have been exposed, to our embarrassment, as an international law nullity.</P>
    <P>Devoid as they are of any standing in the order of international political affairs or international law, we must face the fact, however, that Articles 2 and 3, as framed, are still part of the Constitution of this State.  They have been considered by our courts most recently in the McGimpsey case.  It has been said that &ldquo;the Constitution means what the Supreme Court says it means&rdquo;.  This is true subject to the rider &ldquo;except when the people decide otherwise&rdquo;.  In that judgment the Supreme Court held that &ldquo;the reintegration of the National Territory is a Constitutional imperative&rdquo;, and that Article 2 &ldquo;consists of the declaration of the extent of the National Territory as a claim of legal right&rdquo;.  If it is a claim of legal right, then whatever the Supreme Court may say about it, it only exists in Irish law.  It does not exist in any real sense in the international order, legal or political.</P>
    <P>The majority of Deputies and parties in this House clearly support a Constitution in which as presently constructed Articles 2 and 3 have no place. The Progressive Democrats have consistently argued for the inclusion in the Irish Constitution of an aspiration to unity based on the principle of consent. That principle of consent is enshrined in Article one of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which makes clear there can be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority there.  Surely this agreement, signed, ratified and honoured by the Irish Government, being just five years old, is a more positive, realistic and honest statement of the relationship between the Republic and Northern Ireland than the pronouncements of 53 years ago?</P>
    <P>The issue is no longer whether Articles 2 and 3 should remain.  The majority of the people want them amended, as was demonstrated by the findings of an opinion poll in a paper on Sunday last. <Col N="2291" /> There the response was 53 per cent for amending them, 29 per cent against and 18 per cent undecided.  Moreover &mdash; and perhaps most importantly &mdash; there was a majority for amending them among the supporters of all the political parties.  I find that particularly heartening.</P>
    <P>The issue therefore, and a very real one it is, is how Articles 2 and 3 should be amended.  This Bill, as has been pointed out by other speakers, is not as well drafted as it might have been but, of course, textual problems can always be rectified.</P>
    <P>The real decision which most people in this House seem reluctant to face practically is how we set about constitutional reform.  Do we, as this Bill suggests, embark on a long series of single issue referenda on different amendments to the Constitution?  Or should we not put before the people a reworked Constitution which retains all that is good in the present corpus of constitutional law, but also tackles the many grave constitutional problems which exist, including the matter of Articles 2 and 3?</P>
    <P>I and the Progressive Democrats are emphatically of the view that the latter course is the only practical way to deal with the many constitutional reforms that are needed.  For instance, there is an urgent need to amend the Constitution still further to deal with the process of European Community intgeration. These are conventions, including a European Patents Convention, for instance, and other Treaty of Rome changes which are likely to follow, which Ireland cannot ratify without further referenda.  The Progressive Democrats pointed this out in the context of the Dáil debate on the Single European Act in 1987, and underlined our earnestness by insisting on a Dáil division to make our point.  Alas, we were ignored.</P>
    <P>But this House and the various parties here cannot go on ignoring the overwhelming case for a radically reworked Constitution.  Apart from dealing with Articles 2 and 3 and the constitutional prohibition on divorce, the Constitution needs change in the areas of European <Col N="2292" /> Integration; equality for women; personal rights; the role of the Seanad; the structure of the courts; the role of the Presidency; the rights of children; the reference to capital punishment and the revision of constituencies.</P>
    <P>These, and many other improvements and amendments ought to be made, but we cannot embark on a decade of single issue referenda.  It would be far better to achieve an all-party consensus than to venture on single issue alterations, which would be divisive, massively time consuming of the whole political process and the effective operation of Government, and, on some issues, would also be doomed to fail, thereby setting back the overall cause of reform.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party deserve our thanks for bringing this issue to the floor of this House.  But I am renewing my party's appeal to them not to push the issue to a formal division of the Dáil this evening. I have made crystal clear that the Progressive Democrats fully support the principle of changing Articles 2 and 3. Incidentally, I note, of course, that The Workers' Party do not propose dropping the Articles entirely.  I regret that some speakers in this debate have confused and misrepresented the issue by implying that the Bill before us is one that proposed dropping Articles 2 and 3 outright.</P>
    <P>I believe that all Irish Nationalists in the Republic and in Northern Ireland are fully entitled to aspire to some form of unification of all the people on this small island.  The process of unification is proceeding apace anyway as the Republic, along with Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom, and the other member states of the EC pool their sovereignty in the creation of a united Europe.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are not supporting this Bill tonight because we sincerely believe that if this single issue referenda format was facilitated it would be hugely divisive to the country and would afford the Provisional IRA/Sinn Féin movement a heaven-sent opportunity to pose as the spurious defenders of Irish nationalism not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the whole island.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2293" /> My goodness, if the issue can be misrepresented even here in the relative calm and quiet of the Dáil debating Chamber as amounting to an abandonment of Irish nationalism, how wild, emotive and even violent would this issue become if taken to the country in its present form?  Such a referendum campaign would unleash tribal bitterness, misunderstandings and divisions that would make the elusive quest for peace in Northern Ireland even less attainable.</P>
    <P>It is surely obvious too that undertaking such a referendum could only stand a real chance of success if it had the fullest and broadest level of endorsement and support going out from this House.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I have restated my profound belief and that of the whole Progressive Democrats Party that amending Articles 2 and 3 should be a part of a comprehensive updating of the whole Constitution.</P>
    <P>I note that Deputy De Rossa said last week that this could take ten or even 15 years.  I do not accept that this would be the case.  Remember the comprehensive 1967 review was completed in just over a year.  I have called for such an all-party constitutional review to be set up quickly with expert backing, to report on a comprehensive review of the Constitution with a one year deadline.  It has been done before; it can be done again.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the irony of the stance of some of the other parties supporting this Bill is an acceptance that the matter does need far more comprehensive consideration. For instance, I note that Deputy Bruton last night called for a White Paper on the matter.  We would then have a White Paper on divorce, another White Paper on Articles 2 and 3 and, no doubt, more White Papers on each and every other constitutional difficulty that would arise.</P>
    <P>I believe that if all other parties are sincere and committed to constitutional reform on these and other issues, they should acknowledge that the course of action proposed by the Progressive Democrats of comprehensive review leading to reform on an all-party committee basis, with a 12 month deadline, is the best way forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> In the negotiations on the formation of the present Coalition Government, the Progressive Democrats were unsuccessful in having this proposal agreed, but we are continuing to promote it and I believe that we can make headway on it, especially in the renewed and welcome climate of political reappraisal that is going on in all the other parties of this House.  The Progressive Democrats were the catalyst for all this reappraisal in our five short years and we heartily welcome the spirit of political renewal and reassessment now sweeping the land.</P>
    <P>I also believe that given the sensitive and delicate stage of the Brooke initiative in the North, which this Government are so anxious to facilitate and see flower into a meaningful peace process, the timing of this Bill is wrong.  I say that not because I believe, as apparently does Deputy Spring and perhaps others, that any change in Articles 2 and 3 should be regarded as some kind of concession to be bartered in peace talks with Unionists. Articles 2 and 3 should be revised because we, the citizens of the Irish Republic, want them changed to reflect our real aspirations as being peaceful in intent and to be achieved only by consent, and not as some crude bartering exercise with the Unionist community of Northern Ireland.  I believe that an all-party constitutional review process would unite this House and the country for constitutional change, and would deliver change.  I believe that the piecemeal approach will fail in a chorus of recrimination, divisiveness and, maybe, even worse.  The Progressive Democrats believe in constitutional change of a comprehensive and sustainable kind.  We believe our approach is the obvious course for those who believe in change rather than in appearing to want change.</P>
    <P>If I thought for a moment that supporting this Bill was the way to ensure the reform of Articles 2 and 3 and save lives, I would vote for it, but convinced as I am that it is not opportune on its own, that it would probably set the country back and could end in divisive failure, I cannot honestly indicate support for the Bill.  Failure to deliver a <Col N="2295" /> change in Articles 2 and 3 in a referendum would be a disastrous setback for peace and a licence for violence and hatred.</P>
    <P>This Bill and any other single issue Bill on major constitutional issues is not the way forward.  I call on this House to unite in genuine constitutional reform.  I seek the building of a political consensus in this House which alone will deliver major constitutional reform.</P>
    <P>Let us amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, but let us do the work in a way that ensures success.  Let us all sit down together to draw up a constitutional document that reflects the consensus of Irish constitutional thought, rather than stitch, darn and patch a Constitution which in many respects is out-dated and overtaken by events like the emerging United Europe.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the people want this House to bring forward proposals for change which reflect a national consensus. I have no doubt that they want us to work to build that consensus.  Words are cheap; work is hard.  This Bill is not the way forward; it could well be the way backwards.  Its failure in a referendum would cost lives and set back hopes.  Success in a referendum will only emerge from a process built, as far as can be done, on consensus.  Let us all begin to work for that now.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, and that of the House I would like to share my time with Deputy Paddy Harte and Deputy Alan Dukes.  I thank them for this arrangement, though it means, unfortunately, that we have only ten minutes each.  Let me say also that I regret I did not hear a number of the speeches made earlier, particularly yesterday evening because of my attendance at a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Group which was, of course, a priority.  Therefore, I will have to stick to a few fundamental points and seek another opportunity to put on record certain sentiments which I, as someone with experience of Northern Ireland, believe I ought to put on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our total detestation of violence and <Col N="2296" /> our rejection of it as a means of achieving political objectives cannot be restated too often.  This debate has provided a welcome opportunity for all of us to put on the record again our total commitment to the principle of consent as the bedrock of our policy in relation to the reunification of our country.  I have long experience which I think has thumped some realism into me.</P>
    <P>I have a long held view on Articles 2 and 3 which membership of this House or, indeed, my occupation of these benches has not changed.  I do not believe that any attempt to remove or even to change Articles 2 and 3 will be successful without the support of Fianna Fáil.  If &ldquo;core values&rdquo; mean anything any longer, these sections of de Valera's Constitution must represent that tradition and realism dictates they be handled with acute sensitivity, particularly when there is another way.</P>
    <P>I have on a number of occasions in the House sought the agreement of the Taoiseach to the proposition that if the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland in conjunction with the Irish and British Governments were to reach agreement and if that package of agreement were to be endorsed by the people in a referendum, then such endorsement would have fundamental implications for Articles 2 and 3.  I have been encouraged by the response of the Taoiseach to believe that this proposal could represent a possible agreed way forward.  If I am right in this, and I believe I am, then all our energies ought to be focused on creating the conditions whereby the talking process can begin by getting the parties to the conference table as quickly as possible.  I hope that will happen and that no excuses will be made or no form of words created or drawn up which will prevent that happening at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Many Unionists have a strong and sincere belief that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution encourage the IRA and a real anger at what they see as unwarranted claims on the land in which they live.  Many Nationalists, on the other hand, see the Articles as a strong <Col N="2297" /> assertion of their right to nationhood and their guarantee that their birthright as Irish men and Irish women will be fully recognised.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Byrne this evening refer to the fact that many Northern Nationalists seem to be less in favour of the unity of the country than they used to be.  There is some support in opinion polls for such an assertion.  Of course, a great part of this is because of the sickening brutalities of the Provisional IRA. I believe that if that brutal, self-defeating campaign were to end, the process to which Deputy Byrne has referred also would end.  I do not think, however, that any opinion polls of such nature or any clear rejection of the Provisional IRA should obscure one point, that Northern Nationalists are proud of their identity as Irish men and Irish women.  They have fought hard to retain that identity as Irish people, and let us make that perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that from the Fianna Fáil benches there has been a recognition of the place of Northern Nationalists, that they have had to fight for recognition, that they have had to fight for survival and that they have had to fight in order to have their identity as Irish people recognised.</P>
    <P>However, I wonder if there is recognition over there of the extent to which certain remarks made by a Government Minister have caused anger and resentment among Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  I refer in particular to the remarks of the Minister for Justice when he regretted the fact that &ldquo;Alan Dukes had to go to Tyrone to find a candidate for the presidential election&rdquo;.  If Deputy Dukes had had to go to Donegal to find a candidate, or if the Fine Gael candidate had been from Galway, or from Cork or from Kerry, all places geographically more distant from Dublin than Tyrone, I wonder if such a remark would have been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs had alighted from a helicopter at Stormont Castle to negotiate with the British Secretary of State.  The following day I happened to be <Col N="2298" /> in Dungannon and Coalisland in Tyrone when a number of people told me how much they were angered by the fact that those remarks had been made, and they wondered how the Minister for Justice could negotiate with the British Secretary of State for their rights as full Irishmen in circumstances where the Minister for Justice seemed to accept that Northern Nationalists were less than full Irish people.  It was, therefore, with particular interest that I listened to the comments from the opposite bench in relation to this.  I could, I suppose, be pardoned for having a certain cynicism because of those remarks.</P>
    <P>Both Nationalists and Unionists have an equal right to freely work towards the achievement of their aspirations and the removal of their fears.  An agreement in which they clearly concur would clearly be the best way to ensure their objectives. I will be availing of the opportunity in the vote tonight to put on record in this House my total commitment to the principle of consent as the only basis for any policy for changing the present constitutional position of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in supporting the amendment of Articles 2 and 3.  In doing so let me say that Articles 2 and 3 should be read in conjunction with Article 1. Article I defines not the Catholic Irish nation nor the Protestant Irish nation but the Irish nation.  It also states quite clearly to foreign governments and Westminster that we, the Irish people, want the right to govern this island and develop a relationship with other governments. Article 2 merely states the geographical territory of Ireland.  Article 3 states that until such time as there is a uniting of Irish people then laws made in this House will be suspended, and will not extend to Northern Ireland which means we do not claim jurisdiction over the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with Articles 1, 2 and 3 as they appear in black and white. Neither would anyone else, if the entire country was Catholic.  In that case there would be nothing wrong in having a Catholic ethos.  We do not, however, have an entirely Catholic nation but one which is <Col N="2299" /> 25 per cent Protestant, and that is not the fault of Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Attitudes in this island have destroyed the Constitution.  It is amazing that the party that introduced the 1937 Constitution, that campaigned to have it enacted, have not used it to cross the cultural divide in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would not like to read my script out against the clock, it would be difficult to do so anyway so I will try to paraphrase the thoughts in it.  I want to say clearly to the House that Fianna Fáil have, all the time, played the Catholic card.  During the referenda of the eighties they brought out the Catholic flag.  They were against divorce, and they wanted to amend the Constitution to prohibit abortion, not because they were good Catholics but because they wanted to get votes.  In the recent presidential election, as soon as Mary Robinson took the lead and was seen as a possible President they said she was in favour of abortion, in favour of divorce, in favour of contraception and of course, below the surface, there were rumours that she and her husband were not living together, all spread by Fianna Fáil.  Did they do this because they were good Catholics?  Not at all; it was not because they were good Catholics but because they wanted to collect votes to stay in power.</P>
    <P>Their priority has always been to stay in power, not the creation of an Irish nation.  They have been small-minded in their approach.  They cannot understand that there is value in the Protestant ethic in the North.  If we were honest with ourselves we would stop playing the Nationalist-Republican / Unionist-Loyalist cards.  They are only valid to the point that Catholics are against British Government policy in Northern Ireland and Protestants are in favour of it.  To that degree Catholics are anti-British, and only to that degree.  To that degree Protestants are pro-British, and only to that degree.</P>
    <P>If tomorrow morning, the British Government were to change their policy and favour Irish unity, then I believe the people who are now anti-British would <Col N="2300" /> be pro-British and the people who are pro-British would be anti-British.  Until the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, the Protestants in the North believed the British Government was in their corner and was their guarantor, but the Anglo-Irish Agreement made the British neutral, maybe not as neutral as the Catholics would like them to be and maybe more neutral than the Protestants wanted them to be, but neutral.  That has been the objection the Protestant community have to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and nothing else.</P>
    <P>When Mr. de Valera set out in 1937, and I accuse the Fianna Fáil Party of this, to set up a Fianna Fáil Party he tried to identify what Catholic Ireland would respond to politically.  He dressed up his crusade and called it republicanism as if they were all little republicans, when we know they were all intolerant little Catholics. If that picture is hard to see then just look north of the Border.</P>

      <P>I have given you fairly wide latitude.  Could you confine your contribution to Articles 2 and 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about Articles 2 and 3.  If we find it hard to understand that we should look at what Ian Paisley does in the North.  Nobody can identify what Protestants stand for in the North. Nobody articulates the thoughts or the fears of the Protestants better than Ian Paisley, but he calls it Democratic Unionism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 have become a bashing bowl in the political arena here.  People have made up their minds as to what they are about.  The Protestants see them as a threat not because of the wording but because of the structures that Fianna Fáil in particular have put on Irish society. The Fianna Fáil Party have misinterpreted the meaning of Articles 1, 2 and 3.  They have sold the idea that they are in favour of a Catholic-Nationalist-Republican Ireland, the hyphenated Irish, this new breed, the super-Irish, and if anyone speaks like The Workers' Party, the Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party or <Col N="2301" /> any of any other independent they are in some way inferior.  Unless you beat the drum and stick out your Republican chest, you are in some way an inferior Irish person.</P>
    <P>Who in their wildest dreams can imagine any Protestant in the North of Ireland wanting to join this State at this time?  Is anybody mad enough to think that a Catholic in the North of Ireland wants to join this State at this time?  After 70 years of native Government is that not an indictment of this House and of the Fianna Fáil Party who are the major party in this country and who therefore have a greater obligation than any other party to find solutions to the problems by moving to middle ground?</P>
    <P>Bishop Cahal Daly presides over the Catholic Hierarchy at Maynooth and the Catholic hierarchy recognise that marriages performed in the Catholic Church can be annulled and that the partners to that marriage can be remarried within the Catholic Church, but the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, presiding over the Fianna Fáil Party cannot see that.  Is it because Fianna Fáil are good Catholics or is it just another manoeuvre on how to collect votes?  I will leave that to the House to decide.  However, I am encouraged by the voices of the newer members of Fianna Fáil.  I sincerely hope they can bring their party into the last decade of the 20th Century because unless we change our attitudes in this House, and in this part of Ireland unless we realise there are two traditions living on this island, unless we can create structures whereby both traditions can find peace and harmony, our contribution is not to peace and harmony but to the continuation of violence.  Peace is about far more than asking the paramilitaries to lay down their guns, it is about far more than condemning them for the violence of which they are guilty.  Peace is about finding direction to middle ground, not about waving flags or wondering how you will get votes.  I want the Fianna Fáil Party to have the courage to come out and say: &ldquo;This is the kind of Ireland we want the Protestants of the North to live in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2302" /> I am sick to the teeth, after 20 years of trying to understand what is happening on this island, after 2,500 people have been murdered and about 40,000 people maimed, listening to armchair generals telling us about what should happen.  I want to see an Ireland at peace and that can only be brought about by people having the courage to have regard to the views of those on the other side.  Peace will not come by way of waving flags and making ourselves believe that because we have been brought up Catholics the only valid opinion is that held by Catholics or that the only valid political opinion is one based on the Catholic ethos.  The same criticism applies to the Protestant North in that they, too, have a monistic attitude.</P>
    <P>I am continually annoyed listening to people portraying themselves as Republicans and Nationalists, Loyalists and Unionists instead of all of us merely being Irish.  We are what we are because of our up-bringing.  We who are Catholics will think as Catholics and they who are Protestants will think as Protestants.  No one can deny that the religious divide in Ireland is the same line which politically separates us.  None of us can deny that there is a religious dimension to all of this and that the Churches have a very major part to play.  Politicians are impotent without the input of the clergy of all denominations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill seems to be to make a series of specific statements or to include a series of specific statements in our Constitution. One of them is that we seek the unity of Ireland and of the Irish people by consent, and by consent only.  Another is that until that consent has been expressed we do not claim jurisdiction over anything beyond the Twenty-Six County State.  Another statement intended by this Bill is that somehow we assure Nationalists in Northern Ireland that we continue to identify with their needs. Another statement the Bill seems to want to make is that we want to assure Unionists in Northern Ireland that we have no aggressive intent, either politically or in any other sense, towards them.  Finally it <Col N="2303" /> seems to me having listened to the debate, that the Bill is intended in some unidentified way to demolish any mandate the Provisional IRA may claim to have.</P>
      <P>I agree with every one of those statements and I wish they had all been made more clearly, more unambiguously and more definitely by Members of this House and by our whole Oireachtas than has been the case up to now.  I believe we need to do much more than that.  There may be other nuances of this Bill or of this debate that I have missed and I think I could be forgiven for having missed them because the debate up to now has been somewhat confused and has been characterised by a good deal of posturing and shadow-boxing.</P>
      <P>The sponsors of this Bill, The Workers' Party, refused to accept the Fine Gael proposal during the recent Presidential election campaign for a peace pledge. Yet they are now asking us in effect to vote for a Bill which would insert a peace pledge in our Constitution.  I am glad we have seen a move towards that peace pledge.  The Labour Party, too, refused to go along with that peace pledge during the Presidential election.  Yet Deputy Spring now says that he will support the Bill on Second Stage but goes on to say that he would obstruct the Bill on any further Stage.  The Progressive Democrats have indicated that they are in favour of changing Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution but, having said that, they run off to shelter behind their absurd contention that nothing in the Constitution should be changed unless everything is being changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Single issue referendums, we are told, are divisive and counter-productive. What in God's name would we have to say then about a multi-issue referendum? It is absured to pretend that our Constitution is a seamless web and that nothing can be changed unless everything is changed.  It may well be that in any examination of any part of the Constitution we will find that one change gives rise to several more, but let us not fall for this absurd pretence that we <Col N="2304" /> change nothing unless everything is being changed because that is not real, it is not practical.  Fianna Fáil, as usual, are trying to be all things to all men in this debate, but end up being not very much of anything.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed at several points during this debate that the proposed referendum will be divisive, and that is seen as something undesirable.  Should it be?  Should politicians &mdash; especially politicians &mdash; run away from political debate because it shows there are divisions between them?  If there are differences of political views on fundamental issues should we not bring them into the open, examine them and why they exist?  Should we not try to resolve them instead of running away from a debate simply because it would show that there is a difference of view and divisions between us?</P>
    <P>Almost any political debate, by definition, is divisive; we would not have a debate if there were not divisions.  I was glad to hear some Members of this House making the point that, if we change our Constitution in any respect, we should change it because we believe the change being proposed is intrinsically worthwhile, has value for us and because the change reflects something that we want to put into effect and include in our Constitution. If we change our Constitution let us change it because it is the right thing to do.  Let us not make a change in our Constitution because it constitutes part of a bargain with somebody else.  I have heard the proposal that we should bargain with pieces of our Constitution. It was proposed to me that we should bargain with the ban on divorce in our Constitution in relation to Northern Ireland.  I reject that.</P>
    <P>It is proposed here that we should bargain with a piece of our Constitution in the context of talks about the political future of Northern Ireland.  I reject that. If we change our Constitution it should be because we fundamentally believe that the change is required, justified and in the interests of the people whom we represent and whom we want to serve.  This <Col N="2305" /> issue in any case will not come to a referendum on foot of this Bill.  It is clear that the Government will vote against the Bill.  The divisions that have been pointed out in this debate will persist and that, in itself, makes my point that we should not run away from an argument because it is divisive.  This House is divisive because there are different views on the issues involved; those differences are deepseated and important and we will not resolve them unless we bring them out in the open and debate them.</P>
    <P>A debate on the issue before us is largely irrelevant, that is not to say that I believe the Constitution should not be changed; it must be changed and I hope it will be this is not the way to do it and this is not the time to make the kind of change proposed.  We could &mdash; and should &mdash; have made such a change, or something approaching it, some years ago but when the New Ireland Forum began its work, the framework had changed and it changed still more during the discussions that led to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Indeed the Agreement itself made it very clear, in its very first Article, that consent must underlie any constitutional change in Northern Ireland. From the moment that the New Ireland Forum talks began a focus only on Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution became irrelevant. I will come back to that.</P>
    <P>I was glad that Deputy Dermot Ahern recognised &mdash; and went so far as to claim credit for &mdash; the fact that all the process about which I spoke, the New Ireland Forum and the talks which led up to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Agreement itself, followed from something that the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, did in 1980.  In many ways, it is one of the tragedies of the recent political history of this country that he has not had the imagination to take credit for one of the very few imaginative things he has done in the last decade in the politics of this country.  Unfortunately, Deputy Ahern, who was making an honourable statement, made it for the wrong reasons, he did so in order to try to say that Fianna Fáil do not need to go along with any thinking of the kind that has been brought <Col N="2306" /> out here because they have all the answers, but they are the same old ones which have not worked for the last 70 years.</P>
    <P>The New Ireland Forum &mdash; and everything that followed it &mdash; has put this subject into a totally different context.  We do not need a debate on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution; we need instead to focus our minds on what might be our contribution to setting an agenda for substantive talks on new, political arrangements in Northern Ireland.  We should be prepared to say now, with total conviction, that we will be ready to put before the people proposals for any changes in our Constitution and laws which may be rendered necessary by the agreed outcome of those substantive talks.  It is clear to anybody who has ears to hear and eyes to see that, if substantive talks take place and produce a conclusion which all the parties in those talks can agree to and work with and for, it will inevitably require changes in our Constitution the laws.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to say, not simply that we think this might require us to change Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution, but that we are prepared to make whatever other changes in our Constitution will be required.  That presents us with a far bigger political challenge and makes a far greater demand on our wisdom and commitment to fundamental, civil and human rights on this island, North and South, than the proposal before us.  We will not bind the Government to any of this.  Let us not be afraid in this House to say what is needed in relation to those substantive talks.  We want to see political structures in Northern Ireland that involve all the people in Northern Ireland in shaping their own destinies.</P>

We need to state that that is what we want to see as the <Col N="2307" /> objective of those talks, not to prescribe a solution but to say that that is the objective.  The Nationalists in Northern Ireland feel that very keenly and, let us be clear about it, Unionists in Northern Ireland need to be involved in a real sense in directing their own community to a far greater extent than they can now do, given the political vacuum that exists there.  Let us, for God's sake, learn the lesson in this House that over 70 years, talk about ultimate ideal solutions has not worked.  The only thing that has made any difference in Northern Ireland &mdash; and it has been little enough in all conscience over that time &mdash; has been to look at practical steps which can be taken and which will have a political effect.</P>
      <P>We need to forget the old jingoistic formulae.  They do not work and they have never worked.  We need to work for real and meaningful involvement for people in Northern Ireland in the direction of the society in which they live. Until that has been achieved it is pointless to harangue the people of Northern Ireland, Nationalists or Unionists, about any further objectives or ideals.  They are better placed than anybody else to go about the business of deciding which choices a reconciled community, at peace with itself, will make its political future.</P>
      <P>There has been some debate here whether a decision that we might make, one way or the other, about the proposal before us would change the minds of the Provisional IRA.  I do not think that any view we take about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution &mdash; or any other Article &mdash; will make a difference to them.  They work to a different agenda which does not respect any Constitution.  Let that not be a reason for us to make any particular decision in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed change is not really relevant to the framework of today.  We need more.  The only reason I will vote in favour of what is being proposed is to signal that that is the direction in which we want to point.  I hope this House has the opportunity of saying how much further than that our ambitions go for Nationalists in Northern Ireland, for <Col N="2308" /> Unionists in Northern Ireland and for the people of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My view and the view of my party is that Articles 2 and 3 are part of the overall equation and that they should be dealt with in the context of a new agreement that would transcend the present Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The timing of this Bill is unfortunate given that we have the Brooke initiative, and irresponsible to a degree, because we have had months of exhausting and at times frustrating deliberations between all parties in a desperate attempt to try to get them to the table.  There is a general view that if we can get all parties to the table that in itself would herald a new era in relationships between Ireland and Britain, between North and South and between Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland.  In that context it is disappointing that The Workers' Party should put forward their amendment now.</P>
      <P>There is a very fundamental flaw with the process in that essentially we have here southern politicians endeavouring to decide for Unionist politicians what they should decide for themselves.  I acknowledge that Deputy McCartan has said they are open to amending the wording, but there is no guarantee that the wording put forward by The Workers' Party would be acceptable to the Unionists. It still retains the territorial integrity of the State as being the entire island, and so forth.  Deputy McCartan said that we should all get together and be open to amendments.  Is not that continuing and compounding the original flaw because there is a vital participant absent from that process, namely, the Unionists? We should allow them to come into the scene and give their views and opinions as to what new Constitution they would like to see in a new Ireland.  It is commonsense to enter into that process in the context of a new agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The talks are about a new agreement that would transcend the Anglo-Irish Agreement because it is not acceptable to Unionists.  It stands to reason that anything that may emerge from the Brooke <Col N="2309" /> initiative would have to be in the context of a new agreement that embraces the three sets of relationships &mdash; between Ireland and Britain, between North and South and between Unionists and Nationalists.  In the context of the Brooke initiative Articles 2 and 3 of our constitution should be debated and resolved.</P>
    <P>At the outset of the debate Deputy De Rossa contended that the Provisional IRA used Articles 2 and 3 as a mandate. That is erroneous.  The IRA do not invoke Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution as a mandate for their campaign of violence.  They invariably refer to the British presence or historically claim their mandate from the 1918 general election. I take Deputy Dukes' point that they will seek new mandates as we rid them of older mandates.  The only way we can outlaw the Provo campaign is in terms of having an all Ireland referendum on any new agreement that might emerge from the Brooke initiative.  That would once and for all put to bed the historical argument of the 1918 general election used by the IRA as a mandate for their activity.  Any attempts before such an agreement to amend Articles 2 and 3 will give a tremendous fillip to provisional Sinn Féin not only in Northern Ireland but in Southern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If one analyses the political progress of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland and how they have garnered support and got people elected to various fora, one will see that they succeeded on a number of occasions because of bungling by the British Government in relation to the H-block and so on.  They manage to single out issues and galvanise support around issues that have a broad degree of support among the general public.  I contend that a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 would give Provisional Sinn Féin a wonderful rallying point on which to focus and on which to base a political campaign in Southern Ireland.  To date they have failed to make any serious electoral inroads in the Republic and an amendment to these Articles would give them a political base.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte should refer to more <Col N="2310" /> recent bibliography on the Irish Constitution and he might take a more balanced view on it.  In fairness, Mr. de Valera was not being confrontational in the Irish Constitution of 1937.  He was in many ways being conciliatory and he had a problem in Southern Ireland.  Articles 2 and 3 were in many ways trying to rehabilitate people who up to 1937 had a fundamental question about the legitimacy of the Irish Free State.  Mr. de Valera's motivation was genuine.</P>

      <P>Mr. de Valera was trying to bring people back.  It could be argued that Articles 2 and 3 were an instrument for outlawing violence in Southern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The implications for the Northern Nationalist community of any attempt to amend Articles 2 and 3 should not be understated.  There is a considerable degree of alienation among considerable numbers of Nationalists from the South. There has been for quite a long time and it would be very unfair of us to understate that reality.  We would increase that alienation further if we were to go unilaterally in the direction in which The Workers' Party wish to go.</P>

      <P>In relation to Deputy Dukes' remark regarding the peace pledge, Deputy Dukes is misinformed. The Workers' Party were not approached by the Fine Gael Party to support a peace pledge but we were asked at a Press conference if we supported it and we said we did but that it was not for us to commit the candidate we were supporting at that time to such a pledge. In fact, that candidate in negotiations with the Fine Gael candidate, did subsequently agree to that pledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all those who participated in the debate.  In my opening speech I urged that the debate should be conducted in a calm manner, and Deputies generally responded in a positive manner to this appeal.  However, my appeal for a rational debate was largely ignored by those who opposed our proposal.  I must <Col N="2311" /> except Deputy O'Malley from that picture. Most seemed not to have read my opening speech or even the wording of the Bill.  For instance, many Fianna Fáil speakers repeatedly referred to proposals to delete Articles 2 and 3 while our Bill clearly provides for the amendment of these Articles.</P>
    <P>The tabling of this Bill by The Workers' Party has already served a very useful purpose in furthering the national debate on these two controversial Articles. Nothing I have heard in the debate has convinced me that the principle or the timing of our Bill is wrong.  On the contrary, having listened to six hours of debate, I am more convinced than ever that now is the correct time to confront the issues raised by Articles 2 and 3 and begin the process of changing them to a format which more accurately reflects the views of the people of the Republic and which can make a contribution to peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland as well as the establishment of better relationships between all of the people of this island.</P>
    <P>There were many issues raised during the debate to which I will not be able to respond in the time available, so I want to concentrate on the more important ones.  I want to deal firstly with the criticism made by the Taoiseach and to some extent Deputy Spring regarding the timing of our Bill and the suggestion that a referendum arising from the passage of the Bill would coincide with the Brooke initiative and the current negotiations between Dublin and London and would therefore be unhelpful.  The Taoiseach asked on Wednesday last, &ldquo;Does anyone seriously argue that in the middle of just such a negotiation this country should be plunged into a referendum on what could be a major issue in the talks?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a total misrepresentation of the situation as the Taoiseach, as a parliamentarian of more than 30 years' experience, must know.  If our Bill is passed at the end of the Second Stage tonight, which now seems unlikely, this would only be the first of several hurdles to be cleared before it could go before <Col N="2312" /> the people in a referendum.  As a Private Members Bill it would first go before a Select or Special Committee.</P>
    <P>There is no time limit specified for the work of such a committee and the Government could, therefore, determine progress based on the pace of events within Northern Ireland.  When the Committee Stage was finished the Bill would have to come back before the Dáil for Report and Final Stages.  The Bill would then have to pass all Stages in the Seanad. When that was complete an enabling referendum Bill would then have to pass all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This would clearly be a lengthy process of discussion and negotiation and the suggestion that if the Bill passes Second Stage tonight we would be plunged into a controversial referendum within a matter of weeks at an inopportune time is quite dishonest.  To argue, therefore, as the Taoiseach and Deputy Spring did, that a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 could upset either the Brooke initiative or the negotiations between the British and Irish Governments on a new agreement to transcend the Anglo-Irish Agreement simply has no basis.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, by passing the Second Stage of our Bill which does not set any date for the holding of a referendum, the Bill could demonstrate to the people of Northern Ireland that we are conscious of their fears and are not going to attempt to impose our will or our State on them. In the present political climate such a move would only help to break the political logjam and foster political progress within Northern Ireland.  This was the clear message I drew from my conversations with the people from both traditions in Northern Ireland last weekend.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach devoted a large part of his speech to responding to arguments that nobody made.  The Taoiseach quoted Article 29 of the Constitution, our membership of the United Nations, our acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Helsinki Accord as an indication of the Government's commitment to the principle of a peaceful settlement <Col N="2313" /> of disputes.  Nobody that I have heard has suggested that this, or any other Government, would attempt to impose a solution in Northern Ireland by force, or that any Government would use Articles 2 and 3 to justify a military solution.  The fact is, however, that there is a force in Irish society which claims to speak on behalf of the Irish people and which is attempting to impose a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland by the use of the most appalling violence.  As I said in my opening address, nobody would suggest that if we passed the proposed amendments the Provos would lay down their arms tomorrow.  There is no doubt in my mind, however, that changing Articles 2 and 3 to incorporate the democratic principle of consent would clearly demonstrate that we, as a State, are delivering a clear and unequivocal message to the murder gangs that they have no right to kill and murder in our names.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may well believe that Articles 2 and 3 simply reflect the aspirations of the people of this State to a united Ireland but this is not the way in which they are perceived by many people north of the Border.  The Taoiseach said last week that in matters concerning Northern Ireland: &ldquo;It is not the phraseology that matters but the signals that can be read into the words&rdquo;.  In this case the signals that many people in Northern Ireland, especially those who do not share an aspiration to a united Ireland, read into Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution is one of hostility and aggression.  Should we be surprised at this when these same Articles claim that Northern Ireland is part of our State, irrespective of the wishes of the people there, when they claim that this Parliament has a right to exercise jurisdiction over Northern Ireland, and when the claim has been adjudged by the Supreme Court to be a constitutional and legal imperative?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his contribution made reference to a radio interview given by the distinguished and, indeed, highly respected Unionist, Dr. Chris McGimpsey, in which, the Taoiseach claimed, Mr. McGimpsey had dismissed <Col N="2314" /> our Bill and &ldquo;indicated that he is not interested in this particular proposal&rdquo;. The Taoiseach admitted that he had not heard the interview but that it was reported to him by his colleagues.  This shows just how unreliable are those around the Taoiseach or, indeed, suggests that his colleagues only tell him what they think he would like to hear.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote what Mr. McGimpsey said in an RTE interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on Thursday last &mdash; the morning after the Taoiseach's remarks.  Unlike the Taoiseach I heard the interview but I also took the trouble to get a transcript to ensure that I did not misquote him.  What Mr. McGimpsey said in this interview was as follows: &ldquo;What we should be about here is trying to normalise relationships between the two states and between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  To delete Articles 2 and 3 would be a major step towards normalisation&rdquo;.  Later, in response to a question from David Hanley, Mr. McGimpsey said he took heart from the debate, saying that &ldquo;the campaign must continue and, hopefully, within the next year or so, we will see an amendment and an agreed relationship between the two states&rdquo;.  Speaking last month in Beech Hill College in Monaghan, Mr. McGimpsey said:</P>
    <P>Whilst it is true today that the sectarian gunmen in each community within Northern Ireland do not read legal documents before they go out and commit murder in your name or mine, it is clear that the Provisional IRA view the claim in Article 2 as a justification for their sectarian pogrom against Irish Protestant men and women.  The removal or amendment of these Articles, as proposed by the Dáil all-party committee in 1967, would be a major step forward towards the normalisation of relationships within this island.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will now have the grace to admit that he utterly misrepresented Mr. McGimpsey's views and that he will convey to him his apologies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2315" /> I should like to turn now to the suggestion made by a number of speakers, including the Taoiseach, that the Nationalist community would in some way feel betrayed or abandoned if Articles 2 and 3 were amended as we suggest. I cannot understand the logic of this argument. The Free State Constitution which preceded the current document has no equivalent to Articles 2 and 3.  There was no territorial claim and no assertion of a right of jurisdiction over Northern Ireland.  When the 1937 Constitution was adopted did it in some way improve the position of Northern Nationalists? Clearly, it did not.  The position of the Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland remained virtually unchanged from the establishment of the State right up to the sixties.  Articles 2 and 3 did nothing for them and amending these Articles would not threaten them in any way.</P>
    <P>Most extraordinary of all is the suggestion that the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 could lead to an increase in support for the Provisional IRA.  This is insulting to the SDLP and to the majority of Nationalists in Northern Ireland who have retained their aspiration to a united Ireland while totally shunning the Provisional IRA.  The implication is that the only thing preventing Northern Nationalists from supporting the Provos are Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>I am most disappointed that the Progressive Democrats have decided to vote against this Bill and I would be very surprised if this decision reflected the wishes of their members.  The Progressive Democrats were among the first parties in the Republic to come out in favour of amending the Articles.  They were among the first to set the pace for reform but now they have baulked at the first hurdle even though they clearly believe that Articles 2 and 3 should be changed.  I would have hoped that they could at least have seen their way to abstaining on the Second Stage vote.  This is, after all, a Private Members' Bill and the subject matter was not included in the Programme for Government and a positive <Col N="2316" /> vote or abstention on the part of the Progressive Democrats could not be viewed in the same light as failing to support a Government proposal.</P>
    <P>Like the Progressive Democrats I would like to see a comprehensive constitutional reform covering far more ground than Articles 2 and 3 but we will not get it so long as Fianna Fáil are the dominant party in Government.  They have given the Progressive Democrats nothing in this debate and Fianna Fáil speakers have poured scorn on questions of constitutional reform, especially on the need for amendments to Articles 2 and 3.</P>

      <P>In that event, may I say there have been appeals for us not to put the Second Stage of our Bill to a vote.  We will not withdraw it.  A vote only arises if the Second Stage is opposed by the Government.  If the Government and the Progressive Democrats are concerned about wrong messages they can decline to oppose it or to abstain on the vote.</P>
      <P>Even if this Bill fails tonight, I still believe it has been a worthwhile exercise, because we have inflicted a mortal wound on Articles 2 and 3 in their present form. It is now only a matter of time before they will be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, what this debate has demonstrated is that while the Taoiseach, and others, have adopted the rhetoric of new thinking, generosity, tolerance and pluralism, much of their language betrays a reluctance to let go of cherished Nationalist assumptions.  Deputy Currie has already referred to some of them which deny any validity whatsoever to the philosophy or tradition of Unionism. As the eminent historian, Dr. Roy Foster said in a recent issue of <i>Fortnight Magazine,</i> in an article entitled &ldquo;The varieties of Irishness&rdquo;&ldquo;...one clichè that has now mercifully been despatched is the notion of the hard-headed Ulsterman whose political orientation is supposedly dictated by the interests of his pocket. <Col N="2317" /> The woeful inadequacy of the wishful thinking behind such an analysis is beginning to come into focus&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, that clichè has raised its head again in this debate from the benches of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I urge the Progressive <Col N="2318" /> Democrats to change their minds or, at least, to abstain on this vote.  I believe the debate we have started here should continue on Committee Stage.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 4, delete &ldquo;treatment or attention&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;medical or psychiatric examination or treatment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the Special Committee a number of Deputies suggested that the phrase &ldquo;treatment or attention&rdquo; was too vague and did not adequately describe what was intended.  The amendment makes it clear that the court may order the parents to cause the child to attend for medical or psychiatric examination or treatment at a hospital, clinic or other place.  I hope this new amendment meets the point raised by the Deputies, in particular Deputies Howlin and Ferris in their amendment, and that they will consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced an amendment at the Special Committee and the Minister accepted the objective I had in mind.  However, he had some difficulty about the word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; and resorted to his dictionary.  He said that he would come up with a more suitable phrase on Report Stage.  Quite frankly, I am not sure that the phrase he proposes is better than the one I sought to have inserted at the Special Committee.  The Minister's amendment would delete the phrase &ldquo;treatment or attention&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;medical or psychiatric examination or treatment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain to be convinced that the phrase &ldquo;medical or psychiatric examination or treatment&rdquo; would cover all eventualities and am of the view that the word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; would be more clearly understood by and more in tune with the normal vocabulary of the medical and paramedical profession.  I was <Col N="2321" /> concerned initially that the original wording would not allow an assessment of this sort to be carried out.  I am not sure if there was any reason for not accepting my amendment at the Special Committee and I remain to be convinced &mdash; I do not want to delay the House on what seems to be a minor issue &mdash; that the phrase I have proposed is less suitable, less appropriate and is not all-encompassing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's phrase &ldquo;medical or psychiatric examination or treatment&rdquo; would be appropriate in a case where treatment was required within a day or a week.  However, an assessment, in the area of geriatrics and psychiatry involves a whole series of tests which could take up to two or three weeks to complete before a final definitive diagnosis is made.  I am not satisfied that the amendments the Minister has tabled to delete the words &ldquo;treatment or attention&rdquo; and substitute therefor &ldquo;medical or psychiatric examination or treatment&rdquo; will cover what we want built into this subsection.  The word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; is the most acceptable word from a medical point of view and would encompass all of the connotations involved in its usage. For example, there are now special assessment units in hospitals in various specialities.  It can take up to three weeks to have a proper assessment carried out.</P>
      <P>From that point of view the Minister might consider withdrawing his amendment in favour of that in the names of Deputy Howlin and myself.  Ours is much more specific in medical terms and covers the broader issues involved in assessment.</P>

For some reason it was not debated.  The words were changed from &ldquo;child care authority&rdquo; to &ldquo;health board&rdquo; and there was no substantive discussion on it.</P>
      <P>What I am proposing is that, when a supervision order is over, be its term six months, a year or whatever, the matter would return to the court for final determination, whether that be that the relevant health board are seeking an extension of the supervision order or, having gained sufficient evidence, are looking for a care order, but that the matter be brought to finality.  It would be a bad thing to have a supervision order and no subsequent decision on the matter.  In such circumstances a cloud would hang over the guardians or the parents of the children at issue.  Therefore, it is important that it be made obligatory to return the child to the court to allow the court decide whether to revoke or extend the order.  This would bring finality to such a matter.  In view of the circumstances involved &mdash; whether they were mistaken allegations by a health board or were well founded &mdash; it is in the best interests of all parties.</P>

      <P>In the Bill it is for a health board to decide whether to apply for a further supervision order when the <Col N="2324" /> term of an existing one expires.  The effect of this amendment would be to take this decision away from the health board.  Instead it is proposed that a health board would be obliged to go back to the court so that the court could decide whether to make a further order.  I do not believe that such a change is necessary or desirable.  It will be the health board who will have to implement the supervision order and, as a result, they are in the best position to judge whether it is necessary to seek a further order.  For example, the position in the child's home may have improved to the extent that the health board are satisfied that there is no longer any need for health board supervision.  In such a case, under my proposals, a health board would not have to take any action when the supervision order expires.  On the other hand, under Deputy Yates' proposal a health board would have to go to the considerable trouble and expense of going back to court, which would probably involve serving summonses on the parents and so on and, at the end of the day, the court may decide not to make a further order.</P>
      <P>The arrangements contained in the Bill are the normal provisions that apply to the extension of orders in family law cases.  I see no good reason to depart from them.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment and suggest that the reasons outlined by its proposer are clear and sensible in so far as if one wants to extend an order one goes back to court and the court takes a decision about it.  It could quite easily happen that a supervision order would just peter out, that there would not be any legal, definitive termination of such an order.  In many instances, families and the children concerned might well regard it as somewhat of a stigma.  To have a natural termination of such an order built into the Bill would be worthwhile.  I ask the Minister to consider doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the logic behind the Minister's argument in this case, but I am impressed by the argument of the <Col N="2325" /> proposer that a supervision order should be in clear defined terms.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 19 (6) the maximum period a single supervision order can remain in force is 12 months. We are all aware of the pressures under which health boards operate.  We are also aware of the sparsity of social workers employed in health board areas.  I could cite details from each health board region but I am sure the Minister has such details to hand.</P>
      <P>The fear I expressed throughout this debate is that we are devolving a range of new powers and responsibilities onto health boards which they are not equipped or adequately staffed to deal with.  It is a very reasonable fear that a supervision order be carried out by a health board, that they have several to monitor.  If things seemed to be going all right they might simply allow it peter out and not be obliged to take a definitive decision at the end of the period.  There is great merit in inserting an obligation in the Bill on health boards to have a final declaration made as to the status of the child so that a judge can have the facts placed before him once again, determine that the child needs to be supervised further, and the attendant monitoring continued or now no longer requires such supervision.</P>
      <P>There is great merit in the case.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>We are talking about bringing people back into court to allow the court decide whether to revoke or <Col N="2326" /> extend an order.  In this case where there is a supervision order and personnel from the health board have been monitoring the situation closely over a 12 month period, the decision whether the order should finish at the end of 12 months or whether a further supervision order should be applied for &mdash; it is up to the court to decide whether it should be granted &mdash; should be made by the health board.  All sides of the House are concerned that we avoid putting children into traumatic situations.  After 12 months if everything is going well, most of the trauma that brought about the supervision order would have been put behind the child, its parents and so on and matters would be on the way to beig mended, but bringing the child back into court means that all that trouble is raked up again.  Evidence might be needed or the health board might be able to say they were satisfied there was no need to continue with the supervision order, but I do not think bringing the child back into the atmosphere where the supervision order was granted is a good idea and I think the Minister is right not to accept this.</P>

      <P>As the debate goes on one's ideas develop.  Usually I approve of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; being included and so I thought on this occasion, until I heard in the debate that it is not necessary, it would be too specific.  Deputy O'Donoghue's argument does not stand up.  The child is brought to the court by some responsible agency, which is the health board, for the protection of the child.  As has been pointed out, we live in an era of grave social problems with so very few people to attend to such problems that there is always the danger that somebody will lapse in regard to attention.  If we provide that it is compulsory in such circumstances, then we could be guaranteeing continuity, and that is what we want.</P>

I have just read section 19 very closely and it will be, as the House is aware, new law. I am very disturbed by section 19 (2) which provides that: &ldquo;A supervision order shall authorise the health board to have the child visited on such periodic occasions as the board may consider necessary in order to satisfy itself as to the welfare of the child and to give to his parents...Maybe the court is going to tell the board to do it, and we can see from subsection (4) and so on that a court may lay down all sorts of directions but there is nothing about what is in the jurisdiction of the board.  Therefore, I am very fearful that the financial considerations, staff considerations, embargo considerations, restrictions on staff, mileage restrictions, time restrictions, the hassle and inconvenience, that all those factors will play a vital part.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>20.&mdash;(1)  Where, in any proceedings under section 7, 8 or 11 of Part III of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, or in any case to which section 3 (3), 11 (b) or 16 (g) of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, relates, or in any other proceedings for the delivery or return of a child, it appears to the court that it may be appropriate for a care order or a supervision order to be made with respect to the child concerned in the proceedings, the court may, of its own motion or on the application of any <Col N="2329" /> person, adjourn the proceedings and direct the health board for the area in which the child resides or is for the time being to undertake an investigation of the child's circumstances.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where proceedings are adjourned and the court gives a direction under subsection (1), the court may give such directions as it sees fit as to the care and custody of, or may make a supervision order in respect of, the child concerned pending the outcome of the investigation by the health board.</P>
    <P>(3) Where the court gives a direction under subsection (1), the health board concerned shall undertake an investigation of the child's circumstances and shall consider whether it should&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) apply for a care order or for a supervision order with respect to the child,</P>
    <P>(b) provide services or assistance for the infant or his family, or</P>
    <P>(c) take any other action with respect to the child,</P>
    <P>(4) Where a health board undertakes an investigation under this section and decides not to apply for a care order or a supervision order with respect to the child concerned, it shall inform the court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) its reasons for so deciding,</P>
    <P>(b)  any service or assistance it has provided, or it intends to provide, for the child and his family, and</P>
    <P>(c)  any other action which it has taken or proposes to take, with respect to the child.</P>
    <P>At Special Committee there was agreement that a linkage should be created between this Bill and the Guardianship of Infants Act.  This would enable a court dealing with a custody dispute between parents to refuse to grant custody to either parent and instead place the child in the care of the health board or to grant custody to one or both parents subject to the child being supervised by a health <Col N="2330" /> board.  The amendment before the House gives effect to that but goes further again by providing that such powers will also be available to the court in proceedings under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act or in any other proceedings for the return or delivery of a child.  I think this is a very important development and I trust it is to the satisfaction of all Members.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 40, after &ldquo;determination.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The hearing of any appeal under this section will not postpone or delay the effect of any order, or the renewal of any order, previously made by the court.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was discussed in my absence on 4 April at the Special Committee.  What is intended in this amendment is that in any <Col N="2331" /> appeal in relation to an order under this section, which would be all the care orders, the emergency care order, the care order itself and supervision orders, if someone sought to frustrate the decision of the court they would not have the opportunity of delaying the effect of an order by an appeal.  What I am seeking to insert is that the hearing of any appeal under this section would not postpone or delay the effect of any order or the renewal of any order previously made by the court.  Obviously the right of any appellant to have the case reconsidered by a higher court on a point of law or whatever is only natural and plain and proper justice.  What is at issue here is that I would not like a situation where a decision to take a child into care or to provide for a supervision order would be put off for three or four weeks because someone lodged an appeal.  I would not like well paid lawyers or even professional expert lawyers for that matter &mdash; who are very capable of boring holes, not to speak of constitutional weaknesses, in legislation &mdash; would frustrate the workings of the legislation.  I would like clarification from the Minister as to how this appeal procedure will work and the effect it would have on orders before I would consider withdrawing my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful to the House if I began by explaining the purpose of section 21.  Normally where a court makes an order and the person affected appeals against it the operation of the order is suspended pending the outcome of the appeal.  For obvious reasons this is not appropriate where there is a risk to the health or well being of a child.  This section provides that an appeal will not normally delay the coming into effect of a care order, supervision order or access order.  It would only be delayed if the court gave a direction to that effect.  Even then the court could impose conditions.  For example, in an appeal against a care order the court could allow the child to remain at home but grant the health board the right to <Col N="2332" /> visit but at home pending the outcome of the appeal.</P>
      <P>It is not exactly clear what Deputy Yates is trying to achieve in his amendment. It appears that he intends that an appeal could not under any circumstances delay the operation of the order.  This might be going a bit too far and we should depend on the good sense of the courts to decide in each case whether the operation of the order should be delayed.</P>
      <P>What is contained in section 21 is the standard provision in relation to the appeals used in family law cases, and I see no good reason to depart from this. I would suggest that Deputy Yates might reconsider the situation and withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>During the sos, I read what the Minister just read.  The issue is quite clear.  Now that I have the Minister's words in front of me we can digest them more carefully.  My section provides that an appeal will not normally delay the coming into effect of the care order, supervision order or access order.  It would only de delayed if the court gave a direction to that effect.  What I am saying is that, if the court deemed it was proper that a child immediately be taken into care, someone could not frustrate it. It is quite clear from what the Minister said that it is possible for, we will just assume, some very wealthy parents to totally frustrate the court, and that is not entirely satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said earlier, normally where a court makes an order and the person affected appeals against it, the operation of the order is suspended pending the outcome of the appeal.  Can we take it that if normal practice applies to this legislation, all orders will be suspended for the period of the appeal?  That is, if normal practice applies.  I think, <Col N="2333" /> normally speaking, we should do something about this.  It is a pity that this was not teased out in the Special Committee because it is clear from what the Minister said that the situation will be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take from anyone their right to appeal.  I am not against a second opinion on the first decision of the court, but we all know how long a case takes to get to the High Court.  If one is appealing it to a higher court it could delay it for months.  I think there should be a set of circumstances to deal with this.  To just ignore it and not to have a section dealing with this is quite unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I regret that there was not more debate on this but in view of the Minister's reply I will have to press the matter.  I would also ask the Minister for his own sake and for the sake of the children, to have another look at this when it arrives in Seanad Éireann.</P>

    <P>In our perusal of the Bill after Committee Stage we observed that there was a slight technical loophole in this section.

The court is given discretion to make short term orders to deal with cases where there may be a possibility that the underlying family problems may be resolved.  However, if that improvement does not occur the court must have the power to renew the order for a further period or until the child reaches 18 years. <Col N="2334" /> This is what is proposed in these amendments, and I would be grateful if the House would agree.</P>

    <P>The question of legal representation for a child involved in care proceedings was raised at Special Committee.  I have since been in consultation with the Attorney General in the matter and the amendment now before the House is the result of that consultation.  The amendement will empower a court to make a child a party to all or part of the proceedings and to appoint a solicitor to represent the child in any case where the court is satisfied that this is necessary in the interests of the child.  It is envisaged that a court might exercise this discretionary power when dealing with an application relating to an older child who is at odds with the health board in relation to the board's plans for him.  The court would obviously have to be satisfied that the child has sufficient understanding to instruct a solicitor.</P>
    <P>The amendment generally speaking gives effect to a recommendation in the Law Reform Commission's Final Report on Child Sexual Abuse that a child involved in care proceedings should have a right to independent representation by a legally qualified person.  Where a solicitor is appointed by order of the court, <Col N="2337" /> the costs and expenses, including solicitors fees, incurred will be paid by the health board involved in the proceedings unless the court orders otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is a typographical error in the first line.  The reference to &ldquo;section 36&rdquo; should be to &ldquo;section 34&rdquo;.  Subject to this correction, I hope the amendment can be accepted.</P>

      <P>Perhaps you would help me on a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle. Amendment No. 119 in the name of the Minister provides, among other things, for a legal advocate on behalf of the child, and the right of the child to its own legal representation.  My amendment No. 123 also seeks to deal with this issue.  The material dealt with in amendment No. 119 is also deal with in amendment No. 120 which seeks to establish a children's court and in Deputy Howlin's amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 122.  To facilitate a general discussion on these matters, I would ask with the agreement of the House, that we arrange some grouping of these amendments so that all the aspects of what would be termed a children's court can be dealt with together.  We will be calling a division on these amendments and one vote will cover all the amendments.  Perhaps some grouping arrangement could be suggested.</P>

In drafting the amendment to the Minister's amendment what I had in mind was to provide for specialist courts outside the normal court sitting and the formality of the normal court environment.  I propose that justices should have independent support from experts in the area.  This is not a substitution for having specialist trained judges, but is in the same vein.  Perhaps <Col N="2338" /> we could group these amendments, and I would support a single vote.</P>

      <P>I will try to cover all the amendments in my name which are included in this group.  When we were discussing amendment No. 75 in relation to independent assessment, I indicated my intention to bring forward a composite amendment to cover the various points raised, particularly by Deputy Yates, who graciously withdrew his amendment at that time.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 119a the court will be given wide powers to procure reports from any person it may nominate in relation to any question affecting the welfare of the child.  This amendment mirrors a provision in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and adequately meets the points made by Deputy Yates.  Accordingly, I ask that this amendment be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 120, tabled by Deputy Yates, I accept that child care proceedings should not take place at the same time as criminal proceedings.  We discussed this at the Special Committee and I undertook to look at the matter again for Report Stage.  I refer the House to amendment No. 122, in which the new <Col N="2340" /> subsection (3) provides that child care proceedings shall be heard at a different time, or in a different place or on a different day from ordinary sittings of the court.  I hope that this meets the point raised by Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <P>As regards the title of the court when dealing with children, section 11 (1) of the Children Act provides that the District Court, when dealing with care or criminal proceedings in relation to children, shall be known as the juvenile court.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1924, provides that such hearings in Dublin, Cork and Limerick are known as the Children's Court.  I hope that, in the light of this, Deputy Yates might consider withdrawing this amendment.</P>
    <P>I propose to take my amendments Nos. 121 and 122 together.  I will deal with amendment No. 122 first.  At the Special Committee meeting on 4 April there was some discussion about the need to ensure that child care proceedings are heard at a different place and time from ordinary criminal proceedings.  I promised to look at this and I am now proposing the insertion of a new subsection (3) to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>I also propose to avail of the opportunity to insert two further subsections here.  The new subsection (4) provides that proceedings in the High Court, arising from the Bill, should be as informal as possible.  There is already such a provision in section 25(2) in relation to the District Court and the Circuit Court. Therefore, I am sure that this new provision will be acceptable to all.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 121 extends certain provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act to proceedings under this Bill.  The effect of this will be to prohibit the wearing of wigs and gowns by members of the Judiciary and by barristers in dealing with proceedings under this Bill.</P>

We have taken the matter to Government and we have got clearance from them and the Attorney General. We have had consultations with personnel in the health boards and we have brought forward three composite and imaginative amendments, amendments Nos. 119, 119a and 122.  These are very broad and composite amendments.  I thought I would have no difficulty in reaching agreement in the House and we have gone a long way, much further than many people expected.  We went much further than the public anticipated in regard to this Bill but we want to ensure that, above all, the primary concern, the importance of the child, is protected in the broadest possible humane and legal way.  I would be disappointed if, after all this, Deputy Yates might choose to vote against these very generous amendments.</P>

      <P>I will try to be relevant. I compliment the Minister of State on amendment No. 119.  I &mdash; and a number of other Members on this side of the House &mdash; had a particular difficulty in regard to the debate on this issue in Committee, particularly in view of the remarks made by the Supreme Court Judge, Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, in which he referred to the question of legal aid and the representation of children in these cases.  The Minister, in his amendment, has gone as far as I would have liked him to go.  The amendment is eminently satisfactory and I do not see how anybody in the House could vote against it.  It is along the lines of the undertaking given by the Minister for Justice in relation to the Bill dealing with rape.  This side of the House should be complimented for having addressed this very important issue.  It is necessary to have legal representation for a child in certain cases and it should be left to the discretion of the court to decide.  There could be cases where a child of 17½ might want legal representation and might dispute what the health board are doing in regard to his or her life.  The amendment is a milestone in this sort of legislation and it followed the good example set by the Minister, Deputy Burke, in relation to the Bill dealing with rape.  Most of the other amendments are alternatives and the Minister's drafting is probably tighter than previously.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 119 represents a new departure and is one of the most progressive amendments to legislation introduced in a long time.  It gives an opportunity for a child to be represented in court and this is an extremely important right because, in child care proceedings, unlike other kinds of proceedings, the individual in relation to whom an order is made is the innocent party but his or her future is being discussed and considered.  It is an enlightening step to allow a child to be represented. It is even more progressive and enlightening to allow the court in its discretion to appoint a solicitor or legal representative for the child.  This is greatly welcomed. Amendment No. 119a is very progressive and lends credence to the statement in the Bill that the interests of the child are paramount.  The idea that the court might of its own volition or on the application of any party to the proceedings give directions in order to procure a report from any such person as it nominates, is new, progressive and enlightened.  These two amendments are extremely important and progressive.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 124, I do not know how one could assess the sensitivity of a District Court justice.</P>

      <P>Having complimented the Minister and accepted his amendments, I must pose a question.  What about the free legal aid system?  We must consider resources.  What about the long queues and the great difficulties for people under the free legal aid system? Is this giving a right with one hand and removing it with the other.</P>
      <P>The whole area of child representation, a children's court, the quality of courthouses and the need to improve the environment in which these cases are heard and the standard of sensitivity of judges who hear these cases are questions that must be examined.  I hope answers will be forthcoming.  We have heard the arguments for a children's court for years.  I will just quote from The Task Force on Child Care Services of September 1980, to point out what they say they envisage the children's court as being.  They say:</P>
      <P>S5.3.2 The Children's Court as we envisage it will have three important functions:</P>
      <P>(a)  filter: referring cases which are not apporpriate to it back to the agency which brought up the case, or to another appropriate agency;</P>
      <P>(b)  arbitration: holding meetings with children, their parents and other parties, and arranging agreements between them;</P>
      <P>(c)  orders: considering the case for compulsory intervention and making formal binding orders if necessary.</P>
      <P>S5.3.3 Any Children's Court will have the power to affect the lives of children and parents very radically.  We are very conscious of the special characteristics of children.  As we said in the Main Report, &ldquo;a child is more impressionable, more vulnerable, more changeable and more liable to being influenced for better or for worse than an adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2345" /> I am sure we all agree with that but it is no harm to restate it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue asked how does one decide on the sensitivity of a judge or how does one select judges for their sensitivity.  The report also has a very practical proposal on that.  They say:</P>
    <P>Children's Judges should be recruited by an independent body&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is a very radical idea but it should seriously be considered.</P>
    <P>&mdash;such as the Civil Service Commission, or a special judicial commission, from among qualified barristers or solicitors with at least five years' practical experience.  Their appointment should be conditional on their successfully completing an appropriate course of studies and practical experience designed to equip them for the specialised work.  They should have the same rank and salary as District Justices.  We have not attempted to specify exactly how many Children's Judges are required but the number would be of the order 12 to 15:</P>
    <P>That is a very practical suggestion which is the closest we will get to achieving a corps of judges who will have the necessary qualifications.  I am quite convinced that many of the men and women at present working in the courts do not have the sensitivity or the training for the kind of cases that come up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's amendments and I hope that they will not be nullified by the problems with free legal aid.  I support the amendments generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has done here is to be highly commended.  It arose from the Minister's commitment and the commitment of all members of the committee who discussed these sections thoroughly in the Special Committee. However, I will take the opportunity of adding my congratulations to the Minister for his work in this area to amend this Bill.  Most of the matters raised by Deputies about a children's court, wigs and gowns and so on, have <Col N="2346" /> been met by the Minister and we should welcome that.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Fennell said in relation to free legal aid does not arise in the context of this Bill because subsection (4) of amendment 119 provides:</P>
      <P>Where a solicitor is appointed under subsection (2), the costs and expenses incurred on behalf of a child exercising any rights of a party in any proceedings under this Act shall be paid by the health board concerned.  The health board may apply to the court to have the amount of any such costs or expenses measured or taxed.</P>
      <P>That covers the point that the Deputy made.  Most of us were looking for an extension of free legal aid when we discussed this case.  This is even better in that people will not be caught up in the obvious delays in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of Deputy Dempsey.  I suppose we should not really restate cases.  We are not getting the children's court but we are getting something that approximates to them.  We have made a very significant advance and I thank the Minister for genuinely taking on board a lot of very good suggestions. Some very good advances have been made in this Bill.  I acknowledge that freely and commend the Minister for it.  It is philosophically a fundamental change, giving a support, a right and a standing to the child.  Legal standing to a child in the courts is very important.  I strongly support amendment No. 119 and amendment No. 119a which provides that the court may of its own volition, procure a report.  Both of those amendments are very welcome.  I do not think they achieve all we want but seldom in life do we get all of what we want.  I believe it goes a significant distance down that road and should be given an opportunity to work itself out.  When looking at amendments for Report Stage I was of the opinion that it was unattainable to get the children's court.  I had thought of putting down an amendment of the type the Minister put forward in his own name.  I sought a much more modest suggestion.  Some of the <Col N="2347" /> suggestions put down as ancilliary amendments in this group could well be encompassed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 120 which states that &ldquo;...hearings of this Court shall not take place on the same day as criminal proceedings.&rdquo;. That is straightforward.  The amendment in my name and that of Deputy Ferris relates to the establishment of a panel of specialist advisers. I gave considerable thought to this amendment because unless we have the specialist corps of trained judges, who would have a specialist expertise in the child care area, as envisaged by the task force report which Deputy Fennell read into the record, there should be some mechanism whereby there would be a panel of expert advice to him which would not come from the health board involved in the case, and who would be available in the health board area to give independent advice.  He could say: &ldquo;I am not convinced of that argument; I want my own advice&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that issue in amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 122.  The establishment of that corps of advisers could involve three, four, or five individuals who would not be salaried or permanent but would be available to the court system and may or may not be used at the discretion of the justice.  This would be a valuable addition in the development of better legal proceedings under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 123 is largely superficial, sorry, superfluous &mdash; in no sense is it superficial &mdash; in as much as it is encompassed in the Minister's amendment. I strongly support amendment No. 124.  If we are sufficiently broad-minded it will be possible to select justices on the basis of sensitivity and previous experience in this area.  That is eminently feasible and there are ways in which it can be achieved.</P>

    <P>We have made a very significant advance in this series of amendments.  I thank the Minister for genuinely approaching this issue in a positive and constructive sense and for taking on board the ideology the Opposition put forward and putting it into a better legal <Col N="2348" /> framework than I had been able to do on Committee Stage.  Perhaps he would go one further step down that road, not to the children's courts &mdash; which we will not get on this outing &mdash; but to accept one or two extra amendments which would improve the very good proposals he has put down.</P>

I have always been unhappy with the words &ldquo;children's court&rdquo; because in layman's language it always had connotations of guilt, whereas the child in this case is definitely not guilty and is the abused rather than the abuser. I would be very unhappy if these cases were tried in children's courts.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the debate in my room.  This amendment was one on which I contributed at the earlier stages.  I recall having a very lively discussion that day about the capacity of children to express views from a very early stage, particularly in relation to such vital matters as who might care for them whether on a voluntary or involuntary basis.  I welcome very much the substantial moves which have been made.  Is Deputy Yates's amendment out of order because it imposes a charge on the Exchequer?  If the Minister's amendment is all encompassing, does that not cover the extra charges involved in Deputy Yates's amendment or is it simply because Deputy Yates's amendment is providing for more extensive powers and a more general provision?  This may be a minor point but not in the context that the Minister has gone a great distance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has <Col N="2350" /> already covered the cost in his amendment but I was concerned that his amendment was too narrowly framed whereas Deputy Yates's amendment is more general, and possibly more expensive but it is clearer.  It will take some time before we know how cases are affected under the powers given in the Minister's amendment, and how courts will act.  I suppose we can rely on the commitment of lawyers to make sure that children are aware of their entitlements.</P>
      <P>This is a major step in this area, and I welcome it.  It is doubly important, not just for the powers it gives but because it brings children to the centre, and their rights, desires and views on the matter are treated much more seriously.  I hope, through our discussion of this Bill we have moved a good distance in relation to children, who up to now had been seen as passive figures, pawns in the context of making decisions.  We were concerned about them but we considered them as people for whom decisions were made but we are now moving to a position where the children are seen as much more central in these issues, are being respected a great deal more and are involved to a greater extent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete line 35.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage it was pointed out that the Minister would have an input into unit trust schemes after the enactment of this Bill.  Because this function is being transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank it might be advisable to remove the reference to the Minister in section 1 (1) and also in section 4 (2).  I should like to hear the Minister's views on these amendments particularly in view of the points put forward by Deputies on Second Stage.  Does he not think it would be a good idea to delete the reference to the Minister in section 1 (1) and section 4 (2)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>These three proposed amendments would have the effect of deleting the provisions under which the Minister would be enabled to direct the Central Bank to make any authorisation by the bank subject to the imposition by it of conditions or requirements specified in the Minister's direction.</P>
      <P>I considered it prudent to provide for ministerial powers as proposed in these sections as a precautionary measure.  Assuming that this Bill is enacted, the Oireachtas will be facilitating certain developments in the legislation regulating unit trust schemes.  In the circumstances where it is not possible to foresee all future eventualities arising from these more flexible provisions, I consider it wise to preserve power to myself to respond to any future representations which might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that Members of the Oireachtas might have concerns arising from the annual report of the Central Bank, which the Minister for Finance would present to the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  That report would be required to include a report in relation to the Bank's exercise of their <Col N="2352" /> functions under the unit trusts legislation. It is apparent from the Second Stage debate which took place last week that there is a considerable divergence of views among the Members of this House on these provisions.  I would be enabled, under section 4, to deal with such representations without the necessity for amending the legislation.</P>
    <P>It would also be important that the Minister, being the sponsor of this proposed legislation, would be aware of further developments in the future and be able to deal with any concerns which arise.</P>
    <P>Any direction the Minister would give to the bank would be limited to conditions or requirements which related to such matters which the Minister is satisfied, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, do not constrain the prudential supervision of a scheme by the bank.</P>
    <P>The provisions in question have several precedents.  For example, a similar provision exists in the Central Bank Act, 1989, section 101, dealing with the supervision of financial futures and options exchanges by the Central Bank, under the aegis of the Minister for Finance. Analogous procedures also exist in the provisions of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, Part XIII, dealing with another form of collective investment scheme, SICAVs or variable capital companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what the Minister said on this amendment is fairly straightforward and direct but nothing he has said could be regarded as an argument for maintaining the involvement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a function which this Bill intends to hand over to the Central Bank.  Indeed, the precedent referred to by the Minister in the legislation concerning the Central Bank is not a precedent for what is included in this Bill because the Minister for Finance is the member of the Government charged with looking after the operations and affairs of the Central Bank to the very limited extent to which they are supervised by the Government.  There is <Col N="2353" /> no precedent for supervision and monitoring being carried out by the Central Bank where a Minister other than the Minister for Finance is involved.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this provision, and indeed section 4, is in the nature of a precautionary measure to provide against a time in the future when the Minister for Industry and Commerce might feel that something unforeseen needs to be dealt with.  However, I cannot understand why it should be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If an eventuality like that were to arise it seems to me that the Minister for Finance would be the appropriate Minister to deal with it.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, given our system of Cabinet Government with collective responsibility, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any other Minister has concerns about things which arise in the course of the operation of a Bill such as this, he has a perfect right and every facility to make those views known to the Minister for Finance and if there is reality behind them the Minister for Finance would act on them.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the relevance of what the Minister said about the Oireachtas perhaps wanting to have an input into this arising from the reports which the Central Bank would make on the operation of these schemes.  This Bill does not give the Oireachtas any direct involvement in this and I am not all sure that is the intention of the provision in section 1 (1). Section 4 (2) does not require the Minister to have any regard whatsoever for anything the Oireachtas might say.  It provides that the Minister &ldquo;may direct the bank...&rdquo; and so on.  The Bill as it is framed does not meet the point made by the Minister.  If there is any foundation for the point the Minister is making this is not the way to deal with it in the Bill and it should be dealt with otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is the sponsor of this Bill only because the Bill transfers from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank the function which are dealt with here.  If any other Minister was looking after unit trusts at present he <Col N="2354" /> would be the sponsor of the Bill.  I do not see any substance in that provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the directions provided for under section 4 (2) would be limited by the terms set out in that subsection.  That is fine and it amounts to an opinion by the Minister but section 4 (2) does not define what these might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it defines their limitations and requires the Minister to make such direction after consultation with the Minister for Finance and in such a way as not to constrain the prudential supervision by the bank of a scheme.  It does not say anything about what might be covered by these directions or about why the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than the Minister for Finance should be the one to do this.  I have to say that the response given by the Minister is not in any way conclusive about the need to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is being divested of powers, any residential function.  If there is a need for any kind of residual function there is nothing in what the Minister has said, or in the Bill, which would indicate that it should be the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than the Minister for Finance who should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputies Durkan and Barrett can be accepted.  If it is adopted the Bill will be meaningless in some respects.  For example, it would be difficult to interpret section 20 (4) if the interpretation clause, which defnies &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, was deleted.  That subsection states that the Minister and the registrar of companies shall on the passing of this Bill, transfer all documents and so on to unit trust schemes.  If the definition section is deleted &mdash; I do not think it should &mdash; that would be a meaningless provision.  It would be more approriate to discuss the substance of this on section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said during the course of the debate on Second Stage, I find what is being done rather strange whether it has <Col N="2355" /> a parallel in other legislation or not.  The purpose of the legislation is to transfer the rights and duties of the Minister in the matter of control of unit trusts to the Central Bank.  I have my own views about this but that is not the issue.  The issue is that the Minister has decided to do this and so be it.  Perhaps, the Central Bank are the appropriate institution but once that decision is taken it seems that the appropriate thing to so would be to leave it with them and let them get on with the job, set up whatever mechanisms and controls are needed, grant the licences, exercise the controls and impose conditions where necessary.  Why is there a necessity for the Minister to retain his finger in the pie?  If the Central Bank are to be given this job leave them be.  Why split the responsibility between the Minister and the Central Bank?  This may give rise to contention at a later stage, if something goes wrong, as to whether it was the fault of the Minister or the Central Bank.  What is it about the functions and powers being granted in the Bill that requires this odd mix?</P>
    <P>Does this mean that we will have two sets of officials dealing with unit trusts, one in the Central Bank and the other in the Minister's Department, perhaps in conflict or having disagreements at times?  This will make the operation of the procedures rather cumbersome.  I see no reason why we should include it and it should be dropped.  If the Minister decides to divest himself of the responsibility and power to license unit trusts he should do this unbegrudgingly, divest himself of it fully and completely and leave the matter in the hands of the Central Bank.  One either takes the view that the Central Bank are the capable and appropriate body of men and women to do this job or not.  If they are the capable body to do the job, and have the necessary resources and personnel, why then is there a need for the Minister to retain his finger in the pie and have the power to impose conditions?  Why would the Central Bank not impose conditions, if necessary, if they were doing the job <Col N="2356" /> properly?  The Minister has not clarified this issue in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to establish, in the public interest and in the interests of investors in unit trust schemes, new and enhanced arrangements for the control and regulation of unit trust schemes by the Central Bank which will assume that statutory responsibility from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with that and accept the point made by Deputy Taylor on amendment No. 1.  I do not think that is the issue although the point made by the Deputy is valid.  Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 states that if the Minister wishes to transfer responsibility, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, he should go ahead and do so.  I see no valid reason why the Minister should retain power in certain circumstances to direct the Central Bank to make an authorisation.</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with the refusal of authorisation and the right of appeal, if the Central Bank refuse an authorisation, to the High Court.  I can foresee people appealing to the Minister.  From my reading of section 4 (2) there is no reason why someone refused an authorisation by the Central Bank could not go to the Minister instead of going to the High Court.  Under subsection (2) the Minister could direct the Central Bank to give an authorisation. For the life of me I fail to understand the reason we need subsection (2).  I do not think the Minister has given us any valid reason why we should agree to retain this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that there is a time limit on this debate I ask the Minister to accept the principle enshrined in our amendments unless he has some extraordinary reason for retaining this power.  I would appreciate if the Minister, when replying, would comment on the point I have made, that under the present wording there is no reason why appeals could not be made to the Minister instead <Col N="2357" /> of to the High Court.  In other words, in the first instance can a company go directly to the Minister instead of to the Central Bank?</P>
    <P>If there is something wrong with the technical aspects of our amendments, then, on Report Stage, I am sure the Minister could substitute different wording for what we suggest or leave in some wording we suggest be deleted.  If he is accepting the principle, if he is going to transfer responsibility from himself to the Central Bank, he should do so and, if somebody wishes to appeal the decision of the Central Bank, the Court is there for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not greatly moved one way or the other by amendment No. 1.  I am more concerned about the fact that, on the last occasion, the Minister of State, in the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, did not give us any rational explanation as to why it is deemed necessary &mdash; separate from all of the other matters that we might consider in the context of financial institutions, financial transactions, supervision of the financial services sector generally &mdash; to proceed at this time with a Unit Trusts Bill, divest the Minister for Industry and Commerce of supervisory powers in that regard and hand them over to the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>Unlike my colleague, Deputy Taylor, I took the view that it is probably desirable to have a unified system of supervision of the financial sector.  On Second Stage I instanced a trend in that direction. I would like to know from the Minister why it is necessary to proceed at this time with this Bill in isolation from a number of other matters about which we spoke on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>As regards there being a perceived lack of uniformity or symmetry about taking the powers on the one hand and giving them to the Central Bank while, at the same time, leaving the Minister with a finger in the pie, I cannot get myself greatly worked up.  The role being left to the Minister is a very peripheral one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20 (4) was referred to but that is no more than a matter of record and <Col N="2358" /> the passing on of the books to the Central Bank.  The real issue arises in section 4 (2) on the question of the authorisation of unit trusts, whether the Minister may intrude and cause a direction to be given in the circumstances envisaged by the provisions of that subsection.  I can see a logic in the argument that suggests it should be the Minister for Finance, if a Minister at all, rather than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  But I do not have any great principled objection to the Minister retaining that function and, presumably, being accountable to the House.  I have an amendment tabled later &mdash; amendment No. 12 &mdash; the purpose of which I will set out when we come to it that does envisage a role for the Minister. I do not really have any major principled objection to the Minister having the involvement suggested here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a great deal to add to what I have said already.  What Deputies should bear in mind is that, at present under the 1972 Act &mdash; which is the only legislation dealing with unit trusts and their supervision &mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the only supervisory authority.  I have considered that it is appropriate that at least the day to day management of supervision of these bodies might be transferred to the Central Bank because they now undertake a lot of the supervision of bodies like building societies, for example, who were transferred from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add as an aside and entirely in parenthesis that, in part at least, this is a product of the control of numbers in the public service which is something we have to think about.  The Central Bank see themselves as an independent kingdom. They do not seem to be subject to any controls in terms of recruitment or numbers; this is the reality underlying the situation.  I say that simply in parenthesis but it does seem to be convenient since they are the principal supervisory authority for these various other matters. However, when we were drawing up this <Col N="2359" /> Bill I pointed out that I thought it undesirable that there should be no democratic accountability at all.  Indeed that point was made at some slight length by Deputy Taylor on Second Stage.  He made that very point: why is the Minister hiving everything off?  Why is it that there will now be nobody answerable to this House for a whole lot of functions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not to the Minister; that would not be appropriate.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is still the sponsoring Minister.  His role, as envisaged in section 4 is purely precautionary. He is still the Minister responsible for SICAVs under company law and, I think, for UCITS as well. These are all analogous instruments.  If he is answerable to this House in respect of SICAVs and UCITS he cannot democratically entirely wash his hands of some answerability in regard to unit trusts.  I thought the argument that would have been made in this House would have been quite different, that it would have been on the lines of that advanced by Deputy Taylor on Second Stage, which was that we were reducing or almost abolishing accountability.  I have often taken part in these debates in this House over the years when that was always the point that was made.  If the late Major de Valera were alive tonight, Sir, he would be jumping up from whatever side saying that the whole principle of this was wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to recall that the accountability of the Minister in respect of SICAVs in Part XIII in the <Col N="2360" /> Companies (No. 2) Bill of 1987 was introduced into that Part as a result of an amendment tabled by Deputy John Bruton, very much at his insistance.  Of course, being the open-minded man I am, and have been throughout the Companies Bill, I accepted it.  It would be quite contrary to the principle of what Deputy Bruton sought to promote in Part XIII of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 to do otherwise here.  The powers of the Minister are entirely residual.  They are entirely non-prudental and, for that reason, in practice, will be rarely, if ever, exercised.  But, as a matter of principle, it is important that they be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has just said in parenthesis is very interesting and deserves to be highlighted.  What he seems to be telling the House now, in effect, is not that there is any merit in transferring responsibility on this issue from himself to the Central Bank, not that the exigencies of the position require that that be done, not that the Central Bank, for any particular reason, is the appropriate body to supervise unit trusts rather than himself and his Department but that, because of Government arrangements regarding the recruitment of staff, this back-handed method had to be found of doing this.  The Central Bank, being an independent body, can, as the Minister said, recruit staff, whereas he and his Department cannot get staff to do the job, and that is the reason the transfer is being made.  That is a very frank admission by the Minister and he is to be applauded for that frankness but it is a remarkable way to do our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the situation requires that it be dealt with in the Minister's Department &mdash; which would be my first choice, as I said on Second Stage, and that remains my position for reasons of democratic accountability that I outlined then &mdash; then arrangements should be made to provide the staff in the Minister's Department so that he would retain the function he has and which no doubt, if he had the staff, he could discharge very effectively and efficiently.  Here we see a backhanded <Col N="2361" /> method of getting round the staff recruitment embargo.  That is what we are about now, not that there is any great thing, as many Members said on Second Stage, about the tidying up operation, that it should be the Central Bank controlling finances, the banks and all the rest of it. It is all to do with the embargo and that is a remarkable position to find ourselves in.  If the Minister is the repository of the control of unit trusts I cannot imagine that human ingenuity in the Cabinet could not devise a method of securing him the staff he needs to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>My order of preference as to who would control unit trusts would be as follows.  My first choice would be that it should rest with the Minister.  I think that would be the correct way to do it.  My second choice, very much a second choice, would be that the Central Bank should have the power to do it.  My third choice, which gives the worst of both elements, would be to have the mix contemplated in the Bill in its present form. It is neither here nor there.  It does not vest the responsibility fairly and squarely in one institution or the other and it gives this peculiar hamble-gam arrangement, a kind of retention by the Minister and his depleted staff, as he acknowledges, of a vague, uncertain control over something he will rarely if ever, use.  If he is rarely or never going to use it, what is the point of it being there in the first place?  Why not just go back to the Cabinet, get his authorisation and retain the democratic responsibility where it should rest, with himself?</P>

      <P>I happen to believe that the Central Bank is the appropriate regulatory authority for financial institutions. I also happen to believe that the input of the Oireachtas and its accountability &mdash; we do not talk of that very much &mdash; have to be in getting the legislation right the first time, and after that handing over the regulation and supervision to a body who will do it properly.  I hope I will offend nobody if I say it is my firm belief, and experience bears me out on this, that the Central Bank has always been better at <Col N="2362" /> supervising financial institutions than the Department of Industry and Commerce. I do not say that to criticise any Minister or any civil servant of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I think it is a matter of record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that blue books are not the infallible source of wisdom they were held out to be from time to time. However, that is by the way.  I believe the Central Bank is the right place to do this.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself has said &mdash; there is no virtue in this &mdash; that the Department of Industry and Commerce are currently the only supervisory authority in relation to unit trusts and he takes the view now that at least day-to-day control of their activities should be given to the Central Bank.  The Minister goes on to say that the powers here are residual and will not be much used.  When the Minister was on a different side of the House and when I was on that side he used to give me long lectures about how nobody can go behind legislation and talk about what the intention of the legislator was when the legislation was passed.  Therefore, the Minister's intentions, which I accept in all good faith tonight, about not using these powers much are not worth a tráithnín. What matters is what is written in the legislation and what it allows the Minister of the day to do.  Without making any judgments about what the Minister and his successor might do, I am worried about what is written down here and what we are going to enact into law and the Minister's current state of mind about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which, of course, as the Minister has pointed out, on previous occasions, is not part of the legislation, says that what is intended here is to complete the adoption of a <Col N="2364" /> consistent approach to the control and supervision of these financial services etc. On the question of where the staffing resources are, the Minister may not be aware that the Minister of State based part of his case on Second Stage on the proposition that the measures here would result in &ldquo;more efficient use of scarce resources and the ready availability of a pool of expertise&rdquo; which would enhance the quality of supervision.  There is apparently some expectation that the quality of supervision and the use of resources would be enhanced by this move to the Central Bank, which says something for the place they are moving from.  I would like to have on the record of the House that neither the Minister of State on Second Stage nor the Minister here tonight has given us any indication that there is any pool of expertise or any extra resources.</P>
    <P>Finally, for the sake of completion, let me mention in response to Deputy Taylor regarding section 20 (4), that there is another section about which he should have the same concern in that it refers to the Minister, that is section 19.  The way to deal with that is to have no further fancy footwork in relation to the definition section but simply to insert in section 19 and in section 24 (4) after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for Industry and Commerce&rdquo; and that will make it perfectly clear what we are at.  If the Minister were disposed to accept the amendment we have down now, I am sure we could insert those appropriate words in those two sections on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to forget it is he who is bringing in this Bill.  He decided this legislation would be brought in.  He says in the explanatory memorandum: &ldquo;The primary purpose of this Bill is to establish, in the public interest and in the interest of investors&rdquo; new arrangements whereby responsibility is transferred from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank.  He has not explained to us the circumstances under which he himself sees his Department getting involved in this whole question of authorisation.  Can <Col N="2365" /> the Minister explain the circumstances he envisages whereby he, as Minister in the Department of Industry and Commerce, may have to use his powers under section 4 (2)?  It is not enough for the Minister to say that he will not be a means of appeal.  There is nothing in subsection (2) to the effect that he may not be a means of appeal.  For those good reasons I would ask the Minister to give a more comprehensive reply in relation to the reasons he needs these particular powers.  As it stands section 4 (2) contradicts what the explanatory memorandum states quite clearly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat to Deputy Barrett that the Minister is not seen as a means of appeal.  The Minister's functions, such as they are, that are reserved in these provisions are non-prudential and an appeal simply cannot arise because the direction that would be given under section 4 would be given in respect of more general matters of policy and not in respect of anything that would be appropriate to the prudential supervision of the unit trust concerned.  I do not really see how it arises.</P>
      <P>I would remind Deputies of what I said with regard to Part 13 of the Companies (No. 2) Bill which was almost entirely analogous with this except that these are units trusts where they are SICAV.  I would remind Deputies of the arguments that were made from that side of the House in relation to Part 13, the amendments that were put down and the amendments that were accepted on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I would say that I think that the aspersions that were cast on my Department by Deputy Dukes are entirely unjustified.  I am very well familiar with the two instances he mentioned. <Col N="2366" /> I would like to ask him what, for example, a Minister in 1979 or 1980 could have done in the particular circumstances and I think if he casts his mind back to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to section 4 (2), notwithstanding anything said by the Minister, I would feel that the continuing interest he retains seems to be somewhat crowding the interest of the Minister for Finance through the Cental Bank and the banks.  I feel that perhaps notwithstanding what the Minister said regarding accountability to this House that the Minister for Finance would.  In any event, be accountable to this House at a later stage and might perhaps have more of a role to play there.  With no disrespect to the Minister, he may not always be the Minister.  He may even move to a higher role in which case another Minister might well be there and perhaps the discussions or consultations, <Col N="2367" /> as the section states, with the Minister for Finance might lead to some confusion or conflict.  For that reason I felt it was somewhat unnecessary to retain that interest.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;including such unit trust schemes managed by bodies corporate incorporated under the law of the State or <Col N="2368" /> of any other member State of the European Communities or of any other State as may be authorised by the Bank in accordance with the provision of this Act&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I will not be in a position to accept these three amendments.  The provisions in question in the Bill deal with the authorisation of unit trust schemes and their registration by the Central Bank.  They are founded on the analogous provisions of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972 as they were amended in 1977 to take account of Ireland's responsibilities in the Community.  They provide a suitable framework within which the Bank can enforce its supervisory requirements and conditions as necessary in accordance with the powers under this Bill.  It would not be appropriate if these incorporation requirements were extended to allow incorporation in countries outside the European Community. The requirements for the management company and the trustees to be incorporated in Ireland or in any other Community country are not likely to be objectionable to those seeking authorisation for unit trust schemes to operate in Ireland.</P>

I am not necessarily saying that we would insist on having this particular amendment made.

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (a), line 42, after &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or their agents or intermediaries.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, as I am sure the Minister will readily recognise, is not in any way to be criticial of the management of unit trusts but is simply an effort to protect the investor, particularly the unsophisticated or irregular investor, the person who does not have, except perhaps once or twice in a lifetime, an opportunity to invest and who has to have recourse to an agent or a <Col N="2370" /> broker.  An investor must satisfy himself that the agent is in good standing, is fully accountable, has the imprimatur and the full authorisation of the management company before he proceeds to invest. There have been instances where the relevant authorisations have been signed by the investor with the agent purporting to invest in a particular scheme and the person finding ultimately that, the funds were not used for the correct purposes. If the agent or intermediary is operating with the authority and on behalf of a larger body or the manager of a scheme, surely that authority should also carry with it some responsibility to the investor in the event of mismanagement by the intermediary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in section 4 (1) relate to the authorisation required, but the focus of control by the bank is on the principles involved, that is the management company and the trustee company under the unit trust scheme.  I do not consider it either necessary or desirable that this focus should be widened to cover agents or intermediaries of those principles.  Such provision could prove unworkable in the context of this Bill.  Indeed, there is a considerable emphasis on the trustee company in that it bears a responsibility on behalf of the investors under the trust law.</P>
      <P>The question of the regulation of agents or intermediaries is beyond the scope of this Bill.  This question is best dealt with in a coherent way relating to intermediaries more generally.  There already exists regulatory legislation relating to insurance intermediaries, and stockbrokers under bank ownership may be covered by bank regulatory legislation. However, the main point is that the question of further development of regulation in this area is best dealt with in a broader context than just unit trusts. Such developments would probably have to take account of proposals for Community directives currently under consideration. I have in mind in particular the Draft Investment Services Directive which is before the Internal Market Council at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the need for the control <Col N="2371" /> of what are broadly called investment agents or investment brokers, now that we have covered insurance brokers, but it would not be appropriate to deal with it in this Bill.  A broker who is acting as an intermediary for investment between the public and any investment institution should be covered by some further legislation and that is being considered at present.  It would probably not be legislation appropriate to my Department, the Department of Finance because of the scope of the investment possibilities, but I hope it will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said in relation to possible alternative legislation and I hope it will be introduced.  I would have preferred to have seen the provision incorporated in this legislation for the reasons I have already outlined.  There have been a number of instances where the parent company, as it were, the trust or scheme, whether it be dealing in bonds or whatever, is operated by an agent or intermediary who may be operating satisfactorily and above the law but because of circumstances outside his or her control, there may be a fairly serious loss to the investor.  The investor may not have regular dealings in such instances and because of that may suffer a great loss.  I hope the Minister will encourage his colleague to introduce the necessary legislation to cover that.  From the time the investor places the funds with the intermediary, agent or broker and they have been accepted on behalf of the scheme or trust, a contract exists between the investor and, as it were, the parent company.  That is where the problem has arisen so far, but, hopefully, when the alternative legislation referred to by the Minister is introduced it will cover that matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a point which, although it relates to the earlier amendments, deals with section 4 (1) (b) which covers the authorisation of unit trust schemes.  It provides that the bank shall authorise a scheme if, among other things, the management company or the scheme is a body corporate that is incorporated under the law of the State or any other member state of the European Community.  I would like to know why it is limited to companies incorporated under our law or the law of other member states of the European Community since &mdash; although this does not happen very often or on a very wide scale &mdash; unit trusts operated by companies incorporated outside the European Community may also be sold here.  Why is this restricted to member states of the European Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Principally for prudential reasons, I would think.  It is much easier for us to enforce the regulations in regard to management companies that are registered within the Community.  It is harder for the Central Bank, or whoever the authority happens to be, to follow those who are found to be delinquent but who are based outside the Community because they are outside our effective jurisdiction.  There is, as has been mentioned, a draft directive on investment services which will cover many of these instances.  If is, of course, a directive that will apply to the whole Community.  Therefore, it would be foolish to leave ourselves open to encouraging people to have their management companies elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon gave me notice of this intention to raise the subject matter of the reason permission was refused to a prisoner in Portlaoise Prison to attend his mother's funeral.  Deputy McGahon has five minutes to present his case and the Minister has five minutes to reply.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this question and giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter.  While it will not help this particular young man's situation it might, with the Minister's help, enable prisoners who are caught in the same situation, to attend their mother's funeral.</P>
      <P>The person to whom I am referring is a 26 year old Dundalk man, Brian McShane, who is serving a life sentence for the very serious crime of murder.  He was convicted with four other people for his involvement in the Drumree robbery and murder.  He was a boy of 20 years of age when he was seduced into the evil IRA organisation, perhaps he was terrorised into joining them.  As a person who believes in the hard-line treatment of criminals, I have no reservations about the sentence or its severity.  He is rightly serving a life sentence in Portlaoise Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One week before the sad and sudden death of his mother he had disassociated himself from the IRA group within the <Col N="2374" /> prison, an act which required courage.  It was not a ploy because of the possibility of his mother's death as his mother was in perfect health although, sadly, she died suddenly a week after he had made that decision.</P>
    <P>That young man should have been allowed out to pay his last respects to his mother even if his movements had been restricted by a ball and chain.  He should have been allowed to attend his mother's funeral.  Every person in jail in this country, particularly those within the jurisdiction, should have that basic civil right, even though they have transgressed against society, sometimes in a dreadful manner.  We have a caring society which accepts that people who commit murder will be allowed out some day, will be able to re-enter society and pick up the threads of their life.</P>
    <P>This young lad took a definite step away from terrorism but his request to attend his mother's funeral was cruelly denied.  Indeed, I understand that the prison authorities, who had shown him every courtesy, had him handcuffed to a warden waiting for the signal to go and then they got a telephone call to the effect that he would not be allowed out.  I understand &mdash; and I believe &mdash; that many people in similar situations were allowed out to funerals and one of the people convicted of the Mountbatten killing, a heninous crime, was let out on compassionate leave to attend the funeral of a parent.</P>
    <P>There was a wrong decision in this case and it was a manifestation of cold, bureaucratic indifference which has no room for compassion.  It certainly will not contribute to this young man's rehabilitation. In any dealings I have had with the Minister, Deputy Burke, I found him to be very practical, helpful and straightforward. However, somebody erred in this case.  Are we really serious about rehabilitation?  Is there a serious rehabilitation programme within the prison system?  If a prisoner turns away from a terrorist group, is there a matching, sympathetic commitment from the Department of Justice?  Was the refusal to allow this young man out an interference with somebody's weekend or a game of golf?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to parliamentary question No. 75 of 27 February last I informed the House that each application for temporary release on compassionate grounds is considered on its individual merits.  I indicated that regard is had to the circumstances giving rise to the application and factors such as the nature of the offence, length of sentence served, behaviour while in custody, the previous record of the offender, the possible risk which a release may pose and the likelihood of an offender returning to prison on the expiration of the period of release. I also indicated that I was satisfied that the arrangements for dealing with applications for release on compassionate grounds struck the right balance between the need to attempt to respond in a humane way to such applications while at the same time minimise the risk to the community.</P>
      <P>There are obvious constraints on what a Minister for Justice can, with propriety, say publicly about the administration of an individual prisoner's sentence. However, given the matters raised by the Deputy, I think it only right to confirm that on 28 March 1985 the prisoner in question was found guilty of the capital murder of a member of the Garda Síochána and sentenced to death.  On 21 February 1986 the President, on the advice of the Government, commuted the sentence of death to one of penal servitude for 40 years.  The prisoner referred to by the Deputy has served less than five years of the commuted sentence and is not due for release until 2026.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that in considering applications for compassionate parole where the grounds are the death of a close relative I adopt as sympathetic an approach as possible.  However, having considered this case under the criteria which I outlined earlier, and having particular regard to the nature of the <Col N="2376" /> crime and the fact that the prisoner's sentence does not expire for another 35 years, I reluctantly concluded that the balance of the public interest did not lie with authorising a period of compassionate parole in this case.  Previous Ministers for Justice have come to the same conclusion in similar cases.</P>
    <P>When turning down this prisoner's application, I at the same time authorised, as an exceptional measure, a special visit from relatives for the prisoner. This offer has been taken up and the visit will take place shortly in the more relaxed environment of the prison service training centre which is near Portlaoise Prison.  The prisoner will be able to spend a number of hours with his relatives and arrangements will be made for refreshments to be available.  The general intention is to enable the prisoner and his relatives to express their grief together in as comfortable an environment as possible while at the same time having due regard to security requirements.  I believe that authorising this visit was a reasonable attempt to go as far as I could to meet the compassionate considerations which clearly arose.</P>
    <P>I accept, of course, that the Deputy would not wish in any way to minimise the gravity of the offence committed by the prisoner &mdash; even though in the past we have profoundly disagreed on the nature of the penalty which should be imposed in such cases.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the report of the visiting committee from Mountjoy Prison in 1989 and the details it disclosed regarding conditions in the prison.  Deputy McCartan knows the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for facilitating me in raising this important issue with the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture of conditions in Mountjoy, depicted in the report of the visiting committee, is a shocking one which should outrage all civilised people.  There is considerable public controversy at the moment about the conditions under <Col N="2377" /> which animals are kept in Dublin Zoo. Those under which prisoners are detained in Mountjoy do not seem to be much better.</P>
    <P>I have to base my comments on newspaper accounts of the report of the visiting committee, as the report has not been laid before the House or circulated to Deputies.  But there is enough in these reports to see that there is very serious cause for concern.</P>
    <P>I deplore the attacks made on the visiting committee both by the Minister for Justice and the Prison Officers Association. I do not know the members of this visiting committee but I am sure they are ordinary decent people, interested in the welfare of prisoners and with no particular axe to grind.  I do not believe they are in it for whatever minimal expenses are paid to them, and what they do can hardly be considered to be fun.  It is an outrage that they should be vilified for repeating in the report allegations which have been made to them by prisoners and for doing something that is no more than their duty.  The fact that the Minister for Justice earlier this year refused to reappoint all but one of the committee, which in previous reports have also drawn attention to the unacceptable conditions in the prison, suggests that the Minister believes that the role of the committee is to be compliant and to turn a blind eye to the horrors of life in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>This report has to be seen against the background of continuing suicides in Mountjoy.  Within the past 12 months we have seen the first suicide in the women's prison, with the death of 19 year old Sharon Gregg and within the past few weeks St. Patrick's has claimed its first teenage victim.  It also has to be considered against the background of the deplorable situation where, as a result of the failure of the Government to provide a therapeutic centre for young offenders, 15 year old girls are being held in custody with adult habitual offenders, some of whom have been convicted of serious offences.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the situation in the women's prison.  It is, of course, misleading even to refer to it as a women's prison.  It is a women's floor in a male prison.  It is 21 years since <Col N="2378" /> it was recommended that it should be closed, but the women are still there. Unlike the situation with men, where there are a number of different prisons and prisoners can be held in different places according to the seriousness of their offences &mdash; open prison, moderate or high security unit &mdash; all female prisoners are dumped in together.  This means that shoplifters are held with murderers, women in for begging are held with drug pushers and those jailed for non-payment of fines are dumped in with recidivists.</P>
    <P>Most of the women held in Mountjoy are there for offences which do not merit detention in a high security prison.  Many should not be in prison at all, but should be serving non-custodial sentences.  Most of the others should be held in an open prison.</P>
    <P>The Mountjoy complex was built in the Victorian period and reflects the standards and values of that era.  There is overcrowding, inadequate sanitary and living conditions, and poor recreational and training facilities.  It is beyond redemption and should be closed down. The package announced yesterday by the Minister for Justice will not be sufficient to save it.  The phasing out of Mountjoy should begin now with the ultimate aim of closing it fully within a specified period.  The Government should also set a timetable for the full implementation of the Whitaker report.  I would take the opportunity to compliment the Minister to the extent that he has announced a programme that is moving in the spirit of what Whitaker has recommended.  I hope that particularly in the context of the women's prison, many of those probation and welfare officers to be appointed will be employed to see that those who are there unnecessarily will be released at an early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt on several occasions by way of reply to Dáil questions and otherwise with many of the issues raised in the report in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible in the course of a five minute reply to deal as fully as I would wish with all of these issues, but I shall concentrate on what I believe to be the <Col N="2379" /> three main issues: physical conditions at Mountjoy Prison; conditions generally in the Women's Prison; and allegations of assault by prison officers on male offenders.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy is a Victorian prison.  Its structural layout reflects the custodial thinking of another age &mdash; Wheatfield, which is recognised as one of the most modern prisons in the world, is what we see as being appropriate today.</P>
    <P>There are limits to what I or anybody else can do with Mountjoy &mdash; Governments all over the world are having the same difficulties in coping with old buildings.  Its replacement was planned some years ago but abandoned because of the enormous cost involved and because of the need at the time to bring order into the public finances.  A new Mountjoy would cost anything from £70 million to £100 million and the taxpayers simply cannot afford that kind of money at present.  In the meantime, all that can be done by any Minister is to improve as best we can on what we have, and that is precisely what I am endeavouring to do.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention some examples by way of addressing some of the comments made by the visiting committee. Plans are well in advance to have the &ldquo;holding cabins&rdquo; referred to by the committee replaced; the new kitchen for Mountjoy is at contract stage, will cost aabout £750,000 and is due for construction in the New Year.  The provision of emergency communication facilities in Mountjoy is proceeding as quickly as possible and has been on-going for some time.  The new facilities are now operational in one wing, work is proceeding on the other wings and the expectation is that all the work will be completed by the end of next year; medical facilities at Mountjoy and at other institutions are being reviewed fully at the present time by the recently appointed medical director for the Prison Service.  This appointment incidentally was recommended by the Whitaker report and I am glad to say I was the one who acted on it; in the past few days I have announced plans for considerable progress in the provision of in-cell sanitation generally; and the new unit for offenders suffering from infectious <Col N="2380" /> diseases who need special care has gone to tender.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Women's Prison I want to emphasise that, of course, I am concerned about comments which are made from time to time and that is why I am improving the facilities.  These improvements will be quite extensive. They are not, as one commentator described them, a &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo;.  At an estimated cost of £1.5 million, it would, indeed, be a very expensive coat of whitewash. Women will no longer share a block with male offenders, they will have much more space, will have single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation and it will be possible in that situation to address many of the criticisms which have been made in a more effective manner.</P>
    <P>I was, as this House knows, extremely concerned about a comment made by the same visiting committee in their report for 1988 to the effect that female offenders had been batoned by male officers.  I immediately referred that matter to the Garda Commissioner, a Garda investigation was set in motion and will be completed in the New Year.</P>
    <P>This, of course, brings me to the point that somewhat similar comments are contained in the committee's report this year concerning assaults on male offenders. I do not wish to be involved in public controversy with any visiting committee who have a job to do and by and large do it quite well, but I am extremely concerned that the committee did not send a report to me immediately about their concerns as provided for by law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925, provides that</P>
      <P>it shall be the duty of every Visiting Committee ... to report to the Minister any abuses observed or found by them in such prison.</P>
      <P>It was not necessary for the committee to be satisfied &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; about the validity of serious allegations made to them in order to bring their concerns to my attention or to the attention of the governor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2381" /> The committee would have been aware that governors act when they receive specific complaints &mdash; the Governor in Mountjoy actually referred cases for Garda investigation where complaints were made to him by prisoners during 1989.  These complaints were made directly by the offenders themselves to the governor.  It is not good enough for the committee or anybody else to say that they mentioned their concerns in the minutes of their routine monthly meetings &mdash; incidentally, my Department cannot trace any record of receipt of such minutes during the period in question.  In any event, the statutory responsibility to report concerns to the Minister is certainly not discharged in this way and I can say that neither I nor any of my officials was aware of the committee's concerns.  There is no percentage to be gained by any Minister for Justice in ignoring reports of criminal assaults.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one aspect of this matter which must not be lost sight of, and that is the very great concern caused to prison officers as a body (who have to deal with offenders day in and day out &mdash; about serious allegations of criminal assault on unnamed offenders by unnamed staff.  They are entitled to be given the details and as entitled as everyone else in the community to the protection afforded by law to those charged in this way.</P>

    <P>It is 11 years since the idea of having a third level college based in Thurles was <Col N="2382" /> first sponsored and proposed by Tipperary VEC.  The case for the establishment of such a college is well documented and proven and was strengthened immeasurably by the revising of an interesting formula.</P>
    <P>The rural and business development concept, developed by the promoters, means that it would make a unique contribution to Irish education by emphasising business opportunities in rural Ireland.  Thurles town has been devastated with closures, rationalisations and redundancies.  It has a frightening level of unemployment with rampant emigration. The town in mid-Tipperary is enveloped in an air of gloom and desperation. There is an ever increasing cynicism among very many who have witnessed the disintegration of the town.</P>
    <P>The provision of the proposed college was seen as an economic lifeline.  It would give an enormous boost to the educational, industrial, agricultural, economic and social life of the area.  The benefits to be derived from having a third level college in Thurles are many and varied and would affect every single person living in the locality one way or another.  The economy of the area would benefit directly through the employment of 100 staff with an average income of £15,000 per annum.  Services in the area of accommodation, food, transport, clothing and entertainment would benefit from the presence of 800 students.  The employment created by the establishment of the college would be permanent and long term and would create demand for private housing and ancillary services all to the benefit of local business.</P>
    <P>Industry would benefit since companies would be more willing to locate in Thurles once the college has been established. It would provide research facilities for existing and potential industries. Agriculture and agricultural related business would benefit through better use being made of natural resources in the area and better management of agricultural facilities will come about through practical projects emanating from the college.  The site is there.  The leadership and structure are there and an enormous fund of goodwill exists.  All we need is <Col N="2383" /> that the Government follow the lead given by the local people.</P>
    <P>While understandably parochial in my attitude I must emphasise that this college is not just for Thurles; it is for Tipperary and for the young people of Ireland.  The entire country is united in its desire to see this project become a reality.  It is rare for any project to have received universal support from so many statutory and voluntary bodies as happened with the proposed college in Thurles. Regrettably, Fianna Fáil's attitude in Government to the RTC for Tipperary has been inexcusably negative.  Every positive and constructive move has been made by Fine Gael in Government. Former Deputies, such as John Boland, Gemma Hussey and Paddy Cooney in their ministerial capacities gave the initial sanction for the college and went on to approve the schedule of educational courses and the purchase of the site.</P>
    <P>The project has been abandoned on a number of occasions by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education starting with the former Deputy Martin O'Donoghue in April 1982.  The present Fianna Fáil led Coalition Government have eventually come off the fence and declared publicly their stance on this issue.</P>
    <P>At election time in North Tipperary the electorate are reminded repeatedly of how important it is to have a voice and clout at the Cabinet table.  On several occasions the public, including those of Thurles, have responded by giving generous support to Fianna Fáil and making it possible for Deputies O'Kennedy and Smith to enjoy ministerial status with as many attendant perks and privileges. Where were our two Ministers when the Minister for Education got Government approval for her programme under European Structural Funds for educational infrastructure? Why were they silent?  Why did they allow the proposal for a third level college in Thurles to be excluded in the full knowledge that this funding was imperative and would not again be available until 1994?  This effectively spelt the death knell of our project.</P>

      <P>While our Ministers in North Tipperary were massaging the electorate, including responsible and sincere pressure groups, with empty, idle rhetoric and faint-hearted promises, the Government in which they serve had sanctioned the commencement of a college at Tallaght and approved a programme of expansion and development for existing third level colleges.  By 1994 we in Tipperary will be told that the requirement for additional college places has been catered for.</P>
      <P>Government policy in this regard was confirmed by the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 1 September 1990, when she stated that no further third level institutions would be built and that existing ones would be expanded to cater for increased demands.  While I disagree totally with the views of the Minister for Education, I acknowledge that, unlike others representing the Government in my constituency, she has been honest and forthright in her approach and has put the facts before the people.  While we are bitterly disappointed I can assure the House we will continue to fight for acceptance of our just and valid case.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, thank you for giving me the opportunity to support my colleague, Deputy Lowry, in his demand for the provision of the Tipperary rural and business institute in Thurles.  This is a unique and a fresh approach to third level education. Throughout Tipperary it was regarded as an exciting challenge which was met with enthusiasm and much commitment by all the people in south Tipperary.  It has come to us as devastating news that this college has not been included under the European Structural Funds for education infrastructure and that there will be no hope of this college being provided until after 1993.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the urgency for the provision of this college.  I look forward to a positive response to the demand tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would <Col N="2385" /> like to say that the outline proposal for the establishment of the Tippeary rural and business development institute at Thurles was received in my Department on 1 March 1990.  The Deputies will be aware that the <i>National Development Plan 1989-93,</i> which sets out the structural measures which Ireland proposes to implement over the five year period, in conjunction with the European Community Structural Funds, was submitted to the European Commission in March 1989.  The Tipperary project which was submitted earlier this year could not, therefore, be included in this part of the plan.</P>
      <P>In arriving at decisions on the projects to be included in the plan, and bearing in mind the financial constraints involved, priorities had to be set.  Areas of particular need had to be specifically targetted and existing unsatisfactory facilities upgraded and rationalised. Deputies will be aware that in terms of higher education participation rates Tipperary is rated already above the average, coming thirteenth in the national order of participation according to the report &ldquo;Who Goes to College&rdquo;, the Clancy report as it is popularly known.</P>
      <P>Having said this I would like to assure the Deputies that the proposals submitted by Tipperaary's Vocational Education Council and county council have been considered in some detail by my Department.  The main proposals are that the institute would be built on a site of the proposed Regional Training College in Thurles.  It would cater for about 800 students and, like the Regional Training College proposal, would provide full-time and part-time third level courses orientated towards the needs of the rural and business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These courses would be at certificate, diploma and degree level and would be validated by the National Council for Education Awards.  The management would comprise a board with broad representation from by Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, SFADCo, Teagasc, Vocational Education Committees and other local interests.  It is envisaged that capital and current costs would be the same as those arising in the case of an Regional Training <Col N="2386" /> College of similar size.  This would obviously involve a major financial commitment, The new Regional Training College in Tallaght, for instance, is expected to cost approximately £15 million to build and could be expected to cost about £2.5 million in annual returned costs.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in 1988 the Government, in view of the very difficult financial circumstances, deferred a number of capital projects, including the Regional Training College for Thurles.  It was felt that to proceed would be inappropriate and that all other possible options in relation to additional productivity and student throughput would have to be carefully considered.  The Government then approved the terms of reference, operation and composition for an inter-departmental committee of third level education.  While this committee has not yet reported considerable progress has been made in the meantime in increasing the number of available third level places.  Further progress is expected in this area and I will continue to keep under review the demand and supply situation.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I propose to keep the Tipperary project under review in the Department.  I will, of course, be happy to consider any further relevant information which the local authorities may wish to supply.</P>
    <P>I will take on board the points made by both Deputies and will certainly have them considered.  I am saware of the urgency of this project and I assure the Deputies concerned that every effort is being made to make progress in a structured way throughout the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want to raise the inadequacy of a reply I received to Question No. 60 on yesterday's Order Paper.  The Minister is re-organising the ordnance survey service and is setting up an office in Ennis.  The ten staff which will be allocated to Ennis are all living in Limerick city.  It is of no benefit to the economy of Ennis or Clare, it is of no advantage to the economy of Limerick but merely a matter of convenience for ten staff.  The addresses of the staff are O'Callaghan's Strand, Limerick; Corbally, Limerick; Singland, Limerick; Castletroy Limerick; Caherdavin, Limerick; Castleconnell, Limerick; Ballyneety, Limerick; Kilmallock, Limerick; Nenagh, Limerick and one man from Fedamore, Limerick, who is in the office in Dublin and wishes to get back to Limerick. There are two ordnance survey staff with Clare addresses: one in Shannon &mdash; Limerick is as convenient to Ennis &mdash; and one in Miltown Malbay who wants to work in Galway and will go to Tuam.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out to the Minister that in a regional layout an office in Cork, an office in Limerick and an office in Tuam would more adequately service regions than the layout which he is suggesting.  For the convenience of the staff covering the regions it makes no sense to require ten people to drive 30 miles to Ennis when they can drive one and a half miles, two miles or three miles into Limerick city.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he acted on the advice of the Office of Public Works. However, I do not think he had full information and I ask him to change the decision.  I regret having to bring the Minister into the House at this hour, I know he is very busy working in the national interest.  This is a minor matter.  It has nothing to do with which town wins or which town loses; it is simply to convenience ten staff who want to work near the area in which thy live.  There is no justification for shifting them 30 miles away.</P>

      <P>As a member of Foynes Harbour Trustees, I want to acknowledge the Government's contribution in providing finance for extra berthage in Foynes.  As the Minister knows, Foynes Harbour is celebrating its centenary this year and at present it is making tremendous progress.  Some finance has already been paid and even though the project is sufficiently advanced the harbour trustees could do with an extra injection of finance to help the cashflow situation. I want to ask the Minister when he anticipates such finance will be forthcoming. As 50 per cent of the financing was based on an estimated cost and there is now a financial overrun in excess of £60,000, can the Minister give us a further assurance that an extra sum will be provided for 50 per cent of this extra cost?</P>
      <P>Aquaculture in Ireland has already created over 2,000 jobs directly and has helped to create further jobs in the areas of supplies and services.  This industry has great potential for development.  The chemical Nuvan, a treatment for sea lice, is used at present to ensure healthy fish life but there is an urgent necessity to find a naturally based alternative to Nuvan to allay the widespread concern at the use of this chemical.</P>
      <P>Independent research has shown that this chemical is cancer inducing to humans involved in administering it. What training procedures are involved in the use of the chemical?  What controls are used in administering of same?  How successful is the research to find an alternative? Does the Minister agree that an alternative should be found?</P>

      <P>Ballina, although not the county town, is the largest town in County Mayo.  It has the highest unemployment rate in the county and one of the highest in the country at 23 per cent. Devastated by emigration and a lack of jobs, Ballina, under the aegis of the Integrated Resources Development Agency, is putting together an integrated programme of local initiatives.  These involve the development of local tourism, services, resources and industrial enterprises. Ballina is the only port in Mayo and has a long and proud tradition, but unfortunately it is not being used because <Col N="2389" /> of a lack of commercial activity. However, its facilities and warehousing, although rundown, have potential.  It needs major development which, of course, will require finance.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that many of the wholesale and industrial enterprises now operating in Ballina, the north Mayo region, of which Ballina is the capital, and the county generally would use the greatly enhanced port facilities if they were developed rather than having to use the long and tortuous route to Dublin.  I ask the Minister to consider developing this port in conjunction with any other plans which may have been submitted to him by the local Integrated Resource Development for the development of the river as a port and a marina.</P>

      <P>In 1975 a licence was granted to a committee representing the farmers in a number of parishes in the north Kerry and west Limerick areas to remove beach material from Ballybunion beach, County Kerry.  The licence was subject to a number of conditions, including the prohibition of the use of mechanical diggers and shovels other than front and rear loading shovels mounted on agricultural tractors.  This condition was blatantly flouted, and as a result, the beach has been seriously damaged.</P>
      <P>Kerry County Council applied to the Department of the Marine to introduce an order to prohibit the removal of beach material from Ballybunion beach.  Last November the Minister for the Marine made an order revoking the 1975 foreshore order and prohibiting the removal by any person of beach material of any kind other than seaweed from Ballybunion beach.  However, some farmers claim a separate arrangement was made with the Department of Transport and Power, the responsible Department at that time, on 18 July 1977.  This agreement was signed by an official of that Department.  Can these farmers continue to remove sand from the beach because of the existence of this agreement?  It is important that the Minister clarifies the position in regard to the 1977 licence. Can he confirm that the 1990 order can be enforced?</P>

      <P>Under the broad decentralisation programme, Limerick city is set to benefit substantially from the planned relocation of approximately 900 staff form the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The great bulk of these, about 550, will be located in Limerick, with about 200 going to Nenagh and about 150 to Ennis.

        <i>Limerick West):</i> The operational programme on peripherality was approved by the EC Commission in August of this year and the first tranche of EC grant aid assistance was paid to the harbour authorities on 20 November 1990.  My Department are now working on the information necessary to facilitate the payment of a further tranche of EC grant aid.  I am hopeful that further EC grant assistance will be available early in the new Year but I cannot give an exact date at this stage.  There is no provision in the operational programme on peripherality, as agreed by the European Commission, for extra funding in the event of any additional costs being incurred on any project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuvan is the proprietary name for a pesticide preparation which is based on dichlorvos and which is used to control sea lice in farmed salmon.  I am advised that this preparation poses little, if any, risk either to human health or the marine environment.  Dichlorvos does not persist <Col N="2391" /> in the marine environment as it breaks down rapidly in sea water.  Very little dichlorvos enters the salmon flesh where, in any event, it would also be broken down rapidly.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless in addition to standard licence requirements on the use of chemicals in fish farming generally, my Department operate a number of controls specifically for Nuvan.  These include the nomination of an operative at every salmon farm responsible for the use and administration of the substance, such as notification to the Department on each occasion Nuvan is used and the amount used, the safe disposal of surpluses and containers and the keeping of comprehensive records.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which imposes on all employers, including fishfarmers, specific statutory obligations in occupational safety and health matters, including in the case, for example, of chemical usage the provision of all relevant information, protective gear and training to employees.</P>
    <P>The development of Ballina port is a matter in the first instance for the River Moy Commissioners, the body responsible for the management, control and operation of the port.  All applications for State and EC grant aid towards the cost <Col N="2392" /> of harbour development works are assessed to determine whether they are justified and to ensure that there would be a realistic return on any investment.  I understand that Ballina does not attract commercial or fishing vessels to any great extent.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure Deputy Deenihan that the Government take a very serious view of the removal of sand and other beach material from Ballybunion beach.  I am aware of local concern that such activity may be damaging this fine amenity and adjoining lands and property.</P>
    <P>On 1 November last, the Minister made an Order under the Foreshore Act, 1933, in respect of an area of seashore at Ballybunion.  This Order, which prohibits the unauthorised removal of beach material, is designed to be more effective than the 1975 Ballybunion Prohibition Order, which it replaces, by virtue of the more extensive area of seashore covered by it and due to its remaining in force throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine are currently reviewing the utilisation and impact of a foreshore licence granted in 1977 to the trustees of a committee of farmers of certain parishes in County Kerry which authorises the removal of beach material at Ballybunion subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.42 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 December 1990.</P>

      <P>State funding for coast protection was transferred from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine on 1 January 1990.  I indicated to the House, in February of this year, that my Department's role would be to facilitate the implementation of permanent schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea and that primary responsibility for coast erosion would rest, as heretofore, with local authorities.</P>
      <P>A number of locations have been identified where valuable property is threatened by erosion and in regard to one of these &mdash; Arklow North Beach &mdash; I am pleased to report that a scheme of works, estimated to cost £1.9 million, is being undertaken by Wicklow County Council with 50 per cent grant assistance from my Department.</P>
      <P>In 1991, and subsequent years, I hope to continue with the progress made in 1990.  Some preliminary survey and design work has been undertaken in connection with proposals for schemes at the Maharees, County Kerry, Bray, County Wicklow and Rosslare Strand, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>Finally, the unauthorised removal of beach material is a significant contributory cause of coastal erosion at a number of locations.  My Department are in line with commitments given in the Government's environment action programme, preparing proposals on legislation to allow for greater control over the removal of beach material.</P>

      <P>The present proposals for changes in the minimum mesh sizes of fishing nets were discussed for the first time at EC level in the middle of September 1990.  Since then, the proposals have been discussed on a number of occasions and at several levels in the EC context, in particular at the November 1990 Council of Fisheries Ministers.  The fishing industry have been consulted in regard to the proposals at all stages of the negotiations and the views expressed have been taken into account in formulating Ireland's response to the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's view in the matter has been that the Council bears an important responsibility in the matter of conservation, and that early adoption of effective conservation measures is essential to the preservation of the stocks, particularly the stocks in the North Sea. This is not an academic matter; it is a practical matter of maintaining a sustainable livelihood for thousands of fishermen. The Deputy will appreciate that it is vitally important in the long term <Col N="2178" /> interests of fishermen to ensure that fisheries are not damaged or disrupted by overexploitation.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations, I have, however, cautioned the Commission against extending to areas outside of the North Sea the solution to a problem which is essentially a North Sea problem.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided on 2 August 1990 to implement the main recommendations of the report of the review group on Air/Sea Rescue Services, including: (i) the establishment under a director directly answerable to the Minister for the Marine of a new division in the Department of the Marine to assume responsibility for maritime safety, shipwreck and sea and coastal pollution; (ii) the transfer from the Department of Tourism and Transport to the Department of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC), the Coast Radio Service, marine radio-engineers and marine radio surveyors and their incorporation in the new division; (iii) the appointment of a director of the new <Col N="2179" /> division; (iv) the supply on contract of a medium range helicopter service to be located at Shannon and to be placed under the control of the new division; (v) the relocation of the Dauphin Helicopter service currently provided by the Air Corps at Shannon to Finner, County Donegal, on a 24-hour basis throughout the year once the contract helicopter service has been put in place at Shannon; and, (vi) the deployment of a second Dauphin-helicopter at Cork as soon as practicable, primarily for operation with <i>LE Eithne</i> but to be located at Cork when not embarked on the ship.</P>
    <P>My Department invited tenders for the supply of a search and rescue helicopter service to be based at Shannon Airport. The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 23 October 1990.  An interdepartmental group with outside consultant advice are currently examining the tenders.  I hope to have their recommendation soon.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new division is primarily an integration and reorganisation of existng services.  The co-ordination of local marine emergencies will be devolved to rescue sub-centres at the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head coast radio station and at a new sub-centre to be established in Dublin.  This new regional structure will enable more local knowledge to be brought to bear on emergencies, the integration of marine communications and co-ordination facilities and the devotion of much larger personnel resources to emergency response.</P>
    <P>My Department has also identified the equipment and staffing requirements for the new structure and provision has been made in the 1991 Estimate for Marine for the necessary expenditure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 30 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The number of vessels reported to my Department as having been wrecked on the Irish Coast was six in 1989 and three in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in the area of shipwreck, prevention is preferable to cure.  To this end Ireland has been one of the first countries to sign the International Convention on Salvage, 1989.  This convention, when it comes into force, will greatly strengthen the international law on salvage and increase the amount of money salvors can expect to gain from preventing shipwrecks.  For the first time also the convention puts forward a compensation regime for salvors who, while unsuccessful in the sense of salving property, have nevertheless by their actions prevented or minimised damage to the environment.  The Merchant Shipping Acts will have to be amended to enable <Col N="2181" /> the convention to be ratified.  I am taking the opportunity of the preparation of such legislation to carry out a full-scale review of the law of wreck and salvage to see if the intervention powers of the maritime authorities need to be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Maritime casualties are a constant threat to us by virtue of our island location at the eastern end of the North Atlantic; in the path of the prevailing winds and close to very busy shipping lanes.  Through the operations of the marine emergency response team we have successfully coped with several potential shipwrecks in recent years. These included the <i>Yarrawonga,</i> the <i>Irwell</i> and the <i>Tribulus.</i></P>
    <P>The Doherty Report about to be published has recommended the establishment of a new division of the Department of the Marine which would have responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, for intervention in all types of marine emergency including shipwreck.

      <P>This country is required under various Regulations to supply specified statistical data on prices etc. in the fishing sector to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>Ireland's performance in complying with these regulations was the subject of a number of complaints from the European Commission and legal proceedings were initiated against Ireland in February 1988 in relation to the provision of data on wholesale prices for products frozen on board ship, products frozen on land and fresh fish products.</P>
      <P>During the course of the proceedings the Commission dropped its complaints regarding Ireland's failure to supply data in respect of both categories of frozen product.  It had become apparent that the collection of data in respect of products frozen on land had created very real difficulties in the majority of member states. In addition, in Ireland's case it was recognised by the Commission that the facility to freeze products on board ship did not exist at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in relation to fresh products required that Ireland submit, twice monthly, returns of the average daily <Col N="2183" /> prices and total quantities landed and withdrawn for a range of products.  The court in this respect found that Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under the relevant regulations.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Regulation which has created so many problems for the majority of member states will be replaced with effect from 1 January, 1991 and I do not anticipate any difficulties in complying with this new Regulation which will be fully implemented.  Under the new Regulation a lesser administrative burden is imposed in that returns of average monthly prices for the products concerned will be made on a monthly and six monthly basis.</P>

      <P>I dealt in detail with the subject of the Celtic Sea herring fishery in my contribution to the Adjournment Debate on 4 December 1990.</P>
      <P>The objective of fishery management in this fishery is to set an annual catch which will enable stocks to recover to a level which will allow the maximum annual rate of exploition which would be sustainable in the longer term.  The achievement of that objective would best ensure the long term interests of all fishermen and processors.</P>
      <P>The stocks at the moments are not in a great state.  The quota for this year was 15,120 tonnes.  The European Commission have proposed on the basis of scientific advice that the quota for 1991 be reduced to 10,800 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be pressing at the forthcoming Fisheries Council for a substantial <Col N="2184" /> improvement on the Commission proposal. At last year's December Council the Commission proposed a quota of 12,960 tonnes but on the basis of a very forceful case advanced by me increased the final quota to 15,120 tonnes.</P>

A computer-based system is used to prepare 97 per cent of these repayment cheques and they are issued within six working days of receipt by the CollectorGeneral of the certificate of the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, it is necessary to prepare the remaining 3 per cent of cheques manually.  In 1990 the issue of these cheques was subject to delays varying from ten to thirty-five, and averaging fifteen, working days after the Collector-General received the Inspector of Taxes' certificate.  Following recent changes in work practices the delay in issuing these manual cheques has been reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained on a number of previous occasions the background to national licensing policy.  I would refer the Deputy in particular to the Adjournment Debate on 31 May 1990 and subsequent press release &mdash; a copy of which follows.  In August of 1989 I imposed a total embargo on the issue of new licences except where prior written commitments had been given.</P>
      <P>Policy has evolved since then to the point where licences, other than licences for vessels engaged in aquaculture or bivalve fishing or certain vessels which have been approved by the European Commission, are granted only to those who are able to meet the condition of withdrawing from the current sea fishing boat register tonnage equal to the tonnage of their new vessel.  In addition they must be able to satisfy me on the following criteria: (a) that the new vessel is safe and seaworthy; (b) that the skipper/crew will be duly qualified in accordance with relevant legislation; (c) that no decommissioning grant shall have been paid in respect of the new vessel; and (d) proof of ownership.</P>
      <P>I must also be satisfied that the economic and social benefits arising from the exploitation of the target species of the boats involved will accrue primarily to the coastal regions and communities which the quotas concerned are designed to benefit.  A total of 19 sea fishing boat licences have been issued this year.  Six licences have issued based on these criteria. Three further licences were issued to new owners of vessels within the existing fleet upon transfer of ownership of these vessels.  The remaining ten licences were issued on foot of written commitments given prior to the coming into effect of the embargo referred to above.</P>
      <P>It is long-established policy not to disclose the details of individual applications received or licences granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with this question it is, I feel, essential to remind Deputies of the <Col N="2187" /> overall framework within which the future issue of sea-fishing boat licences must be handled.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it has to be recognised that there are segments of our fishing fleet where there is clear over-capacity.  To allow uncontrolled access into these segments would simply undermine the viability of existing fishermen and add to the already severe pressures on scarce fish stocks.  Future licensing policy must, therefore, take cognisance of this situation in the interests of the industry as a whole.  As Deputies will be aware, it has already been established policy for some years now only to allow boats enter the pelagic and beamer fleets where equivalent tonnage is being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Second, there are major constraints on capacity arising from European Community fishing fleet policy.  That policy is designed to address the problem of the serious over-capacity which exists in the Community as a whole.  Recently there was an additional cause for concern arising from the fact that the fishing fleet of East Germany is double the size of the Federal German fleet.  Herr Von Geldern, the Federal German Fisheries Minister on a visit to Dublin two weeks ago reassured me that a united Germany would not be making any extra demand on quotas.  For this relief, much thanks. All Member States are required to reduce their fleet capacities by 3 per cent below the end 1984 level.  This requirement poses very real difficulties for a number of Member States, including Ireland, whose fleets had increased since 1984.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case, the cutback in capacity requires that the fleet be reduced to 43,941 gross registered tonnes by the end of 1991.  To date we have achieved the interim target of 57,355 tonnes set for the end of 1989.  A substantial further reduction of about 6,000 tonnes is required by the end of 1990 to be followed next year by another of about the same order.  I am not happy with these restrictions and will continue to fight to have them revised.  However, the same restrictions apply to all Member States.  Moreover, there are linkages with other <Col N="2188" /> elements of policy and specifically the availability of significant financial assistance for the fishery sector generally.</P>
    <P>Countries which fail to reduce the GRT will not receive any financial aid from structural funds to modernise and refurbish their fleet.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that the scope for allowing new entrants into the fleet is strictly limited.  Future decisions and policy guidelines to be applied in the assessment of licence applications must be consistent as far as possible with available unexploited fishing opportunities and be consistent as far as possible with EC parameters.</P>
    <P>Against that background future licensing policy must of necessity be highly selective.  In that context it is inevitable that in future licences will be issued generally on a replacement basis in the first instance.  The rate of replacement will be determined primarily by the types of vessels involved and the species to be fished.</P>
    <P>That is the general policy that has been recommended to me by an expert group which I set up last year to advise on this issue.</P>
    <P>I have, however, on hands some 240 applications seeking licences for boats which in aggregate would amount to about 18,000 tonnes or the equivalent of about a third of the existing fleet.  Clearly only a small fraction of these applications will be successful.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware I recently established a special Vetting Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary of my Department to examine the applications on hand in the light of the general policy guidelines to apply for the future.</P>
    <P>I am now advised by that committee that, on the basis of a 100 replacement policy only a handful of licences is allowable. These are to be issued shortly.</P>
    <P>It is evident to me, and I am supported in this by scientific advice, that there are unexploited fishing opportunities available particularly in the white fish sector in deep waters which existing boats cannot catch.  I am now specifically addressing the question of how best to structure my decisions on licensing policy so as to on <Col N="2189" /> the one hand facilitate the catching of these unexploited resources while on the other respecting the wider EC constraints.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my sole objective in deciding on licences is to safeguard the long term interests of Irish fishermen and of the Irish fishing industry as a whole.</P>

      <P>The employee concerned was awarded sums under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  As the employer failed to pay the awards, the employee referred the matter to my Department in accordance with the provisions of these Acts whereby the Minister for Labour is empowered to institute proceedings for the recovery of such sums.  It was found that the employer company had been struck from the Register of Companies in January, 1989 and legal searches revealed no assets in its ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal advice was sought on the question of instituting proceedings against the employer.  The advice received recommended against exercising the options which are available to me in law in these circumstances to enforce payment. Unfortunately, the prospects of recovery do not appear to be optimistic.  However, my Department are currently examining <Col N="2192" /> the situation further and will be in contact with the employee's solicitor in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, introduced a wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking. The basic approach taken in the Act is to make it as difficult as possible for a person under 18 years of age lawfully to purchase alcohol, or to consume or be in possession of it elsewhere than in a private residence.  The operation of the controls contained in the Act is being carefully monitored.  There are indications that they are having a beneficial effect and the situation is being kept under review.</P>
      <P>Legal measures on their own cannot, of course, provide a solution to the problem of under-age drinking.  Social, cultural and economic factors are involved and abroadly based approach to the problem is required.  Involvement of parents and local communities is essential to the reduction of the incidence of under-age drinking.  The gardaí are more than willing to assist and co-operate with local initiatives to deal with the problem and in certain instances they have played a prominent part in organising legal programmes to deal with abuse of alcohol and other substances by young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education of young people about alcohol is also crucial and my colleague the Minister for Health gave full details of <Col N="2194" /> programmes that are now under way in this area when replying to a question by Deputy Tom Kitt on 25 October last.  I might also mention that under-age drinking is a significant factor in the behaviour of a considerable number of young offenders, as indeed excessive drinking is with their parents.  The probation and welfare service in my own Department have a proven record in developing alcohol education programmes and these will form an integral part of the specialised, community based initiatives to rehabilitate young offenders which, as I recently announced, are being undertaken by the service.</P>
