    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have noted the Supreme Court decision referred to.  In reply to a Question in the House on 3 May 1988, I referred Deputies to paragraph 5.7 of the report of the New Ireland Forum, which was endorsed by all the parties participating in it.  This states:</P>
      <P>The particular structure of political unity which the forum would wish to see established in a unitary state, achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the Nationalist and Unionist identies.</P>
      <P>As I said at the time it is not possible, at Question Time, to attempt to set out any exhaustive set of steps towards achievement of the form of unity wished for by the parties to the Forum, except to say that such measures would in my view have to meet the requirements set out in chapter 5 of the Forum report.</P>
      <P>These requirements would, among others, include:</P>
      <P>a total cessation of violence which can have no place in the building of the Ireland of the future that we all desire; constructive dialogue with Unionists in Northern Ireland; accommodation of the two traditions, their aspirations and their loyalties; an all-round constitutional conference to formulate new structures.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy and actions under the Anglo-Irish Agreement are in accordance with those requirements and I have made it clear that I would be willing to meet Unionists at any time to discuss their concerns.  Such a meeting should take place without preconditions and without prejudice to the Unionist position on the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach has said and it sums up my point of view. I should like him to reply clearly to the subject matter of my question.  The <Col N="2191" /> Government, and all the parties in the House, want to achieve the unity of Ireland only by peaceful means and with the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland and I should like to know if the Taoiseach will agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my position on the matter which I think is absolutely clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept what I have said, that all the parties in the House, and the Government, only wish to see the unity of Ireland achieved by peaceful means and with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Barry has said in relation to peace and the consent of the majority.  In relation to the recent decision of the Supreme Court, the fact that as far back as 1965 when the Constitutional Review Committee recommended that Articles 2 and 3 be changed, and the fact that the Unionist members have constantly stated they have problems in relation to Articles 2 and 3, I should like to ask the Taoiseach if the Government will now consider <Col N="2192" /> bringing in amendments or consider changes in relation to Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Government have no such plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if has examined the implications of the Supreme Court decision and its impact on Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Taoiseach referred to the New Ireland Forum but he will be aware that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is agreement between two states.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement clearly states that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland and yet the Supreme Court decision is that Articles 2 and 3 place an obligation on the State to seek unity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach feel that there is a contradiction between those three Articles?  Will he indicate if that has been considered? What is his response to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not see any inconsistency.  As I see it, the Supreme Court have outlined the position as I have always understood it to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it has been declared by virtually all parties in the House that they regard Articles 2 and 3 as the declaration of an aspiration, and that the Supreme Court have said that it is a legal responsibility on the State to pursue those aspirations or objectives, will the Taoiseach consider, bearing in mind that the Unionist leadership have constantly stated that both Articles are offensive to them, reviewing how those Articles may be changed to declare themselves as an aspiration and not a legal obligation, as the Supreme Court have stated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I regard <Col N="2193" /> the decision of the Supreme Court as outlining the position as I have always understood it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the fact, as I understand it, that the Taoiseach will have an opportunity in the very near future to meet Unionists.  I suggest that he say to them that, in circumstances where political agreement was reached as a result of negotiations and that that package of agreement was put to the people North and South in referenda, that endorsement of the package would have fundamental implications for existing constitutional arrangements, including Articles 2 and 3 and that in those circumstances, the best thing the Unionists could do would be to immediately enter into discussions with himself and with the other Nationalist constitutional party?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach in view of the difference of opinion offered by the Supreme Court a fortnight ago and that offered by them in 1977, if he would consider establishing a committee of this House to look at the Constitution again to see, in the light of the contradiction between those two interpretations, whether any amendments could be necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat my statement made at the time of the New Ireland Forum &mdash; and the Deputy will recall it &mdash; if we had a situation where both parts of Ireland could be brought together in some way that would certainly call for an entirely new Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking, in the narrow <Col N="2194" /> sense, about the difference of interpretation given by the Supreme Court in 1977 and again this year.  Would the Taoiseach, in those circumstances, set up an all party committee to look again at the Constitution to see if amendments are necessary or could be proposed with the agreement of all Members of the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Article 15.13 of the Constitution states that when a Member of either House is going to or returning from the House the only circumstances in which he may be arrested is for treason, felony or breach of the peace.  In the case of other offences he may not be arrested.</P>
      <P>The immunity given by Article 15 to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas is of long standing &mdash; Article 18 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State provided an identical immunity &mdash; and has in fact been regarded as a necessary protection for the Oireachtas from interference with its proceedings by the Executive or its agents.</P>
      <P>There may be a case to have the constitutional principle more precisely defined by legislation.  If this view is widely held I would be happy to have that question examined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that there has recently been a case where it appears that this privilege may have <Col N="2196" /> been abused?  Can the Taoiseach confirm for me that it would be improper for this House, or, indeed, for the Government, to make rules or regulations interpreting that particular Article in the Constitution? Can the Taoiseach tell us whether there is any means open to the Government under which the Supreme Court could be asked to give a clearer more detailed interpretation of what that provision can actually be taken to mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that would be a very sensible way to proceed. I think it would be a matter primarily for this House to look into these matters if that is the wish.  There are a number of principles outlined in the Constitution which are subsequently elaborated on by legislation.  The legislation indicates how the particular principle should be given effect to or implemented.  If the wish of the House is that this particular constitutional provision, which I must again emphasise is here for the protection of Members of this House basically against any possible interference by an Executive at some stage with their privileges, should be more precisely elaborated, refined or defined, then that is something we might look at through some House mechanism, such as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and then decide whether we should legislate in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would accept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to accept that there is a view in this House that that particular provision needs clearer definition and specification. Would the Taoiseach accept &mdash; and I would like to have his advice on this <Col N="2197" /> matter &mdash; that it would be improper for this House to take on itself the rôle of interpreting the Constitution?  Would he not also accept that in all the cases in the Constitution where a constitutional provision is interpreted or elaborated on by legislation, specific provision is made for that in the Article of the Constitution? That is not the case in this instance.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House whether there is a mechanism available either to the House, as he suggests, or to the Supreme Court which can be used in order to give a clearer definition of what is intended in that Article?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal way that would be explored would be if a case were brought all the way up to the Supreme Court and then through the normal judicial court procedures, the Supreme Court would interpret the particular constitutional provision.  That would be the usual way of proceeding.  I am not suggesting that this House should attempt to interpret the Constitution; what I am suggesting is that there may be some case for elaborating by legislation the implementation, operation and the circumstances in which this particular constitutional provision would operate. There may be a case for doing that by legislation, but that is different from interpreting the principle in the Constitution. The situation might then be that the Supreme Court, in due course, would decide whether the legislation we enacted to elaborate the constitutional principle was in itself constitutional.  However, I think it is something that could be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that minor infractions, such as breach of the peace, are not offences from which a Deputy or Senator can be exempt?  Would he also accept that the application of the rule in the context of drunk driving, or alleged drunk driving, <Col N="2198" /> or a refusal to give specimens, are clearly offences not contemplated by the Article? Would he consider those facts to represent an abuse?  May I ask the Taoiseach in the context of the recent case does the Taoiseach as Leader of the Party of which that person is a member, intend taking any particular action to bring his views to bear on members of his party about the use of this privilege?</P>

It would be entirely inappropriate for me &mdash; following Deputy Dukes's line of argument &mdash; to attempt to give an interpretation of a constitutional provision.  The constitutional provision is clearly stated but we might consider, if we think it desirable, whether that clear statement of principle in the Constitution should be further defined by law.  That is a reasonable approach.</P>

      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women will shortly be appointed.  The commission will be broadly based, representative of a wide range of knowledge and experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following are the terms of reference of the commission: to review the implementation of the recommendations of the first Commission on the Status of Women as set out in that commission's report to the Minister for Finance in December 1972; to consider and make recommendations on the means, administrative and legislative, by which women will be able to participate on equal terms <Col N="2204" /> and conditions with men in economic, social, political and cultural life and, to this end, to consider the efficacy and feasibility of positive action measures; in the context of (ii) above, to pay special attention to the needs of women in the home; to establish the estimated costs of all recommendations made; and to report to the Government within a period of 18 months from the date of its establishment.</P>

      <P>One of my queries related to whether a budget would be provided for the committee and asked if the Taoiseach would indicate what it might be.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would indicate that?  Will he also incorporate as one of the priority areas for investigation, the position of women part-time workers?  Most part-time workers in this State are women and most are without the protection of social legislation and they are being extremely badly exploited. This is an area which needs urgent attention. Will the Taoiseach address that question and also the question relating to the fact that there are 280,000 women in this State who are living on £48 a week or less, below the poverty line?  Will he include that as a priority for this commission?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference held in London on 2 March reviewed developments in a number of areas relating to confidence in the security forces.  In the course of this discussion, I raised the recent &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme which contained deeply disturbing revelations about the UDR.  These are issues which have for a long time now been a source of deep <Col N="2210" /> anxiety to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and to successive Governments here.  In particular, I conveyed to the Secretary of State the Government's deep concern about some of the remarks made by the former Chief Constable of the RUC and by the present Commander of the UDR.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the issues which the &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; programme highlighted and brought to wider attention are quite fundamental and need to be urgently addressed.  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to press the British authorities on the issues in question at future meetings of the Conference.</P>
      <P>The representations made by Deputy Currie in relation to the unaccompanied UDR patrol on the Pomeroy-Donaghmore Road were raised in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and an explanation sought as to why it was not accompanied by the police.  In response to our having raised the case the British authorities have informed us that the patrol consisted of three UDR teams and that they were accompanied by one policeman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The British authorities have speculated that the policeman may not have been with the group referred to in Deputy Currie's question.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government remain very concerned about the unsatisfactory rate of accompaniment of UDR patrols and our dissatisfaction in this matter has been forcefully conveyed to the British Government through the Anglo-Irish Conference and Secretariat.  The issue was most recently discussed, and our concern again conveyed, at the Conference meeting on 2 March.  This meeting also took note of the progress made by the working group established following the meeting of the Conference on 18 October 1989 and charged with making early recommendations on the implementation of the principle of accompaniment.  The work of this group is continuing.</P>

The explanation given that the three patrols were accompanied by one policeman is not satisfactory given the time of the night and the area in which this encounter took place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the two Covenants elaborated on the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human rights.  Ireland ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights on 8 December 1989. On the same date Ireland acceded to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights. On 8 March 1990, these Covenants entered into force for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decide on the ratification of international legal instruments following a full examination of what legislative or other measures may be necessary to allow Ireland become a party to <Col N="2214" /> the instrument.  The Government may deem a reservation necessary where constitutional, legislative or other considerations might conflict with the full application of a provision of the instrument in question.  The effect of a reservation is to limit the application of an element of the instrument to Ireland. This may be necessary, for example, to enable the completion of legislative measures enabling full compliance with the instrument.</P>
    <P>In the case of the international instruments, it was considered necessary to make a number of reservations which I will now outline.  These reservations were made in the light of certain provisions of our Constitution, of long-standing Government policies, and of legislative considerations.</P>
    <P>The reservations to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural rights are as follows: The first reservation is on Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Covenant which relates to discrimination on the basis of, among other things, language. In the context of Government policy to foster, promote and encourage the use of the Irish language by all appropriate means, the Government reserved the right to require, or give favourable consideration to, a knowledge of the Irish language for certain occupations.  The reservation arises from Government policy in regard to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The second reservation is on Article 13, paragraph 2 (a), which deals with compulsory primary education.  While Ireland recognises the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide for the education of children, and, while the State's obligation to provide for free primary education and for requiring that children receive a certain minimum education is recognised, the Government nevertheless reserved the right to allow parents to provide for the education of their children in their homes provided that certain minimum standards are observed.</P>
    <P>The right to free primary education is guaranteed by Article 42.4 of the Constitution. While Article 42.1 of the Constitution refers to the duty of parents to <Col N="2215" /> provide for the education of their children Article 42.2 specifically leaves them free to provide this education in their homes, in private or in State schools. Article 42.3 prohibits the State from obliging parents, in violation of their conscience and lawful preference, to send their children to schools established by the State or to any particular type of school designated by the State.  It can be argued that the provision in the Covenant referring to compulsory primary education does not preclude the possibility that this may be provided in the home. However, Article 13.3 of the Covenant specifically recognises the right of the parents to choose schools for their children but makes no reference to their right to provide that education themselves.  It was deemed prudent for the State to make a reservation in relation to parental rights because if compulsory education were to be interpreted to mean solely education provided in the schools the obligation under the Article and the Covenant could not be met by the State without an amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Covenant on Civil and Political rights the Government made the following reservations: First, the Government made a Declaration on Article 6, Paragraph 5 which deals with the death penalty for minors.  The Government declared that, pending the introduction of further legislation to give full effect to the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 6, should a case arise which is not covered by the provisions of existing law, the Government will have regard to its obligations under the Covenant in the exercise of its power to advise commutation of the sentence of death.  This declaration reflects the Government's intention to introduce legislation removing the death penalty from the statute books.</P>
    <P>Second, with regard to Article 10, paragraph 2, which deals with the detention of accused persons, our reservation noted that while the Government accept the principles and implement them as far as practically possible, they reserve the right <Col N="2216" /> to regard full implementation of these principles as objectives to be achieved progressively.</P>
    <P>Although every effort is made to keep remand prisoners separate from convicted prisoners and to achieve the segregation of juveniles from adults, the pressure on accommodation in recent years has made this difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>Third, with regard to Article 14, which concerns the right to legal assistance and to legal review and compensation for miscarriage of justice, the Government reserved the right to have minor offences against military law dealt with summarily in accordance with current procedures which may not, in all respects, conform to the requirements of the Article.</P>
    <P>Ireland also made the reservation that the provision of compensation for the miscarriage of justice in the circumstances contemplated in paragraph 6 of Article 14 may be by administrative procedure rather than pursuant to specific legal provisions.</P>
    <P>While the statutory procedures for the trial by court-martial of offences against military law conform to those contained in Article 14, except for paragraph 6 which is already the subject of a reservation, the procedures for the investigation and summary trial of offences (contained in sections 177 to 180 of the Defence Act, 1954) cannot be said to do so in all respects.  Unless a capital charge or a charge of murder is involved, legal representation is not allowed at a preliminary investigation or at a summary trial.  Furthermore, there is no right to review of conviction or sentence arising from a summary trial except in so far as is provided for in section 180.  It was considered that the reservation was appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of Article 14 requires that a person whose conviction is reversed or who is pardoned on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice shall have a right to be compensated according to law.  At present there is no such right in Irish law although it has been the practice to pay compensation in such cases on an <i>ex <Col N="2217" /> gratia</i> basis.  In the absence of appropriate legislation it was considered prudent to enter a reservation under this Article.</P>
    <P>The fourth reservation concerns Article 19, paragraph 2, which deals with freedom of expression.  Here, the Government reserved the right to confer a monopoly on or require the licensing of broadcasting enterprises, because the State monopoly on broadcasting or broadcasting licensing systems might be regarded as contrary to the provisions of this Article.</P>
    <P>The fifth reservation, on Article 20, paragraph 1 on the prohibition of propaganda for war, stated that Ireland accepts the principle of this provision and implements it as far as is practicable.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, having regard to the difficulties in formulating a specific offence capable of adjudication at national level in such a form as to reflect the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations as well as the right to freedom of expression, Ireland reserved the right to postpone consideration of the possibility of introducing some legislative addition to, or variation of, existing law until such time as it may consider that such is necessary for the attainment of the objective of the paragraph.</P>
    <P>There is no existing provision of Irish law which prohibits propaganda for war. If legislation were introduced, a reservation might still be necessary unless propaganda for war in all circumstances were prohibited, as it is unclear whether this article outlaws all propaganda for war or only propaganda for war in contravention of international law.  War is permitted by international law in certain circumstances, for example, in exercise of the right to self-defence (Article 51 of the UN Charter).</P>
    <P>The extent to which the provision of Article 20, paragraph 1, is compatible with the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 19 of the Covenant was also considered.  A number of States have entered reservations to Article 20, paragraph 1, on the grounds that it is not compatible, while others stated that they did not accept the obligations set out in Article 20, paragraph 1.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2218" /> The UN Human rights Committee has adopted general comments on Article 20 strongly expressing the view that the required prohibitions are fully compatible with the right to freedom of expression &ldquo;the exercise of which carries with it special duties and responsibilities&rdquo;, and the text of Ireland's reservation takes account of this.</P>
    <P>The sixth reservation is on Article 23, paragraph 4, which deals with the dissolution of marriage.  Our reservation states that Ireland accepts the obligations of this paragraph on the understanding that that provision does not imply any right of spouses to obtain a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>Although the last sentence of paragraph 4, which reads &ldquo;In the case of dissolution, provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any children&rdquo;, may be considered to be concerned solely with the situation which arises on the dissolution of marriage, without in itself implying recognition of any right to a dissolution of marriage, it was considered that the making of an interpretative declaration in relation to divorce would be prudent.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government made a reservation to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights to state that Ireland does not accept the competence of the Human rights Committee, established under the Covenant, to consider a communication from an individual if the matter has already been considered under another procedure of international investigation or settlement.</P>
    <P>This reservation, which has been made by a number of other countries, ensures that the possibility of complaints being made to two separate international bodies in respect of the same issue will be avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Is it the intention of the Government to regard the reservations in relation to legislation as a legislative programme?  In other words, are these reservations to be allowed stand?  An interesting phrase used <Col N="2219" /> throughout the answer is &ldquo;achieved progressively&rdquo;. Many people will say that means some time in the future.  The question I want the Minister to answer is the one in relation to Article 19.  As I understand it listening to the reservations mentioned, no reservation has been submitted by the Irish Government concerning the right of access to information and to transmit information in relation, for example, to abortion referral.  In this regard I take it that any citizen who wishes to either transmit or receive such information would be perfectly within his or her rights as now recognised by Ireland.</P>

      <P>With regard to the second part of the question as to why reservations on other matters were not introduced, if the Deputy gives me a list of the reservations he feels should have been considered, we will deal with that separately.  The Deputy asked whether I would outline the reservations made in our recent signing of the Convention and the reasons for such.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The process of developing a closer relationship between the EC and EFTA has been under way for some time and is an important agenda item for the Irish Presidency.  During preparations for the Presidency I visited Sweden &mdash; which is the current EFTA Presidency &mdash; in October and had talks in Dublin in December with the Swedish Minister for Foreign Trade.  As the House will know, the Taoiseach met Prime Minister Carlsson yesterday.  We are also maintaining close contact with the other EFTA States: indeed, I have just come from a meeting with Austrian Foreign Minister Dr. Mock.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the Community and the EFTA countries, which are so close politically economically and culturally, is a co-operative and harmonious one.  Each of the two groups is the other's largest trading partner and co-operation already extends over a number of sectors.  What is in question now is the further enhancement of relations through the creation of a European Economic Space with common rules on a range of matters and in which there would be free movement of goods, services, capital and persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> Exploratory talks have been taking place between the Commission and EFTA officials on the possible scope of a new agreement between the EC and EFTA and on the legal and institutional aspects.  There is acceptance of the need for each side to retain full autonomy of decision making in any new arrangement. A joint meeting of EC and EFTA Foreign Ministers on 19 December expressed satisfaction with the preparatory work carried out so far and agreed that formal negotiations should begin as soon as possible in the first half of 1990 with the aim of concluding them as rapidly as possible. It will be necessary for the Council of Ministers to approve a mandate for the Commission to enter into these negotiations. Before the Council can act it requires a proposal from the Commission. It is my hope that the Council, under our Presidency, will act expeditiously on such a proposal once it has been received from the Commission.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received any representations from members of the public or from public representatives, regarding the attitude of personnel in the United States Embassy in Dublin dealing with inquiries concerning visa applications; if he intends to make any representations to the embassy regarding the need for a more helpful approach; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received some representations from members of the public and from public representatives concerning the attitude of personnel in the US Embassy in Dublin dealing with visa inquiries.  The embassy have informed my Department that if individuals have such complaints, the embassy will be pleased to deal directly with the complainant and have the matter fully investigated. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that this is a matter for the embassy and that the embassy must deal with visa applications on the basis of US immigration law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2222" />
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is widespread dissatisfaction on the part of both members of the public and public representatives at their inability to find anybody in the visa office willing to co-operate with inquiries as to progress on passports or visas being processed? Our senior civil servants seem to feel, to put it mildly, that co-operation is not as would be expected particularly from a so-called friendly country.  Will the Minister make representations to the American Embassy to nominate a senior official of whom civil inquiries could be made on behalf of members of the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress again that it is a matter for the US Embassy to decide how they wish to handle representations.  I understand, however, that all written complaints about visas are normally referred to the US Consul for his personal attention.  With regard to the suggestion in the second part of the supplementary question as to whether it is true that officials &mdash; senior civil servants from my Department, I presume &mdash; sometimes have difficulty with the attitude of the embassy officials, I must reject that allegation.  Officials of my Department are in frequent contact with the embassy and have found the embassy helpful in giving reasons based on US immigration law for particular decisions on visa applications.  I am sure the Deputy will share with me the realisation that US consular officials have relatively little discretion under US immigration law and must have a legal basis for all decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that many visa applicants would be reluctant to complain about what they would regard as insensitive treatment of their inquiries because they feel it may rebound on their applications?  Can he assure the House that that would not be the case and that complaints can be made freely?  Has he made any representations to the US Government with regard to the interpretation of US law on visas?  I have received quite a number of representations, and I know others have too, about how strictly this obligation of <Col N="2223" /> having a base to return to in Ireland is applied.  I am speaking specifically about holiday visas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again it is a matter for the US Embassy officials to decide how they wish to handle representations.  All written complaints are brought to the Consul's personal attention and examined by him.  If the Deputy has any case in mind I suggest he bring it to the attention of the embassy.  In fairness to them I should say that their job is to administer US domestic legislation in relation to visas and they are under no legal obligation to respond to representations from public representatives of another jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the case being made here by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Byrne is totally exaggerated because when you are dealing with perhaps 70,000 to 100,000 visa applications there are bound to be some people who feel they are badly done by? It is not as if you were dealing with visas to go to some South American country. This is the country to which most Irish people go where it is necessary to have a visa.  It is very wrong to bring it on to the floor of this House when it is a matter of internal US management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the background to this question from Deputy Byrne, an application was made for a B2 tourist visa less than two weeks before departure and the application was being handled through the post.  This visa application would not be the centre of the issue if the person realised that what he or she was hoping to achieve in two weeks takes longer and had gone in person or applied earlier.  We have to be fair.  There are quite a number of applications to be processed and something might go wrong through no fault of the American Embassy staff.  For instance, somebody might be disappointed at the delay &mdash; it may be a legitimate delay or a postal delay &mdash; and fail to understand that the embassy have <Col N="2224" /> an obligation to process applications as they arrive rather than trying to find the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that any intervention by public representatives would not be made in an effort to influence a decision about granting visas?  The problem is that when some difficulty arises there is nobody we can contact.  I am referring to genuine cases regarding invitations to weddings and matters of that kind.  We cannot contact people to find out how to comply with the regulations.  Nobody is trying to change the regulations; we are only trying to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate, as would any public representative, that delays can take place not only in relation to the issue of visas for the United States but in relation to other matters also.  If I were accepting an invitation to a wedding in the United States I do not think I would wait until two weeks beforehand to apply for a visa.  Neither would Deputy Ferris. If people recognised that there is a certain timespan required for the satisfactory processing of a visa application, a lot of the difficulties would disappear overnight. With regard to a genuine case where something goes wrong, I am quite satisfied that if any public representative or any person writes formally to the United States Embassy the matter will be brought to the attention of the Consul and dealt with by him personally.  I do <Col N="2225" /> not think anybody believes there is any question of political influence having a bearing on any decision made by the staff of the United States Embassy in regard to visa applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When one considers the importance to certain individuals of fulfilling their obligations to Aer Lingus or other holiday commitments, is it not slightly bloodyminded of the officials in the American Embassy to be so bureaucratic in their structures and unco-operative with our own officials, let alone public representatives, even where a visa has been processed and stamped on the passport?  There is no method by which we can intercede and get the passport from the bureaucratic tube, even though we know the visa has been stamped on the passport.  There is no simple method of extricating those passports, inclusive of the visas, in emergency cases.  That is why I am asking the Minister to make representations to the American Embassy to nominate a senior official to whom emergency cases can be put and from whom we can receive a civil response.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think it might be helpful if his Department, the Department of Tourism and Transport, the American Embassy or individual Deputies would contact the travel agents in their area advising them to inform people booking passage to America that it takes three weeks to get a visa and that they should apply in time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the concern of Deputy Byrne.  The embassy, having been contacted by the Consular section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, said that all postal applications received on that day had been processed and sent for dispatch by post.  That is as far as they could go.  One has to recognise that this was the end of their obligation.  It was in the postal system.  It is a bit unreal to <Col N="2226" /> expect officials in the US Embassy to start chasing through the postal system.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 33, 15, 18 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the elections in Nicaragua, the twelve member states of the EC issued a joint statement on 27 February in which they welcomed the holding of elections in Nicaragua in a free and fair <Col N="2227" /> fashion, in conformity with the undertakings given by the Nicaraguan Government in the context of the peace process in Central America.  They warmly congratulated the new President-elect, and welcomed the commitment made by both sides to work for national reconciliation. They expressed the hope that the outcome of the elections would expedite the advancement of the peace process in Central America, and in particular that the demobilisation of the Nicaraguan resistance could now proceed in compliance with the terms of the agreements reached by the countries of the region. They reaffirmed their commitment to intensify co-operation with the Central American countries, with the aim of supporting economic development and social progress in the interests of greater political stability.  Ireland is of course fully associated with this statement, on which as Presidency we had the co-ordinating role.</P>
    <P>The Government have maintained cordial relations with the Government of Nicaragua, and expect to continue to do so with the incoming government.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Twelve regularly express their concern about human rights violations where this is called for. I would consider it premature however to raise the matter with the incoming government in Nicaragua, as I have no reason to anticipate that it will engage in violation of human rights.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the EC provides assistance to the countries of Central America, including Nicaragua, under the terms of the Economic Co-operation Agreement concluded in 1987. The level and allocation of this aid are determined in annual discussions with the countries concerned.  The next such discussion will take place at the San Jose VI Conference in Dublin on 9-10 April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Community have recognised the achievement of what were the Opposition parties in Nicaragua in winning the election.  I put this question to the Taoiseach last week and did not get a reply.  I got a sort of <Col N="2228" /> snide comment.  A delegation from this House attended the election process in Nicaragua three or four weeks ago.  Why should we send a delegation to observe such elections if that delegation do not report back to this House?  Surely some provision should be made whereby a report can be made by that delegation, who I am sure will be glad to make such a report and have it debated here.  Would the Minister endeavour to see that such a process is followed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that if the Whips of the parties give consideration to this, time will be found for the presentation of such a report in this House, which I personally would welcome.  We would all benefit from any debate on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply to the last question, which I can assure him will be responded to by the members of the delegation.  The statement of 27 February used a phrase which I hope I misheard.  The phrase I refer to is &ldquo;the Nicaraguan resistance&rdquo;. I wonder is there any chance that the Minister is referring to the hired mercenaries known as the Contras who have been raping, murdering and terrorising the citizens of Nicaragua for a number of years?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this phrase to the House.</P>

      <P>The answer as read to the House by the Minister included the phrase &ldquo;the Nicaraguan resistance&rdquo;.  I am referring very specifically to the statement of 27 February.  Does it refer to the 13,000 mercenaries located in Honduras or to the 2,000 who occasionally make advances into northern Nicaragua?  These people have in the last two months killed 15 people in an area of 25,000 people <Col N="2229" /> and indeed they disembowelled one young man.  Is the Minister referring to that band of hired murderers and terrorists as the Nicaraguan resistance?  In what sense are they a resistance?</P>

      <P>At the invitation of President Kaunda of Zambia and on behalf of the Taoiseach, who was unable to go due to other commitments, I travelled to Lusaka to meet Nelson Mandela.  I met Mr. Mandela, who was accompanied by Mr. Walter Sisulu and Mrs. Sisulu, on 28 February.  I told Mr. Mandela how great an honour it was for me to be in Lusaka to celebrate his freedom.  I told him of the high esteem in which he was held in Ireland, as an embodiment of the movement to abolish the odious apartheid system.  I also expressed my admiration for the courage and generosity he had <Col N="2231" /> displayed in his dealings with the South African Government.  I expressed the hope that the Government of South Africa would create the conditions for a national dialogue leading to the dismantlement of the apartheid system and the creation of a new democratic and non-racial South Africa.  I outlined to Mr. Mandela Irish and EC policy on South Africa.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mandela said that my presence in Lusaka was a clear signal of continued support for his people's struggle.  The European attitude of continued support for the efforts of the ANC were, he said, deeply appreciated and the support and interest of the Irish people was particularly helpful.</P>
      <P>I reminded Mr. Mandela of the Taoiseach's invitation to him to visit Ireland. He replied that he was looking forward to making this visit as soon as he could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of associations for the purpose of representing members of the Defence Forces on remuneration and related matters without compromising the essential military systems of command and control.  The new arrangements will give members a representative voice on pay, allowances, grants and pensions and various other matters as well as access to conciliation and arbitration for the first time.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in essence, is an enabling one. Before dealing with the background to it and the main underlying considerations, I shall run through the main provisions.</P>
      <P>Section 1 deals with definitions.  Section 2 provides for the establishment of associations, the scope of their representation and excludes matters such as operations, command and discipline from the scope of such associations.  This section also recognises the right of individuals not to be members of an association and provides that the association will be independent of and will not, without the Minister's consent, be associated with, or affiliated to any trade union or other body.  It also provides that members will not join a trade union or body, other than an association established under the Act, which seeks to influence the remuneration or other conditions of service of members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Section 3 provides that the association will be inoperative during a state of emergency as provided for in section 4 of the Defence Act, 1954.  Section 4 of the Bill deals with circumstances in which the Defence Forces are on active service and section 5 deals with members serving overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person, whether subject to military law or otherwise, is prohibited by section 6 of the Bill from endeavouring to persuade a member of the Defence Forces to join a trade union or other body &mdash; except an association established <Col N="2347" /> under section 2 &mdash; and penalties for a breach of the section by persons not subject to military law are provided for.  Persons who are subject to military law and who are in breach of this section are comprehended by the existing provisions of the Defence Act, 1954.  Sections 7 and 8 are, I think self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill is that last July the Taoiseach anounced two major new developments regarding the Defence Forces.  For the first time ever a completely independent prestigious commission was established to inquire into the remuneration and conditions of service of the Permanent Defence Forces. The deliberations of the commission are proceeding.  On the same occasion the Taoiseach announced that I had instructed the Chief of Staff to make preparations for the establishment of a new structure regarding remuneration and related matters for privates, non-commissioned officers and officers.  Since then considerable study, research and consultation has taken place.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental constitutional and policy issues involved in this matter. The constitutional right to form an association is not an absolute or unqualified right.  Article 40.6.1º provides that laws may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the right &mdash; thus explicitly providing for the limitation of the right.  The courts have made the position very clear in a case involving the Garda Síochána; in Aughey <i>v.</i> Ireland, it was held by the High Court on 29 August 1985 that&mdash;</P>
    <P>the right of association in Article 40.6.1º (iii)  of the Constitution is subject to public order and because of their close connection with the security of the State, Gardaí may have to accept limitation on their right to form associations and unions which other citizens would not have to accept.</P>
    <P>The need to regulate the right applies, I suggest, <i>a fortiori</i> in the case of the armed forces of the country and there can be no question of allowing unregulated development.  This House has a particular <Col N="2348" /> responsibility in that connection since under the Constitution &mdash; Article 15.6.1º &mdash; the right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The supreme command of the Defence Forces is vested in the President under Article 13.4º, and Article 13.5.1º provides that the exercise of the supreme command shall be regulated by law.</P>
    <P>The Constitution, therefore, recognises the unique position of the Defence Forces and the manner in which the State may provide by law for their organisation and control.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the Defence Forces is specifically provided for in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 and the Defence Act, 1954.  It is but one of a number of functions in relation to the Defence Forces the exercise of which, for fundamental reasons, is controlled and regulated.</P>
    <P>This controlled and regulated system of the exercise of command and authority is fundamental to the raising and maintenance of a defence force in a democratic state.  We live in a Parliamentary democracy which implies that the armed forces are subject to civil control.  We have a system which has stood the test of time and any development which involves the creation of a new institutional arrangement in that system has to be examined against the background I have outlined.  It is important to get the balance right.  It is important that members of the Defence Forces feel they have a representative voice in relation to their pay and other conditions of service.  It is equally important to ensure that any developments in this area will not be incompatible with the system of command in the Defence Forces and will not compromise good order and discipline. This matter, therefore, requires careful and mature examination to try to accommodate the legitimate wishes of the members of the Defence Forces with the requirements of the public good.</P>
    <P>A study group was established by the Chief of Staff and members of the group visited Denmark and Italy to study the operation of representative associations <Col N="2349" /> there.  The position in Great Britain was examined also and information was assembled on a number of other countries.</P>
    <P>From the information which is available it is clear that there is great diversity in the arrangements in different countries. A report in March 1988 by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe concluded that the number of member states of the Council of Europe which recognise the military right to form and join trade unions equals the number of member states which do not.</P>
    <P>In any event, while the systems which apply in other countries are of interest, it is necessary that we should try to design a system which is the optimum one for our circumstances.  An important consideration in that connection is the fact that, unlike the majority of other armies in Western Europe, the Permanent Defence Force is an entirely volunteer force.</P>
    <P>It has been repeatedly alleged that there has been no consultation and that a system is being imposed.  The factual position is that from day one in the evolution of the new process I sought to involve those who are affected by the new system: from an early stage any information of a substantive kind was made known to the force through letters issued by the Chief of Staff, press statements and replies to questions in this House.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, three military teams were assembled &mdash; one for officers, one for non-commissioned officers and one for privates &mdash; in connection with the Independent Pay Commission. Early last December I addressed these teams on the representative structure issue as part of the process of consultation which I wished to have undertaken.  Later I prepared a document for dissemination throughout the force and as a basis for discussion with the teams by the military study group which had been set up.  The document contained the broad principles regarding representation and the views of the force were sought on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> Even at this stage the process of consultation is still only in an early phase: consultation is the essence of the new arrangements &mdash; I emphasise this &mdash; and will continue as an integral part of the arrangements.  It is, however, obviously necessary to make a start somewhere and democratic elections, by secret ballot, will form a sound basis on which to proceed. There is absolutely no question of a system of representation being imposed on Defence Forces personnel without consultation and in essence this is an enabling Bill.  In order to avoid any misunderstanding or confusion on this issue, I wish to emphasise that the structures to be put in place will be the subject of discussion, consultation and agreement with the duly elected representatives after the first election.  As regards the structures, what is involved here is the question of the number of representative associations, the number of representatives, their distribution geographically and the practical arrangements throughout the Permanent Defence Force.  In sum the entire representative structure, in all its aspects, will be the first business for discussion with the duly elected representatives.  I attach particular importance to this; there can be no question of an imposed structure which would be counter-productive and would do more harm than good.  Once the democratic process under the protection of the legislation is gone through, real dialogue on this central issue will take place.  The structures once agreed will then and only then be incorporated in regulations which will be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To avoid doubt, I wish to add here that the formal establishment of the associations and the making of the relevant Defence Force regulations will not take place until after the consultations and dialogue to which I have referred and the various issues involved have been resolved.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, in broad outline, what is envisaged, is that the associations will represent members in relation to remuneration &mdash; pay, allowances, gratuities, grants and pensions &mdash; and other matters to be prescribed by <Col N="2351" /> regulations.  Their role will also include welfare matters such as credit unions, recreational facilities, medical benefit schemes and family support systems, on the same lines as the Garda representative bodies which are also protected by legislation and regulation.</P>
    <P>Spokespersons for the associations will be permitted to make statements to the news media on matters which fall within their mandate and the associations will be permitted to raise money by subscription, in addition to receiving certain facilities by way of accommodation and staffing from the Department.  A system of conciliation and arbitration will be provided for the first time which goes beyond any demand or request made by anyone in the Defence Forces in recent times. This is the most important initiative I am now proposing to put in place &mdash; a system of conciliation and arbitration which compares with the system that obtains in regard to the Garda Síochána and in regard to the public service generally. The real power that the new representative bodies will have will be that they can do more than just make representations and suggestions.  They will be permanent participants in the conciliation and arbitration regime such as has obtained successfully in the public service generally.</P>
    <P>Last week the Chief of Staff circulated a detailed booklet outlining the military proposals for the new system.  I hope that this booklet, copies of which I have made available in the Dáil Library and sent to Deputies, will be studied in detail by each Deputy and individual member of the Permanent Defence Force to whom it has been sent.  I hope it will form the basis of widespread constructive discussion towards the final resolution of the question and the establishment of the representative structure.</P>
    <P>Throughout the entire process the Government have sought to avoid a situation where democratic procedures might be pre-empted.  Every opportunity will be accorded to the duly elected representatives to participate in the formulation and finalisation of the arrangements <Col N="2352" /> which can then be incorporated in regulations. The process of establishing the necessary structure on a statutory basis will prevent the development of a proliferation of groups and spokespersons which would be most undesirable and against the interests of the personnel of the Defence Forces.  In that context it is disappointing that certain self-appointed individuals, however well-intentioned, should take it upon themselves to try to pre-empt the results of the democratic elections which will take place.  I am seeking to establish a democratic process as a legitimate basis upon which a representative association can be established and that that representative association will be protected by legislation and regulations, in the preparation of which they will have participation.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the views of all members of the Permanent Defence Forces were invited in the early stage of this process and proposals submitted by individuals contained much that was acceptable and formed a valuable input into the examination which culminated in the presentation of draft legislation. The scheme which is envisaged for members of the Permanent Defence Forces is, however, more comprehensive and in certain respects goes much further than what is contained in some proposals which were put forward and would, I am satisfied, best serve the interests of all concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the first elections &mdash; it is important to say this in order to again clear any confusion about allegations which may be made &mdash; it is my intention that the principal officer of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Mr. Tim Sexton, who is a well known expert on elections and referenda and a public official of long standing, will supervise these elections.  Before the elections take place he will seek, by way of submissions from all interested parties, including PDFORRA, to determine a system of election which will find acceptance throughout the Defence Forces.  His task before these elections take place is to seek these submissions to ensure that a totally acceptable, above board and <Col N="2353" /> legitimate form of election or elections will take place by secret ballot.  The count will be taken under his supervision and with any safeguards he may seek to impose in order to ensure absolute propriety in regard to all aspects of both the election and the count.  He will establish this electoral structure after consulting with all the interested parties and seeking submissions from them on what form these elections should take.  All elections will, of course, be by secret ballot using the single, non-transferable vote system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  It is a framework for a fair solution to an important organisational issue in the Defence Forces.  Giving members of the Defence Forces a real say on pay and related matters without compromising military discipline requires a fine balance. The issue of representation could have major long-term implications for the armed forces of this country.  I express the hope that our deliberations will be guided accordingly in a constructive manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading until such time as the document entitled <i>Permanent Defence Force &mdash; Representative Groups</i> has been published generally and has been considered and debated by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first thing which has to be said in all honesty is that it is good to finally see some Bill which will enable members of the Defence Forces to establish a representative association coming before Dáil Éireann.  However inadequate, disappointing or defective that Bill is, at least it is a reluctant recognition by the Government &mdash; we have been saying this to Governments since 1987 &mdash; that something must be done but I regret to have to say that the Bill before us is not much more than mere recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the defence forces in Western <Col N="2354" /> Europe have their own independent representative associations.  I learned this morning that the Dutch Defence Forces have had their independent representative association since 1898 &mdash; 92 years. Indeed, they have followed modern trends by coming together in a European organisation of military associations called EUROMIL.  As I said at the outset it is good that the Government have at last recognised that our Defence Forces are entitled to move into the 20th century.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way I should pay tribute to the Government and the Minister for Defence for introducing this legislation &mdash; this is very much the done thing, especially in regard to a Bill which is wanted by everyone &mdash; but I am genuinely sorry I cannot do so in the case of this Bill, its content or, as must be said on this occasion, its total lack of content. The reason this Bill has been prepared was not due to any enlightened or progressive thinking on the part of this Government or their Fianna Fáil predecessors; it was forced on them through the rightful outrage at conditions within the forces and, most importantly of all, by the outrage and frustration at the lack of any change to bring these grievances to the attention of someone who would be delegated to listen to them and act. This frustration led to protests by the Army Spouses Association on the streets. Then there was the result at the ballot box during the general election, and later the establishment of PDFORRA.</P>
    <P>It is only right on this occasion to give due recognition to the achievements of the Army Spouses Association.  Without their well organised protests on the streets and at the ballot box we would not now have before us a Bill setting up a representative association for the Defence Forces.  Neither would we have the Gleeson Committee on Pay &mdash; I understand they will report in June.  I am confident their report will bring major improvements so far as pay is concerned. I regret the failure of the Minister, who estimated that there would be large improvements in pay, to introduce an interim improvement for members of the <Col N="2355" /> Defence Forces at the Christmas period. The Fianna Fáil Government of 1987-89 ignored all the grievances and the logic of the case for the establishment of a representative association but acknowledged the message in the ballot box.  It has to be accepted that their antennae are still very acute in that respect.</P>
    <P>As a result of the outcome in the ballot box and the protests, the Gleeson Committee were set up and this Bill, inadequate as it is, has been introduced.  Even now the response has been a very reluctant one.  An excellent opportunity has been bungled.  What could have been, to use the words of the Chief of Staff himself, an historic progression in the development of the Defence Forces is ending up in conflict, in acrimony, in confrontation and in protests outside Dáil Éireann.  The Minister could have delivered this historic progression with the support of all sides of this House, with total accord within all ranks of the Defence Forces, had he carried out proper consultations and allowed common sense to prevail instead of being guided by a sense of obligation to outdated codes and practices or maybe just letting the military authorities or his Department do the thinking for him.</P>
    <P>With a totally inadequate Defence (Amendment) Bill we are now heading into another unnecessary debacle akin to the rod licence debacle.  When the Minister asked the Chief of Staff to examine the question of representative associations there was naturally the expectation that there would be meaningful consultation throughout the ranks of the Defence Forces.  Why should there not be consultations?  After all, what were to be set up were associations representing members of the Defence Forces, dealing with their needs and their conditions. These were to be their organisations, not those of the Department or the General Command.  Why then should they not be consulted?  The Minister again said here that he has carried out consultations, He keeps repeating that he has carried out consultations.  Yet, we can ascertain from <Col N="2356" /> within the Defence Forces that no meaningful consultations have been carried out.  I refer the Minister to a document from the Office of the Curragh Command referred to in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7 March:</P>
    <P>The success or failure of a proposed representative association really rests with one question &mdash; Is it fair?  It is suggested that any proposed structure which is not seen to be fair by the general body will not work.  It is suggested by the officer body of this command that any structure which is imposed upon it without any consultation or communication will not be fair and will not work.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of communication on this issue there is a belief in the Curragh Command that the type of representative structure envisaged by the General Staff is NOT remotely similar to that proposed in this paper. If this is so, then the Barrack Representatives of this command believe that the general officer body and the general staff will be in a conflict which could result in the formation of an association along similar lines to that organised by other ranks.</P>
    <P>This, we believe, is not the type of confrontational situation the Defence Forces requires at any time.  Therefore, it is in all our interests that this issue is resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned.  It is suggested therefore that the proposals outlined in this paper should form the basis of consultation and communication between the Chief of Staff's Study Group and the representatives of the general officer body.</P>
    <P>That is, of course, for the Curragh Command, but I understand there are papers along the same lines available within other commands.  The Minister keeps telling us that he has had consultations but we are getting all the evidence that there have been no meaningful consultations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Already a new body has been set up representing the enlisted men.  I have read its constitution very carefully and it seems to be well within the law as far as the constitution and the Defence Forces regulations are concerned. It represents somewhere in the region of 8,000 enlisted men.  The Minister says dramatically across the floor of this House the he will give them 95 per cent of what they are looking for, that with conciliation and arbitration he will give them even more.  Why then did he find it impossible to consult them?  Why did he not carry on the necessary consultations which would have avoided all the confrontation we have now?  He can still do that.  All that is needed is a little imagination and a bit of common sense.</P>
      <P>There is no need to lose face on this matter.  There are various structures there.  The pay advisory group worked very well.  The Minister could use some mechanism whereby these consultations could take place before this measure becomes law.  The Minister should have done that.  He has missed his opportunity, but he can still retrieve the situation to some extent with a bit of commonsense. Instead, he seems hell-bent on confrontation when nothing of that sort is needed.  The Minister seems to be following very much in the footsteps of the Minister for the Marine in relation to the rod licence.</P>

    <P>The Bill the Minister has given us <Col N="2358" /> abjectly fails to deal with the principal issues.  There is in this Bill but one positive section, section 2 which will enable the Minister, by regulation, to provide for the establishment of representative associations for the Defence Force members.  The rest of the Bill states what the associations cannot do and nothing at all about what they can do.  All of this is to be decided by the Minister by regulation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are being asked to do is to pass a Bill with nothing in it outlining its scope or impact.  The Bill just says the associations to be set up by regulations will deal with remuneration and such other matters, if any, as the Minister may specify.  I notice also that this is far more curtailed in the Bill than was the Minister's statement where he specified quite a number of things; when it comes <Col N="2359" /> to dealing with such in the Bill it is stated that it will deal with remuneration and such other matters, if any, as the Minister may specify.  There is nothing here about the basic issues of how the members are to be elected, about the independence of the organisation, about access to the media, about how meetings are to be held.  All of this is to be done by Ministerial regulation.  We will not be able to discuss these or debate them here in the House or put down amendments.  If we challenge them the Minister will be able to dragoon them through with a majority of the House.  What the Minister is asking us to do is to sign a blank document and he will fill in the details later.  What he has given us is an empty framework.  I notice also that in the paragraph which says that the various regulations have to come before the House it is not the affirmative version, the version that would demand discussion here.  We know we cannot get amendments in that procedure but it would at least be some advancement if we could have discussion on a particular item.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>When the legislation is passed we will have a situation where members of the Defence Forces will be asked to vote to form the various tiers of associations but they will not know exactly what those tiers are to do until after they have voted. Suppose they do not like what the Minister has in his regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This sets out the Government's proposals for the various representative groups in all sections or all ranks.  It is a very detailed document in every respect. I understand it has been circulated to each member of the Defence Forces and was made available to spokespersons of the various parties &mdash; I got mine this morning.  There are a limited number of copies available in the Library but it has not been published generally. It is not available yet to all Members unless they go to the Library for it.

      <P>This debate started without these details being available except to a limited number of persons.  In the document, the letter to each member of the Permanent Defence Forces from the Chief of Staff says that the first and most important step would be conducting the elections.  Then he goes on to say that, once the elections are over, full consultations will take place with the elected representatives on all aspects, including the electoral process itself, the voting system.  After the election has taken place, the most important, vital election of all, they can have consultations about the electoral system.</P>

      <P>He is seeking to change it by providing an official of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment to supervise the elections and before they take place he will seek, by submissions from all interested parties, to determine a system of election which will find acceptance throughout the force. That already is a change, an acceptance that what the Minister was first proposing is defective.  That is going to be the history of this Bill; section after section will be proved to be defective and the Minister will have to retreat and produce a decent, honest Bill that we can discuss and amend in the appropriate fashion for the well being of members of the Defence Forces whom this is intended to help.  I am delighted that there is a bit of improvement there, but it is a bit late to have these consultations about the electoral system when the voting is over and the first elections have taken place.  These are essentially the most important elections.</P>
      <P>Incidentally on the voting system, the Minister might explain why he has opted for the single non-transferable vote in the Defence Forces as against PR which is enshrined in our Constitution and which the Irish public at large on two occasions refused to change.  As far as the Defence Forces in particular are concerned, it might have been appropriate that PR be used.</P>

I am not sure what version of the single, non-transferable vote that is if you put an X after many candidates.  I think it is the one used at Fianna Fáil conventions.  This can create major distortions within the electoral system where one group of people commanding a vote, say in excess of 60 per cent, can monopolise all the seats, and it does not give the same true vote that the PR system gives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, all these could have been sorted out if the Minister had taken the trouble to have consultations before the legislation and the rules were drawn up.  The letter of the Chief of Staff is followed by an introduction by the Minister for Defence himself, concise I have to say and clear cut, but also very ominous in that it is a pointer to the restricted nature of the associations envisaged at this moment under this legislation, but which I think we will be changing as time goes on.  He is putting a major question mark over the independence of these associations.</P>
      <P>For instance, under the heading &ldquo;Meetings&rdquo; we are told by the Minister that there will be regular meetings of representatives in military installations to whatever extent is required.  Does this mean meetings will not be permitted to take place outside military installations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is not as now envisaged because I have checked for fuller elaboration of the Minister's reference down the line, and it comes from the section dealing with the format and operation of the structure.  Section 11 in this document headed &ldquo;Meetings&rdquo; states that there will be regular meetings of representatives in military installations by arrangement between the elected representatives and the relevant military authorities.  Not only are they told where they will meet, but the meetings will be by arrangement with the relevant military <Col N="2363" /> authorities.  What kind of independent structure is that?  Who can have confidence if the representatives are so constrained as regards the place of the meeting, and if it has to be arranged between the military authorities and the representatives when these meetings take place?  Is it now envisaged that the headquarters of the various associations will be in military installations?  Would the associations decide on these headquarters themselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is seeking to back away from what was obviously intended to be definite thinking as far as the military authorities are concerned. He now sees the difficulties that arise and he is trying to back away.  Our intention is that throughout this debate he will have to back away much further because these sections are ominous as far as the independence of the associations is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2364" /> We find another very ominous sign in the section dealing with the electoral process. To qualify to become a candidate a member must have a conduct rating of not less than good or its equivalent.  I am not an authority on these ratings so I do not know exactly how good a good rating is or how bad, but if you have truly free elections, the much vaunted democratic process the Minister has been going on about across the floor of the House, then anyone good enough to be a serving member of the Defence Forces should be good enough to be a candidate and submit himself to the electoral process and the judgment of his colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the conduct weighting can be changed very easily. This could in certain circumstances be used as a method of vetting who would go forward.  The Minister may very well say in reply &mdash; and I will go along with him in this &mdash; that such things would be very unlikely to happen in the Defence Forces but even if they could not happen, he should countenance nothing in his legislation or his regulations that would leave the electoral system open to even the possibility of the suggestion of rigging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Something should be done about that.  There is also the consideration, which the Minister has not adverted to, that conduct ratings are supposed to be confidential.  Therefore, if a candidate is disqualified after appearing on a list, or if a likely candidate is mysteriously a non-runner, then confidentiality for that person as far as conduct is concerned is gone.  As I said, if a member is good enough to be a serving member of the Defence Forces and he can gain sufficient support from his colleagues to represent them, the Minister should not seek to interfere.  If, as he wants to claim, this election is to be free <Col N="2365" /> and democratic, we hope the new provisions he has introduced will ensure this beyond doubt.</P>
      <P>The Bill proper has one positive section. The remainder are negative and will be more appropriate for dealing with on Committee Stage, but I do not think section 6 could possibly be left until Committee Stage, especially subsection (2) which provides that: &ldquo;a person who is not subject to military law who endeavours to persuade or conspires with any other person to endeavour to persuade a member to join a trade union or other body (other than an association) aforesaid shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to the penalties provided for a contravention of section 257 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.  That is a monstrous provision in any Bill.</P>
      <P>What about the trade unionist who genuinely feels that the members of the association would benefit by being part of some other organisation?  Under this legislation he is forbidden to give expression to that view.  The same would apply to a journalist or a Member of this House who would attempt to put this forward.  It is a Draconian measure which I believe would not stand up constitutionally. It prevents everything except having bad thoughts about the issue.</P>
      <P>The penalties are the same as those in the principal Defence Act, 1954.  The penalties there are imposed for someone who wilfully obstructs an officer, or a man who wilfully induces any disease or infirmity into a member of a force or a man who provides them with a drug, substance or preparation which would make them incapable of performing their duties.  The penalties are £100, which has not been changed despite inflation since 1954, or a term of imprisonment of six months or both.  This section is extraordinarily objectionable.  It obviously must be removed from the Bill by way of amendment.  I believe it would not stand up constitutionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be thankful that the Minister's regulations &mdash; the whole Bill in this case, as at present envisaged &mdash; will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="2366" /> This is very much a window-dressing exercise.  The Minister has the majority to push them through.  As the section is worded, we cannot have discussion or debate and we cannot have an amendment. It is a very mixed blessing.  The regulations will be the entire substance deriving from this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Chief of Staff has described this move to representative associations as an historic progression in the development of the Defence Forces.  It should have been and it could have been.  We know that the Government never wanted this development and that it was only wrung from them by the pressure of protest, the pressure of the ballot box and the knowledge that it would cost them dearly in future elections if nothing were done. Even with this background, they could still have seized the opportunity to make an historic progression with proper consultation, common sense and acceptance of the fact that our Defence Forces are like everyone else in the last decade of the 20th century.  We should all have been participating in formulating that historic progression with resultant untold benefits to the morale of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I would still appeal to the Minister to have consultations.  These people out there are not wild men.  They are not people who seek to have a union card vote before they go to war.  They are very reasonable people and there can be a coming together.  There is no use in the Minister saying that consultation has taken place and that everything is all right when the street outside is lined with people and every Deputy has been approached over the weekend by representatives of the women's association. Obviously there is something wrong and the Minister knows it. Obviously he has not done the background work which is so necessary.  I would appeal to him to have these consultations, to repair the damage which has been done and to ensure that what he brings before this House is in line with what he is saying on the radio.</P>

      <P>The Minister sounds reasonable but the legislation is a great disappointment to me and to everyone in the House.  This could have been an historic progression but it is an empty framework which fails to address the main issues.</P>
      <P>The regulations to be enacted need massive amendment.  Already in the course of my address the Minister, who was responsible for the preparation of this Bill, has conceded in a number of important areas that amendments should be made.  Therefore, he is conceding that what appeared originally should never have come before the legislators.  I hope the Minister will be amenable to various amendments.  In the meantime it is essential that this document be widely published, made available to everyone and debated in this House.  We could then go into the finer points and find out exactly what the Minister means.</P>

It is no use saying that this is a preliminary document.  It is obviously what the Minister intended. These are his ideas.  Why should he set up confrontation by putting in something which he will later amend?  These are what the military authorities, the Department, the Minister and the Government intend.  They were brought reluctantly to this and they are still reluctant about giving us a good Bill.  We have our democratic duty in this very important matter for the Army.  It can be enormously important in regard to morale, the future of the Defence Forces, the quality of the people attracted and the quality of the work they do for our democratic institutions. All these matters are tied into this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to have second thoughts.  I hope that my amendment declining to give the Bill a Second Reading until this document has been debated here will be acceptable.</P>

      <P>Spouses are protesting outside the Dáil and other representative bodies are trying to make their voices heard.  I hope it is clear, from the wording of this amendment, that the Labour Party intend to oppose this Bill in every possible way.  We regard the Bill as not just undemocratic but as anti-democratic. It flies in the face of the letter and the spirit of our Constitution and places in danger people who have committed no wrong other than to seek to organise their colleagues in pursuance of the rights to which every other citizen is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We question the extraordinary haste <Col N="2369" /> with which the Bill has been introduced. We only got details of it this morning. The documents which were referred to earlier have been distributed right across the country and many members of the Defence Forces and TDs did not have an opportunity of reading them.  The Bill is being presented to the House and to members of the Defence Forces as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  It was circulated to the vast majority of the Members of the House as late as yesterday and we have had to rely on media coverage for details of the Minister's conclusions.</P>
    <P>There has not been any real consultation with members of the Defence Forces or with the groups who have been campaigning so valiantly on their behalf for the last year.  I understand that the Minister has not granted the National Army Spouses' Association the courtesy of a meeting.  Instead he commenced disciplinary action against one of the members involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make any further reference to the case but it is regrettable that it should have happened in the first place.  The Bill raises a whole series of fundamental questions because it is so badly thought out and prepared.  Perhaps its worst feature is the position in which it places people who have been campaigning, perfectly democratically and legitimately, to establish an association which is now in place with over 8,000 signed up members.  The association has a constitution which explicitly recognises 95 per cent of the aspects contained in <Col N="2370" /> the Minister's speech here this afternoon. Its officials are clearly people who have the interests of a professional army at heart.  Having met some of them I can vouch for that.  However, the effect of this Bill will be to outlaw the association and to make it illegal.  People will not be able to seek membership of the association when this Bill is passed.  Indeed, it will be a criminal offence for anyone to seek to recruit members to it.  In other words, this Bill places democratically organised soldiers in exactly the same position as the provisional IRA, an illegal organisation.  This is not just absurd, it is scandalous and I will develop that theme later.</P>
      <P>The need for some sort of representative body for enlisted personnel was painfuly obvious to the whole country in the aftermath of the 1988 inter-Departmental Pay Review Committee.  Enlisted personnel expected a meaningful response to their low pay, long hours and conditions of employment.  In many cases take home pay was not as high as the deplorably low rate of unemployment benefit or the dole.</P>
      <P>Various Ministers referred to increases of 19 per cent to 21 per cent.  What have members of the Defence Forces received since then?  Many of them are living in poverty and have to resort to moneylenders to pay their bills.  This is why a representative body was needed but members of the Defence Forces could not set up such a body.  The National Army Spouses' Association was then founded and they took up the fight on behalf of their men to campaign for improved pay, allowances and conditions for all members of the Defence Forces. They also set up a lawfully constituted representative body for members of the Permanent Defence Forces, one of the main planks in their objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I honestly believe that the Government never forgot the involvement of NASA in the general election because such involvement helped to elect a Coalition Government.  I also object to section 6 (2) which was referred to by Deputy Nealon.  It is a highly undemocratic section because, not only does it not allow <Col N="2371" /> Members of the Dáil to put forward suggestions for improvements in the Defence Forces, but it technically prevents a member of the Defence Forces from recommending to his wife that there might be a better way of improving their lot.  The Minister should look at that section again.</P>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces felt helpless when they saw their wives protesting, endeavouring to fight their cause. Who could blame them?  Accordingly, they decided to set up their own association help to improve their conditions of employment and rates of pay so that they could look after themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>There was also a reference to a PDFORRA.  There is no legal barrier to the formation of the proposed association as Article 40.6.1º (ii) of the Constitution guarantees the right to form associations unless barred by law.  Therefore, unless there is a clear, legal prohibition in the statute that right now exists, and will exist until this Bill is passed, I ask the Minister and Members of the House if these people were looking for something unreasonable.  Would 8,000 people have joined the association if that was the case?</P>
    <P>The whole aspect of representatives for the Defence Forces has been discussed at length in Europe and at the United Nations.  A comment from the European Parliament at this stage would be relevant. This matter was discussed there in 1984 when it was stated that the basic goal must be to ensure that members of the armed forces enjoy fundamental rights, including the right to form associations. This is the main difference of opinion between the Minister and ourselves. The Minister is denying these people the opportunity to form an association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister thinks he is giving it to them but that is not so.  These people do not want the Minister to give them this opportunity; they want to be <Col N="2372" /> involved in a process with him in bringing that about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that later. The member states of the European Community consider that a soldier, as a citizen in uniform, is an integral member of the community.  In principle, therefore, a member of the armed forces is also entitled to enjoy all fundamental rights.  A soldier's task is to protect civil rights and liberties from external and internal threats.  These men and women bear the responsibility for the defence of fundamental rights against external threats in the same way as members of the police forces are called upon to protect rights and liberties against internal threats.  It seems inconsistent, therefore, that those who are responsible for protecting the community and its liberties should have some of these liberties withheld from them.  Members of the Defence Forces would have greater motivation to defend the rights and liberties of a democratic society if they themselves possessed these rights.  Most of the countries in the EC agree with that.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another aspect.  A question has been put down in the European Parliament by the Socialist group for answer next Thursday &mdash; reference, H267/90; subject, Servicemen's Organisation, PDFORRA.  On 12 April 1984 the European Parliament called for servicemen to be granted the right to establish, join and actively participate in professional associations.  Servicemen's organisations are not bound under the Irish Constitution.  The Irish Presidency should say whether the recently formed Irish servicemen's organisation, PDFORRA, belongs to the category of associations referred to by the European Parliament and what it will do to make sure that PDFORRA can operate freely and their members do not risk imprisonment or an inquiry simply because of their acts in connection with PDFORRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much that appeals have been made by Members of the Council, who approached the President's office, to <Col N="2373" /> withdraw this question.  I am delighted to say it was not withdrawn and it will be dealt with next Thursday or Friday. There were ominous connotations in that movement in that regard.  It was stated in the European Parliament in 1984 that member states within the Community have established representative organisations to look after the interests of enlisted personnel.  It should also be said &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; that in their rules PDFORRA state that their association shall be of a consultative nature and shall at no time seek to interfere with the organisation, structure or command of the Defence Forces.  This is very important and should reassure the Minister.  Why have 8,000 members joined PDFORRA and why are they opposed to the Minister's proposals?  In answer to a question last week the Minister doubted whether that number of people were in the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  Nobody knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that that is the case.  As I said earlier, this is an enabling Bill, enabling the Minister to take whatever powers are needed by regulation.  The members want to be involved and want to know what they are voting for and what the regulations are.  Given that there are no regulations with this Bill at the moment &mdash; that probably is not unusual &mdash; we can only refer in the first instance to the document &ldquo;Permanent Defence Forces Representative Groups&rdquo; which was issued to most members last Friday.  The Minister said he will implement what he has put on record in the House this afternoon, but at the end of the day, this is unsatisfactory.  We can only go by what is contained in the Bill and what is placed before this House by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any way that I, as a public representative, can be of assistance in trying to bring about a coming together of the Government and the members of the Defence Forces I would be happy to do so.  Basically what we are saying &mdash; and the Minister has acknowledged this <Col N="2374" />&mdash; is that elections will take place in the next couple of weeks for PDFORRA. The Minister acknowledges a role for them in relation to consultation and the format of the elections.  We are making progress in that regard but the breaking point at present is in relation to the regulations. There are aspects of the regulations which we can come back to later if we have time.  It can be seen from the document that people are very concerned about the suitability of a candidate.  They wonder why should they vote for some of the so-called regulations &mdash; the Minister says they are not regulations but they are all the people can go by.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters of concern. After the elections and before the vote the Minister should bring forward a mechanism where consultation can take place between the legally organised PDFORRA, which represents over 70 per cent of the Defence Forces, and the Government to see if we can bring about the type of powers that should be provided for in the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to take some of those aspects on board.</P>
    <P>To get back to the constitutionality aspect, I and my party are convinced that this Bill cannot pass the test of the Constitution.  For instance, section 2 (4) of the Bill is in clear contradiction of Article 40.6.1º iii of the Constitution unless the Minister can prove to the satisfaction of this House that the association be referred to is in the public interest and the association already established is not. That section of the Bill makes it illegal for people to be members of the PDFORRA.  If the 8,000 members of the association believe they have a constitutional right to belong to that association, the Minister should not deny them that right.  What will he do if those 8,000 members refuse to resign from PDFORRA?  I hope this does not arise. It would be in nobody's interest if there was a general boycott of the election process referred to in this Bill.  It is incumbent on the Minister to move in the direction of consultation to prevent the possibilities of a boycott.</P>
    <P>These questions highlight the ludicrous <Col N="2375" /> nature of the Bill.  The Minister cannot court martial 8,000 members of the Army or put them in jail.  He cannot cashier them out of the Army for exercising what they believe to be their constitutional rights.  The Minister knows that, and indeed they know it.</P>

      <P>The serious issue of the constitutionality of the Bill has to be raised.  In normal circumstances it would be possible for us to urge the President at this stage to examine the Bill closely and refer it to the Supreme Court for consideration of its constitutionality, but in this instance, the President &mdash; I think this is a very important point &mdash; is also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and, therefore, is an interested party in regard to the legislation.  While it does, of course, remain open to him to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court, expecting him to do so may place the President in an invidious position.  That is why we believe the question of the constitutionality of the Bill must be argued out on the floor of this House and Members of the House must be satisfied in conscience that the Bill does not deprive individuals of well-established rights before we give it a Second Reading.</P>

    <P>As I said earlier, this is enabling legislation which places restrictions on the rights of citizens to bear arms on behalf of the State while enabling the Minister to order his future relations with those same citizens by way of regulation on any matter he sees fit in such a way that the <Col N="2377" /> regulations need never be debated in the Dáil.  We will not be shown the regulations before we pass the Bill.</P>

      <P>That is a valid point.  Perhaps on the basis of amendments we may be able to find an accommodation between what the Minister is seeking and what I, other TDs and the members of the forces are seeking.</P>
      <P>As things stand, people perceive that they are being asked to buy a pig in the poke and to trust the Minister to behave in a democratic and consultative way.  I am not saying for one moment that would not happen, but the fact still remains we are taking the Minister at his word.  From reading the papers I know the Minister has other hopes and aspirations for higher office and if the people decide so, we will have another Minister coming in to take over and what has been said here this afternoon will be irrelevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill that would enable us to place that level of trust in the Minister.  There is a simple solution to the problem.  If the Minister would agree to meet PDFORRA he would quickly find that its officers are genuinely committed to the development of good relations and a modern professional defence force.  They are not troublemakers, interested in wrecking the Army or Navy.  In fact, if I thought for one moment that there was a subversive element who were prepared to do that, I would not be standing up here on behalf of the Labour Party supporting them and trying to bring in better legislation by changing the Minister's mind on the matter.  PDFORRA are comprised of professional Defence Forces personnel who are interested in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My strong advice to the Minister, if he is prepared to take it, is that before it is <Col N="2378" /> too late, he should meet with officers of PDFORRA and this could be done following their elections.  At that stage we will know how many have joined that association and we could then give them the opportunity of discussing the regulations which will affect their lives and the lives of future members of the Defence Forces for years to come.  It is not asking too much that the Minister should meet with them to see if there can be a coming together in that regard.  I hope that can be facilitated.  I do not want and I do not think anybody in the country, least of all the personnel of the Defence Forces, want a split in the Defence Forces which will not be in anybody's interest.  The regulations will affect them for the rest of their working lives.  The issues of who will process the regulations and whether there will be a complaints procedure need to be discussed in a process of consultation and I do not think it is unreasonable for these people to expect to have a say in that process.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take on board what we have been saying and, hopefully, on the basis of amendments put forward by the Labour Party and other parties we will be able to reach a solution.  At the end of the debate I hope we will have adopted a unified approach not only in the interests of this House and the country but also of the people who work long hours in the Defence Forces.  In all their interests it is incumbent on us to come together.  One way or another at the end of the day it is in everybody's interest that the Minister acknowledges this body and meets them before we reach the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on behalf of The Workers' Party to give our response to the legislation before the House, the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, and to speak to our amendment which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, believing the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, to be seriously defective, in view <Col N="2379" /> of its failure to spell out detailed arrangements for the operation of the proposed representative bodies, declines to give a second reading to the Bill until such time as the Minister for Defence enters into discussions with representatives of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, with a view of seeking agreement on democratic representative structures, which would be acceptable to all concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In drawing the attention of the House to the details of the amendment I say to the Minister in all sincerity that I hope by the end of this debate it will not be necessary to move this amendment.  I thank the Minister for meeting me yesterday to tease out some of my concerns about this legislation and for his genuine offer to seriously consider and, if I understood him correctly, take on board many of the points raised.</P>
    <P>I persist with my attempt to address the amendment and those of the other parties in Opposition because, quite frankly, the Bill in its first printing is not a formidable or impressive document and the Minister in his speech moving the Bill does not seem to have taken on board some of the points which I understand he would be prepared to seriously address. I would also like to express our appreciation to the National Army Spouses Association who were first into this debate and who at a very early stage recognised that they would never be in a position to address in the long term to pay and conditions of their spouses in the Defence Forces unless an independent group or organisation was established to argue on a continual basis on behalf of members of the Defence Forces as circumstances changed.  They also recognised from an early stage that over the decades politicians have failed the members of the Defence Forces in their duties as public representatives in this House and the Minister for Defence has failed to look after their basic conditions.</P>
    <P>One of the basic propositions is that <Col N="2380" /> members of the Defence Forces who do exactly the same work, if not more demanding work, as other officers of the State in the area of security, namely, members of the Garda Síochána and prison officers, do not get equal treatment or recognition.  It is sometimes suggested that others are better trained.  I can say unequivocally today that there is no better trained group of men or women in the service of the State than those in the Defence Forces who have to undergo rigorous training an a daily basis and whose service to the State is unparalleled but they do not get the recognition they deserve in terms of conditions or levels of pay.</P>
    <P>I have been led to understand in my meetings with representatives of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Assocation, whose existence I fully acknowledge and respect, that they could be subjected to discipline by the military authorities for meeting with me.  I find it remarkable that people concerned about their everyday working and living conditions could as a result of meeting with me, a public representative elected by the people, be subjected to discipline.  I would also like to acknowledge the staff of the general headquarters of the Defence Forces, whom I had the honour to meet for the first time last Friday in the company of the other six members of The Workers' Party in this House.  I received a full briefing from them and had the opportunity under the guidance of Commandant Duffy to visit Collins's Barracks and meet with the officers and men there.  That meeting and the meeting at Army GHQ proved very helpful in speaking in this debate.  I appreciate all that was done in alerting me to the demands, problems and issues facing the members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>We have made remarkable progress on the issue of representation within the Defence Forces during recent months. The issue of pay and conditions is now being looked at by the Gleeson Committee in exactly the same way as the issue of pay and conditions in the public service is being addressed and in exactly <Col N="2381" /> the same way as the issue of pay and remuneration and other entitlements of Members of this House is being looked at.  The Gleeson Committee is acknowledged as a hardworking and conscientious body.  It is only proper that it is the body to which we look for recommendations with regard to the pay and conditions of those in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I wish to put down a marker here. I want to see the deliberations of the Gleeson Committee completed at an early stage, its report published and acted upon.  There is a grave fear and worry within the Defence Forces that it will be at least two years, if not longer, before action is taken on the recommendations of that committee.  We have to acknowledge that PDFORRA are in existence. That, in itself, would be progress and a remarkable development in the history of the Defence Forces.  Members of the Defence Forces have sought in an orderly, organised, law-abiding fashion to establish spokespersons and there is much in the history of the past 12 months to show why this has happened.  I will come back to deal with this matter briefly later.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has formally acknowledged on behalf of the Government that members of the Defence Forces have the right, in principle, to representation.  I do not think we can understate the importance and significance of that declaration.  I fully acknowledge the contribution and role played by the Minister for Defence in this.  We can all recall our unfortunate experience during the lifetime of the previous Government when the Minister for Defence simply repeated time and again that he did not consider it was consistent with the good order and discipline in the Defence Forces to establish a representative organisation.  This was repeated as late as 7 December 1988, when the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Noonan, replied to a question from a member of The Workers' Party, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla.  I quote from column 652, Volume 385 of the Official Report of 7 December 1988:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2382" /> I am advised that the formation by members of the Defence Forces of associations or unions having a system of organisation and control separate from that of the Defence Forces, would be incompatible with the system of command essential in any defence or military force contemplated by Articles 13 and 15 of the Constitution and provided for in the Defence Acts and the regulations made under those Acts.</P>
    <P>That view was repeated time and again. It is a view that was taken on by the Minister of State at the Department of Defence in the course of an Estimates debate on 20 July 1989.  In the course of his speech, which was distributed in the House, the Minister of State said that, as the House would be aware, the question of forming an association in the Permanent Defence Forces had been raised.  He said a number of non-commissioned officers and men had recently intimated that they were contemplating the formation of an association, with the objects of having the right of consultation in matters relating to pay and allowances and making recommendations for the improvement of conditions of other ranks.  He said the association would also have a role in several other areas, including welfare and educational matters and professional standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, who is currently the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, went on to say that on any occasion on which this matter had previously been considered the official view had consistently been that the formation of an association such as that contemplated, having a system of organisation and control separate from the Defence Forces, would be incompatible with the system of command essential to our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>No more than seven or eight months ago the Minister of State at the Department of Defence was reiterating the official view as held consistently, the idea of representation being incompatible with the command system required.  In that view he was not seriously challenged <Col N="2383" /> by any member of the Fine Gael Party. Deputy Connaughton in the same debate indicated that this was a matter of fundamental principle and concern and that there could not be progress too quickly on that matter.</P>
    <P>I find it galling that when we are trying to address what is a most fundamental departure in the development of the Defence Forces Deputy Nealon should come in and upbraid the Government for what they are trying to do.  He said that the Government were now doing what he, and the Fine Gael Party, had been telling them to do for the last number of years, and that is not true.  The Deputy should read the record.  Their position, and that of many former members of his party, including the former Minister for Defence, now MEP, Mr. Patrick Cooney, is that they consistently opposed any suggestion of independent representation for members of the Defence Forces.  Even members of the Labour Party were somewhat confused on this issue.</P>

Deputies know that this is a feature of the House and that ample opportunity is given to other contributors later to take issue with the statement made.  We cannot be interrupting Deputy McCartan in the course of his contribution, which is perfectly in order.  He is entitled to make that contribution without interruption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The view of the Labour Party was enunciated in the <Col N="2384" /> House in an exchange with the Minister for Defence on 7 December 1988. Deputy Bell suggested the following to the Minister:</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this (representation for members of the Defence Forces) could be done by assigning an officer in each command who would form a group within the Army and be responsible for making representations directly to the Minister, following consultation with the units and that this could be done by setting up a special personnel section? Would the Minister like to comment on this?</P>
      <P>That was the thinking in the Labour Party at the time.  The point I should like to make is that the thinking in Opposition was not clear on what should be done within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>We are entering a debate in which we are saying that we are not satisfied with what is proposed by the Minister for Defence but at least it should not be suggested that the hands of all Members are entirely clean on this issue.  We should recognise that we are dealing with an issue of major complexity that requires us to address the issue in a constructive way and not suggest that there is the scope for confrontation inside or outside the House, that there is scope for dissent and that there is the possibility that by the time we conclude this debate there will be no need for opposing voices.  We want clear assurances from the Minister that issues being raised by us will be taken on board before the debate has ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a number of points about what I consider to be major defects in the Bill.  In doing so I want to refer to the document, <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups</i>.  I do not think the Minister would suggest that he would not stand over that document. In the post this morning I received from his office a copy of a document which is similar to it in every respect except layout.  It was accompanied by a letter from the Minister's Private Secretary which stated that enclosed was a copy of a document issued recently by <Col N="2385" /> the Chief of Staff to all members of the Permanent Defence Forces which outlines the Government's proposals for the establishment of a representative structure. The view expressed in that correspondence that was circulated by the Chief of Staff is his general proposal for the establishment of structures in the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the establishment of any Defence Forces representative organisation that it be exterior to independent of the command structure of the Defence Forces.  It is essential that there should be two representative associations, one of the non-commissioned officers and privates.  They join the Defence Forces through a common system of enlistment and they are anxious to stay together and be represented by one structural representative body.  The Minister is proposing there should be three but I am asking him to agree to the establishment of two bodies.  That body must have an external and representative secretariat free and independent of the command structure of the Army.  The Minister has said that he wants to establish representative associations in line with the Prison Officers Association and, more particularly, with the Garda Representative Association.  The document I have referred to does not propose that type of representation.  From the point of view of discussion the Minister should withdraw it, particularly if he intends to take on board the points we are raising.</P>
    <P>For the representative body to work at all it must have a general secretary and a secretariat independent of the Defence Forces.  There are limits laid down in the Bill in regard to associations and connections with other organisations.  They are subject to the agreement of the Minister. The Garda Representative Association is affiliated to the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations. Why is it that the Defence Forces representative bodies will not be free to involve themselves with other groups in the context of their objectives?  The constitution of PDFORRA states, in subparagraph (d), that the association <Col N="2386" /> recognise that they do not have any power to take industrial action.  In that event, what is the fear if there is a majority feeling that they should be affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?  If there is a commitment to nonindustrial action why is there a worry about members of the representative body getting involved in the general stream of labour relations discussions and negotiations?</P>
    <P>Provisions like section 2 (3) and others imposing penalties for canvassing and so on, suggest that there is a potential in the Defence Forces not to be loyal and law abiding.  I resent that inference.  One of the factors that impresses me most in any discussions with the spouses, members of the Defence Forces and representatives of the PDFORRA was their commitment and loyalty to the Chief of Staff and to their supreme commander under the Constitution.  There is no question of any word of military dissension emanating.  I will illustrate that later, with some examples.</P>
    <P>In every debate in this House the Minister and the Minister of State acknowledged that there is an undying loyalty amongst the Defence Forces.  This point was made to me by Commanding Officers in Collins Barracks and General Headquarters. They have absolute confidence in the loyalty of their men.  That being so, why do we have to introduce penal legislation which is attempting to outlaw PDFORRA and to suggest that any involvement with outside organisations might not be contemplated or allowed? Why should not our Defence Forces representatives once established, affilitate to EUROMIL, the European Organisation established under the Council of Europe?  That would not represent sedition in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 (4) concern was expressed about joining other bodies or trade unions.  Why can those members of the Defence Forces who are lawyers not maintain membership of the law society? Why should a tradesman not be able to maintain his membership of a skilled <Col N="2387" /> trade organisation for when he might ultimately leave the Defence Forces?  This subsection is utterly unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The real purpose of section 3 is to put down the PDFORRA.  Unless we get a definite assurance from the Minister, there will be a great suspicion that that is what this entire Bill is about.  If under these structures we do not allow for a full-time independent secretariat, what is to stop a commanding officer from ordering a person involved in important work on to active service, frustrating all efforts of the representative association along the way?  The command to active service would override any other consideration and the work of the representative association would be set at nought.</P>
    <P>I resent the provision in section 6 which would affect Members of the House like myself who make an active interest in matters concerning the Defence Forces and their representation.  That section should not be in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provision for laying regulations before the House under section 7 is a remarkable proposition.  The Minister wants us to give him enabling powers to make proposals without us having the opportunity to debate them in the House. The Minister has circulated his outline proposals but that is not good enough.  If regulations are to be introduced they must come before the House and require the assent of the Dáil before they become law.  This Bill will not be supported on Second Stage by any Member of the Opposition unless we can expect to debate at length at an early date the minutiae of what the Minister proposes from the development and establishment of the Defence Forces representative organisations.</P>
    <P>The regulations circulated seem to be the Minister's current ideas as per his covering letter.  There is no objection to the basic idea about representation except that we demand that the NCOs' and privates' structures be amalgamated and that the two years' service limitation be looked at.  Also the good conduct rating must be reviewed because it is <Col N="2388" /> stitch up an effective representative of the soldiers who is facing up to pressure from above on issues affecting day-to-day business.  A commanding officer could put in a report saying that he had not had a snappy response to a demand.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister and I am only commenting on it to put it on the record.  This document and the covering letter from the Minister's office seems to outline the Government's proposals for the establishment of a representative structure.  I am happy, on the basis that they are a framework for discussion and once we have a clear understanding that we can come back here to debate the proposals after consultations with the representatives of the soldiers in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this debate we must address the existence of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association because they are of pivotal importance in this whole debate. To date the Minister has not openly acknowledged their existence and the need to consult with them.  I will outline some of the facts as to why they are in existence and have a pivotal role to play and I hope the Minister will recognise the need to meet and talk with them.  I put this proposition to the Minister no later than last Thursday and the response at the press conference on Friday seemed to indicate a lack of understanding about what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July of last year the Minister of State replying to the debate here on the Estimates indicated that there was no shift in Government policy.  Because Members like myself had been unequivocal in saying that there was nothing in law or in the Constitution to prohibit the establishment of a Defence Forces representative organisation, the message <Col N="2389" /> went back to the soldiers, who consulted with solicitors and got legal opinion indicating that in law and under the Constitution there was nothing to prevent the establishment of a representative association. I represented that view first in this House in August 1988 and I have repeated it since then.  I conveyed that view to the spouses when I spoke at some of their meetings around the country, including in Mullingar on one occasion.  I asked the spouses to put that proposition to the soldiers &mdash; to set up their own representative association because there was nothing in law to stop them from doing so.  That right was acknowledged in the research documents of the European Parliament in 1984 when they reported on the present situation.  They said it appeared that the non-existence of a representative body in Ireland was based on military tradition and discipline and there was no reason for it in law.</P>
    <P>Having got that opinion the Minister's office &mdash; I do not know if the Minister saw these letters &mdash; received correspondence from both the legal representatives and members of PDFORRA asking for the Minister's response on whether he had agreed they could progress and establish such an organisation.  They wrote to the Minister's office on eight or nine occasions &mdash; I am not sure exactly how many times they wrote &mdash; but they never received a response from that office whether they could establish such an organisation.  They received acknowledgments which said that the matter was a technically complex one and was being looked at.  They have not received a full acknowledgment to date.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is superfluous now because of the events which have occurred in the meantime.  These events include the setting up of the Gleeson Committee to look at the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces and the establishment of a study group within the Defence Forces to look at representative structures.  That study group which was comprised entirely of senior officers visited other countries to look at their organisations.  They visited Italy where <Col N="2390" /> there is a constitutional ban on the establishment of representative associations. What was the point in visiting that country?  They went to Denmark, which is the other extreme, where radical structures are in existence for the independent representation of soldiers in regard to pay, conditions and other matters.  No enlisted men were involved in the delegations who visited these countries and they never spoke to one enlisted member of the Danish Defence Forces.  The study group had some consultation with someone in GHQ in regard to the problems which were likely to arise and how they could deal with them.  There are established representative associations within the Danish structure but the study group never met with any member or group from those associations to discuss their ideas.  That study group are an irrelevant structure so far as enlisted men are concerned. When I talk about &ldquo;enlisted&rdquo; I am talking about NCO members.</P>
    <P>On the other hand under the Gleeson Committee three working groups were established at each rank level.  When the delegation from the NCO group met the Gleeson Committee on 14 September they were accompanied by a commanding officer from the planning and research section.  When Mr. Gleeson, the chairman of the committee, invited submissions from the group on representative structures, because he correctly believes that pay and conditions are an integral part of the representative structures issue and he cannot divorce one from the other, there was an immediate interjection from the commanding officer present, who said that that was not a matter for the delegation but for the study group who were already established. However, Mr. Gleeson persisted and said he would like to hear the views of the people on the ground.  That being so, the delegation withdrew.  As a result of the persistence of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Gleeson, Senior Counsel, the planning and research section of HQ were obliged to sit down with the various representative groups and look at the question of representation.</P>
    <Col N="2391" />
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the consultation referred to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were forced into it.  The NCO group then sought the assistance of the Judge Advocate and other personnel attached to the planning and research unit.  They wanted advice on what it was possible to suggest while at the same time keeping within the laws and regulations of the Defence Forces. They got no help whatsoever from those quarters.  Because they received no response the NCO group went ahead and prepared their submission for the Gleeson Committee and presented it as best they could.  That submission was returned to the committee on 14 November 1989.</P>
      <P>As he acknowledged in his speech, the Minister met three of the groups from each of the ranks who had made submissions to the Gleeson Committee, on 14 December 1989.  I am sure the Minister recalls that he thanked them for the work they had done and said he had read the PDFORRA constitution, was happy with it and disagreed with very little of it.  He indicated that he would expect these three representative groups &mdash; one for the privates, one for the NCO's and one for the officers commanding &mdash; each of which comprised six persons, to stay in existence and act as consultative groups in regard to the question of representation, which was being actively looked at by his Department.  The Minister indicated that if there were any difficulties his office would always be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from that meeting the NCO group, who had previously been to the Gleeson Committee and who are now being kept in place as a consultative group on the representative structures, sought a meeting on 15 December with the study group who were looking at this issue on behalf of the general officers commanding.  They put their request for a meeting with the study group through the co-ordinating officer in the research and development section.  That request was passed on but there was no response. The study group were not prepared to meet them at that stage.  Because they <Col N="2392" /> had received no response after three weeks the NCO group contacted the Minister's office and asked to meet with him. They were upbraided for having had the audacity to contact the Minister's office directly and were referred back summarily to meet with the study group. They were told that that was their business.</P>
    <P>The next event occurred in or around 5 January 1990 when a document entitled &ldquo;Briefing Notes&rdquo; was circulated in vague terms by the general office commanding staff.  This document dealt in general and brief terms with the ideas which were percolating in regard to what body might be established and considered by the Department.  This document was circulated and prepared by the general offices staff without consultation with the study group who had been established by the Minister or any ordinary member of the Defence Forces, the privates and NCOs.  The NCO group responded by asking for the document to be withdrawn. On 8 January, three days later, they were eventually invited by the study group to meet and discuss their ideas.  They were told by the study group that the first they had seen of this document was on the morning of 8 January 1990, the morning they met with the NCO delegation.  It appeared to the PDFORRA people that something was afoot at general office commanding level and they were having no regard to what was going on at the study group or PDFORRA level.</P>
    <P>When they met with the study group they were told that the study group's only function then was to elicit the response of the NCOs and others to the &ldquo;Briefing Notes&rdquo; document and nothing else was envisaged.  The NCO group withdrew and said there was nothing they could do about it because that meeting was completely at variance with what they understood from their meeting with the Minister on 14 December would be the function of the meeting.  The NCO representative group who were present took the document away and said they would consult with their members.  They did this and when they met at the end of <Col N="2393" /> January with the study group they indicated there was universal rejection of the principles and ideas contained in the &ldquo;Briefing Notes&rdquo; document.  That is where the matter has stood since then.</P>
    <P>I have outlined these facts at some length to the Minister in order to show that while there was a declaration that there would be consultation, the clear practice over the past nine months has been that the general offices staff commanding have gone about their own business and paid little or no regard to any consultation, discussion or involvement of the other ranks in the deliberations. That is why this document was produced and even today the other ranks say they have not been consulted or involved even though they were assured they would be. For those reasons, and no other, PDFORRA set a pace in establishing their own organisation with their members.  Perhaps at that stage they might have been in a position to demand the right to be consulted and involved.</P>
    <P>There are some other facts I would like to put on record on behalf of these people.  I have met them.  I am absolutely convinced that they represent over 8,000 members of the current other ranks.  The figures stand at 84 per cent of the Naval members; 92 per cent of the Air Corps; 94 per cent of the Southern Command; equal figures in the Western Command; 75 per cent and rising in the Eastern Command and between 80 and 85 per cent of the Curragh Command already listed having signed forms of appointment. They propose to proceed with their elections by ballot which will be circulated on 30 March next and they will be counted on Easter Saturday, 14 April.</P>
    <P>Their message to me leaving their meeting last Saturday was that they are simply doing this to get involved.  What they are asking for is active consultation and negotiation with the Minister in regard to the progress of the proposals the Minister has now put before the House.  With that consultation involving direct negotiation &mdash; because they have been denied it to date &mdash; the Minister will get a workable formula which he can present to this House in time in regulation <Col N="2394" /> form.  If the Minister can give us those assurances The Workers' Party will not press this amendment.  We will await the outcome of the deliberations and negotiations; we will await what we believe will be the culmination of this historic moment in the development of democracy within the Defence Forces in the form of regulations.  I urge the Minister, with all the strength I have, to meet those men, to negotiate and consult and to come back with regulations that everyone in the Defence Forces want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which provides for the setting up of the first representative associations for the members of the Defence Forces in the country.  The Bill has not come out of the blue.  It follows an initiative taken by the Government last July and since then we have known that these proposals were on the way.</P>
      <P>The representative groups will be established on the basis of elections by secret ballot supervised by an election agent who is expert in these matters.  I welcome the Bill which is a genuinely new departure reflecting fresh thinking in the area of representation in the armed forces.  Whatever earlier speakers have said, nobody can really doubt the bona fides of the Minister.  I therefore support him in this initiative and see the Bill as a wholesome response to the need and the request for a representative structure in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill are very similar to the arrangements already prevailing in the case of the Garda Síochána. The Bill before us is a compromise in that the Minister has to steer a middle course and hold centre stage between, on the one hand, permitting a clear voice on remuneration and other matters while at the same time ensuring that proper controls are maintained in the operational and command areas of the Defence Forces so that they can carry out their duties properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to earlier speakers, I feel there is some confusion.  The Minister has intervened from time to time to say that <Col N="2395" /> the Bill is intended to provide the necessary framework, the first step not alone to provide protection for the Government but especially for the members of the Defence Forces.  Following this legislative framework we will have secret ballots and genuine participation and discussion on the regulations, on the shape of which the Defence Forces themselves will have a major say.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces differ from other sections of the workforce.  Article 40.6.1º (i) of the Constitution provides for the rights of the citizens to form associations and unions.  It is useful I suppose, as Deputy McCartan has done, to look at international experience.  It is a fact in that context that most international conventions recognise the entitlement of a State to exclude certain categories of workers from the general freedom of association.  For example, although the Freedom of Association and Protection of right to Organise Convention of the ILO, guarantees association for workers and employers without distinction, nevertheless, it allows States to exclude the armed forces and the police.  In Ireland, for example, the Garda are not free to join trade unions of their choice. While the Garda have associations, and effective ones at that, they are not allowed to affiliate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Similar circumstances prevail in Britain.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the European experience is a mixed one.  The Council of Europe shows that the number of member states where the military have the right to form and join trade unions equals the number of member states where there is no such right.  Drawing again on the international scene, the International Labour Conference Convention No. 98, which is concerned with the application of the principles of the right to organise and to bargain collectively, states &ldquo;The extent to which the guarantee provided for in this Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police shall be determined by national laws or regulations&rdquo;, in other <Col N="2396" /> words, it is left to the discretion of member states of the ILO.</P>
    <P>Whatever about international experience, what we are addressing, shaping and designing here today are structures that suit Irish circumstances.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, have to take the requirements of national security very seriously.  In this Bill the Minister is putting forward proposals which are suited to our circumstances.  The Bill has been drawn up against the background of a large corpus of legislation in relation to the armed forces.  We start from the premise that obedience to lawful order is of paramount importance.  That is basic.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate I feel we should exercise the restraint that this Bill deserves.  The constitutional right to form associations and unions is subject to public order and is not an unqualified right for anybody in the country.  Co-operation between the armed forces and the Government is clearly important and therefore as Members of the Oireachtas we have to behave responsibly and not contribute in any way to fuelling confrontation. The Minister, by his personal disposition as well as in his capacity as Minister for Defence, has made it very clear that he wants a co-operative approach, as opposed to a confrontational one, to this Bill.</P>
    <P>PDFORRA are seeking representative structures for the Permanent Defence Force.  The Bill is a comprehensive response, I suggest, to their needs.  On grounds of law, logic and practicality the initiative for representative structures of the Defence Forces properly rests with the Minister for Defence and the Government and not with an unregulated group. Indeed under Article 15.6.1º of the Constitution the right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas; so we have a particular right in this context and that obviously gives rise to corresponding responsibilities.  I suggest we have a responsibility to ensure that there will be no erosion of the essential integrity of the armed forces.  It is, therefore, unacceptable if steps are taken in relation to representative structures in the Army <Col N="2397" /> that could pre-empt the decisions in the Oireachtas.  That is our right, and that is our duty here.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill provide for the establishment, by secret ballot, of representative groups in the Defence Forces.  This is a new, major, fundamental development.  It provides the first step for a legal, formal channel for representation, that is, genuine participation as opposed to a talking shop for the Defence Forces.  Put another way, the new machinery as envisaged in the Bill will provide the opportunity for members of the Defence Forces, including those in PDFORRA, to opt, by secret ballot, for participation in the arrangements leading to representative associations.</P>
    <P>As the Minister outlined, the last thing he wants to do is to impose structures. What we are doing here today is contributing to a debate which is concerned with providing a legal framework which in turn will provide a forum for genuine participative arrangements in drawing up regulations.  Structures are now being established under the Bill to accommodate the need for representation in the Defence Forces.  What the Forces are seeking obviously are outlets to express their views and opinions, to have a say on pay and related matters.  The proposed machinery, therefore, meets the needs of the Defence Forces.  Not only that, it goes a long way further in that it provides for conciliation and arbitration machinery. This scheme will again be the subject of consultation before it is put in place.</P>
    <P>I fail to see any conflict here.  The Minister for Defence and the Defence Forces have this in common.  Both want a system of effective representation for the Defence Forces and we here in the Oireachtas do not want to weaken this innovative proposal and affect it adversely at its birth.  The experience of conciliation and arbitration schemes in the public service &mdash; here I want to draw on my professional experience in UCD in this field &mdash; is that they are seen to be fair, effective and highly regarded by the members.  In other words, the record of the conciliation and arbitration schemes shows that these schemes enjoy a very <Col N="2398" /> large measure of confidence by their members and this confidence is reflected in several ways, not least by the very high membership &mdash; more than 80 per cent &mdash; of the associations who participate in these schemes in the public service.</P>
    <P>The armed forces, I suggest, can take heart from the excellent experience elsewhere in the public service, especially in the parallel case of the Garda.  The proposed conciliation and arbitration arrangements for the Defence Forces are very similar to those of the Garda Síochána. The experience of the gardaí shows that their schemes have stood the test of time.  Indeed, the Garda representatives have been robust in dealing with issues on pay and related matters.  This is no house union we are talking about here. Furthermore, the representatives in the public service associations in general have been very able people who show that they can fight their corner with the best.</P>
    <P>Here in this Bill we are talking about the Defence Forces; able, intelligent, competent, resilient people who have proved their worth at home and often in difficult assignments abroad in the Congo, the Lebanon and so on.  The representatives who will act as advocates for their members in these new associations envisaged in the Bill will be as able as anybody else to handle the issues facing their members.  Indeed, the record of public service associations shows that not alone have they been effective in handling matters on a day-to-day basis, they have proved particularly resilient, stable and orderly in handling very difficult, and even crisis situations occasionally.</P>
    <P>I make an appeal to the Defence Forces and say they should have no fears about their future in the proposed representative structures.  The existing public service associations have an impressive record of achievement which underlines their members' participation in and commitment to the machinery that has been provided by law just as we are now doing here for this machinery.  Equally, the same opportunities will exist under the proposed arrangements.  As in <Col N="2399" /> the case of the Garda, certain conditions relate to the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Defence Forces.  After all, our lives and the security of the State depend on the Army.  It would not be logical to have exactly the same scope and range of negotiable issues for an Army as would apply in the case of a non-Army representation.  Again, the experience of the Garda scheme which, like the Army, consists of a uniformed force, shows it is entirely possible, given the provisions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme proposed here for the Defence Forces, to have effective representation on a number of highly relevant matters like pay and other conditions.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister has produced a good scheme which provides for review and change in the light of the experience of the operation of the new arrangements. All things considered, I appeal for the support of the House for this enlightened legislative matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I support the amendment of this Bill as proposed by our spokesman, Deputy Nealon, that Dáil Eireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading until such time as the document entitled <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups</i> has been published generally and has been considered and debated by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment not because we oppose the Bill, but because we believe enough discussion has not taken place on this Bill.  The Minister has missed a great opportunity in the introduction of this legislation.  Now is the time to give the Defence Forces a full say in the running of their own affairs.  If the Minister had approached this in a different manner and had entered into proper consultations with the various people concerned and the people whose lives this Bill will affect, we might have had near unanimity on the Bill in this debate tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is a panic reaction on the part of the Government and the Minister to the public awareness of the rights of the members of the Defence <Col N="2400" /> Forces.  This was brought to light first by the formation of the Army Wives' Association and secondly by the issues they have highlighted.  Let us consider first the formation of the Army Wives' Association.  The wives of the members of our Defence Forces normally were like any other housewives.  They minded their own business and stayed at home in the background worrying about the things that usually worry women in looking after their families and trying to make ends meet.  I have met a number of them since their association was formed.  They have come to present their case to me as they have done to other public representatives. I met them today outside the Dáil.  They do not wish to be involved in this type of public agitation or campaign, but this was forced on them because of the circumstances of their husbands' position and the continued frustration at not being able to do anything to improve or highlight their position.  No greater loyalty can any wife display than to go out on the streets in support of her husbands' claim because she believes in her right to do that.  These wives believe their husbands have the right to meaningful consultation about their conditions of work and their remuneration.  Similar loyalty is sometimes displayed by politicians' spouses so we know what it means.</P>
    <P>I salute the Army wives on their great efforts and the progress they have made so far in their campaign.  It is not easy for a quiet section of the public who are usually in the background to come out and take the lead in such a prominent and important matter as this and they deserve great credit.  We can be certain we would not be here tonight debating this Bill in all its inadequacies but for the campaign of the Army Wives Association, particularly in their involvement in the last general election where they hit the Government where it hurt most, in the ballot box, by having candidates of their own in various constituencies.  That had an effect on the returns to this Dáil. That was the ultimate step in their campaign to draw attention to the situation their husbands found themselves in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2401" /> One aim of the Army Wives Association was an association for members of the Defence Forces and they were outside the gates of Leinster House today protesting against and showing their dissatisfaction with this Bill.  The Minister should ask himself the reason.  I have asked myself the reason and I would say they do not intend to be deceived by this Bill.  That is probably due partly to an event which occurred in their negotiations. They were deceived previously in one of their major objectives, their claim for parity in conditions and pay with the Garda and prison officers.  Their campaign started in 1988 and the previous Fianna Fáil Government made great play of it at the time when they announced with great hype and fanfare a 12 per cent wage increase at Christmas 1988.  That was simply a PR exercise to stall the public support for the Army Wives Association that was building up at that time with great momentum.  Quite suddenly at an opportune time before Christmas the Government announced what was supposed to be a 12 per cent pay increase.  This was a PR exercise by the Government but they flattered only to deceive.  The 12 per cent turned out to be 4 per cent then and 4 per cent for the election in June 1989.  We are still waiting for the other 4 per cent.  That which appeared at first to be a concession to the campaign served only to raise the hopes of the people concerned that the campaign was having an effect.  Those hopes were then dashed by an exercise which left the Army wives and members of the Defence Forces disappointed, suspicious and frustrated.  It would not have been as bad if the Government had come clean at the time and said quite clearly that they were giving a 4 per cent rise rather than a 12 per cent one.  Hopes would not have been built up.  The increase of 12 per cent was announced with great fanfare. It did not deceive those people directly concerned but it deceived a large number of the general public who had been supporting the Army wives in their courageous stand.  That move on the part of the Government is part of the reason the Army wives are outside the gates of <Col N="2402" /> Leinster House today.  It is part of the reason that we as public representatives have been approached since the publication of the Bill and given an indication by these people that they do not want to buy a pig in a poke again.  They might have taken the Minister and the Bill at face value but for the earlier letdown.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that when the Minister was prepared to make this historic breakthrough by agreeing to set up an association, warts and all, he could not have consulted more widely.  He could have consulted the people concerned and won the confidence of members of the Defence Forces and the Army wives.  The association proposed in this Bill is to be set up without any consultation with enlisted personnel.  That is a major fault in what the Minister is trying to achieve. I am afraid the Minister is leading his regiment from behind.</P>
    <P>I would pose some questions to the Minister.  If this Bill is passed, will the Army wives association be illegal or can they continue with their legitimate efforts to sort out various problems?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>I am very glad to know that.  The Minister has conceded that some amendments will be made in the course of the Bill's progress but unless we can make a substantial number of amendments it will not be accepted by the Defence Forces because of the suspicious manner in which it has been introduced. That is regrettable because we could have done something very good.</P>

A great and historic opportunity has been lost due to the manner in which this Bill has been handled.  All we can do now is try our best by tabling amendments to redress some of the very serious inadequacies in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The denial of the right to form an association contravenes the UN Charter on Human rights and Article 40 of our own Constitution on the right to form and join associations.  The Bill ignores the 1984 European Parliament resolution which called on all member states in peace time to allow armed forces to participate in representative associations.</P>

That is my responsibility as a Deputy.  It is extraordinary that it has taken until now to get this Bill on the floor of the Dáil.  I contend that it would not be here but for the very serious campaign by the Army wives and pressure of public opinion and also because the Army wives took the ultimate step of contesting marginal constituencies in the last general election.  This brought the Government to their sense and they realised they had to face up to the problem and do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity we have not an adequate Bill before us.  I have not yet gone through it but it is obvious that it is not satisfactory <Col N="2404" /> to the very people it is meant to serve. They would not be outside the gates of Leinster House today had it been otherwise. Deputy McCartan and the Minister must address themselves to this problem, as must the Government.  Why are those people outside protesting about a Bill which the Minister claims is giving them what they want?  They have contacted me and every other Deputy on the Opposition benches during the past few days because they are not satisfied with the Bill as presented.  The Minister should have allowed consultation with the people directly concerned.  I challenge him to say whether he consulted Army officers or Defence Force personnel in relation to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the emergence over the last three years of a housing crisis which is rapidly becoming more acute; deplores the Government policies which have brought this about; and calls for urgent Government action to alleviate the crisis which affects every city and county in the State.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government which took office in 1987 and the present Coalition Government which took office following the June 1989 general election have effectively sabotaged the local authority house building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition Government came into office at the end of 1982 we were in the midst of a major housing crisis.  There were 30,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists and many of them believed that they had little hope of proper housing for many years.  New housing policies, together with a substantial increase in local authorities' housing capital allocation, resulted in a dramatic decrease in the housing waiting lists.  In excess of 6,000 <Col N="2405" /> houses per year were built during the lifetime of that Government and, as a result of their policies, the waiting lists fell to approximately 17,000.  At the end of the life of that Government few of those entitled to local authority housing would have been on a housing waiting list for more than 12 months and many would have expected that, within 12 to 16 months, local authority housing would have been made available to them.</P>
    <P>The statistics of the achievements of that period are worth recording because of what I anticipate will be the misleading remarks likely to be made by the Minister in the light of an amendment to our motion which has been circulated about what took place during that period.  The Minister, in a foolish amendment which has been circulated to the House, talks about welcoming the strong reversal in 1989 of the eight year decline in new house completions.  That amendment is in the realm of fantasy and wishful thinking on the part of the Minister.  It brings us back to the sort of Opposition politics that we saw exhibited in this House on a week to week basis during the lifetime of that Government.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister misleads the House about the achievement of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, the statistics of their achievements in the housing area should be read into the record.  The statistics show that in 1982 there were 5,686 houses completed; in 1983, 6,190; in 1984, 7,002; in 1985, 6,523; and in 1986, 5,516.  In 1987, the first year of the Fianna Fáil Government, there were 3,074 houses completed, a figure which declined to 1,450 in 1988 and there was a further decline in 1989 to below 1,000.  Those figures are from the <i>Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics 1988</i> published by the Department.  How could any Minister seriously be party to tabling a motion in this House which welcomes &ldquo;the reversal of the eight year decline&rdquo;? The decline only started when this Minister took office.</P>
    <P>The problems in the whole local authority housing area have been the product of this Government's policies.  The impact of Fianna Fáil entering office was <Col N="2406" /> traumatic.  Capital financing for local authority housing was drastically curtailed, which resulted in 1988 in only 735 local authority housing starts.  The capital allocation, as I said, fell dramatically.  For example, in 1984, there was an allocation of £207 million for local authority housing; in 1985, £193 million; and in the last year of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, £147 million.  In 1988 the allocation, the first for which this Minister was responsible, fell to £48 million, and in 1989 to £39 million.  This latter allocation was not only to cover house building but also repairs and refurbishment. The extraordinary reductions of 1988 and 1989 resulted in local authority house building programmes effectively grinding to a halt.  In 1989 building commenced countrywide on approximately 750 local authority houses.  This countrywide figure is less than the total number of new houses provided by Dublin Corporation in each of the years between 1980 and 1986.  In each of those years the corporation completed on average 1,500 new houses.  Last year, to the lasting shame of this Government, Dublin Corporation did not complete a single house, an extraordinary record from the largest local authority in the country.</P>
    <P>There are currently an estimated 22,000 people on local authority housing waiting lists.  By the end of this year, on the basis of the Government's current policies, the figure may have grown to 25,000.  The Minister for the Environment, overflowing with his usual political hyperbole, announced last November in the Estimates debates &mdash; and again just over two weeks ago &mdash; the local authority housing capital allocation. &ldquo;Flynn announces increased local authority housing allocations&rdquo; screamed the headline of the press release from the Minister's press and information office. We were told that capital allocations totalling £51 million for the local authority housing programme in 1990 were announced, £33 million of which was to be spent on new local authority housing.  I suppose the figures sounded impressive in the context of the <Col N="2407" /> Minister's preceding two year offering. The Minister described this allocation as an increase of 50 per cent in the 1989 outturn.  Of course it was not very difficult to increase the 1989 outturn by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>This self-indulgent piece of ministerial back slapping fooled the media into thinking that something meaningful was happening and that real additional resources were being provided for the local authority house building programme. The press release was not, of course, deliberately misleading, it was just economical with the truth.  It did not state that the 1990 capital allocation is less than one-sixth in real terms of the allocation made a decade ago.  It did not state that the 1990 capital allocation is lower than any sum allocated in any year by the Government in office between 1982 and 1986 for local authority housing. It did not mention, as I already said, that for the first time in living memory, Dublin Corporation had no house building programme for 1989 and that, incredibly, not a single new house was completed by the corporation last year.</P>
    <P>It omitted to mention that in our capital city the housing waiting list had grown from 1,800 in May 1988 to 3,970 in September 1989.  If you add Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council lists together at 31 December 1989 there were approximately 5,000 families on the housing waiting lists in Dublin, the vast majority of whom have no hope of being allocated a house this year or next if the Government continue their present policies.  Will this figure reach 10,000 in Dublin by the time our capital city features as the cultural capital of Europe?  Of course Dublin is not the only area in which the local authority housing waiting lists are growing.  The statistics show that throughout the length and breadth of this country there is a rapid increase in numbers on the housing waiting lists, with very limited hope of houses being allocated to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister also did not publicise the contents of the circular letters his Department are sending to local authorities <Col N="2408" /> about their capital allocation.  He did not tell the general public or the media who received his press release that the capital allocations to many local authorities are merely illusory and that instead of providing additional resources for housing the Government were diverting housing resources to other uses such as road building.  In the case of Dublin County Council, for example, no direct capital grant is to come from the Department of the Environment for housing this year. This local authority have been notified by the Department that a capital sum of £2,621,000 can be used by them for their local authority house building programme. Of that, £2,196,000 is for the provision of local authority houses and £425,000 is for halting sites or residential caravan parks for travellers.  This total allocation is to be financed from the internal housing capital receipts of Dublin County Council, that is, from money raised from the sale of existing houses. Apart from meeting existing commitments, this sum will enable the council to commence the building of only 50 new houses this year, not all of which will be completed during 1990.  With the additional families it is anticipated will come onto this local authority's waiting list, the impact of this allocation will be minimal.</P>
    <P>Many will take the view that it is reasonable that moneys raised from the sale of houses should be used for the provision of new houses.  Similar requirements are being imposed on other local authorities throughout the country.  For example, Dublin Corporation are in a position similar to that of Dublin County Council.  All the moneys they are to use for the provision of local authority housing accommodation are to come from internal housing capital receipts and the same applies to the Cork local authorities. There is, however, more to the story.  We are not simply recycling moneys that are normally obtained from the sale of houses for the building of new houses.  Until this year these moneys were normally made available for local authority loans or remedial works on existing local authority accommodation but the matter goes further.  Not only will <Col N="2409" /> moneys no longer be available for these purposes but Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and other local authorities have been instructed to use some of the moneys realised from the sale of houses for other purposes.  The Dublin local authorities have been instructed that £500,000 of their 1990 road grant in respect of each authority is to be resourced from internal housing capital.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that at a time when there are growing housing waiting lists this uncaring, anti-social and heartless Government have taken the unprecedented step of directing local authorities to divert housing finance to the building of roads.  In Dublin alone this year a total of £1 million that should be used in the provision of local authority housing accommodation will be used for roads purposes.  At no stage has the Minister brought this information before the Dáil and at no stage has he told the Dáil exactly how much money the other local authorities in the State have to divert from housing finance into road construction.</P>
    <P>We are sitting on a social time-bomb that is slowly ticking away as housing lists are building up all over the country. Emigration resulting from unemployment has delayed the explosion but will not prevent it.  We are rapidly developing a two tier society with growing deprivation and homelessness.  This Government choose to ignore the problem they have created and will no doubt this evening in response to this motion engage in another misleading and dishonest public relations exercise.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister in response to Dáil questions talked of meeting &ldquo;acute housing needs&rdquo; only.  For each and every family on a housing waiting list their need is acute.  For the increasing number of people who require housing this Government offer no hope.  The Government have not only turned their back on those who require accommodation through local authorities but they have not done enough to tackle the problems of those who live in inadequate and dilapidated local authority accommodation which <Col N="2410" /> lacks the basic essentials of life.  It is a national disgrace that in the Ireland of the nineties there are families living in 2,500 local authority dwellings which have no indoor toilets and over 8,000 local authority dwellings with no proper bathroom facilities.  While the majority of such accommodation lacking these basic facilities is to be found in Cork and Dublin, most local authorities have some accommodation in which such facilities are lacking.</P>
    <P>The statistics of local authorities with accommodation that lack such facilities were given recently in the Dáil by the Minister.  You could go through each local authority area in the country and you would be hard pressed to find some local authority with accommodation in which such basic facilities are not lacking. For example, in Cavan there were 25 local authority houses with no indoor toilets and 30 with no bathrooms or showers; in Longford there were 36 houses with no indoor toilets and 38 with no bathrooms or showers; in Waterford there were 403 houses with no indoor toilets and 403 with no bathroom or shower and in the Dún Laoghaire Borough there were 203 houses with no indoor toilets and 758 with no bathrooms or showers.  In Dún Laoghaire, which is often viewed as being a rich part of the world, there are people living in conditions which should not be tolerated in the nineties and which are familiar to the Ireland of the thirties.  There is a whole list of local authorities with accommodation in which the basic facilities, that many of us as Members of this House take for granted as part of our day to day comforts, are sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>For those currently purchasing their own home, this Government are also responsible for creating major difficulties. The decrease in interest rates which resulted from the policies of the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition Government and which was maintained by the Fianna Fáil Government when constrained by Fine Gael from the Opposition benches has now been reversed.  We have had five increases in mortgage interest rates in the past 12 months and <Col N="2411" /> in the current economic climate the possibility of further interest rate rises cannot be ruled out.  Young couples who obtained mortgages at a time of low interest rates now find themselves paying approximately £100 more per month in repayments to building societies and banks.  The reduction by the Government in the Finance Acts of the mortgage interest allowance was justified by the Minister on the basis of the low interest rates payable by house purchasers.  I recall being in this House when the present Minister for the Environment, never slow to heap modest praise on himself, said that the changes in the Finance Act were justified as a result of the Government's policies in reducing interest rates.  The Minister claimed credit for the reduction in interest rates and he cannot now throw his hands in the air and disclaim responsibility for the savage rises that have occurred.</P>

      <P>To relieve the pressure felt by many hard-pressed young couples purchasing their first home, the Government should ensure that when the Finance Bill is published an amendment is included in it to restore full mortgage interest relief.  In the absence of such amendment there is going to be an increasing number of house purchasers unable to meet their mortgage commitments, who are going to be forced to sell their homes and look to local authorities to provide them with accommodation, so adding to the housing crisis that now confronts us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A broad range of policies and initiatives is required to tackle this problem. There is a specific need for sheltered housing and this need has not yet been adequately addressed.  Currently there is a mixture of responsibility between the local authorities and the health boards in this area.  The need is urgent.  The number of patients in psychiatric units in our hospitals fell from 26,000 in the early sixties to 13,000 in the mid-eighties to about 8,000 in 1989.  The idea of people being <Col N="2412" /> deinstitutionalised and returned to their communities is right.  Nevertheless, the Simon Community have reported a worrying number of such former patients having to be picked up and helped by voluntary services.  There is little evidence that deinstitutionalisation has been accompanied by the kind of attention required to avoid homelessness.</P>
    <P>The 1989 report of the National Council for the Aged refers to the manner in which voluntary organisations have had to provide basic housing for the elderly because of the collapse of the public housing programme.  Over 90 per cent of shelter beds in this country is provided by religious, voluntary and charitable organisations, very few of whom receive more than a token contribution towards their running costs from statutory resources. This is a problem that the Government have not to date adequately confronted.</P>
    <P>The need for hostel accommodation is well documented.  Most hostel accommodation is provided in grim 19th century buildings offering poor amenities, little basic privacy and in most cases nowhere to stay during the day.  There is a shortage of places for women and children and extreme overcrowding.  Totally inadequate provision is made for women who are the victims of broken marriages and who are very often battered and beaten into leaving their homes.  It took three years after it was agreed by the Eastern Health Board to replace Brú Caoimhín with a new service, Haven House, in February 1989, illustrating the lack of urgency the problem receives.  As resources to house all the homeless people now living in hostels and unsuitable accommodation are unlikely to materialise overnight, given the cut in the housing programme and this Government's failure to tackle properly the problems of the homeless, some basic improvements in present living conditions must be attempted now.  As a minimum, there should be an end to the practice whereby hostel residents have to leave first thing in the morning and the appropriate resources will have to be given to provide the necessary day staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" /> A large number of initiatives are necessary to tackle the problem but this Government, ostrich-like, have sought to bury their heads in the sand and pretend there is no problem.  Every Member of the House is aware of the problem.  Every Member of this House is meeting people on a regular basis who need help to resolve their housing difficulties and has to honestly say to those seeking local authority accommodation that it is unlikely that they will get it in 1990 or 1991, and if the Government remain in office they will not get it in 1992.  It is the responsibility of Government to take urgent action to alleviate this crisis which affects every city and county in the State. The responsibility for the crisis lies with the Government and the Government are not meeting that responsibility.</P>

The Government Deputies, particularly those on the backbenches, are well aware of the extent of the problem and are coming across it weekly at their clinics and are throwing their hands up in despair at the policies implemented by this Minister. Some of those Deputies were fooled into believing when the Minister announced the capital allocation for 1990 that some <Col N="2414" /> small step would be taken to alleviate the problem within the local authority housing area.  I suggest that some of those Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrat backbenchers should consider supporting this motion, because if they do not, I do not believe their constituents will thank them next time they come before them seeking support for election purposes.</P>

      <P>There is a housing crisis facing the country and as I have first hand knowledge of the position in Dublin city I will confine my remarks to the problem in the capital.  My comments specifically relate to Dublin Corporation and do not take into account the waiting lists in the Dublin County Council area. According to the Corporation's most recent assessment of housing needs, there are 3,970 applicants on the housing waiting list and a further 6,972 people on the housing transfer list, many of whom are living in overcrowded circumstances or in flat complexes which are in a poor state of repair.  Since the corporation built no houses in 1989 and estimate they will built only 34 houses in 1990, the housing crisis in the capital, where the closing date for new applicants is next Friday, will become acute when the new list is published on 1 May next.  The fact that the corporation close their list for six months at a time probably disguises an even worse housing crisis, if this is imaginable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment placed by The Workers' Party, as usual, does not attempt to address the current problem or the housing needs of the people but rather, sets out to score points off the Labour Party by deleting the reference to the past three years.  For the record, and so that everybody is aware of the <Col N="2415" /> precise position, I will read out the table of house building by Dublin Corporation and this is worthy of examination.  In 1970, 1,027 houses were built; in 1971, 1,536; in 1972, 1,282; in 1973, 1,588; in 1974, 1,480; in 1975, 1,525; in 1976, 1,626; in 1977, 1,640; in 1978, 1,386; in 1979, 1,505; in 1980, 1,519; in 1981, 1,520; in 1982, 1,351; in 1983, 1,753; in 1984, 1,717; in 1985, 1,358; in 1986, 1,014; in 1987, 446; in 1988, 148; in 1989, nil; and the estimate for 1990 in Dublin Corporation, the largest housing authority in the country, is 34 houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This must be set against the fact that there are 3,970 applicants on the housing waiting list and a further 6,972 on the housing transfer list, many of whom are living in over-crowded circumstances in very poor accommodation. We ask whether we have a housing crisis.  Of course we have a housing crisis and it is very clear that in the years the Fine Gael and Labour Coalitions were in office the housing problem was tackled and when they were out of office it was not.  I resent the attempt by The Workers' Party to delete the reference to the past three years in the amendment they put before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the local authority house building the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition introduced the £5,000 surrender grant for house purchasers, which had some side effects, but was largely successful. They also introduced house improvement grants for those who could leave the waiting list and house themselves with some assistance.  Until recently, Dublin Corporation had approximately 2,000 tenants on their books &mdash; I stress on their books &mdash; who did not have bathrooms, but by deleting those who had applied to purchase their houses and also removing from the list those old and feeble persons who do not want to face the disruption of builders, the corporation were able to reduce their book records to 636 Dublin Corporation <Col N="2416" /> houses plus approximately 200 flats which do not have bathrooms.  The real figure is, of course, nearer to 2,000 since those applicants who have applied to purchase their houses will still not have a bathroom and will have to provide themselves with this basic facility when they eventually own the house over the next 18 months to two years.  Let us ask whether it is acceptable that tenants of our capital's local authority do not have a bathroom nine years off the 21st century.  Of course not.</P>
    <P>There are 16,000 Dublin Corporation flats and about 1,000 of these are senior citizen flats which are generally of a high standard but of the remaining 15,000 about two-thirds, or 10,000, are in need of major refurbishment.  None of us would aspire to live in the dark, dank crumbling flat complexes where we compel some of our citizens to live.  If our children lived there we would have many sleepless nights but it seems that we are prepared to tolerate others living in such circumstances.  This is not the first time I have raised this issue in this House but what has the Minister for the Environment done during his three years in office?  Nothing.  I have illustrated the situation in the figures.  It was a serious mistake to appoint two rural Deputies to the Department of the Environment in 1987 and to leave them there.  It is comparable to appointing two city slickers to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The housing crisis is not on the agenda because the two Ministers do not know it exists.  Surely the recently appointed Minister of State will tell us the plans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, I am sharing the remainder of the time available to Fine Gael with Deputy Doyle.</P>
      <P>I fully support what has been said by my colleagues, Deputies Shatter and Mitchell. Every public representative, not only in this House but in every local authority, is fully aware of the extent of the housing crisis being experienced at present.  It cannot be called anything but a crisis.  It is apparent that the Government have abandoned the moral obligation to provide adequate housing for the most marginalised and disadvantaged among us.  It seems to be their policy to tell the poor and homeless that they will have to await an improvement in the economy before adequate housing can be provided.  This is poor and scant consolation for the many thousands at present living in inadequate and miserable housing conditions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter earlier made the important point that the increase in mortgage interest rates will lead to further difficulties.  There are some in the middle income range who are thinking of buying a house with their own resources. However, the recent increase in mortgage interest rates will stop them in their tracks and turn them towards the local authority housing programmers but, unfortunately, their response will be very negative indeed.</P>
      <P>Each public representative could cite many cases to highlight the appalling problems being experienced by thousands of people on council waiting lists. Because of the failure to provide adequate funding people will end up in hospital as a result of having to live in very damp conditions.  Most of us are fully aware of those cases where marriages have broken down as a direct result of housing conditions.  This is an argument which cannot be countered.  We tend to sweep the problem under the carpet but it is a very grave one.  I can restate with certainty that there are many cases where marriages have broken down as a direct result of inadequate and appalling housing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to the position in <Col N="2418" /> the area which I am most familiar with, that is north Cork.  The figures for that area and for the county as a whole are worse than the figures for any other area in the country.  In 1985, the year I was first elected to the council, and I have had many people approach me since looking for houses, 125 houses were built in north Cork.  Last year, however, only 17 or 18 were built and this year we have received finance to build 35 houses.  No Minister could say that the housing needs in an area where 125 houses were built in 1985 could be met adequately through the provision of 35 houses in 1990.  North Cork and the county as a whole are experiencing the same problems as the rest of the country, and, unfortunately, they are getting the same negative answer from the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one final point on housing policy which would be of more importance if adequate funding was being made available but even at a time when inadequate funding is being made available we should address the issue of policy. As a rural Deputy I wish to express my disappointment at the disappearance of rural cottages from the council's housing progrmme.  Last week in this House the Minister indicated that it costs about £35,000 to build a council house.  In many areas rural cottages can be built for a figure of between £20,000 and £25,000. If we can keep people in rural areas we should do so.  However, we are doing the reverse which is very wrong.  In relation to council housing estates, the building of council estates of between 50 and 70 houses in towns is the wrong way to proceed as in the long run it leads to social chaos and disorder.  What we need is a far better mix of private and public housing. I appeal to the Minister to give some consideration to this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell outlined the substantial progress made in house building in Dublin over a long number of years and the effect this had on the waiting list which had been substantially reduced, down to a figure as low as 2,800 in May 1988.  However, since then it has gradually increased and, unfortunately, <Col N="2419" /> no houses are being made available.  This stark fact was brought home to the housing committee of Dublin Corporation at their meeting last Thursday when they discussed a letter they had received from the Minister for the Environment in which he outlined what their capital allocation grant would be &mdash; £7.5 million. Indeed this did not amount to a capital allocation grant at all as it was to come out of the revenue of Dublin Corporation. The Minister was castigated by his own members for this.  One of them went so far as to apologise on his behalf and stated the Minister probably did not realise that the letter had been sent out. It was a ridiculous letter.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the part of the letter dealing with Sheriff Street.  It is quite clear that Dublin Corporation were of the view that the Government were going to give Sheriff Street priority and that a capital allocation was needed from the Government.  The Minister has asked the Corporation to buy 60 units this year and has provided a sum of £1 million to enable this to be done.  Where could one buy a house for £16,000 today?  It is just not on. It is a crazy suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are facing serious problems. Deputy Mitchell referred to the number of houses which Dublin Corporation feel should be provided.  This figure has been notified to the Minister.  The corporation have pointed out that at present there are 582 homeless persons on the waiting list. However, the Simon Community in a letter to me say the figure is at least 1,700. As we are aware, the homeless are given priority under the 1988 Housing Act but there is nothing to give them.  Today I visited the housing section of Dublin Corporation and saw the queues there.  One needs to have points before one can get a flat in Ballymun today.  It is true that at present 390 units in Ballymun are under repair but when these have been repaired there will be no vacancies in Ballymun; neither are there any vacancies in Tallaght. As no accommodation is available for the homeless, they are just going to have to wait.  It is not good enough for <Col N="2420" /> the Minister to say that there is no need to provide housing.  There is.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to point out that we cannot draw up a housing programme overnight.  We all want to see the economy improve and to see some of those who have emigrated in recent years return home.  Incidentally, this has taken some of the pressure off the Government to build houses.  If the economy improves and these people return home where will they be housed?  We will end up facing the same crisis again when the Taoiseach and the Minister will probably go on television and radio to say that they were not aware of the crisis just like they were not aware of the crisis in the health service. As the Minister is well aware, before houses can be built two to three years have to be spent in planning.  It is most essential that the Minister realises there is a problem in Dublin.  I would not call it a crisis but we are nearing that stage. Unless the Minister pays far more attention to this matter than he did in the letter he sent us last week and provides a real capital allocation with which to build houses we will end up facing serious problems.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>welcomes the strong reversal in 1989 of the eight year decline in new house completions, the bringing into force of the Housing Act, 1988, the success of the other Government initiatives in the housing area and the increased resources made available for local authority and voluntary housing and for the homeless in 1990; and urges the Government to keep housing policies under review.</P>
      <P>I have not been all that impressed by the contributions I have heard so far.  One has come to expect a reasonably good contribution from Deputy Shatter on most topics but we heard a rather dull contribution from Deputy Shatter on most topics but we heard a rather dull contribution from him this evening.  That was followed by a pretty lacklustre contribution from his colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Shatter's heart is not in this subject.  He did not display any great commitment to those in need of housing, to those looking for better housing or for the repair of their existing houses.  The building industry is doing well.  One only has to open one's eyes to see that building activity is booming not just in Dublin city but throughout the country.  Housing is a major contributor to the large growth in output that occurred last year and that is continuing.  Overall, building output last year increased by more than 10 per cent. It was an equally good year for employment with the creation of at least 4,000 new construction jobs plus countless others in the areas providing support services to the industry.</P>
      <P>The prospects for the construction industry are better now than they have been for a long time and that is agreed by all serious commentators.  This year we expect growth to be similar to last year.  In two years we will have achieved the best part of 25 per cent growth or, in money terms, we will have generated an additional £660 million of expenditure in the industry and all the jobs that entails. New housing has always contributed significantly to this growth.  I recommend the weekly property supplements of the country's major newspapers as prescribed reading for Deputy Shatter and his friends opposite.  They will give those Members some idea as to what is being said about the building industry and new house building in particular.</P>
      <P>The building industry and the house building sector are bullish and the best commentators expect continuous improvement in the overall performance of that industry over the next few years. I find it ironic that Members should be casting about looking for a crisis where none exists.  At least Deputy Doyle confirmed that there is no crisis.  He said that there was a problem.  I agree with him that there is a need for housing but he was correct in stating that there is no crisis in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> Through the early and mid-eighties when housing output was falling year after year nobody claimed that there was a major housing problem or crisis.  Over the past year housing output has been increasing for the first time since 1981 and we are now told we have a housing problem.  The truth is that when the whole economy was in crisis nobody felt the need to claim a problem in a particular part of the economy but now that the economic picture is much brighter it is inevitable that for political reasons some people are driven to manufacture so-called crises and problems in some specific areas of Government policy. That is what is taking place now.</P>
    <P>The main Opposition party were casting about for a suitable item for debate during Cheltenham race week and they come up with the old hardy annual, housing. It is a good item.  They felt it would not cause any problems and that there would not be too much attention paid to it.  I take this business more seriously than they do.  Deputy Shatter's contribution seeks to convey a major problem, a problem of extreme proportions.  It is highly irresponsible of the Deputy, as spokesman for the main Opposition party, to put a motion before the House on any issue in such extreme terms that it exaggerates problems and promotes unjustified fears and anxieties.</P>
    <P>There always exists a housing need where the population is on the move but certainly there is no crisis.  Deputies do not have to take my word for that.  The NECS's independent report on housing, published in December, 1988 stated:</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial improvement in the average standard of housing.  This leaves the average level of service from Irish housing, judged in terms of space, conditions and amenities, as relatively high &mdash; that is in relation to the level of GNP per head in Ireland: indeed, Ireland would score highly on any international comparisons of this nature.</P>
    <P>In addition I defy any Deputy to find any professional or tradesman in the house building industry who would say that <Col N="2423" /> prospects for house building are worse now than they were when the parties opposite left Government three years ago.</P>
    <P>Figures now available show that last year private housing output grew rapidly and an additional 3,100 new private houses were completed compared to 1988, an increase of 22 per cent in just one year.  This year significantly additional resources are being made available for the local authority housing programme and I expect about 5,000 new lettings of local authority houses in 1990.  Total housing completions will again increase this year to about 20,000.  This compares with the NESC estimate of likely housing requirements for the period 1986 to 1996 as between 11,000 and 15,000 per annum with a figure towards the upper end of the range as more appropriate.</P>
    <P>Registrations under the national house building guarantee scheme are the most important leading indicator of future trends in private house building.  They have shown an increase of 72 per cent between 1987 and 1989 and I am glad to be able to report that figures to date this year show a further 7 per cent increase over last year.  This is hardly the stuff that would suggest a housing crisis or a major problem.</P>
    <P>While I say there is no crisis I do not say that everything is perfect in the housing field.  Deputy Doyle is correct, there is a need.  It is not &mdash; either here or in any other country that I know of &mdash; and it probably never will be perfect.  There are problems that need continuing attention. Families who cannot afford to house themselves must not be condemned to living in unfit or inadequate accommodation indefinitely.  Vulnerable households such as the homeless, the handicapped and the travelling people must be catered for.  Access to owner occupation particularly for young couples must be made as easy as possible.  The greatest possible level of resources &mdash; financial and otherwise &mdash; must be devoted to dealing with these issues.  This is precisely what the Governments in which I have held the housing brief have <Col N="2424" /> been doing over the past three years. And I dare say we will continue to do so. The Fine Gael-Labour Government of 1982 to 1987 had been fooling around with a badly needed Housing Bill for practically four years but failed to get it on the statute book.  Yet within little over a year of taking office I had succeeded in having the Housing Act, 1988, passed into law.  That was generously welcomed by Deputies Shatter and Quinn and others. Deputy Shatter's Coalition Government in the years previous failed to deliver.</P>

      <P>This Act represented a number of major advances in housing legislation, not least of which was to positively address the issue of homelessness for the first time in housing legislation. The Government have greatly expanded the provision of voluntary housing, particularly for categories such as elderly persons and the homeless.  These and the numerous other positive measures taken in the housing area by my party over the past three years show up the hollowness of this motion.  I will be reminding the House of these presently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much is being made of the restriction on income tax relief on mortgage interest.  I should point out, however, that Deputy Dukes as Minister for Finance restricted the benefit of mortgage tax relief in his budget of 1983 when he reduced the upper limit on the interest that was allowable against tax from £4,800 for a married couple to £4,000. Incidentally, the mortgage interest rate at the time was 13 per cent.  In fact, this limit still remains but is subject to the further restriction which disallows 20 per cent of interest paid within the relevant ceiling.  The main Opposition parties would be well advised to tread warily when they are talking about restrictions on mortgage interest relief.  When I became Minister for the Environment the mortgage interest rate was 12.5 per cent even though international rates were in decline.  The economy was in a mess even following the mismanagement of the Labour-Fine Gael Government and the <Col N="2425" /> public finances were certainly in disarray. That, at least, is agreed by all parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to our Government's firm management of the public finances and the economy in general, mortgage rates for much of the past three years were at their lowest level in almost 20 years.  Of course, restrictions of mortgage interest relief must be seen in the widest context of the continuing improvements in recent years in the income tax structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>From 6 April next the standard rate of income tax will be reduced to 30 per cent and the top rate to 53 per cent.  Up to the 1989 budget these rates were 35 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively. There has been a beneficial widening of the tax bands as well in recent years.  These benefits do not come cheaply.  The cumulative cost of the income tax reliefs in the 1988, 1989 and 1990 budgets, at over £800 million, is well over three times the £225 million commitments given by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Indeed the savings accruing from the partial restriction on mortgage interest relief only meet a small part of these broader income tax reliefs which benefit all taxpayers. Mortgage relief will cost well over £200 million in the 1990-91 tax year.  This represents a very substantial continuing subsidy to home ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that at the time of the 1989 budget I said &mdash; and I am on the record of this House &mdash; that one of the reasons for the reduction in the mortgage interest relief from 90 per cent to 80 per cent at that time was to counter strong inflationary pressures beginning to emerge in the house market. The 80 per cent restriction has been <Col N="2426" /> among the factors that helped to moderate these inflationary trends.  There is no point in giving tax relief on mortgages if it is simply passed on in higher house prices and consequently to higher mortgages.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 the Government have been committed to rescuing the economy from the shambles left behind by the previous Administration, an Administration which, among other things, managed to double the national debt.  We took the decisive measures, made the difficult decisions and saw the country benefit as confidence in the economic management of the economy returned.  Thanks to our policies, the country was able for the first time in years to reap the full benefits of favourable international trends in interest rates.  Indeed, for a long time in the latter part of 1988 and the early months of 1989 we were able to withstand upward movements in international rates, but, as any independent commentator would acknowledge, we could not, as a small and open economy, go on forever &ldquo;bucking&rdquo; the continuing upward spiral in rates in other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputies may ask where have our prudent policies got us now that rates are high again.  I will tell them.  Our sound economic management of the economy has ensured that our mortgage rates are not considerably higher.  For many years our mortgage rates were considerably higher.  For many years our mortgage rate was on par or higher than the prevailing rate in the UK. Today our standard rate is three pecentage points lower than theirs. Restoring the full 100 per cent tax relief on mortgages up to the £4,000 limit would be equivalent to an expenditure of over £50 million.  To increase public expenditure &mdash; for that is what it would be &mdash; in that manner would be a singularly inappropriate response to present interest rate trends.  It would give the totally wrong signal to the financial markets and would be seen as a return to the soft option of more spending as the solution to difficulties.</P>
    <P>We cannot, and must not, take the <Col N="2427" /> apparent soft option of relaxing our policies and begin throwing money at problems. If we were to go down that path &mdash; and I can assure you it is not our intention to do so &mdash; I have no doubt that mortgage rates would quickly reach levels of 16 per cent.  In the long term we would not be acting in the best interest of house purchasers. Rather, we must continue to prudently manage the economy and in this way we will ensure that we will benefit immediately from improvements in interest rate levels internationally.</P>
    <P>On 1 April 1989 section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, dealing with the assessment of local authority housing needs, was brought into operation.  Section 9 is a singularly important provision of the 1988 Act in that it provides for the first time a framework for the comprehensive measurement by category of the need for the provision of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The first assessment of housing needs under section 9 was undertaken on 30 September 1989.  In assessing housing needs, housing authorities were required by the Act to have regard to a number of specified categories of needs including the homeless, handicapped and elderly. Despite the fact that local authorities were required to include in their assessment, in many cases for the first time, categories of need such as single persons who were not elderly and homeless persons, the level of approved applicants remains significantly below what it was in the early 1980s.  I will quote the figures for the past three years.  At the end of September 1989 there were 19,400 approved applicants for local authority housing including, as I have said, those categories of need not previously counted by many authorities.  On January 1987 there were 20,637 approved applicants for local authority housing.  In reality these figures would have been much higher if compiled on the basis of the 1989 figures.</P>
    <P>In addition to the decline in the overall level of needs, the housing prospects of all categories of local authority housing applicants have improved significantly in recent years, with authorities housing <Col N="2428" /> applicants who previously had little or no prospect of securing local authority accommodation.  Many applicants still on waiting lists have chosen to decline reasonable offers of accommodation and await accommodation becoming available in a particular location indicating that the severity of such needs is much less acute than it used to be.  Against this background it would have been irresponsible to maintain the local authority housing programme at the level of previous years and this could not be justified either in terms of real housing needs or the critical need to restore order to the public finances.</P>
    <P>On 22 February I notified all housing authorities of their capital allocations for their housing programmes for 1990.  The total available this year is £51 million, an increase of almost £13 million or 34 per cent on expenditure on the programme in 1989.  Of this sum £33 million will be available for the provision of additional houses.  This represents an increase of over 50 per cent on last year's expenditure of £21.7 million and reverses the trend of previous years where the capital allocation provided to the programme reduced each year since 1984.  The increased provision being made available to the programme will enable an expanded programme to be undertaken which should yield over 1,250 new starts and about 1,200 completions this year. When account is taken of casual vacancies it is expected that at least 5,000 new lettings will be made in 1990.</P>
    <P>An important development this year is that housing authorities have been given full discretion in the selection of the particular dwellings which they will start in 1990 within the total number allocated to them.  I think Deputy Bradford will be pleased to hear that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for each authority, therefore, to decide the locations of their own starts or purchases of existing private houses, as appropriate.  It is only <Col N="2429" /> right and sensible that each local authority would decide their own priorities within their overall allocation.  I hope Deputies will respond positively to that.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funds available for new construction it is important to ensure that sufficient funds are provided to conserve and improve existing local authority estates and dwellings.  Deputies are no doubt aware of the many major schemes of refurbishment which are being undertaken to local authority estates countrywide under the terms of the remedial works scheme.  Since its inception some £47 million has been made available to authorities, including expenditure of £13.5 million in 1989 and a provision of £15 million this year.  The 1990 allocations which I have recently notified to local authorities will enable work to be undertaken in some 75 estates this year.</P>
      <P>For Deputy Shatter's information it is interesting to note that out of that £15 million, £5 million will go to Dublin Corporation, a major contribution to a need which I have recognised for the past few years as existing in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>The success of the 1988 local authority tenant purchase scheme has pushed the level of owner occupation in this country up to the 80 per cent mark&mdash;a remarkable level by international standards.  It showed that the desire for home ownership is as strong among local authority tenants as it is among the community at large.  The 1988 scheme gave a chance to those tenants in newer estates who could not previously have afforded the cost of home ownership.  Some 20,000 sales had gone through by the end of 1989 and the remaining 12,000 or so sales are being processed.  In 1989 I introduced a special scheme for the sale of flats and maisonettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed guidelines on the implementation of the provisions of the Housing Act, 1988, dealing with homelessness issued to housing authorities on 29 November 1988 and these provisions were brought into force on 1 January 1990.  Now that these arrangements have been in place for over a year, I intend to review the operation of the homelessness <Col N="2430" /> provisions during this year and to take the views of housing authorities and voluntary housing organisations into account in this review.</P>
    <P>My Department's voluntary housing scheme funds up to 95 per cent of the overall capital cost of the provision of accommodation for homeless persons and 80 per cent for other categories &mdash; mainly elderly persons &mdash; subject to an overall limit of £20,000 per unit of accommodation. The response by voluntary organisations to this scheme has been most gratifying and I am pleased to acknowledge the major contribution voluntary housing has made towards the provision of housing for some very deserving categories.</P>
    <P>Activity by approved voluntary housing bodies has grown dramatically, particularly in the past three years.  The reason for this growth has been the attractive terms of the scheme of capital funding by my Department coupled with substantial increases in the overall capital allocations for the scheme &mdash; from £2 million in 1986 to £9.275 million this year, which I expect will produce 500 units of accommodation.  Special attention has been given under the scheme to the needs of the homeless and I have ensured that particular priority has been afforded to funding projects for homeless persons such as those promoted by the Simon Community, Focus Point and the Iveagh Trust among others.</P>
    <P>The new Simon Community hostel at Usher's Island which opened last year has meant a great improvement in the living conditions of over 40 people who would otherwise be homeless.  Grant-aid has recently been sanctioned for another 15 unit Simon project in Cork.  The Iveagh Trust is presently upgrading its hostel accommodation to provide 155 modern units and accommodation for about 100 homeless persons will be provided at Stanhope Street, Dublin when the Focus Point project is ready later this year. Indeed in recognition of the importance of this very large scale voluntary housing project a special provision of £120,000 was made in this year's budget to assist the provision of communal facilities in <Col N="2431" /> the Stanhope Street project.  These projects are all grant-aided through the voluntary housing scheme along with numerous other projects throughout the country.  Overall, there is a wide spread of voluntary housing activity right across the country with significant schemes in Cork, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, Limerick, Cavan, Kilkenny and Meath and in fact virtually every county.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise and appreciate the importance of the private rented sector in the overall housing picture and I want to ensure the continued health of this sector so that it provides a sufficient stock of good quality accommodation to meet the requirements of households who need or prefer this form of tenure.  The Government have taken significant measures to encourage greater investment in the provision of private rented accommodation.  Our approach to the sector has been to create conditions which are favourable to increased investment through the provision of tax incentives and the reintroduction of the section 23-type incentives have done much to encourage investment.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the level of activity generated during the three years of the current incentives will exceed that which resulted from the original section 23 incentives which applied for six years &mdash; from 1981 to 1987.  The measures we have taken to encourge the provision of private rented accommodation are succeeding and this will lead to an increasing supply of good quality accommodation which will be available at a reasonable rent.</P>
    <P>In housing, no less than in other spheres of public policy, it is vital that we plan ahead.  In order to ensure that the necessary basic information for the proper review and development of housing policies is available, I requested local authorities on 1 December last to carry out an estimate of total housing requirements of their areas for the period to 1993.  This period broadly coincides with the time scale for other infrastructural development plans included in the National Development Plan.  The making <Col N="2432" /> of these estimates by local authorities will involve the carrying out of a sample survey of the existing housing stock to ascertain the present level of requirements in terms of replacement or improvement.  To this will then be added the prospective level of housing requirements arising out of future demographic trends.  The Environmental Research Unit of my Department is providing guidance and assistance to local authorities in carrying out this exercise.  When completed later this year, these estimates will provide very valuable date on housing requirements in each area and should assist us in reviewing policies and planning ahead.</P>
    <P>In many ways the most distressing aspect of these calls from Deputy Shatter and the Fine Gael benches for more public spending is that they appear to have learned nothing from their stewardship in the housing area during their last term in Government which was nothing short of disastrous.  In fact the liabilities which I inherited from them have seriously constrained me in making the best use of the resources available for housing.</P>
    <P>In 1986 a special new house grant of £2,250 was introduced for the benefit of builders with the peculiar characteristic of being paid in deferred instalments so that it would not have affected expenditure until 1988 when it would have cost £22 million.  The full annual cost of £29 million would have to be met in 1989. Furthermore, the situation I found in regard to public expenditure commitments on house improvement grants on becoming Minister for the Environment was truly appalling.  Grants approved totalled almost £230 million with applications still coming in at a rate that would add £5 million a month to this staggering figure.  The legacy of public debt left by this scheme resulted from a crude attempt to buy survival for a shaken Government that was having grave difficulties facing the resumption of the Dáil after the 1985 summer recess.</P>

      <P>This was a hastily conceived open-ended scheme under which expenditure could neither be predicted nor controlled.  It provided large handouts of taxpayers' money to individuals regardless of their means for doing often inessential, or even cosmetic works. Moreover, it was the better off people who were able to make most use of these grants.  As Deputies are aware, these grants will finally terminate on 31 May next and this will bring down the final curtain on this unhappy episode which has done immense damage to the concept of house improvement grants.</P>
      <P>The way the last Fine Gael-Labour Government treated ordinary people is a lingering disgrace.  The way they dealt with the house improvement scheme, by committing huge sums of unnecessary expenditure to it, prevented me from implementing a programme which I could have started earlier than this year. In these circumstances if we as a new Government were serious about tackling the problems of the economy, we had little choice but to take firm action to prevent any further escalation of liabilities. In doing so we were confident that we were taking on an important step towards providing the conditions under which the decline in the housing and building industries could be halted and reversed.  Time has proved this Government right.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of housing policy which has been accepted by successive Government is:</P>
      <P>to ensure that, as far as the resources of the economy permit, every household can obtain a house of good standard, located in an acceptable environment at a price or rent it can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Government and our predecessor real progress has been made in achieving this objective over the past three years.  But I have no intention of resting on our laurels.  It is my firm intention to actively review policies on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that changes are made and appropriate initiatives developed and introduced to deal <Col N="2434" /> with problems that exist or will arrive in the future.  The record of my party in the housing area going right back over the years is second to none and is something of which we are proud.  I trust I have said enough to satisfy Deputies that housing policies have been pursued in an effective and responsible way which contrasts sharply with the record in Government of the party sponsoring this motion.  Furthermore, this Government have the will and the energy to ensure and implement policies that are most appropriate to the achievement of the objective I have mentioned. Therefore I commend to the House the Government amendment to this motion.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputies that what was necessary in the economic sense for the country was done as our initial priority. We have a need for more housing and that need has been addressed.  More money is being provided this year and it is our intention to continue to meet the demand.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party amendment proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;acute&rdquo; and add the following:</P>
      <P>notes that the cause of the crisis has been the virtual abolition of the local authority housing programme, which has caused huge increases in housing waiting lists in every local authority area, and the absence of any coherent policy on homelessness; and calls on the Government to take the following actions:</P>
      <P>&mdash; to increase the capital allocation for local authority house building to £100 million, so as to enable existing housing construction proposals from local authorities to be acted upon, and to rescind present policies which will force the rapid depletion of the existing housing stock in local authority hands;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to expand the powers and terms of reference of the Rents Tribunal, and to publish a statutory charter of tenants' rights, to eliminate abuses in the private rented sector;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to ensure that local authorities promote the establishment of local housing co-operatives, particularly in relation to local authority flat schemes in need of refurbishment;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to improve eligibility for local authority housing loans, and to increase the amount of capital available;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to recognise the special housing needs of the handicapped and the elderly;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; to publish a White Paper on housing policy that would enable our population to have a comprehensive and extensive housing policy that would recognise changing population <Col N="2436" /> trends and needs, the condition of the housing stock, the need for an integrated approach in the future as between local authority and private housing, and the need for the development of communities in the context of housing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the unique part he played in the collapse of the Berlin Wall.  The Minister's modesty has prevented him from claiming credit for that extraordinary feat despite his claiming unique credit this evening for so many other extraordinary feats.  It would be remiss of us not to attach the same degree of credibility to that ludicrous assertion as to some of the other ludicrous assertions the Minister made during the course of his 30 minute speech.</P>
    <P>Normally on a Tuesday night I hold clinic in the same premises as Deputy Doyle shares in Ringsend.  I know that at this time there will be at least four or five people &mdash; it could be as many as 15 because the numbers are increasing&mdash;at that clinic seeking local authority housing accommodation.  The Minister for the Environment has said that part of the problem was that some people who were offered accommodation turned it down because it was not suitable.  He implied that they were in some way fussy in so refusing such accommodation.  Tragically the comment made by Deputy Mitchell about having a Minister for the Environment who does not understand the problems of urban housing has been very clearly illustrated.  To ask a person in Westport to accept housing in Ballina is not dissimilar to asking somebody in Dublin city to accept housing elsewhere in the city.  The lack of realism displayed by the Minister in that instance goes right through the statistics he has put on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I want to try and get away from the game of shouting numbers at each other. Nobody is the winner in that respect and we are simply playing with the housing needs of a great many people in our society.  There is a real housing problem in this country and unless action is taken very quickly in the next number of years <Col N="2437" /> that problem will become a crisis.  It is already a crisis in some areas and I suggest that the Minister should have due regard to what the Labour Party propose in their amendment.</P>
    <P>First, we are looking for an increase of £100 million, approximately £50 million on top of what the Minister has already provided, for the local authority housing programme.  The need for this money has already been illustrated by Deputy Doyle.  I do not want to confine my remarks specifically to local authority housing problems.  My fellow Deputies will illustrate the problems in other parts of the country.  I want to go beyond the local authority housing programme because the housing crisis is no longer confined uniquely to that area.</P>
    <P>There is a real need to expand the powers and terms of reference of the Rents Tribunal so as to deal with the expanded private sector to which the Minister referred and to publish a statutory charter of tenant rights to eliminate real abuses in the private sector area.  We have repeatedly called on the Minister in the House to introduce regulations under the existing legislation to make it mandatory for a landlord to give a receipt and a rent book to each private sector tenant. The Minister has so far consistently refused to do so because he appears to be protecting the construction industry, or landlords to be more precise.</P>
    <P>In addition we are asking the Minister to ensure that local authorities promote the establishment of local housing co-operatives particularly in relation to local authority flat schemes in need of refurbishment. The failure of Dublin Corporation to effectively implement the tenant purchase scheme in relation to flat purchases and not properly convey to any of the applicants the price of those schemes is an indictment of the relationship between the Department of the Environment on the one hand and Dublin Corporation on the other.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment on a previous occasion.</P>
    <P>There is a need to improve the eligibility thresholds for people seeking local authority housing loans and to increase <Col N="2438" /> the amount of capital available for them. Since the Government have been so quick to claim responsibility for the reduction in the interest rates over a number of years there is a clear need for them to intervene now positively in the money markets in a particular way to ensure that people in particular need get assistance with mortgages because of the rapid increase &mdash; approximately 50 per cent as a result of five increases &mdash; in mortgage interest rates over the past year.  The Minister needs to target those people who were deliberately driven off the local authority housing list and encouraged to buy homes which they could barely afford when interest rates were at single figure levels.  Those people are how extremely vulnerable and exposed to a great deal of terror and hardship.  The Minister should listen to his backbenchers, if not his advisers.  If he does not believe that a crisis is imminent he should listen more closely to the Deputies who deal in their clinics with people who are on the local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a need for the Government to recognise the special housing needs of the handicapped and the elderly. I welcome the progress which has been built on by this administration on the programmes which were opened up in the early eighties in the area of helping the voluntary sector to provide sheltered housing accommodation but this is simply not enough.  Since the Minister referred to the 1980 Housing Act, I am sure he recalls the debate which took place in this House at that time when I referred to the need for a proper inventory of our housing stock, not just a local authority assessment of housing needs.  No progress has been made in relation to that.</P>
    <P>The Government need to look at the entire area of the administration of the construction industry which provides only 2 per cent of additional housing units to the total stock in any given year.  In confining himself in glowing terms to the fact that the building industry is doing well, the Minister is ignoring the fact that 98 per cent of the housing stock is occupied by people who either cannot <Col N="2439" /> afford it, who live in fear of being evicted or cannot get accommodation because, perhaps, of having a child.  Some landlords refuse to give people accommodation if they have children.  These people have no protection against such discrimination and they have no possibility of getting accommodation from Dublin Corporation unless they are prepared to go out to the far and of Tallaght where there is no bus service and where they cannot survive in a holistic sense.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons &mdash; this is part and parcel of the amendment I have put down in the name of the Labour Party &mdash; there is now more than ever a chronic need for a comprehensive White Paper on housing policy to take us to the end of this century. This White Paper could show the massive achievements we as a people have made in regard to housing policy from the 1967 to 1969 period.  White Papers which have been published since that time show what has been achieved by all of us.  It does not behove anybody to start claiming exclusive credit for what has been achieved.  The taxpayer has paid for it and society has provided a massive housing stock over that period.  Some mistakes were made by the Government and some were made by us during our time in office in regard to the quality of the housing, its location and, as Deputy Bradford said, the large size of local authority estates.  We will not learn anything from the past if we keep on shouting statistics at each other, which is what the Minister indulged in here tonight.  The Minister is more capable of doing something with the powers he has as Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Government should publish a White Paper on housing which will assess our current housing stock and have regard to the special needs of the largest single group of people seeking housing. They are no longer the traditional nuclear family of two parents and two or three children.  They are now a minority in search of housing in our society.  As Sister Stanislaus and others will tell us we have turned that corner.  We need to formulate policy measures in regard to housing <Col N="2440" /> which will address the problems I have outlined.  If we stick to the old game of shouting numbers across the Floor we will ensure that categories of people who tonight are homeless or in fear of being made homeless will so remain.  The Minister must first and foremost do the things we have asked him to do and also bring in a White Paper on housing policy so that the entire industry can plan over the next eight years to take us up to the end of this decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very surprised at the Minister's response to the major housing crisis that confronts every housing authority in the country.  Every public representative has received volumes of representations from people who have been waiting for houses for two or three years.</P>
      <P>My own housing authority have between 70 and 90 people certified in need of housing by the county manager, the housing officer or the health inspector. At the January meeting we asked for 50 houses to relieve the situation.  Last Monday night the Minister allocated the princely sum of £75,000, enough to build three houses.  This aroused the condemnation not of the Labour Party and Fine Gael members but of the Fianna Fáil members of that council and they demanded that the Minister immediately meet a deputation.</P>
      <P>Local authority housing bodies are sitting on a virtual time bomb.  There is a growing uneasiness and depression descending on those who have been on the waiting list so long.  Our amendment seeks additional funds in the hope of removing that frustration and depression. Unfortunately nothing has been forthcoming so far.  Even if that were forthcoming tonight many more would be added to the list two years down the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my authority we got ten houses over the three years of the present Minister's responsibility.  We are offered a further three and there are now up to 100 families, including single parent families and the aged looking for houses.  No member of our housing authority, when approached, can offer any hope because <Col N="2441" /> there are not the resources to give people the statutory, fundamental and inalienable right of a house to live in.  This policy has not only deprived them of a house but has resulted in them becoming the victims of unscrupulous landlords who charge excessive rents over which there is no control.</P>
    <P>Let me make one reference to the house improvement grant.  This was accepted as one of the major bases of house improvements and restructuring in recent years.  Were it not for that grant the housing lists in all local authorities would be substantially longer.  That money provided the means for reconstruction and refurbishment that restored exceptionally bad houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's contribution tonight.  He gave most of his time to firing statistics across the floor.  Only twice in his 30 minutes did he mention local authority housing which is the basic of this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  Read the motion.  It says nothing about local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about refurbishment as being the greatest waste of public money.  He said that most of the work was cosmetic and unnecessary. That is the worst reflection I have ever heard cast by a Minister on his own officials who travelled the country diligently inspecting works that needed to be done.  The Minister says they were just cosmetic.  That is a mistake.  He has no idea of the dedicated work his inspectors put into that scheme.  Many people have been disadvantaged as a result of the cancellation without notice of that <Col N="2442" /> scheme.  These people had legitimately applied under the scheme but the Minister failed to send out the inspectors in time so that they could get approval.  It was a good scheme and I hope the Minister will look again at his silly decision to curtail it on 7 May.</P>
      <P>The Minister neglected the question of old people's dwellings.  Nobody in Tipperary South will get a new local authority house this year except in very exceptional circumstances, or if somebody dies.  The Minister should be able to do better.  We have come a long way from building 7,000 houses when Labour, in Coalition, tried to address what was then in crisis, to building about 1,200 houses this year.  In the whole of the county of south Tipperary this year, a miserable number of 26 houses were built and there are 300 people designated as being in need.  Is that addressing the problem? What about family houses?  What about sheltered housing for old people? What about the people who will surrender their isolated houses, give them up freely, for the privilege of living in a town or village where they can have access to protection from the Garda Síochána, to health services, to churches or whatever?  What is the Minister going to do for them?  They cannot even be given the tenancy of a house on surrendering their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has neglected the whole area of mortgage repayments in the last year and this will be a disincentive if any future purchase scheme is offered by the Minister.  It was a good scheme and we advocated that people would use it, but since they entered the scheme the cost of mortgages has escalated four times in the last 12 months under Deputy Flynn's glorious ministry of which he is so proud and which he has thrown across the floor tonight as if he were the first Minister for the Environment.  There is the marvellous refurbishment scheme on which we have congratulated the Minister, but what was the Minister addressing?  He was addressing a scheme initiated by one of his own Ministers in the seventies.  Now, of course, he is a PD Minister and it is only a temporary arrangement, so the <Col N="2443" /> Minister might not even want to take credit for what he did in low cost housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the loss of time but also about various aspects of this Bill.  I am concerned about the document, <i>Permanent Defence Force &mdash; Representative Groups</i>, sent out to Army personnel containing a letter from the Chief of Staff which provides among other things, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The first and most important step <Col N="2445" /> will be the conduct of the elections. Once the elections are over, full consultation as the Tánaiste has said, will take place with the elected representatives on all aspects including the electoral process itself, the voting system, structures and procedures.</P>
    <P>I find that very strange.  After the election is over the consultation will take place. This Bill went astray and was not accepted by the people concerned because it did not provide for the consultation to take place in advance of rather than after the event.  On page 2 of the document it is provided on the system of election that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Officer representatives who form the command group will in turn elect one of their number to go forward to DF HQ level.  All these elections will be by secret ballot using the single non-transferable vote system.</P>
    <P>I query that.  Why not use the PR system, the recognised electoral system in Ireland which was twice maintained by the people in referenda when the Fianna Fáil Government tried to abolish it?  I cannot for the life of me see why the proposed system would have to be adopted when a number of people contest a position. The only fair way of coming to a result is by PR.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would the Minister not do that the same as anybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my opening speech that would be the subject matter of discussion for the returning officer. They are all only proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. It is good to know there is flexibility still in the matter.  Knowing the Minister, I know there will be flexibility before this Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (3) of the Bill provides that, and I quote: &ldquo;An association shall be independent of and shall not, without the <Col N="2446" /> consent of the Minister, be associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body.&rdquo;.  Again that is restrictive but apparently nothing can be done without the consent of the Minister.  That is what makes many aspects of this Bill questionable from the point of view of the people it is supposed to serve.</P>
    <P>The most surprising and serious aspect is section 6, particularly subsection (2) which provides that: &ldquo;A person who is not subject to military law who endeavours to persuade or conspire with any other person to endeavour to persuade a member to join a trade union or other body (other than an association) aforesaid shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to the penalties provided for a contravention of section 257 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.  That penalty is up to a maximum of six months in jail.  That seems very serious.  Does it mean it would be dangerous to associate with or speak to any member of the Defence Forces? It seems extraordinary and completely unnecessary and I hope it will be removed by some amendment before the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in the Minister and I hope he will be able to accept the many reasonable amendments which will be put down by the various Opposition parties on Committee Stage.  Perhaps we can reduce some of the harm by considered amendments to the Bill as presented to us.</P>
    <P>In Galway city we are privileged to have an Army barracks in my parish of Renmore, Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa Barracks, where we have a large number of Army pesonnel and here I pay tribute to them. They are great asset to our community. They are involved at every level, social, cultural and economic.  I hope the other Dáil representatives from Galway West will take note of the high feelings of the members of the Defence Forces in Galway and of their families in their opposition to this Bill in its present restrictive form.  I will be watching with interest their contributions, if any, to this debate.  Members of the Defence Forces in Galway will take more than a passing interest in the actions of their elected <Col N="2447" /> representatives and how they will vote on this Bill or how they will contribute to this debate.  This Bill concerns the future and wellbeing of a large section of our community within our constituency of Galway.  The people of Galway are watching this debate with interest, as I know from the activities particularly of the Army Wives Association over the weekend and the way they lobbied their Dáil representatives, outlining their feelings and beliefs about the inadequacies of this Bill.  I will watch with interest the actions &mdash; or inaction &mdash; of my fellow representatives from Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, which will allow for representative associations for members of the Defence Forces is major legislation. This is a historic day for the Defence Forces and I am delighted that the Minister for Defence has brought the Bill before the Dáil.  It is long overdue and I think we all agree that the members of the Defence Forces have had grievances, they have something to say, and they should have structures within and through which they can voice their opinions and improve their conditions, and that will have the knock-on effect of improving their morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, we have a Defence Force of which at all levels we should be proud.  At UN level our Army have served and are serving us with distinction and courage, playing their part admirably on the international stage in the Middle East and southern Africa. They bring with them to these divided regions the unique Irish characteristics of passivism and diplomacy, characteristics that are truly evident in the personality of the current Minister, Deputy Lenihan, who has over the years as Minister for Foreign Affairs and in his capacity in other Departments been a respected advocate of peace and reconciliation worldwide.  The reputation of the Irish members of UNTAG in Namibia is recognised internationally.  They have the ability to get on with both sides, to act as mediator, to build bridges.  Because of <Col N="2448" /> this nation's pivotal role internationally &mdash; after all we are neutral and are using this position positively abroad &mdash; our Defence Forces command unique respect.  We must give them the scope to develop and to respond to modern times. We must give them the facilities and equipment, and this enabling Bill is the first step in bringing about this process.</P>
    <P>Because of the Defence Forces' binding association with the security of the State it is clear that the structures being set up must not and will not impinge adversely on the command, control and discipline of the forces.  I believe the armed forces recognise this and the public who are protected by them would not want it any other way, so the associations will represent members in relation to pay, welfare and other matters to be prescribed by regulations.  Issues such as operations, command and discipline will not come within the remit of the associations. The Minister's approach is correct. He is initiating a general framework for a representative system.  The details of this new framework will be worked out in consultation with the elected representatives of the Defence Forces following democratic elections by secret ballot.  The Army have fallen behind in relation to some welfare and pay matters, medical benefit systems and family support schemes.  These are issues which must be addressed and they will be addressed as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The representative group will be entitled to speak to the media once they have their own representative association. The situation at present is most unsatisfactory.  It has been left to the wives of the Defence Forces personnel to put forward their grievances through the media.  They do a good job but I am sure they would prefer their husbands to speak directly for themselves.  The associations will have a clear right to talk to the media. They will not have to go through a military chain of command.  This is one of the many aspects of this debate which needs to be cleared up.  I hope as a result of this debate that many of the problems which have been put before us here and by the media will be cleared up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2449" /> A very important and necessary proposal is the establishment of a new system of conciliation and arbitration.  This in effect will be the same as the system in place for the gardaí.  Reference has been made to the PDFORRA which was set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and also to the spouses association who have been speaking for the Defence Forces.  It is clear that we must start afresh.  We must have free, fair, democratic elections in the interests of the Defence Forces. There must be elections for new associations. Members will decide on the structures and on the direction they will take. The irony is that if these new associations are allowed to develop they will protect the rights of members and give them the right to speak.  The alternative facing the Minister is to do nothing.  In that case the PDFORRA would remain a talking shop with no real function.  This situation is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced last July that this new system would be established. Since then much time and energy has been put into the type of framework envisaged and how it could proceed in a democratic manner.  Now we have a Bill and we know where we are going.  In many ways the new framework is like that of the Garda representative body.  If the gardaí representatives have a grievance they go to the commissioner; if this fails they avail of conciliation and arbitration machinery.  In the case of the Army, representatives will go the Chief of Staff and if necessary they can avail of the conciliation and arbitration mechanism. The system is backed up by law and the courts.  The Minister's approach is non-confrontational.  It has been suggested that in some way the Bill is a con, that there is a trick in it somewhere, that the Minister is trying to get these structures in place and then nothing will be done.  This could not be further from the truth.  I am convinced that it was introduced in a generous spirit of co-operation and the whole appoach is to tackle a fundamental and real grievance.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormark suggested that section 6 was targeting the Army spouses association.  I think the inference was that <Col N="2450" /> they would be silenced.  The Minister has already made it clear that this is not true. The section refers to people who try to persuade a member to join a trade union or other body other than the association. Such persons shall be guilty of an offence. It does not prevent these spouses from meeting or speaking out.  I hope there will no need for such a forum but if the spouses wish to meet or to speak there will be no problem and they can continue to do so.</P>
    <P>This is an historic occasion.  Two central measures were initiated last year by the Minister.  The first was the setting up of a representative association with legal standing and the second is an independent pay commission.  Nobody wants public controversy in relation to armed forces.  It is not good for the morale of the forces themselves or for the morale of the country.  If this controversy persisted it would impinge on the very core of the authority of the State.  The Constitution states that laws may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the right to form associations.  That is what we are about tonight.  There is a right and proper way to do this but there is no quick solution. This House has a specific constitutional responsibility regarding the armed forces and careful consideration is called for.  The Minister has responded properly with care, conscious of the need to initiate some fresh thinking that will have the end result of improving the lot of privates, non-commissioned officers and officers.  If members feel the need for change or for some sort of amalgamation, the arrangements can be reviewed.  That is part of the success of the Bill.  There is great scope for flexibility.  It is enabling legislation.  The details are left for incorporation in regulations which are more flexible.  This is appropriate since we are dealing with matters which are evolving. The Minister has asked for consultation as part of this process.  No doubt there will be change as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred earlier to EUROMIL, which is the European umbrella organisation of military associations. Deputy McCartan supported an <Col N="2451" /> association with EUROMIL.  I must state my serious concern at the possibility of such an association.  I firmly hold and believe that our military neutrality must be zealously guarded and I would strongly oppose any suggestion of affiliation with or membership of a European group of military associations.  Deputy McCartan could find himself in deep water if he pursued this line of argument. He was always a strong promoter of the PDFORRA.  In some respects it is typical of his party's style.  They have the advantage, because of their size, of being able to be for everything because they will never have to be accountable in Government for making responsible decisions, unless they form an alliance with some larger party.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy McCartan when advocating the establishment of PDFORRA.  I can only describe such an approach by an elected Member of Dáil Éireann as reckless and irresponsible.  He should know, as one who participates in a parliamentary democracy, that we must act responsibly on this issue.  This House has a responsibility and a right under the Constitution to raise and maintain military or armed forces.  In effect, the organisation of the Defence Forces is a matter for Government. The Constitution recognises the unique position of the Defence Forces and the manner in which the State may provide by law for their organisation and control.  In trying to set up a new institutional arrangement we must be conscious of this special position and, at the same time, allow for the setting up of representative voices in relation to pay and other conditions of service.  As the <Col N="2452" /> Minister said earlier, it is a matter of getting the balance right.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party attitude to the issue is the same as their stance on other economic and social proposals from the Government.  They oppose it.  This response is an insult to the Defence Forces.  This is not just another issue, it is different and unique.  I have hoped that they would have waited for the Minister's proposal, allow this legislation to evolve and the democratic process to unfold. Careful consideration was required to provide for the setting up of these associations to give a voice to the members of the Defence Forces while not compromising the essential military systems of command and control.  The Minister got the right balance; he stated today that the process of consultation is the essence of the new arrangements and will continue as a integral part of them.</P>
      <P>I agree with the remark by Deputy McCartan that the loyalty and competence of the men in the Defence Forces are not in question.  All politicians accept this and they and the public appreciate it.  We all look forward to the conclusion of the Gleeson report on pay and conditions because we want to see the conditions and pay of our armed forces improved.  Deputy McCartan is a spokesman for the PDFORRA and he spoke today on their behalf.  He said he would wait for the outcome of the Minister's deliberations but I find it difficult to take that kind of thing when we are dealing with such a delicate and sensitive matter. The same Defence Forces' representatives appreciate that one should not be involved in a destructive manner in this debate and it is difficult to accept that a TD would approach such a debate with this attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is taking the first step towards establishing something important and a new structural framework will be put in place.  The representatives of the Defence Forces understand the special position they hold in relation to the State and it is appreciated by the public.  The representatives understand what the Minister has in mind for the <Col N="2453" /> future now that the Bill has been introduced. It is an historic breakthrough and it is time to join the Minister in making the system work because it is in their interests and those of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we are here discussing this Bill is an achievement in one sense because the right to do so was hard fought and contributed to by various people.  I must give all due credit to the Army spouses' association who initially took up the cudgels on behalf of the Army personnel because nobody was allowed, legally, to take up their case.  I will deal with that in a little more detail in a few moments.</P>
      <P>It was sad that we allowed the situation to deteriorate to such an extent that the Army wives had to protest outside this House before they got a hearing from Parliament and, more especially, from the Government.  The Minister was not then responsible for the Department but I am extremely critical of the Government for allowing a situation to develop over a long period of time &mdash; throughout 1988 and 1989 &mdash; when a lot could have been done to redress the obvious problem. The dogs in the streets were barking the problem that had arisen in the Defence Forces but the Government sat idly by and did nothing.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker said that those involved in PDFORRA should have waited.  However, they have waited long enough.  Many promises were made to them over the last six or eight months in particular and a glorious opportunity was missed by the Government, in the early stages of the year and especially at budget time, when it would have been easy to say that as an indication of their seriousness and intent they were awarding something on account.  They did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that we hold our Defence Forces in very high regard and that they conduct themselves well with UNIFIL and so on, but what good is that if we do not respond quickly to solve their problems?  This has been going on for several years but in the last 18 <Col N="2454" /> months there have been repeated representations and statements made on both sides and, far from reconciliation, the two sides were at daggers drawn. The Minister and the Government had a serious responsibility to try to ensure that the matter was resolved long before we got to the stage where the Minister had to bring a Bill to the House to set up some kind of framework to deal with the problem.  He is not too sure about it, he has circulated a document, <i>Permanent Defence Force &mdash; Representative Groups</i>, which purports to say a great deal but which in reality says nothing.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the origins of the problem.  In the beginning I felt that there was a serious problem which should have been addressed in relation to pay, working conditions, housing and many other issues which do not impinge on the day to day discipline within the Army.  They were not dealt with and I felt &mdash; I still feel &mdash; that if they had been responded to at that time the problems would not have magnified.  The ideal structure would have been something which was representative of officers, other ranks and NCOs.  Perhaps a chairman could have been provided by the Minister who would not have had a veto.  The whole question could have been dealt with in that way and the body &mdash; a statutory one &mdash; made up of representatives of the groups I mentioned could have adjudicated on the various issues raised.  They could also, in the case of disagreement, refer their problems to an independent arbitrator.  I admit that I do not know which would be the best kind of structure in that case.</P>
    <P>At present we have got almost what PDFORRA were looking for but with a number of fundamental differences.  The only reason this Bill has been introduced is to slow down the momentum which started because of the Government's failure to respond to the legitimate representations and requests of the Army personnel.  That applies to officers, NCOs and enlisted men.</P>
    <P>The biggest single military establishment in the country is housed in the Curragh in my constituency.  From 20 <Col N="2455" /> January last there has been no communication between the bodies investigating at senior staff level and the officers there.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said in the last couple of hours about consultation and communication. A great deal can be achieved if consultation is entered into at the initial stages.  However, a great deal of harm can be done if that process is ignored.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is the only person responsible, the Government are also responsible. They should get off their high horse and recognise that a problem exists.  They should enter into some sort of negotiation with, for example, PDFORRA.  They are not a statutory body so the Government can talk to them. It has been suggested that an individual who has a legitimate submission &mdash; assuming of course that it was possible to do so in the current climate &mdash; might be put on report.  That is not constructive, advisable or helpful in any way at present.</P>
    <P>What in Heaven's name are the Army personnel to do?  Individuals step out of line or make representations to any quarter whatsoever, they can proceed through the normal command structure, which has always been the case, and that is all right up to a point for certain issues but the problem is that the issues that have caused the serious problems in the last 18 months or so were not of that type; they were basic, fundamental, almost human rights issues which were ignored by the Department.  If the Minister wants to accept responsibility for that, so be it. Somebody somewhere must accept responsibility for the problems that have arisen mainly because of the deafening silence in the face of the legitimate submissions that have been made.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the conciliation and arbitration proposal the Minister has made in this document.  I see nothing wrong with it.  I am sure PDFORRA or the officers' representatives, when and if they are allowed to set up a structure, will see nothing wrong with it either.  The problem I see is that it leaves a great deal <Col N="2456" /> of speculation.  It refers to what happens in the rest of the public service and the confines within which the conciliation and arbitration system could work but it does not tell us exactly what happens in the case of an impasse developing and the matter being referred to an arbitrator. Who appoints the arbitrator?  Where does the arbitrator come from?  Does this commission consist of just one person?  If so, I presume such a person is deemed to hold the fountainhead of all knowledge. That would be a very difficult position to be in.  It would be preferable to have a body that would be representative of the men, officers and NCOs and if they failed to achieve some degree of common ground there could be further reference to an independent arbitrator.</P>
    <P>I fully accept, as I am sure everybody in this House accepts that the Army have a very difficult and responsible role to play.  I do not accept for one moment that every minor detail or problem, disciplinary or otherwise, should have to be referred to any quarter other than through the normal channels.  In the type of situation that is now developing we in this House and especially the Government, have a responsibility to recognise that the problem has arisen simply because of a slow response.  It is fine to suggest that this could be a dangerous type of association, that it is not exactly what we have in mind, that we have to make certain changes or that certain procedures will have to be followed in relation to elections and so on.  I do not think the people involved have any objection to that.  They accept that elections will be democratic elections and that, having been elected, those people will then be given the responsibility of making their case but there is one thing missing in all of this.  Surely the Government, the Minister or the officials in the Department, should have talked directly to the people concerned.  I know somebody will say this has been done and perhaps it has up to a point but generally speaking in any command you will find again and again the same response; that there has been little or no consultation.  If the Minister is serious about setting up a structure <Col N="2457" /> to resolve the problems that have bedevilled the Defence Forces for the last few years, consultation should have been the first chapter in anything he intended to do but I am sorry that does not appear to be the case.</P>
    <P>It was in response to questions from a number of people in this House that the Minister indicated his intention to set up three bodies.  I accept there may be difficulties in having one body and I think the Minister's proposals to set up three representative groups would not receive too much opposition, even from within the Defence Forces.  The only problem I would see relates to the old adage of divide and conquer.  If you divide often enough you weaken the thrust of the representation that is going to be made. Again, this is something that is not desirable and certainly is not necessary.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have always shown themselves to be highly responsible and they and their families have made great sacrifices.  If anybody wants to visit some of our barracks they will recognise fully the extent to which families have made sacrifices and one can then recognise the degree of annoyance and utter frustration with which the Defence Forces have responded to the Government's lethargy over the past 18 months to two years.  I do not want to dwell too long on that aspect of the matter but I want to state that the housing conditions in which many families and single people in the Defence Forces have lived over the years are not exactly what one would expect of a civilised society in the 20th century, especially a society that purports to give great recognition to the work of the Defence Forces, including their work abroad.  Small issues like basic housing accommodation should come high on the priority list when dealing with the issues that have been raised.</P>
    <P>I know considerable discussion has taken place within every command in the country and the Curragh is no exception. Discussions have taken place there at officer level with a view to determining what kind of structure they would like to have representing them.  Essentially the structure they are thinking about is more <Col N="2458" /> or less the same as that put forward by PDFORRA, with one or two differences. Again the one thing that comes up is that there seems to be little co-operation, assistance or consultation with the Minister or the Department, the powers that be.  The people concerned are a very responsible group of people who do not wish to offend anybody but at the same time they wish to ensure that their rights are recognised.  They have legitimate rights just the same as every other branch of society and they have every right to have their case heard.  It would be only a small thing for the Minister to send somebody along to have discussions with them on a fairly regular basis.  The situation should not arise again whereby there have been no discussions since 20 January while somebody decided the framework of a Bill. With no disrespect to the draftsman or anybody else, it could scarcely have taken from 20 January until now to produce a Bill of that size.  The time in the interim would have been extremely well spent having regular, on-going discussions with the people concerned in order to ensure that when this document, <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups</i>, was produced there would be sufficient provision in it to meet the requirements of the times.</P>
    <P>We are not expecting too much at this stage.  I, too, support the amendment put down by my colleague, Deputy Ted Nealon, who is our spokesman on Defence.  I hope the Government will consider, even at this late stage, accepting that amendment in order to give us an opportunity to discuss the document in question.  Considerable progress might be made in evening out some of the corners and taking some of the difficult or more obstructive edges out of the document if we had an opportunity of discussing the matter at some length in the House but we do not have that facility. This document was only issued in the last few days but I happened to see an unofficial copy of it earlier &mdash; an unofficial copy for the simple reason that we all know what could possibly happen to members of the forces who make representations to public representatives, <Col N="2459" /> which again is a matter for further discussion during the course of this Bill.  All Members of this House should have had the same access to this document in the initial stages as the members of the Defence Forces to whom it directly relates.  I do not want to delay the House as I realise time is running out, but I would point out that the representative groups in the structure proposed by the Minister are not too far from what PDFORRA have talked about.</P>
    <P>There are a number of difficulties, and one is a lack of trust.  The Defence Forces would have more confidence in the Government if they had responded to them at an earlier stage.  The Minister and the Government should have said they recognised the difficulty the Defence Forces have with pay and working conditions. After all, the Minister for Finance started out on budget day with a surplus but in the evening ended with a deficit.</P>
    <P>I am sure it would not have been impossible to deal with this problem and recognise the issue that drove the Army spouses to seek election at the polls of June last year.  Surely somebody recognised the necessity to respond at an earlier stage and that the people concerned were genuine and had no axe to grind, other than to obtain a reasonable standard of living for their households.  I believe the Government could have done something constructive at that time by simply saying, or having the Minister for Defence say on budget day, that he proposed to respond to them in a positive fashion.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of distrust on the Army side in the sense that they do not trust the Government to do what they have set out in the Bill before the House tonight.  They have their doubts, and quite frankly, I have doubts too because far too much time has been allowed to drag by.  The situation has been allowed to ferment for far too long.  The few bob involved will not make or break anybody and could have done a great deal to resolve the problem in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2460" /> Great responsibility rests on the Government collectively.  There is no use in anyone trying to skive off and let the responsibility rest on one individual, because the Government, collectively, must accept responsibility.  The Cabinet sit around the Cabinet table and they have their responsibilities.  The members of the parliamentary parties which make up the Government have a responsibility and they should have known about the problem that has existed since last June when the arrangement, which some people referred to as temporary, was entered into.  Surely somebody should have recognised that a response from Government would have been well received and that that would have generated trust and confidence that has been lacking.  Until such time as the Government come up with a positive responsible approach to these problems, there will be that distrust.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think it would be better to accept the Fine Gael amendment than to rush ahead and superimpose these structures without going into the finer detail.  The Minister should have gone in a different direction.  He should have started at the top and told us in fine detail the structures he had in mind.  He could have laid the groundwork so that every member of the Defence Forces, whether an enlisted man or woman, officer or non-commissioned officer, would know before the elections took place that they could make representations to a particular body or bodies and they had to go about drawing up their representative bodies.  That would have been the responsible way to go about it.</P>
    <P>At present PDFORRA has been virtually set up and the officers' representative body has been almost set up unofficially with nobody knowing whether their body will be official or unofficial after this.  If the Government had responded more quickly at the beginning we would not have this situation. I call on the Minister and the Government to give serious and careful consideration to the amendment tabled in the name of Deputy Nealon to the effect that: <Col N="2461" /> Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading until such time as the document entitled <i>Permanent Defence Force &mdash; Representative Groups</i> has been published generally and has been considered and debated by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government may yet respond positively to that and even at this late stage establish a confidence between the Government and the Defence Forces which does not exist at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from the Border town of Dundalk and in the past 20 years I have had first hand experience and a grandstand seat of the role the Defence Forces, both the Garda Síochána and the Army, play in safeguarding our country from the threat of subversive forces which has hung over this country like a pall for the past 20 years.  Over the past two decades I have observed the Irish Army out at all hours of the night performing duties necessary to ensure that our country is safe from the IRA and the UDA.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it has taken until 1990 for the Army to be given a hearing. Almost 70 years after the founding of the State the fact that the Defence Forces have not had a representative body is surprising and very regrettable.  It is also particularly regrettable that the Fianna Fáil Government, and possibly my own party when in Government three years ago, did not recognise that need.  It is very easy to recognise it now in Opposition but the fact is the Defence Forces have been denied a basic right to air legitimate grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is progressive that the Government, however belatedly, have recognised the right of the Defence Forces as some time ago the Garda Síochána were given the right to have representative bodies. However, confrontation by the Fianna Fáil Government with the various Defence Forces, be it the Garda Síochána or the Army, is nothing new and I believe the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Justice suspended several leading <Col N="2462" /> members of the Garda Síochána, including, I believe, Jack Marrinan who recently stood for office as a Fianna Fáil candidate.  However they won their battle.  It is only just that the Government should have decided, no matter how belatedly, to recognise that there is a need to introduce representative bodies in the Army.</P>

      <P>In his contribution Deputy Durkan referred to various matters which give rise to grievances.  He stated that housing conditions are not as they should be in different barracks around the country.  I have to say that this is not so in the town of Dundalk where a magnificent barracks was built which would serve as a monument to the efforts made by my illustrious predecessor, the former Deputy Paddy Donnegan, who gave the go ahead for a building which could not be surpassed for comfort.  That is as it should be.  I would like to see the same standard achieved in other barracks.  I am confident that will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that Army wives had to take to the streets to air the grievances of soldiers, many of whom are paid very low salaries and who can only make ends meet by working long hours of overtime, illustrates the real grievance being felt by many Army personnel at the rank of private and corporal.  Some of these soldiers have to put in between 90 and 100 hours a week before they can earn a reasonable salary.  Surely, and I am no <Col N="2463" /> admirer of trade unions, something needs to be done about this.  I do not believe in street politics but if the National Army Spouses Association had not taken the initiative nor had the courage to take to the streets in peaceful protest the Government would not have recognised the need which everybody else in the country has recognised but then when the Government did not recognise that there was a crisis in the health service it is hardly surprising that they failed to recognise the unease being felt within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The National Army Spouses Association have been spectacularly successful by means of their peaceful protests and they have brought the Government, screaming, up to the mark.  Deputy Durkan hinted that the commitment of the Government is not all it should be and I am sure that Deputy Power, coming as he does from a county where there are so many Army personnel, will be well aware of the unease being felt within Army circles.  I do not want to have a dog in the manger attitude but it is a fact that the Government, no matter how belatedly, have recognised this need.</P>
    <P>In relation to joint Garda and Army patrols which I have observed on many occasions along the Border, it is wrong that Garda personnel are paid handsome sums for overtime while the hapless unfortunate soldiers have to work for virtually nothing, although in recent times they have been given a significant Border duty allowance.  Many of these soldiers are young, married and buying homes and they would not be able to pay for their mortgages except for the fact that this Border duty allowance was introduced. Before they can get a reasonable salary they have to work a bizarre and unacceptable number of hours, between 90 and 100 hours a week which is totally unacceptable in the modern world.</P>
    <P>I make a reasonable request that the Government accept Deputy Nealon's amendment which proposes that the House should decline to give the Bill a Second Reading until such time as the representative groups in the Army have <Col N="2464" /> had the time to absorb what is contained in the Bill and to consider it fully.  This is a reasonable request which I think should be granted by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I listened to Deputy Kitt speak about coalition which is a theme I would like to take up for a few moments as I wish to talk about the present position of the coalition in relation to representation in the Defence Forces.  It is remarkable that in the Programme for Government drawn up by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats there is no mention of the Defence Forces despite the fact that the question of pay and conditions in the Defence Forces was an issue long before the general election as it was during the campaign itself.  The omission is also remarkable given the fact that the Minister for Energy, who is a former Minister for Defence and who had much to say about the Defence Forces prior to the general election, apparently was one of the negotiators of the document.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt also had some things to say about democracy.  One of the fundamental tenets of democracy is the right of people to organise.  There is a constitutional right which guarantees freedom of association and the right to organise.  Section 2 of the Bill as presented provides for the establishment of representative associations but it seems to be concerned as much about suppressing the associations which have arisen voluntarily within the Defence Forces as it is about the establishment of new associations.  This appears to be a negation of the democratic principle of freedom of association and the right to organise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much talk at present about the implications for discipline and operations in allowing organisations and representative bodies within the Defence Forces. When the record of this debate is read 20 or 30 years from now, when the principle of representation in the Defence Forces is long established and when people will be looking back at 20 to 30 years of representation within the Defence Forces, they will be somewhat bemused by the <Col N="2465" /> extent to which Members of this House were concerned about what the establishment of representative bodies might lead to within the Defence Forces.  It is not all that long ago that the same arguments were put forward about nurses, and people asked what the implications would be for the hospital service if nurses were allowed to join unions or form their own associations.  There is a long record of that and I have no doubt that in years to come there will be a long record of representation within the Defence Forces without that causing anarchy or a breakdown of discipline.</P>
    <P>It has been said repeatedly in the House that we are fortunate that the Defence Forces are committed to the force and, indeed, are committed to the democracy which guides those forces in the first place.  That is very valuable and it must be defended.  It is regrettable that the pay and conditions of the members of the Defence Forces were allowed to deterioriate to such an extent that there was concern about the establishment of the Army wives association to raise the issue, and the establishment within the Defence Forces of PDFORRA.  The level of concern and activity arose because of deterioration in regard to pay and conditions. I do not believe that that should have been allowed.  The fact that there was not a representative body within the Defence Forces, or a forum through which members of the Defence Forces could express their grievances on these matters, was exploited through neglect and allowed to degenerate.  The members of the Defence Forces are concerned that where they work side by side with the Garda on security duties they must do so under conditions that are considerably worse than those enjoyed by the Garda. It is clear that that gives rise to bad morale among the members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I should like to express concern about a number of aspects of the Bill.  Members of the Defence Forces should have the right to organise themselves.  There is always a danger in prescribing the type of organisation to which people may belong. There is a danger in section 3 which, <Col N="2466" /> effectively, is aimed at outlawing PDFORRA.  Members of the Defence Forces who have joined PDFORRA may have done so out of frustration at the lack of progress on their grievances.  It is very dangerous to challenge the method by which many members of the Defence Forces chose to organise themselves.  The Bill is seeking to do so by effectively repressing that organisation and putting a new body in its place.  That is a bad principle.  The question of representation could have been better tackled had the Bill laid down procedures for elections and the conduct of business within an organisation that was voluntarily established by members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 4 which states that an association shall not represent or have as a member of any governing or other body or committee of the association a member who is on active service.  That provision is wide open to abuse.  Is it not possible through that section for an active member of the association for one reason or another to suddenly find himself put on active service? There are many examples of members of trade unions or staff associations finding themselves in that position. For one reason or another after they had become active a person in authority decided that the easiest way to deal with him or her, particularly if they were active and articulate, was to put them on active service.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for the appointment of a full-time secretariat for the new bodies.  One of the strengths of the Garda Representative Association has been the fact that they have had their own general secretary and secretariat.  Those officials are not in active Garda service and have, therefore, been able to represent their members without fear of any comeback through the normal system of authority and discipline within the organisation.  I hope the Minister will correct that weakness in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the association shall not, without the consent of the Minister, be associated with or affiliated to any <Col N="2467" /> trade union or any other body and I consider that to be a repressive measure.  I can understand the fear that has motivated it but it is a fear that is not well founded.  I have no doubt that in the course of time the Minister will find that that is not the case.  I am concerned that the Bill, far from providing a satisfactory method for representation within the Defence Forces will give rise to more unrest than it was intended to resolve.  It would be a better approach to accept that members of the Defence Forces are voluntarily organising themselves into a representative body.  Certain measures and regulations could be set down as to the method to be adopted but it is a dangerous principle and a dangerous approach to attempt to set about the suppression of organisations which have been voluntarily established within the Defence Forces and to put in their place bodies which may not have the confidence or the active participation of the members of the Defence Forces.  Those bodies will be established in a way which will severely restrict them and they could give rise to a lot of frustration and difficulties within the Defence Forces.  Far from resolving the problem this may exacerbate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I should like, like other Members, to pay tribute to the Army.  Like many of the institutions of the State, the Army grew out of the War of Independence and, subsequently, out of the Civil War.  It was a major constitutional achievement for an Army that took a particular side in the Civil War to be able to develop as the Army of an independent State between 1922 and 1932.  It is possible that the Army's finest hour was when they could accommodate a change of Government in 1932 when the political representatives of the opposing side in the Civil War got into Government.  The loyalty of the Army was sufficient to accommodate that change in a manner which was unique in emerging nations, particularly in the type of emergence from colonialism that we <Col N="2468" /> have seen across the world in the last 50 years.</P>
      <P>That type of tradition was laid down by Michael Collins in his time.  On the occasion of the death of Michael Collins the House will recall the tribute, in the first instance, of Risteárd Mulcahy and his appeal to the forces that no act would sully the proud name of the Army.  There is a long tradition and one of which we can be proud.  The Army has served the people of this country and every Administration without fear, favour, rank, or prejudice and has done so in an outstanding manner.  Their role has changed over the years, as the role of any Army will change.  Certainly they played a crucial role in the life of this country.  It is remembered with great fondness by many older people that during the Second World War when units of the Army were billetted in all parts of the country and civilians from all walks of life joined in what we euphemistically called the &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; friendships were established between the new entrants to the Army and members of the regular Army who were transferred subsequently in civilian life, and formed the basis for many endeavours throughout the fifties and the sixties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army of the small emerging nation became an international force subsequently when we were honoured by being accepted as members of the United Nations and when our forces were deployed overseas in a peacekeeping role.  I can still remember the march through O'Connell Street when the Irish Army sent the first units to the Congo.  I can also remember the great mixture of pride and sorrow that greeted the returning cortege from the Congo when our small nation, which had stood aside from the events of 1939 and 1948 and which had no record of coffins coming home, was suddenly faced with the tragedy of young Irishmen playing their part in keeping the peace in an emerging nation being brought back to Dublin and corteges moving through the streets of Dublin.  Many of us in this House can recall that event.  Since then they have fulfilled the peacekeeping role in many <Col N="2469" /> parts of the world, in Cyprus, in various observer status missions in the Middle East and at present in the Lebanon always with pride, making us feel proud of them and more than anything else being distinguished by the very good relationships they establish and maintain with the civil populations in those countries. We have example after example in areas of conflict where we got the word back home that the Irish were the most popular peacekeepers.  They seem to understand the problems of ordinary people.  That is true because we have shared the kind of experiences of emerging nations, except that we shared them in an earlier generation.</P>
    <P>In later times the army became the last arm of government, the last defence, the last provider of essential services.  I saw members of the Army driving oil lorries to provide oil and petrol when it could not be done any other way.  I saw the Army providing an alternative transport service in Dublin when the buses were on strike.  I saw the Army emptying refuse when it became a health hazard in the streets.  I saw the Army, during my time as Minister for Justice, providing the housekeeping in the prisons when the Garda Síochána carried out the duties of the prison officers.  Sometimes the work they had to do was unpleasant and sometimes it was a potential for conflict between legitimate trade union movements as they carried out work which was not done by people who were legitimately on strike.  Something we can all be proud of is that despite all the potential for conflict there was never real conflict between the trade union movement and the members of the Army who went in to do the jobs of striking workers.  That says something about the Army as well.</P>
    <P>We have an Army of which we should be proud that has served all Administrations very well and ultimately has served the Irish people and I have no doubt they will continue to do so in the future.  That is why many of us were depressed by the massive decline in morale over the last three years or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): It is not that the problems in the Army began three years ago, there have been problems in the Army for quite some time.  I think that the problems of the Army arose from the fact that the population at large and probably Depities from all sides of this House came to take for granted the service they provided and we did not look to the day to day concerns of the Army.  There is no doubt that whatever the failings of past Administrations, the performance of the two year Fianna Fáil Government in respect of the Army was absolutely abysmal.  I do not want to say any harsh things but I think we all know, especially those of us who have barracks in our constituencies, that Army morale reached an all time low between 1987 and 1989.  I do not blame the unfortunate Minister for Defence for that.  Sometimes I took the blame for him because there was confusion between our two names.  I blame the Taoiseach because he should have been aware of what was happening. During the 1989 budget I remember standing where Deputy Nealon is now sitting and describing in detail why the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance should have moved in the budget to solve the immediate pay problems concerning the Army.  By the summer of the same year Army wives were on the streets, Army wives were lobbying Deputies, Army wives were picketing Leinster House, Army wives were standing for election, Army wives were doing what their menfolk were forbidden to do, they were seeking to represent in an organised way and to bring to the attention of the Department of Defence and members of the Administration, the problems that existed within the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not have been too surprised here in Leinster House that it was done through the wives because there had been a long tradition that if an individual soldier had a problem he was forbidden to visit his TD.  How many of us have had the experience of the private's wife or the corporal's wife calling to our clinics or houses and telling us, &ldquo;He cannot come himself because he would not break or bend the regulations&rdquo; but that she was <Col N="2471" /> coming to speak for him, because what was happening was not fair and could not be allowed to continue?  When that individual form of representation was magnified with Army wives providing the main focus for protest against conditions which their husbands found intolerable, then it was inevitable that the type of legislation which is being proposed by the Minister here tonight would come before the House.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that it was a decline in morale in the Army, that it was a response to circumstances that had become almost intolerable, which eventually forced the Government to give the right of representation to the Army and to various ranks in the Army.  With the proud record of our Army would it not have been better if, when morale was high and there had not been anguish, tension or protest in the Army, a Minister for Defence had magnanimously come into this House and said: &ldquo;We must move with the times; we must do what the majority of our partners in the European Community have already done and freely, openly and generously allow the right of representation to people in the Defence Forces&rdquo;.  But this has been dragged out of the Government.  I hope that the damage which was done to the Army over the last two-and-a-half years can be remedied by this belated action in the House.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that, having become aware of the problem, if not 12 months ago, at least in the course of the general election, the incoming administration would have taken the opportunity to have the widest possible consultation, that this would have been the top of their priority list and that they would have firm proposals to bring before this House.  Instead, we have the spectacle of the Minister coming in here tonight with an extraordinary proposal, a Bill to enable some sort of representative groups to be set up.  When the Bill was circulated we had no idea as to what the Minister had in mind.  Latterly we discovered that a document had been distributed in the Army, copies of which were available in the House yet we have <Col N="2472" /> no facility to debate this document and we are not sure of its status and about how firm the proposals are.  The Minister is asking us to buy a pig in a poke by passing a Bill which is merely a series of enabling sections to allow him to set up representative organisations.  We in this House who should have the final say in these matters will have no say at all, because the statutory regulations which will detail the provisions of the representative bodies will not require anything but the silence of this House.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a normal section which says that in the absence of a veto in this House, after 21 days the regulations will become law.  That is not the way to treat this House or the Army.  I understand from the media and from members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the Minister for Defence has aspirations to becoming the commander-in-chief of the Army.  If that is his intention, he owed it to the Army to come in here tonight with firm proposals and he owed it to this House to outline the proposals in detail.  If the Minister had not finalised his consultations and discussions with members of the Defence Forces of all ranks, he should have said so, and come in with a proposal to allow us to discuss on Committee Stage or, subsequently by affirmative motion in the House, the proposed regulations under which the representative bodies will be set up.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that when challenged by Deputy Nealon tonight the Minister could say there was no problem with the voting system and that we could have PR now and a single transferrable vote even though this document says something different.  When challenged by Deputy Nealon the Minister also said that the meetings need not take place inside Army barracks even though that is what this document says.  As Deputy Gilmore said no secretariat is provided, yet the Minister when challenged by Deputy Nealon said that there was no problem in giving a secretariat.  However, that is not in this document.  The draft regulations say in relation to eligible candidates that members of the Defence Forces will have to have &ldquo;good conduct&rdquo; on their records <Col N="2473" /> before they can represent their fellows. Again, when challenged by Deputy Nealon tonight, the Minister said we did not need this &ldquo;good conduct&rdquo; thing and that he appreciated the Deputy's concern that somebody whose superior officers might regard him as undesirable, might have this &ldquo;good conduct&rdquo; status removed for reasons other than that he deserved it and yet the Minister can say that there is no problem, that we do not need the &ldquo;good conduct&rdquo; regulation any more.</P>
    <P>It is not in the regulations, but it has been sounded abroad that the Army Wives Association will be suppressed when this goes through.  When Deputy Nealon challenged this, the Minister said that the organisation can continue.  I am not saying that the Minister is wrong in what he has conceded.  I thank the Minister for his concession, but is that any way to legislate for representative bodies to represent all the ranks in the Army, an Army of which we are so proud?  Is that not to add insult to injury after neglecting the Army in a most outrageous fashion for the last two and a half years? Are the same people to come here and in a slip shod fashion put through enabling legislation to enable the Government to do we know not what?  It certainly transpires now that the document accompanying the Bill is not a firm proposal at all.</P>
    <P>We have to move with the times.  The Army must be represented.  I welcome the statement in the Minister's speech that he envisages that this will involve a system of conciliation and arbitration. That is normal practice.  It is also a good idea that full trade union status is not being granted.  There are certain obligations on the security forces of the State and there are certain restrictions on the way in which they can organise.  The High Court in Aughey <i>v</i>.  Ireland on 29 August 1985 held that:</P>
    <P>the right of association in Article 40.6.1 (iii)  of the Constitution is subject to public order and because of their close connection with the security of the <Col N="2474" /> State, Gardai may have to accept limitations on their right to form associations and unions which other citizens would not have to accept.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are well aware of that restriction.  As Minister for Justice I have dealt on the employer side of the table with representatives of the Garda, The Garda Representative Association and the Association of Sergeants and Inspectors and with an association representing the superintendents and chiefs.  I found admirable the way they conducted their business.  When the Garda Representative Body was formed the administration of the day was dragged kicking and screaming into the 20th century to allow that representation.  I remember a time in Dublin when all the young gardaí took sick leave on the same day and threatened to take it on another famous occasion when an important visitor was visiting Dublin.  I remember the meetings in Parnell Square when people like Jack Marrinan were suspended from the force because they took part in representative associations.  Yet, those associations were admirable.  Their executives and chief executives were admirable and they always had the interests of the State at heart in their negotiations.  They never exceeded what one would think proper for a security force.</P>
    <P>The Army will also treat the new freedom of association which will be granted to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the same way as they have carried out their roles since the foundation of the State.  I have absolute confidence in the Army. We have a right to be proud of the Army, but this is not the way to legislate.  We must have some clarity in the Minister's intentions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon's amendment is a reasoned one and it will be put at the end of the debate.  What we want, by whatever formula the Minister can devise, is an opportunity to discuss and ratify the details of the regulations.  It is not sufficient for us to say &ldquo;yes, we understand that this is an enabling Bill; carry on; do <Col N="2475" /> whatever you like, sir.&rdquo;  That is not the way that provisions for associations to represent all ranks of officers in the Army should be dealt with, in this House.</P>
    <P>There are precedents for doing as we ask.  For example, the Minister could put down an affirmative resolution in place of Resolution No. 7 so that when the regulations are brought before this House they would need an affirmative order of the House.  The Minister could go further and give a commitment to make the arrangement I made when the Criminal Justice Bill was introduced.  People were extremely worried that some of the accompanying legislation which was being dealt with by way of regulation could not be debated.  I refer in particular to all the regulations which deal with the treatment of people in custody.  That whole corpus of legislation by way of regulation was discussed in this House by way of a committee-type debate.  It was not possible for the Opposition to put down amendments but it was possible for them to suggest amendments to the Minister which he could take on board and incorporate subsequently in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Some such formula will have to be found in regard to these regulations.  It is not sufficient to treat this House as a rubber stamp before the event.  It is bad enough to be treated as a rubber stamp which stamps regulations which have already been decided but it is not good enough to treat us as a rubber stamp in advance of decisions.  It is quite clear from the toing and froing between Deputy Nealon and the Minister that the Minister is very flexible on this issue. While his flexibility is admirable the fact that he has not made up his mind firmly about the most important sections of the regulations suggests that this Bill is prematurely before the House.  I ask the Minister of State to communicate this view very strongly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are all good at simple arithmetic. The Government can put their troops through the lobbies when the vote is called so that this side will lose and that side will win but that is not the way to <Col N="2476" /> legislate.  We must be afforded the opportunity of going through the ultimate set of regulations which will be the code by which the association will be set up, live and operate.  We need an opportunity to discuss the details of this code in this House.  If the procedures of the House are so restrictive as not to enable us to do so that we can have a full Committee Stage debate on the regulations then we should at least be afforded the opportunity to have that type of Committee Stage debate where the regulations can be taken <i>seriatim</i> and the views of all Members of the House on this most important matter can be taken on board by the Minister.  When an interval of time has passed subsequent to the Committee Stage type of debate on the regulations, the Minister can come back into the House and present an agreed set of regulations which can go through by either positive or negative resolution.  I am not too worried about what happens at that stage.</P>
    <P>This might be our last chance to do the right thing by the Army.  I am not alarmist &mdash; I have great confidence in the Army &mdash; but the Army have been badly treated and there is a sense of grievance among members which runs right down from the officers to the men.  I strongly advise the Government to proceed with prudence and caution so as to ensure they do not find themselves isolated from this House as a result of this legislation being regarded as legislation of the Government and the Minister for Defence but not the legislation of this House.  It would be very unwise for the Government to proceed in a manner which muzzles the views of the House, presents us with an enabling Bill and rams the regulations down our throats subsequently.  The Government will be taking a shot in the dark if they proceed in that way.  The Government may succeed and the Army may ultimately accept what they decide but they will be in a much stronger position if they have the support of all of us on this side of the House for the regulations.  No party owns the Army. The Army is not the property of any political party or group.  It is a national <Col N="2477" /> institution set up under the Constitution. The best way to put regulations such as these through the House is to try to get as much support as possible for them within the House.</P>
    <P>In blunt terms, the Bill before us tonight is nothing short of a refined form of parliamentary guillotine to force a form of association on the Army, the nature of which is unclear to the Members of this House who are being asked to endorse it.  I appeal to the Minister of State to communicate our views to the Minister and to give the House the opportunity &mdash; I do not mean this in any party political fashion &mdash; to discuss the regulations in detail and endorse them, otherwise he could be storing up a lot of trouble for himself in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has outlined the Labour Party attitude to this Bill.  Among the first of the arguments he put forward this afternoon was the Labour Party's serious reservations about the constitutionality of the Bill if passed into law, about the fact that the regulations proposed to be made are not being made available for prior debate and &mdash; perhaps this is the most important reservation from the point of view of the Defence Forces &mdash; that consultations have not taken place between the Minister and the interested parties to this legislation on the relevant matters.</P>
      <P>I want to refer at the outset to the clear constitutional flaw in the Bill.  During my time in this House and in the Seanad I have not seen draft legislation in so clear a violation of both the letter and spirit of the Constitution as this is.  Indeed it is not accidental that the Minister took up so much of his speech this afternoon in addressing this issue.  He spent a considerable amount of time addressing what he knew to be the weak constitutional basis upon which the Bill rests.  He said, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are fundamental constitutional and policy issues involved in this matter.  The constitutional right to form an association is not an absolute or unqualified right.  Article 40.6.1 <Col N="2478" /> provides that laws may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of the right &mdash; thus explicitly providing for the limitation of the right.  The courts have made the position very clear in a case involving the Garda Síochána; in Aughey <i>v</i>.  Ireland, it was held by the High Court on 29 August 1985 that&mdash;</P>
    <P>the right of association in Article 40.6.1 (iii) of the Constitution is subject to public order and because of their close connection with the security of the State, Gardaí may have to accept limitations on their right to form associations and unions which other citizens would not have to accept.</P>
    <P>Taking this issue as a starting point, the case law quoted is partial.  There are other cases which could be quoted in regard to the exercise of the right to, for example, join trade unions.  There are also the cases of the Educational Company <i>v.</i> Fitzpatrick and the case of Meskal <i>v.</i> CIE, both of which are relevant.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which arises, that is, one cannot say that the constitutional right to form an association is not an absolute or unqualified right and then ignore the terms of the High Court decision of 29 August 1985.  I want to draw attention to the text of the quotation by the Minister which used the phrases &ldquo;is subject to public order&rdquo; and &ldquo;the security of the State&rdquo;.  It would be incumbent on anybody seeking to curtail the rights of people who have been described as &ldquo;citizens in uniform&rdquo; to show how their purported activities or intentions in forming associations endangered public order.  In addition to that there is an interesting example of constitutional rights being trampled.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 of the Bill the Army are to be subjected to considerations of security and to public order to the extent that they have to sacrifice, in an unqualified and <i>a priori</i> way, their rights as citizens. In passing let me say that the Irish Government, when they signed the United Nations covenant on civil and political rights &mdash; article 19 refers &mdash; did <Col N="2479" /> not enter, as was clear at Question Time today in the answer given to the question that I put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, any reservation whatsoever in this regard.</P>
    <P>In addition to this question of curtailing the constitutional liberties of citizens in uniform, there is, with one leap, a move from section 6 (1) of the Bill to section 6 (2).  It is suggested that one can move from considerations of limitation in the case of Army personnel and then go on to limit the right of citizens to make statements which affect those covenants we have signed in relation to the right to both receive and transmit information.  It states, for example, in section 6 (2): &ldquo;A person who is not subject to military law who endeavours to persuade or conspires with any other person to endeavour to persuade a member to join a trade union or other body (other than an association) aforesaid shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to the penalties provided for a contravention of section 257 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, because I want to be constructive, to seriously consider the implications of section 6 of this legislation.  There is, in relation to the points that have been made by Opposition speakers, the need that the representative bodies that will emerge within the armed forces enjoy the confidence of those who are serving in the forces.  I might say that in a curious way there is a paradox in relation to the Minister's arguments as represented in his speech also when he says &ldquo;an important consideration in that connection is the fact that unlike the majority of other armies in western Europe the Permanent Defence Force is an entirely volunteer force&rdquo;.  One can argue that if it is an entirely volunteer force the one thing that people who have the courage and the commitment to their country to take up service in the Defence Forces are not doing if they are volunteering for service is volunteering to suspend their constitutional rights.  It is a very daft argument in my view to move from what I <Col N="2480" /> have just been discussing to this later comment of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to dwell a little more on the full implications of section 6 (2).  There are implications, unfortunately, in this section for those who are interested but not subject to military law.  There could in fact be knock-on effects for trade unions in general.  If I were a member of the executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I would certainly look very seriously at section 6 (2).  It makes it an offence to advocate, even as an opinion, even if it is unrealisable that the forces should unionise.  What this proscription refers to is something very interesting as well.  A person who felt that at the end of the day perhaps representation was not working internally might offer an opinion that something that was within the context of trade union law might be better.  The Minister may not agree with that opinion: I may not hold that opinion. What is clear from section 6 (2) however, is that it will be illegal to express such an opinion.  It would be illegal, for example, for the wife of a person serving in the Army to suggest some evening in the security of private company that her husband would be better off if he were a member of a trade union like many other workers.  That becomes an offence under section 6 (2).</P>
    <P>Because I am anxious to be as constructive as other members of the Labour Party are, I feel that it is in the interests not only of this issue that we are discussing in relation to the Defence Forces but of the Constitution, of the protection of rights, and of orderly and proper legislative functions, that the Members of this House should not create a situation in which they are limiting their own rights as public representatives outside of this House and limiting the rights of others. I have to make that point very strongly because when I first read a version of this Bill which was circulated on Friday I immediately saw section 6 as a provision that I believe cannot stand the test of constitutionality.  I also believe that if it is in violation, as I think it can clearly be shown, of the letter of the Constitution, it is certainly in violation of the spirit of <Col N="2481" /> the Constitution.  When one thinks of the purpose of that section of the Constitution which occurs at about article 46 and some of the succeeding subsections, what was involved in relation to that freedom was a right that might be qualified in times of emergency or in the interest of public safety or security; but to take public safety and security which may arise in particular times and in particular circumstances and to say that one should, for example, anticipate the normalcy of the future and bring these conditions to bear on it is an outrageous abuse of those sections of the Constitution as may make the mitigation of these rights proposable or defensible.  It is, quite frankly, an untenable argument to suggest that one should behave in this way.</P>
    <P>Let me go further and say what are the full implications of this because it is worth expressing it.  There is a serious issue of civil liberties involved.  It is that one is taking the constitutional rights of citizens, and the rights of citizens as elaborated in relation to the covenants that this country has signed.  I refer to one of the three recent covenants of the United Nations in the protocol in the civil and political rights document.  The Government, in accepting that article, issued no reservations, as far as I can understand it, to deal with this matter here &mdash; if I am wrong the Minister can correct me.  This would not last a few minutes with a constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>There is the other question with which I want to finish this very important point. If one were to say that constitutional rights may be, in certain circumstances, curtailed or limited, that they are not absolute in their application, one is saying something else, and that is that it is not up to the incumbent of the office of the day, or even this House itself, by way of enabling such Ministerial or legislative decrees as can permanently disable those rights that we enjoy in the Constitution. That is something which is, if one likes, putting one branch of our administration even the legislation of the Cabinet itself before the very thrust of the Constitution's assertion of rights of citizens. <Col N="2482" /> It is to make the Constitution itself subservient to both the whim and the temporary nature of orders.  I hope these comments are brought to the Minister for Defence because I am quite astonished that somebody who has himself practised in the courts would in fact be coming into this House with legislation so seriously flawed.  I am being deliberately temperate in my comments, I can assure the Minister, because one could very easily spell out further ramifications of this.  Let me conclude this point of my argument by saying that section 6 (2) is as outrageous a breach of the Constitution as I have read in my time in Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  Section 6 (1) is also, I believe, a breach of the constitutional rights of people who have enlisted in the forces.</P>
    <P>There are also two other flaws in relation to this Bill of a constitutional kind.  One arises in relation to the question of the right to organise itself, which is rather obvious.  There is another one in relation to the question of the curtailment to the right to information.  I have said enough about it.  I simply say that I am absolutely certain that it would be improper for people who respect individual liberties within the Constitution to vote for this legislation as it is placed before us.</P>
    <P>A second major issue arises in relation to the legislation, if one could set aside this constitutional defect which I believe to be so basic.  If I were in the Minister's position I would, quite frankly, withdraw that section.  There is a fundamental involved here in relation to the concept of what is voluntary.  There is a partial, very tendentious and confused use of voluntarism in the Minister's speech and in the Bill itself.  For example, any sensible interpretation of the concept of a voluntary association presumes that it can arise by a voluntary process from the members of any organisation or group; it can come from themselves.  As I said, if rights have been qualified earlier, this concept of voluntarism is also qualified because in the Minister's speech a voluntary action becomes the action of being free to opt out, which is a very negative and circumscribed right.  What is being <Col N="2483" /> said in addition is that having circumscribed your civil and political rights, you will now, therefore, belong as freely as you like to structures that have been devised for you.  There is an inescapable authoritarian interpretation to this.  Also it is impractical within the structures as suggested, without consultation, ignoring the voluntary generic evolution that has taken place already.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, the fact is that the Army Wives Association came into existence for very good reasons.  In addition PDFORRA exists.  Curiously, the Minister if he reads the constitution, objects and rules of the latter organisation will find it very difficult to suggest there is anything in those rules which threatens either security or public safety.  How then can he proscribe such an organisation in anticipation and ask us through legislative action in a Bill of this kind to lend ourselves to that?  The Opposition are quite correct to say that they are worried about &mdash; to mention one aspect of the Bill &mdash; the nature of the process of formation of this association to which it is suggested Army personnel should belong.</P>
    <P>Other issues arise which are important. I am afraid there is a partial, tendentious construction in the Minister's speech on the report of the Legal Affairs Committee in March 1988 at the Council of Europe.  The Minister dismissed the report blandly when he said, and I quote: &ldquo;A report in March 1988 by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe concluded that the number of members states of the Council of Europe which recognise the military right to form and join trade unions equals the number of member states which do not.&rdquo;  That is hardly and inspired comment.  It is exercise of very simple arithmetic.  That is not bad but what is very serious &mdash; of course, the Minister has no obligation to put forward an argument which does not suit his own purposes &mdash; is that that very report of the Legal Affairs Committee in March 1988 stated that there should be no legal impediment placed in the way of armed personnel joining a <Col N="2484" /> trade union.  It is in that very report which is quoted for other purposes.  That is an extraordinary use.  It provides us with ambiguities such as the Bible has on occasion provided, but the report simply establishes that there is not and should not be a legal impediment placed in the way of personnel of the armed forces joining a trade union.</P>
    <P>That report in March 1988 had been preceded, as other speakers including Deputy Ryan have suggested, by a very important resolution in the European Parliament of 12 April 1984.  That decision has been quoted by, among others, EUROMIL, the European organisation of military associations founded in September 1972.  They quote the resolution of 1984 being passed with some approval and they have gone on to look at the Irish case.  Simply to dismiss the European view as saying there are many trade unionists and there are many who are not in trade unions is not an accurate construction of the situation in Europe.  The European Parliament's view is as expressed in 1984, the Legal Affairs Committee's views is as expressed in 1988 and, as Deputy Ryan pointed out, there are people asking what extraordinary situation exists in Ireland that Ireland would want to be out of step with the spirit of the thinking and feeling and decisions of the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and those who are in charge of armies of very large size all over Europe.  You might say, a point not made by the Minister's speech, that trade unionised army personnel are serving in NATO where there are now greater security issues involved than in the case of Ireland which is not in NATO.  If I was a member of the Defence Forces I would reasonably argue, &ldquo;What makes my service to Ireland through the Defence Forces so different from service in other armies in Europe, that it makes it necessary for you to tell me I cannot have an association to represent me which has 8,000 members, and you must decide for me the form of representative body which I will then be asked to volunteer myself out of, or if I do not volunteer myself out of, I will be presumed to be within?&rdquo; It <Col N="2485" /> is an extraordinarily ungenerous approach.  I am not surprised at it because it reflects an authoritarianism in relation to this approach which has previously brought trouble to the Army and to Army personnel.  It is the last thing one needs in what the Minister calls a volunteer Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have paid tribute to the Army and I would like to pay my tribute. I am very familiar with the work of the Defence Forces.  Only a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of seeing them in action in Managua with UNOCA and I have known of their work abroad, but particularly there is the work they do every day in the barracks in Renmore and others. There is some point in this that is terribly important.  The inter-generational commitment to the Army is being abused.  I read a letter in yesterday's paper from a retired member of the Defence Forces, two of whose sons had joined, one had died and one was still alive, and he said he would like full democratic representation to be available to the Army.  There has been an inter-generational, familial commitment to service in our armed forces. We should not take that as a docility which would be required to take the form of the sacrifice of constitutional and internationally established rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going down a perilous road if he proceeds as he is doing.  The Labour Party are asking him simply to meet the association that exists, to cease placing restrictions on their right to operate and to negotiate with them the terms and procedures of such a representative bodies as will emerge.  There is much common ground.  For example, the Department, the Minister and PDFORRA are interested in such human situations and necessities as what people who have left the armed forces do by way of reintroducing themselves to civilian life, the questions of education, reintegration and so forth.  There is so much in common to be talked about.  The Labour Party amendment which suggests prior consultation on the whole question of regulations and so forth is reasonable, and the other Opposition Members who make the case for their discussion in the <Col N="2486" /> Dáil before elections take place are entirely reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be very wise to take back the Bill at this stage.  I recommend to him seriously to think again particularly about section 6.  I have said enough on it and I want to be as constructive as possible.  There will be no triumphalism here if he decides to withdraw the Bill at this stage to enable it to be redrafted or, better still, improved by way of amendment, but that will require something quite different from what obviously is the intent with which this legislation is introduced, that is to take all the Stages within a very short time and to have a curtailed discussion on Committee Stage.  This is one of those measures which, because of the issues that have been raised, cannot be rushed through or curtailed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Farrelly gave notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the present position regarding Zenith Corporation, Kells, County Meath and the saving of jobs there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise the question of the future of Zenith Electronics Limited and Groupe Bull Limited.  Since 1 November last when I raised this matter in the House the Minister informed me that part of the Zenith operation had been sold to Groupe Bull of France.  Under the proposed sale the Minister said it was intended that the product produced at Kells would be the subject of a separate agreement between Groupe Bull and Zenith under which Bull would purchase the produce produced at Kells for a minimum of 18 months from the date of the sale.  This has not happened and jobs are now seriously at risk.  Four months later <Col N="2487" /> 40 members of the staff have been told they are to be laid off and 18 of them have received their notice.  Thirty hourly workers, members of the union, have been informed that from mid-April they will have no employment there.  Thirty other members of the staff are also informed that they will suffer the same fate in mid-May.  That is the present position for people living with this problem on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>What happened to the promise made here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on 1 November that 18 months work would be available between the two organisations on the takeover by Groupe Bull of a certain amount of the work at the plant in Kells?  All of the raw material owned by Groupe Bull has either been exported or is in the process of being exported to other factories in Europe, probably France.  This is a far cry from what I was informed in November. Eighteen months work was to be available on the basis of the raw material which was in the plant at the time of the sale.  Why have the store manager and the production controller been told that they are being given their notice?  If this company were in earnest about development in the plant at Kells these people, with the experience they have, would not be the first to be told they are no longer required.  They are the best in their field.</P>
      <P>What are the consequences of the loss of all these jobs to the local economy? What will the real effect be on the local shopkeeper, the post office and the schools?  There is the possibility that people may not be able to make repayments on their mortgages.  It will be a very trying situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister urged people not to be unduly concerned because he hoped and expected that close monitoring of the matter by the IDA would avoid any undesirable results from the point of view of the company in Kells.  No one on this side of the House can be blamed for interfering.  I am extremely interested in ensuring that all the jobs are saved through the IDA and whatever other agency is working in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2488" /> There is consternation among the workforce and fear of the loss of their jobs.  I should like to think that the Minister and the IDA will be able to give me and the people of Kells some hope that these jobs can be secured in the long term.</P>
    <P>What did the close monitoring by the IDA turn out to be during the past four months?  Has the Minister a plan to deal with this grave problem?  I and the employees require action.  The &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; in the Minister's reply on the last occasion are no good to the people unless this excellent plant in Kells can be kept working.</P>
    <P>I would make a cry from the heart that certain decisions be taken and that negotiations take place immediately with management in the two companies involved.  It seems that the commitments have not been lived up to in connection with work for the people in the plant over an 18 month period.  It is very disappointing that I have to raise the same matter within four months.  It is so serious that the northern part of County Meath will be devastated if this plant has to close.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, addressed this House on the matter last November, the proposed takeover of the Zenith Corporation (US) by Groupe Bull of France which he alluded to at the time has taken place.  As the Kells plant was not included in the takeover deal, he was naturally concerned about the long term viability of the plant.  For this reason he asked the IDA to maintain the closest contact with all the parties concerned and to take every practical step to ensure the continued viability of the Kells operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the electronics industry is global in nature, highly competitive, cyclical and characterised by short product life-cycles. Against this background it is not unexpected that any electronics plant will go through a number of transitions, sometimes difficult, during its operational life. <Col N="2489" /> The Kells plant is no exception and has already done this effectively since its establishment in 1983.  It now finds itself again having to shift its product and marketing strategy to adjust to the realities of the market place.  I understand that the plant will phase out its PC production operation over the next few months and turn to power supply unit manufacture instead.  The Kells plant will serve as the European base for the manufacture and supply of this product.  I understand that this transition may involve a number of redundancies but I am optimistic that a significant portion of these will be temporary.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with Zenith management, the IDA are actively seeking to secure subcontract work for the Kells plant, thereby helping to underpin its long-term viability.  The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that particulars of the IDA's operations in so far as they relate to contacts with companies, etc., are a day to day matter of that body's business. They are not matters on which I can comment directly and, in any event, the confidentiality of those contacts is important for their success.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that during Minister O'Malley's recent visit to the US he spoke to the chief executive of the parent company and was encouraged by his positive response.  I am confident, therefore, that current efforts to find alternative work will result in work for the Kells plant.  It requires time for companies who may place work with Kells to examine the quality of the products.  I assure Deputy Farrelly that this is receiving special treatment in the IDA.  As I said, Minister O'Malley is personally aware of the situation in Kells and is taking it on himself to meet the chief executive of the company in the United States with a view to securing the long-term viability of this plant.</P>

We must appreciate the difficulties in the market-place but the Minister's goodwill is there in relation to this industry and, as I said, he met the chief executive in the United States to try to secure the best possible arrangement for the Kells plant and the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On 6 December last this House had a short debate on the future of Irish Steel.  I raised the matter then because I was deeply concerned about the deferral of deadlines in this takeover.  At that time other Members, including Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, Deputy Allen and Deputy Dennehy, also expressed their fears regarding the future of the country's only steel plant.</P>
      <P>We were told by the Minister of State that the plan presented by the Cork consortium needed to be examined even though the outline of the plan had been presented to the Government before the end of 1988.  The full business plan was presented in September 1989.  While there is an acceptance that any plan of this nature has to be carefully scrutinised and closely examined we are now informed that it will take another three months or more before a decision is made.  That is completely unacceptable to me and &mdash; I am sure &mdash; to the workers and their dependants.</P>
      <P>While the background to the problem is relatively straightforward the public perception is that there is serious disagreement within the Cabinet about this whole issue, so much so that it is now reported that the Taoiseach has directly intervened to sort out differences which have arisen between some of his Ministers. The workers and management in Irish Steel have shown, by their efforts over the last number of years, that they are determined, with dedication and willingness, to co-operate with any reasonable and constructive takeover proposal or international sharing arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade union officials and shop stewards have shown great restraint and responsibility in dealing with this very sensitive <Col N="2491" /> and important issue which has economic implications, not alone for the city of Cork and county, but for the whole county.  We are all aware that substantial taxpayers' money has been invested in this plant but, more importantly, there are 600 jobs directly involved and another 500 downstream jobs which also depend on this plant.  These jobs are vital in the greater Cork area, an area which has already been devastated by unemployment.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel, by international standards, may be a small plant but for those workers, their families and the surrounding area &mdash; including Cork city &mdash; it is a major industry with thousands depending directly or indirectly on its future survival.  Is it too much to ask that their future should not become a political football between two Ministers from different parties in a Coalition Government? There is now great urgency to clarify the Government's position in view of the reported statement by Dr. Korf who has indicated that any agreement he had with the Government has now been terminated. I have not heard a denial from a Government spokesperson that this is not so.  The deafening silence has created its own fears among many people in that area.</P>
    <P>If there are other interested parties involved in negotiations regarding the takeover of Irish Steel there is an obligation on the Government and on these other parties &mdash; whoever they may be &mdash; to make sure that the same co-operation and openness which was displayed by the Cork consortium will be continued.  This, of course, will include the protection of existing jobs and a substantial investment of capital.</P>
    <P>There must be a clearcut statement from the Government so that the workforce can be fully informed and any doubts about the plant's future dispelled. Maybe it is time for the politicians to step aside and to let the IDA &mdash; or some other Government agency &mdash; to take over any outstanding negotiations.  It is vital that the public and the workforce and all those depending on the plant should have a <Col N="2492" /> clear idea of what is happening.  The urgency of this debate is confirmed by the Government's sell off today of Irish Life.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the Coalition Government have embarked on a policy of selling off State assets but a Government which embarks on such a policy without protecting the jobs and the taxpayers' money and without full information on the implications for the workforce do so at their peril.  It is time for the Government to come clean on Irish Steel and to allay the fears of their loyal workforce.  It is time to give hope to their families and to the community who, as I have said, depend so much on Irish Steel not alone for their livelihood but for their very existence.</P>

      <P>As a former long-term employee of the company, I feel I would be letting the side down if I did not contribute to the debate.  I agree with most of what Deputy O'Sullivan said.  He appealed for Ministers not to make a political football of the issue and I reiterate that.  Irish Steel is far too important to the employees and to the locality for that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the call for openness and co-operation from any other companies interested in a possible take-over.  This is essential and I have no doubt it will happen but I would give one word of caution.  I am not anxious to see delays by anyone &mdash; the Government, employees, their representatives or management &mdash; regarding a take-over.  In the past we made serious mistakes, Tara Mines being <Col N="2493" /> the classic example of which is being discussed at the moment.  I am concerned that we would not go down that road.  I ask that the best possible study be carried out and I add my voice to the request from Deputy O'Sullivan for openness. We must ensure that we get the best possible deal, not just for the State, which is important, but also for my former colleagues in Irish Steel and for the Cork area generally which, as Deputy O'Sullivan has said, was totally devastated in the years from 1983 to 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Steel based at Haulbowline, County Cork, is a significant employer in the area.  While the plant may be comparatively small when compared to the large integrated steel mills of Europe, we all recognise its employment of around 640 is of major importance to the Cork area.  The company are principally involved in the production of structural steel sections which amounted to approximately 280,000 tonnes in the year ended 30 June 1989 and generated a turnover of £80 million for the company.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the products and the size of the plant in relation to the home market, Irish Steel export over 80 per cent of their annual production.  This almost total dependence on the export market leaves the company open to the fierce competition of the European steel market which for many years was dogged by over-capacity and low productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now unlike many of their European competitors, losses had been a recurrent problem until 1988-89.  The main reason for the better performance in the year ended 30 June 1989 was the exceptionally strong demand for structural steel throughout Europe.  The manner in which Irish Steel capitalised on this growth is reflected in the fact that the £80 million turnover in 1988-89 represented an increase of 40 per cent on their 1987-88 turnover of £58 million.  However, there has been a weakening in market demand of late and it is difficult to estimate how long the more subdued demand for structural products will last.  This has <Col N="2494" /> specific relevance for the profitability of the company because their output falls into the area of commodity steel rather than more specialised products, such as alloys, which would be less vulnerable to price and volume movements as market demands fluctuate.</P>
    <P>Over the years, ISL have received total Government support amounting to roughly £190 million made up of equity, grants, repayable advances and State guarantees.  Of this, £143 million has been advanced since 1982 and cumulative losses as at 30 June 1989 amounted to £97.5 million.  Needless to say, company losses and state advances of this magnitude were not sustainable and the realism of that situation was reinforced on 1985 by the adoption at European Community level of rules prohibiting State aid for European steel manufacturers. In these circumstances, it was made repeatedly clear to ISL that it was up to them to review the whole range of their operations with a view to containing costs and ensuring that the company were in a position to generate the funds needed for on-going investment.  This was the reason the company had since 1985, been engaged in a search for a suitable foreign company which could be of assistance in this regard, unfortunately without success.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the search for a commercial partner that would ensure the future viability of Irish Steel and their workforce commenced in 1988.  It was recognised that any partner would be required to bring to the company much needed finance and marketing and technological resources.  This inevitably requires the carrying out of a due diligence exercise on behalf of the company, their employees and the taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <P>It is in the employees' own immediate and long-term interest that all options for the future of the company are thoroughly and expertly investigated, so that when the Government take a decision on the matter they will do so in the knowledge that the option chosen represents the best way of securing the future of the company and their workforce and also the best <Col N="2495" /> possible terms for the State.  With this in mind, the Investment Bank of Ireland have been engaged to explore all available options.  This is currently being done as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer the Deputy to the following statement issued on Friday, 9 March.</P>
    <P>The Government wish to confirm that negotiations are being undertaken to ensure the future of Irish Steel and the maintenance of its employment.  A number of possibilities exist and the Government are confident that, within <Col N="2496" /> a period of three months, matters will be successfully concluded and the future of the company and its employment assured.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make any further comment at this time except to assure all concerned that the Government are giving this matter particular attention and it is in the best interests of all concerned that these negotiations and discussions would continue.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 March, 1990.</P>

      <P>There are no estimates available of the number who emigrated to Britain in 1989.  As the Deputy may be aware, net migratory estimates for the 12 month <Col N="2233" /> period ending mid-April will, in accordance with usual practice, become available in August next.  These estimates, however, will relate only to the total picture and cannot be broken down on a country of destination basis.</P>
      <P>On the question of the accommodation problems facing some of these emigrants, I would like to state that I fully share the concerns of my colleague, the Minister for Labour, who dealt with this question very extensively on 20 February 1990 in this House.  I wish to repeat here his advice that young persons contemplating going to London should not go if they do not have accommodation and employment arranged in advance.  I wish also to point out that the Government are providing financial assistance, through DÍON, the London Embassy based body, to organisations specifically dealing with the homeless.</P>
      <P>On the question of taking the matter up with the British authorities, the Deputy will be aware that the direct provision of housing in Britain is the responsibility of the local authorities.  The Embassy believes that the best way of influencing the policy of the latter is by encouraging organisations, which benefit from grants made available by DÍON, to explore partnerships with these authorities with a view to obtain matching funds from them.  This is happening on an increasing scale and I am confident that over a period of time this will directly benefit more and more Irish people including those who are living in unsatisfactory conditions.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Embassy will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 63, 68 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against the background of the provisions of the UN Charter, any possible military intervention by one state in the affairs of another is a matter of grave <Col N="2236" /> concern.  We would normally support a UN Resolution deploring such action and have done so in the past.  In this case however we had to take into consideration certain exceptional circumstances. General Noriega had disallowed democratically-held elections and refused to hand over power to a legitimate Government.  The Twelve on 11 May 1989, condemned the annulment of the elections and on 20 September 1989 they declared that the Noriega regime had no institutional legitmacy. There were also serious accusations of involvement by the Noriega regime in narcotics trafficking.  Panama had declared itself at war with the US, which has special treaty responsibilities in the Canal Zone.  The Government returned by the democratically-held election of May 1989 was consulted in advance of the US action and subsequently endorsed it.  In view of these factors it was decided that an abstention was the appropriate position on our part.</P>
    <P>The US authorities informed us of the reasons for their action immediately after the intervention.  Our position was subsequently stated publicly.  I understand that US forces have now been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic and Consular Relations which provides that diplomatic missions shall be inviolable.  We can only deplore violations of the provisions of the Convention.</P>

      <P>The Foreign Ministers of the Community member states met in the General Affairs Council on 5 February last&mdash;the first meeting of the General Affairs Council under the current Irish Presidency.  For a full list of the items discussed and an account of the outcome, I would refer the Deputy to the press release containing the conclusions of the Council which was issued by the Council Secretariat and which has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The principal items considered were as follows: We had an exchange of views on the preparation of the Bonn Economic Conference which commences on 19 March.  Our officials were instructed to prepare guidelines for Community action at the conference.  Ireland regards the meeting, which is part of the CSCE process, as particularly important for the development of economic links with Eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Vocational Training Foundation and the Tempus Scheme involve the development of training and student exchanges with Eastern Europe and at Council we gave guidelines for further work on the basic decisions establishing the schemes concerned.  Ireland <Col N="2238" /> supports these proposals which will play a significant role in assisting the East European countries in coping with the economic changes which have taken place in the last year.</P>
    <P>We had a detailed review of negotiations on trade and co-operation agreements with Eastern European countries, on aid to these countries and on how their future relationship with the Community might best be managed.  The Commission will bring forward proposals on the latter point.  The Irish position on relations with Eastern European countries has been to support Community action which helps the countries concerned to develop their economic capacity and which supports the movement towards democracy.</P>
    <P>We discussed economic and monetary union and it was agreed that the Irish Government would rapidly table a formal proposal for the revision of the Treaty which will enable the intergovernmental conference to take place in line with the decisions of the Strasbourg European Council.  In compliance with this decision, the proposal was tabled on 21 February.</P>
    <P>We examined the Commission's report on the Turkish application for accession to the Community and noted that the Commission will submit concrete proposals for strengthening co-operation with Turkey.  Ireland agrees that it is important that these proposals be processed quickly.</P>
    <P>The Council considered the state of relations with the US which, as you know, is of major interest to the Community at present and to Ireland also.</P>
    <P>We had a first debate on the difficult subject of the future of car imports after the completion of the internal market in 1992.  Ireland would like to see a solution which takes account of the need to maintain free trade while enabling the European auto industry to continue to develop.</P>
    <P>We reviewed the position as regards progress in the Community's relations with the Mediterranean countries and the Council committed itself to examine as a priority proposals which the Commission <Col N="2239" /> will make for a special programme of co-operation with Colombia in the context of the fight against drugs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will recall, and as I already pointed out here on 7 February in answer to another question, the <Col N="2243" /> Government's policy on German unification was set out by the Taoiseach in reply to a question on 13 December last.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach noted on that occasion, the right to self-determination is a principle endorsed by the Charter of the United Nations.  Ireland supports the right of the peoples of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the German Democratic Republic to determine their own future by a free democratic process.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach also pointed out on 13 December, the Twelve Heads of State or Government of the Europen Community at their summit meeting in Strasbourg indicated their support for unity of the German people in the two states and said that it should be achieved in accordance with the principles of self-determination and with due regard to the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act.  The Taoiseach confirmed the Government's position in reply to questions on 20 February.</P>
    <P>The question of the borders of a united Germany must be seen in the context of the Helsinki Final Act, which both the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic have subscribed. That document, to which Ireland and all other European countries, except Albania, together with the United States and Canada, have also subscribed, provides that &ldquo;The participating states regard as inviolable all one another's frontiers&rdquo;. It also provides that &ldquo;their frontiers can be changed, in accordance with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement&rdquo;.  The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany itself has declared that a solution to the German question can only be achieved within the framework of the CSCE process. Obviously, we welcome this declaration.</P>
    <P>Ireland does not regard the unification of Germany as such as having implications for our policy of military neutrality, which we are intent upon pursuing.</P>
    <P>The question of the status of a united Germany is one for that country to pursue.  The Helsinki Final Act provides that states have the right to belong, or <Col N="2244" /> not to belong, to treaties of alliance; they also have the right to neutrality.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter directly with the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister in the course of his visit to Dublin on 21 February. I expressed to him our concern and told him that our view is that Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, are illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier on 31 January, at Ireland's initiative, the Twelve member states of the EC had issued a statement which expressed their serious concern at recent suggestions that immigrants to Israel might be settled in the occupied territories. They recalled their long-standing view that Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, are illegal.  The statement noted that the Twelve warmly welcomed the liberalisation of Soviet emigration controls, including the freedom of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel and elsewhere, but expressed the hope that the Israeli Government would not jeopardise the prospects for bringing peace to the region by either allowing or encouraging Jewish <Col N="2245" /> immigrants to settle in the occupied territories.</P>
    <P>Again, on 20 February the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, at their meeting in Dublin which I chaired, issued a statement which deplored the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied territories. We pointed out that Israeli statements on increased Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza are not conducive to establishing the climate of confidence necessary to make the progress which is urgently needed in the peace process. We reiterated our warm welcome for the liberalization of Soviet emigration controls, including the freedom of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel and elsewhere; and noted that this sentiment is very widely shared in the international community, on the basis that the right of everyone to leave any country, including his own, is enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights. We stated that the attainment by Soviet Jews of this right must not, however, be at the expense of the rights of the Palestinians in the occupied territories; and urged the Israeli Government not to jeopardise the prospects of bringing peace to the region by either allowing or encouraging Jewish immigrants to settle in the occupied territories.</P>

      <P>Honorary Consuls are appointed essentially to respond to a need for the provision of consular services for a significant body of Irish citizens in a particular country or region and to promote Irish economic interests in the area.  Ideally, the person appointed should be well established and be of good repute in the area in question.  He or she should be known to the Irish community and the local administration and should <Col N="2246" /> have business connections which would be beneficial to Irish economic interests. The successful candidate would normally be the one, among those interested in the position, who is considered to come closest to this ideal.  Not all of our Honorary Consuls are Irish but, other things being equal, preference would normally be given to a suitably qualified candidate of Irish nationality or background.</P>
      <P>Candidates are invited to complete a standard application form.  Their background is then verified and they are interviewed by the Department or by an appropriate Irish Embassy.  Following on this, a recommendation is made as to which of the applicants appears best suited for the position and the appointment is made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I think I should add, since it may not be widely appreciated, that these are solely honorary appointments and that apart from a purely nominal stipend and a proportion of the consular fees, Honorary Consuls are in receipt of no remuneration from the State.  Notwithstanding this, they provide a valuable service for our citizens overseas and in many cases take on onerous tasks on our behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers of the Twelve meeting in the framework of European Political Co-operation in Dublin on 20 February had a very thorough discussion on recent developments in South Africa.  There was a general welcome for the measures announced by President de Klerk in his speech to the opening of Parliament on 2 February, which was followed by the <Col N="2248" /> release on 11 February of Nelson Mandela.</P>
    <P>These measures are considered by the Twelve to be both positive and significant. Taken together, these measures constitute important contributions to the creation of that climate which we and our partners in the Twelve consider essential for the initiation of genuine negotiations with the majority community in South Africa.  I would underline that such negotiations in our view must be aimed at the total abolition of apartheid and the establishment in South Africa of a new non-racial and democratic society based on principles of equality and justice for all.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers were agreed that these recent measures by the South African Government, while welcome, do not yet go far enough.  The state of emergency is still in place and a number of political prisoners are still being held. Ministers agreed that there is still a distance to go to achieve our common aim, which is the complete abolition of apartheid.</P>
    <P>Against the background of these recent developments, Ministers also discussed the subject of sanctions against South Africa.  This discussion clearly showed that there was no consensus among partners to lift the Twelve's restrictive measures at this stage.</P>
    <P>The majority of our partners do not share the United Kingdom's view that the measures taken to date by the South African Government warrant a lessening of Twelve pressure on South Africa.  The United Kingdom subsequently lifted the ban on new investment unilaterally with effect from 23 February.  This decision has been the subject of considerable public debate both at the time and subsequently. I have no doubt that the United Kingdom is fully aware of the views of her partners in the Twelve, including those of this Government.  I do not see that further expressions of disapproval would serve any practical purpose.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any call by Mr. Walter Sisulu of the ANC for an intensification of Irish sanctions against South <Col N="2249" /> Africa.  In the Government's view, the purpose of sanctions against South Africa is not to punish that country but rather to encourage the South African Government to dismantle the apartheid system and to engage in negotiations to this end with the majority community.  In view of the steps taken recently by the South African Government to remove some of the obstacles to dialogue, I do not think that an intensification of sanctions against South Africa would be appropriate at present.</P>

      <P>Under subhead C of the Vote for International Co-operation for 1990 there is a grant-in-aid fund of £10.250 million for bilateral and other aid.  The other aid refers to an allocation of £650,000 for assistance to Poland and Hungary.  The sum of £9.6 million is therefore available for development co-operation with developing countries generally recognised as such.</P>
      <P>The estimate for new projects this year is £0.87 million or 9 per cent of the £9.6 million allocated to developing countries.</P>
      <P>All of the amount allocated to Poland and Hungary is for new projects.</P>

      <P>I know that all Deputies will agree with me when I say that it is impossible to compensate adequately the many families in Northern Ireland who have suffered as a result of the campaign of terrorism.</P>
      <P>Until mid 1988, the relevant legal provisions in Northern Ireland were such that the level of financial compensation payable to families and victims in certain circumstances was extremely low. Changes introduced under the Criminal Injuries (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order, which came into effect in July 1988, have achieved some improvement in the situation.  The terms of this Order have been the subject of discussion in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and the situation will be kept under continuing review by my Department.</P>

      <P>The Civil Defence Volunteer Organisation at large operates, under direction from my Department, as part of the emergency service available to the local authorities.  The paid element of the organisation are employees of the local authorities and, as such, come within the arrangements being set up by the local authorities in compliance with documents setting out guidelines issued by the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board since the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act came into force on 1 November 1989; the latest such document entitled <i>Preparation of Safety Statement,</i> issued last month.</P>
      <P>My Department has set in train the necessary steps to give effect to the provisions of the Act in so far as they pertain to its civilian employees, and these will be applied also to the staff engaged in instruction at the Civil Defence School.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence volunteers as such do not fall within the scope of the Act as they are not employees as defined in the Act.  Nevertheless, the whole ethos of civil defence turns on the concept that the volunteers will not put themselves at undue risk in responding to emergencies or in embarking on training or other exercises. The organisation has an excellent record in this regard.  All Civil Defence training manuals contain safety instructions and these are now being examined for full compatibility with the provisions of the Act.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach has already informed the Dáil on 6 March, he and the President of the United States reached an agreement on 27 February that such meetings should become a regular feature of US/EC relations and that at least one such meeting should be held during each Presidency of the European Council. The talks could cover the whole gamut of EC-US relations.  On the political side this means all subjects within the sphere of European Political Co-operation.</P>

    <P>In the Single European Act the Twelve took on a common obligation to try to formulate and implement a joint European foreign policy.  What is envisaged essentially with the United States is greater and more regular political consultation without in any way trespassing on the decision-making processes of EPC.

I can assure the Deputy that both I and my Department will continue through administrative and legal actions to seek a resolution of the matter.  Both the Naval Service and my Department's fisheries protection staff have intensified the monitoring of all vessels in Irish waters and take appropriate action in cases where infringements are detected.

      <P>In fishing harbours facilities for waste are provided at the five fishery harbour centres as a matter of course.  In commercial ports waste disposal is generally by arrangement with ships' agents or the harbour authorities.  The Sea Pollution Bill, which I hope to circulate shortly, will require the provision of facilities for the disposal of ships' oil and waste in accordance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.  This convention is better known as MARPOL 73/78.  The Bill will bring about an overall improvement in the provision of facilities and in the inspection and standard of ships' equipment and will reduce considerably the incidence of dumping refuse at sea.</P>
      <P>In the meantime and pending the enactment of the relevant legislation my Department are arranging with harbour authorities for the provision of suitable reception facilities for ships' garbage at ports.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment is responsible for the three civil liability directives in respect of the use of motor vehicles.  Two of those directives have already been adopted.  The third proposed civil liability directive is awaiting a second reading by the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The draft motor freedom of services Directive which I referred to at the Internal Market Council press conference on 22 February 1990 is my responsibility. Its purpose is to allow a motor insurer established in a member state of the Community to transact motor insurance business on a services basis, i.e. without establishment in other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft motor freedom of services directive subsumes motor insurance within the administrative framework set up by the second non-life insurance freedom of services directive which was adopted on 22 June 1988 &mdash; the &ldquo;second Directive&rdquo;, 88/357/EEC, O.J. No. L 172. The supervisory provisions and other arrangements provided for in that directive will apply directly to the business of providing motor insurance throughout the Community.  The quantitative criteria for distinguishing large risks laid down in <Col N="2274" /> that directive will apply to motor insurance.</P>
    <P>Service insurers covering large risks will be subject to the supervision regime of the member state in which they are established.  Service insurers covering mass risks, risks below the large risk size, will be subject to formal authorisation and supervision procedures of the member state into which the service is being provided.  However, establishment will not be a requirement for large or mass risks services business.</P>
    <P>The draft directive allows for the appointment of a claims settlement representative in the member state into which the service is being provided so as to avoid placing third party claimants in a less advantageous position when dealing with the services insurer.</P>
    <P>Under the draft directive the services insurer must become a member of and contribute to the Motor Insurance Bureau/Guarantee Fund of the member state into which the service is being provided. The contribution of the services insurer will be based on the gross premium income volume from third party Class 10 motor insurance business or the number of risks in that class covered in the member state in which the service is provided.</P>

      <P>The differences in the means testing arrangements as between different social welfare schemes arise largely as a result of measures introduced from time to time to meet the special needs of particular categories of claimants.

      <P>The increases in the rates of unemployment assistance and the extension of the means limits, as announced in <Col N="2279" /> the budget, will benefit many farming families this year.</P>
      <P>The social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to a claimant from the use of property &mdash; other than property personally used and enjoyed by the claimant, such as a dwelling &mdash; is assessable as means.  In the case of farmers the value of the yearly advantage represents the income from the farm less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The normal basis of the calculation is the net income from the farm over the 12 months preceding the date of the investigation.</P>
      <P>The typical calculation is based on the claimant's income and outgoings in the previous year.  However, in making the assessment, due allowance is made for any unusual features in that year so that the level of means assessed reflects the situation in an average or normal year. In this way, the system caters for cases where, for whatever reason, farm income is significantly reduced in a particular year.  Accordingly, there is no necessity to issue any new instructions to social welfare officers now in the matter.  Similarly, it is not necessary to introduce amending legislation to provide for a reduction in the assessment of means in farming cases.</P>
      <P>Any smallholder in receipt of unemployment assistance who considers that he may be entitled to a higher rate of payment as a result of a significant temporary reduction in his means may apply, in the normal manner, to have the means assessment reviewed to take account of his changed circumstances.  Such a case would generally be reviewed again at some later date so that the ongoing means assessment would reflect the normal situation.  Smallholders who now consider that they might be entitled to unemployment assistance as a result of the fall in their incomes should also apply to the local offices of the Department.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a landholder who does not have the required 78 paid contributions in the previous three year period and whose profit from his holding exceeds £4.00 daily.  Accordingly his application for unemployment benefit of 24 March 1989 was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He claimed unemployment assistance from 24 March 1989 and his claim was authorised for payment at the weekly rate of £51.20 on the basis of an existing qualification certificate with means of £57.70 per week assessed against him.</P>
      <P>Following investigation, a deciding officer disallowed his claim from 9 August 1989 on the grounds he had failed to disclose full details of his means. Accordingly he is not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance from that date.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all residents of the State aged 66 years or over.  The scheme also applies to registered blind persons over 18 years and to certain categories of disabled persons under 66 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment, including those in receipt of an invalidity pension from this Department and disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board. The scheme also applies to spouses under age 66 for journeys on which they accompany the qualified pensioner.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned does not come within the aforementioned categories, she does not qualify for free travel.  The father is believed to have an occupational pension and does not appear to be receiving any pension from my Department.</P>
      <P>As I have already announced the free travel scheme will be expanded to allow a companion to travel free along with certain recipients of disabled persons' maintenance allowance.  It is proposed to introduce this extension to the free travel scheme before the end of this year.  Further extensions of the scheme along these lines to include companions travelling with other categories of beneficiaries would again rise to significant additional cost and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

Under the terms agreed the Forensic Science Laboratory will undertake to use the probes and the information provided, only for forensic science case work or research within this jurisdiction.  The probes and information will not be provided to third parties generally but this restriction will not apply where there is a legal obligation to disclose &mdash; for example, in criminal proceedings. Accordingly the current procedure relating to forensic evidence generally, whereby defence experts can have access to individual case tests conducted by the laboratory, will also apply to DNA profiling and will not be affected by the agreement.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly where tenants/residents of approved non-profit and voluntary housing associations do not have the benefit of a defined income-related rent subsidy scheme whereas tenants of local authorities in similar income circumstances qualify for the differential rent subsidy assistance; in view of the important work carried out by such associations in catering for low income disadvantaged persons, the steps he will take to remove this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination of rents in respect of accommodation let by voluntary housing bodies is a matter for the bodies themselves. The rent levels set must, of necessity, take account of the outgoings of the body on the accommodation and any income available to them from other sources.  In consideration that the assistance from the State for the provision of the accommodation substantially relieves a body of any borrowing costs, bodies are expected to set rents which are reasonable and, in doing so, to bear in mind the general principles of the differential rents scheme.  I have no proposals to change that situation nor do I consider that it would be practical to do so.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that, in necessitous cases, tenants of voluntary housing projects may apply, under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, for assistance towards their rent liabilities.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Cork land use/transportation plan of 1978, the purpose of which was to develop a strategic plan for the orderly growth and co-ordinated development of the study area.  The study has been taken into account in reviews of the city and county development plans.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Roads.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Study recommended a programme of road improvements costing an estimated £144 million (at 1989 prices).  Most of the improvements have already been undertaken or are at present underway, with the assistance of full cost State road grants.  The improvements completed include Midleton by-pass, the northern ring road, the south city link road and the de Valera, Collins and Christy Ring bridges.  Projects at present in progress include Glanmire by-pass, the southern ring road, stage 1 of the Blackpool by-pass and the improvement of the N20 between Cork and Mallow.  This year, I allocated road grants amounting to £15.2 million to meet costs arising on these projects in 1990.  The timing of the completion of other major road improvements which were recommended in the <Col N="2304" /> study has been considered in the context of the preparation of the operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure.  A draft of the programme, which has been prepared in accordance with the community support framework 1989 to 1993, has been submitted to the EC Commission.  Pending the adoption of the programme, I do not propose to give details of the timing of the major projects in the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sanitary Services.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Schemes identified in the study will continue to be taken into account in the planning of the sanitary services programme. It is expected that further such schemes will reach construction stage in 1990.</P>

      <P>The public health nurse serving the Whitechurch Estate has been on sick leave since the end of January.  In her absence her area is being covered by other public health nurses so that at no stage has the Whitechurch Estate been left without a public health nursing service. The Eastern Health Board has now engaged an additional nurse on a temporary basis to supplement the service until such time as the nurse who is on sick leave is fit to resume duty.</P>

Enrolment in the Ard Lughaidh school has been significantly declining; the school has, currently, 209 pupils.

      <P>The matter was discussed at a meeting with representatives of the vocational education committee on 8 March 1990 and the question as to the number of places to be provided will be re-examined in the light of further statistical data to be supplied by the committee.</P>

    <P>DART, in common with all urban rapid transit systems, is designed to cater for standing passengers.
